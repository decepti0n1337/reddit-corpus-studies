What is that questing addon you have?
---
---
---
True, you're also not losing anything by greeding on an item everyone wants.
---
Haha yeah - imagine you’re about to start a dungeon run and ur like “ok before we start everyone watch this quick video” :)
---
Had a friend in Uni who basically broke out of his super religious hyper conservative family chokehold on his social life through wow. He also had super bad social anxiety, but when I met him I always thought of him as super charismatic and even dare I say outgoing/extroverted. It wasn’t till we talked about gaming and WoW did I get the full story.
---
Hey, wait a minute!... Where'd you get those sick boots mate?
---
Evidently you have done neither role
---
only 20$!
---
I don't care what you say, I will always hear DAMPE lmao
---
Had a human mage, save me from murlocs in dustwallow marsh, and then help me finish the quest so his aoe grinding would go smoother. 
---

---
Also a gnome warrior helped me with some goblins in STV, we both ended up dying to them, not before we said our thanks to one another. Almost every other alliance has just ganked me while i'm fighting mobs so fuck em.
---
obviously fake...
---
Were you actually offended by the name bjgirl? Pobrecito
---
Good for you leveling the druid. low levels need tanks in dungeons also
---
How does the crimson whelp one compare? I had the crimson one drop on my 6th whelp today. Definitely gonna keep it.
---
How is this in Orgrimmar??
---
Still talking?
---
I’m not knowing bout no Hordin’ nah. Me identify as a troll in a humie paladin body. It’s 2019 ya know what I be sayin’?
---
In your defense, I've never seen this vid so thanks for posting.
---
Luna frames is an extension of shadowed unit frames. The creator of Luna made the standalone version of the heal prediction feature of Luna and called it healcomms.
---
Rag targets mana users with an aoe knockback.
---
Please edit your sexyMap and disable the texture layer that does not exist in wowclassic, hence the green texture placeholder.
---
Engineer, Blacksmith, or kill the first boss every single run, which is obviously a waste of time.
---
#Thex casts *Stormstrike*
---
So I want the healer to waste mana fixing your fuckup?
---
I said this on a different thread with the same message and I'll say it here. Classic lived on pservers for years and never died, why would it now?
---
Yes, you need the charges to get through the second door
---
I'm a lvl 59 warlock with 300 skinning and 300 tailoring. Would I be better off dropping both professions for, say, herb/mining? I already crafted my Robe of the Void and believe there's nothing left for me to gain from either profession.
---
Stormwind. Something about the human buildings I love.
---
Awwww =) this is cute lmao I been there done that
---
I always loved desolace, Gelkis clan 4 life.
---
You mean “don’t worry the healer will handle it” the warrior isn’t handling shit.
---
&gt;I just don't have a reason to run the entire dungeon, if there is no useful loot for me in it.
---
The other mindset is that the reason you get all this loot and do all this time investment is precisely to play dungeons and that playing them /exploring them is by itself the reason.
---
I RP walked to ding 60 off exploration, but not at a cool spot. Just a random place in the burning steppes.
---
You know what pisses me off?
---
miss, miss, parry, dodge, miss, need rage to do that, need rage to do that, miss, parry....resist taunt. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD BLIZZARD, LET ME HIT THAT MOB AT LEAST ONCE PLEASE!
---
I tank and dps, when I'm tanking the dps tanks and when I'm dps I tank. The only place I can actually tank, as a tank, is in a lower level dungeon.
---
Could be your [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) Ignore list.
---
I saw savage gladiator chain twice in one day this week. I've only ran arena about 20 times. Gorosh 4 times. But my damn healing trinket hasn't dropped once off Golem in those 20ish runs...what are the chances
---
&gt;You can be god among tanks but with three dps each going all out each on different target, the run will be a mess and nothing will salvage it
---
This is literally every pug. They usually work out alright.  Tab -&gt; Sunder -&gt; Taunt if a caster gets aggro. You're not expected to have aggro on every mob in every pull. That only happens in a premade.
---
Probably a good thing I'm not guild leader of that guild. I would have kicked mister sour grapes right there. He's toxic, just remove now before he taints guild chat with his negativity. It's a BiS ring, of course people are going to link it. That's a small part of the guild community, to congratulate each other on major milestones. It's not up to Sour Grapes to be the fun police.
---
But that's why I'm not a guild leader, probably. Maybe better that way.
---
Sir u are racist
---
+10
---
See when ever I have a worrior join me as dps I always ask them "your tanking right?". I never make them but it's a god meme
---
Ppl need to agree on a price point. But i'd consider myself greedy for saying i "need" an item bc i'd like to equip it when others would basically have the same chance at gear (or whatever) they need by selling that same item. As others stated, if you really need it, farm the gold or run with ppl who would gladly hand it to you for free, but don't expect ppl to pass on a chance for 50+ gold (or whatever agreed upon amount) just bc you want to equip.
---
This is why gelfling must be drained for their essence.
---
If he tries for long enough someone will join. The desire for prebis is strong.
---
Mind sharing your accomplishment with us? I see a picture of an orc with a bow.
---
[removed]
---
Fury Warriors are tough. They can take hits.
---
Hearing strat live is a tough one makes me even more impressed with the shaman tank we had my last run.
---
It's a lot easier in retail because it has incoming healing API. In classic there is no such API so it relies on all healers in the raid having the same addon to communicate heals. Luckily there's a "standard" LibHealComm library that a few addons are based on.
---
There's LunaUnitFrames which has this feature built in; if you prefer another frame addon, HealComm should do the trick.
---
I just cancel travel form pot and re-shift, not instant but its fairly quick.
---
What exactly does this do? I keep seeing it in macros but never understood why.
---
Yes and the exploration and seeing of the dungeon is done after 1-2 runs.
---

---
I thought about this but don’t you need to be like level 35 to get to artisan? Not sure I’ll have the time or desire to level another character that high
---
Are any greens dropping off the SoS whelps?  Grinded through 1.5 levels and didn’t see a single one.
---
https://countdowntoclassic.com/page/2/ episode #108
---
Have you never raided ever? Losing loot happens.
---
Yes
---
No I don’t bother because I’m not a try hard, people almost always b/o so anything I sell less than vendor ends up negligible.
---
Ah very true, did not think about that!
---
Shouldn't of rolled over like a b.
---
I actually kinda dig it lol
---
I've never seen anyone blame the healer.
---
The healer doesn't really need to babysit as much as tanks do. Threat is the hardest mechanic, and it's the tank to mop up for everyone when the dps don't do their job.
---
The healer just needs to fill the bars. Yeah its still more reactive and difficult than dps but I don't really think healers tend to babysit anyone.
---
It's a BiS ring. That's hardly every piece of loot.
---
Crimson ones were on AH for about 20g today. Emerald one was about 90g
---
That sounds just awful. That's worth an alt character.
---
Reminds me of when I walked into Mara for the first time in 10+ years and had no idea where to go. Ended up running around in a circle and the healer laughed and asked me “how high are you right now?” I... uh.... I wasn’t... but... I just simply said “yes”, he just laughed and lead the way since then. Nice smooth run.
---
That’s pretty smart!
---
No ones going to give you that information because then it would ruin their personal business if more people found out secret ways to make lots of gold.
---
I don’t know any off hand, but I didn’t want you to be waiting around for an answer that’s probably not going to come
---
Man dungeon elites hit for like 300 and any melee dps has good ways to reduce damage like rogue stun or warriors just wearing high armor, others can kite. A dps overaggroing isn't going to matter much for a healers mana if he knows what he's doing...
---
&gt; it's not always the same for everyone
---
That's kind of my point. Ony drops 3 pieces of gear. There are 40 raid members if you're fully stacked (tho 25 is reasonable). You have had an exceptional experience. It will calm down.
---
&gt; 3 Magesblades drop
---
The drop rate of Mageblade is 15%. You are having an exceptional experience.
---
You can tank MC as hotw. You simply miss out on some crit
---
Hahaa I agree
---
Interesting, you got source where paladin and warlock mount quests were available day 1?  Because you do realize that’s what’s actually being discussed right?  No shit normal epic mounts were in the game since day 1, what does that have to do with the topic?  Or is going off on an irrelevant tangent part of your troll at this point?
---
Nice.
---
I'm 28 right now and spending some time there. Seems accurate.
---
/cancel aura : cancels your current shapeshifting form. You can’t mount/use consumables in any form so you macro the consumable with the aura cancel so you can instantly use the potion.
---
The point of the comment was that if you have a healer and tank duo leveling together then it would be very easy for them to get 3 dps to run dungeons with. Calling someone entitled just for pointing out a quicker way of doing things is entitled in and of itself
---
I cannot stress this enough - You shouldn't look at classic as a game that needs to be played in any specific way at all.
---
Do whatever **you** want!
---
Obviously most people want to grow their character by gearing out, maxing professions and amassing gold and sometimes that makes it feel mandatory, but it really isn't.
---
God. I can get forgetting about giving credit, but reuploading another dudes YouTube video just for karma and own views...
---
You're gonna hate trying to get into a group at 60.
---
Not for a tank wtf? A tank will just post "Tank LFG Strath, first orb is mine" and immediatly get an invite.
---
I’m assuming you’re fury so there are a lot better pieces of leather and mail out there with nice agi stats.
---
As a tank, if you are running the lvl 60 dungeon you’ll notice there are a couple of VERY high armor pieces with a lot of stamina.
---
It’s okay to mix in a couple valor pieces, namely the chest and maybe shoulders or head... I can’t really remember. But the set as a whole is quite lackluster and is a time waster. You could spend weeks looking for those pieces when you can just force your way into MC/Ony with any other blue high defense value gear and skip that akward gap.
---
Decorum goes a long way when helping a server establish a community. Catering to ninja behavior, only breeds more of it. Something to keep in mind.
---
Sure man. I'm a Boomer because I'm not giving away loot I won the roll on. Nevermind that I'm 26.
---
Thinking is a good first step.  Next, try empathy.
---
Are you really trying to talk to Alliance in /say by spacing out your words that much?
---
[deleted]
---
One common way to deal with this problem is to have everyone in the raid roll. However, if a guild member wins the roll, the loot is allocated according to the guild's loot allocation system.
---
The bots can be hidden from warden which is why Blizzards greatest success in stopping them has been in suing the owners of popular bots like Glider and Honour Buddy, both bots are dead so no issues to name them. 
---
I will be curious to see what AV will be like as Vanilla was largely half the team running anti afk jump scripts in the AV cave. I expect fishing bots are prevalent as always.
---
Your party will be part of the raid
---
If you can honestly say you would greed on edgemasters handguards if it dropped then you're a fool.
---
Ideally you want about 200-300FR~ buffed for Ony as a MT, I believe it's something like a 1/3 damage mitigation on average.
---
The "everyone blames the healer" thing is mostly a meme. I've always played healer in MMOs and the only times I've been criticized were when I actually played bad enough that I deserved to be scolded, never when someone died from their own mistake.
---
If you are consistently blamed for letting people die as a healer, then my guess is maaaayyyybe you are the weak link, no offense.
---
I just put it 1 silver below the lowest on AH
---
I mean SM is pretty straightforward.  If the tank acts as a puller and a place to drag stray mobs to, they’re doing a great job. Especially if higher level DPS is burning stuff down quickly.
---
Just bought mine for 50g last night wondering if I got played...
---
Think of it as a KitKat bar, there are several bars (parties) that make up the whole thing (raid)
---
All depends on context, seems weak from the photo but if the guy is constantly spamming guild with every upgrade and level they get than yeah it could be annoying.
---
You ask why you get downvotes and it's because of your shitty attitude. You are the one who made your shitty attitude relevant, and now when you hear something you don't like, you pretend that it came out of nowhere.
---
With that questionable logic people should only roll mage, lock, and hunter.
---
A raid consists of 1 or more parties. A party can have up to 5 players. Party chat only talks to your party. Raid chat talks to the whole raid, even if they are in a different party from you.
---
When people do this shit to me un ironically I get so annoyed. Well played.
---
You may want Tailoring for the Bloodvine set when ZG comes out, but that is a fair bit away and you can always pick it up again.
---
Skinning is a nice way to supplant your income, but if you don't have anything to use it with then it can get a bit cumbersome.
---
&gt;Would I be better off dropping both professions for, say, herb/mining?
---
Problem with Herbalism/Mining is that you cannot track both at once, so you'll always have to be swapping between the two, or be using just one.
---
If you really feel like dropping tailoring, I'd suggest Mining + Engineering, as the Engineering items are pretty amazing and you'll always need mining to make more bombs/bots/equipment/tools.
---
&gt;The ONLY good thing I’ve found about it is making your own groups whenever you want. You can invite who you want, get what items you want. That’s it, though.    
---
  
---
 Now take that away while keeping all the shitty parts and you have a healer's world.
---
I think it’s.. a joke.
---
Next offense is a ban :)
---
Shit happened to me a couple times, once it dropped me in the middle of the ocean on my way to hillsbrad
---
/mooo
---
You are just a piece of shit really.
---
"When in doubt, kick the healer out".
---
I work in the humanities. I like sentences, not columns. A spreadsheet doesn't have context and explanations.
---
r/holup
---
If you think you'd be salty about losing rolls, don't join PUGs.
---
Honestly not sure, I got the sinew before the leaf myself. But I was the only hunter in the raid when the leaf dropped lol.
---
Yes. Is that term used by another class?
---
If someone asks you for help, you help! Your fellow horde player was probably ganked by this dude. Ofc he is pissed when you dont help.
---
Are they purple tho
---
What is this? A village for ants??
---
man of culture
---
"Dives drain tanking" looks like a kind folk has even linked it for you.
---
Get a buddy to invite your bank alt into the same party as you. Now you can reset dungeons solo by logging into your bank alt for 2 minutes until it automatically gets party leader, resetting dungeons, and then logging on your main.
---
It is not just that. It has a lot to do with what gear drops. And gear drops in this are just bad for tanks.
---
Well after lv55 you can start running the high lvl dungeons for your pre raid bis gear, so by the time you are 60 you alrdy have a lot of them.
---
This is a troll right? 
---
Pallies are a very flavorful class and I'm leveling one as an alt but their design is far from the best. 
---
Kevin Jordan, one of the original class designers, has even said retadins were the [biggest failure](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769367727) in class design.
---
It’s also fair if everyone rolls greed on it. It is also an exercise in trust. Can I trust this person? The server community has no other way of policing itself than to ostracize bad behavior.  Getting everyone to just roll Need on valuable items allows these shit individuals to blend in more. It is a major part of the toxicity problem on a server.
---
1. repost
---
2. you don't get HKs from lowbies
---
3. Goldshire isn't a contested zone
---
You are missing the best part in that this is the DPS making the demands.
---
A raid group is divided in up to 8 parties of 5 players. 
---
Every party has their own individual party chat that only they can see, whereas everyone can see raid chat.
---
Certain auras and buffs such as Leader of the Pack, Trueshot Aura, shaman totems etc. Only affect members in the same party. 
---
For example, theres 5 players in group 4. Two of which are a hunter and a shaman. All players in group 4 would benefit from the Hunter’s trueshot aura and Shaman’s windfury totem.
---
If you wanted the whole raid to benefit from windfury, you’d have to put a shaman in each of the 8 parties and have them place a windfury totem. 
---
Essentially, a raid is a coordinated group of 2-8 parties.
---
Ok cool, have fun.
---
people like you should be banned.
---
100% agree, positivity is great!
---
Raids are up to 40 people.
---
Parties are up to 5 people.
---
Raids are essentially composed of 8 parties (8*5=40) and you can see which party you belong in by going to the "Social" page and hitting the "Raid" tab. 
---
The reason the chats are different is because at times certain parties within a raid have certain roles or responsibilities, for instance we put half our mages in one group for Ony, and the other half in another group. That way when the whelps spawn, someone in the party chat can alert the relevant mages to start AoE'ing them down without spamming up the main raid channel or altering people who don't need to worry about whelps.
---
Man this is so sick, I miss being young and games having so much mystery and allure to them
---
Just play holy/reckoning build, you have all the strengths of pally healing (arguably the best in the game) in addition to getting reck bombs when you get the opportunity to hit someone. You can heal or tank in pve as you have every crucial talent.
---
It works but not nearly as well as it did on pservers.
---
What a tool
---
Url? Dm if it’s against rules. I miss wall walking
---
My choice too - the Queldanil belf village in the northwest is idyllic I'd love to spend a long weekend there.
---
That's what every scammer says...
---
LMAO unarmored epic mounts were in the game, but armored were added in 1.4? Or do you not know that??
---
I think with the hassle its taking me to actually get it down right, and only use it against specific mobs it will work on I may just stop doing it really.
---
Gnomes are always the biggest tryhards. I don’t think anyone actually likes the look of gnomes they pick them for the OP racials.
---
And as a healer I sure as hell will call out a shitty tank, just as fast as I'll call out that slacking dps. Especially if we're doing a long dungeon...
---
when leveling up your new weapon skill, spam serpent sting rank 1. it triggers a chance for a skill up and early on you can get to 100 with just a few mobs this way
---
Horde gourd
---
healcomm is working, not sure where you got those informations. Also pred heals are not broke on my grid.
---
It really was amazing, and this subreddit is going to be real upset when more people realize we are getting the trash 1.12 version.  When people wax nostalgic on AV, they aren’t talking about the trimmed down Zerg rush that AV became after they removed all the side paths and 80% of the mobs and buffs.
---
Yeah ToC and the shift to "all the daily quests" was where I got uneasy with it all. I didn't mind the weekly quests for rep where you could log in for an hour anywhere in the week and work on them but then they started having people do that every day? I didn't like where it was going and turns out I was very right.
---
Honestly it's what killed off the other expansions as well. I leveled up to the cap and went "OK now what". Answer was the same - do daily quests every day for the next 3 months and then you can do some more daily quests. Fuck off, how is that fun?
---
KHAZUKAN KAZAKIT-HA
---
Hey, sorry to dig this up but I was testing this clearcasting theory yesterday with CL&gt;ES and the ES still appeared to consume mana. Can you confirm if you are getting both spells for free?
---
Was this on Firemaw?
---
Seconded. I wonder how that works.
---
Lol it still shows the mount for Tauren is Plains Running
---
You're gonna run a lot more onyxias before even phase 2 releases, I wouldn't worry about it.
---
It's fine to not have aggro all the time, plus I started playing a mage as an alt and trust me, they're just happy to have you there. Grinding mobs while waiting for a tank is soul crushing, and I'll never get used to it. Full party, people would be happy with a druid or even a tough paladin. You get desperate.
---
I see Thex do be messin’ wit da voodoo. Shame shame.
---
Like 90% of Huntering is standing in one place and auto-attacking while occasionally pushing buttons. Then this quest comes along and you have to be not just capable of but *proficient* in kiting and Hunter melee. Oh and you can’t use your pet. 
---
I spent easily a couple hundred gold just in consumables doing it in vanilla. Nice job!
---
Stormwind, a nice house in the Mage Quarter somewhere. Doesn’t have to be big. I’d be outside most of the time anyway.
---
Flare is free and has 100% uptime. Impossible for rogue to open against hunter sitting in flare.
---
One of the things I missed most about vanilla was that people don't say ding anymore in retail  :(
---
But then how can you hit 61 and 62 in raids?
---
Feign death is bugged and doesn't remove hunters from combat in pvp
---
No idea how to do that lol
---
If you’re ever on Westfall/Alliance, pm me and I’ll be happy to quest along as a friendly face :)

Same. A few bad apples here and there, but for the most part people have been skilled enough and friendly.
---
Happy cake day

see for yourself   [https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php](https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php)
---
Weaponskill is incredibly useful, it's a bit of a long explanation of the benefits, but they are definitely there.
---
It is Guidelime addon with the Guidelime\_Busta's 1-60 horde leveling guide it's really good
---
I mean sure, I guess I just don't see the point. Questing is fun and way faster to level. That said I never obsessed over BiS anyway. I've run instances and gotten what I've gotten, some BiS and some "good enough". I'm always top 5 DPS in raid, often number one, and we're smashing MC and Ony without issue.
---
It's nice to work on getting best of everything but with the patch we started at the content isn't *really* challenging enough that everyone needs all the best gear right now. Saw way too many guildies chain running instances for the BiS piece for days on end only to replace it the next day anyway.
---
That’s they key. Very few people paying anything near that atm. Save and sell later
---
&gt;It is Guidelime addon with the Guidelime\_Busta's 1-60 horde leveling guide it's really good
---
Damn you are lucky.   We have like 5 other hunters,  it sucks.

If we get in melee range tho it can often be a one or two shot with a strong 2h
---
Do you know what OC stands for?
---
Original Content. Not “original-to-me” content.
---
&gt;Edit: Website... lol
---
vould be worse, could be webtite
---
I disagree. I don't know where the general consensus changed but back in vanilla every single group I ran used:
---
Need if you are going to use/equip immediately.
---
Greed if you are going to sell it.
---
It's incredibly selfish to sell a BOE someone in the group could use on their character now imo.
---
I never said I was though. I was simply saying there is potential for paladin to make gold, encouraging other paladins to do so if they want another form of gold farming. Love how negative this subreddit is!
---
It's text based, You need to make it incredibly obvious. 
---
&gt; But people on this sub is apparently so stupid that even the most stupidest comments meant as a joke is seen as serious
---
No, that's just the internet in general because usually when someone says something that should be stupid, they actually mean it.
---
I got recommanded [this video](https://youtu.be/7YkijTMQYOg) which seemed to be older, not sure if this is the original inspiration.
---
Some classes are just doomed when trying that route
---
I haven't really seen the guy spamming guild chat with loot or anything, but then again I'm not on very much during the week. I guess the negativity just caught me off guard in what is usually a pretty cordial guild.
---
Go into your interface options and click addons tab and find sexy map,
---
He literally says he is upset because OP does it all the time. I highly doubt it was BiS every time.
---
Best remedy: learn to be happy for other people's gainz and use it to fuel your own fire for gainz
---
Never mentioned gold per hour in my post. Just encouraging other paladins to give it a try as theres potential. Like i posted for the dude above, I love how negative this subreddit is!
---
Because reddit is a hivemimd so they tend to join guilds with 100+ people instead of joining smaller raiding guilds
---
I'm a fury warrior and I tank dungeons all the time. I can swallow my pride and realize that if I just throw some plate and a shield on I can find a group almost instantaneously. Doesn't involve me respeccing, doesn't compromise my morals or something, it's just a no brainer to save myself time and get what I need.
---
If you don't want to do it, fine. But acting like somebody is being entitled because they ask a fury warrior to tank or a shadow priest to heal is just unreal. You CAN do it, so you should expect to at least get asked. If somebody asks and you can't deal with the idea of playing a second role just say no, you don't have to take personal offense.
---
Amusingly this is specifically because way back when you could indeed use custom emotes to talk to the other faction.
---
This is funny to me. Server communities should be policing this shit themselves. Letting everyone roll need on valuable items caters to ninja behavior instead of ostracizing it. I want to know if you’re a piece of shit so I never group with you again. I hope the community cares enough about itself to remove this individual by killing this person’s reputation so it becomes very hard for them to find a group in the future. This helps eliminate the toxicity problem some of these servers are having.
---
What did I just read
---
A few bad apples spoil the bunch
---
I had this issue until I joined an active guild, not a problem anymore
---
I love the FAQ section. There are a lot of uncertain things. Things that were obviously changed later on. I didn't even know about this one:
---
&gt;**Do Tauren have mounts?**
---
&gt;No, they instead have a special racial ability called Plains Running, which allows them to run very quickly for a certain amount of time.
---
It's a really nice, almost meditative thing to do for gold.
---
Arbitrage ftw. I’ve sold countless starting zone recipes for 1000% or more markup because nobody wants to walk back to those areas and find the vendor who sells em.
---
Did you try google?
---
2 sets of del rends dropping in that time is
---
IIRC this was fixed in Vanilla so it doesnt work on the current patch
---
People use ep/gp still?
---
I will be disappointed if that's all the info we get.
---
Gold!
---
Warlocks life tapping to around 20% health and then sitting there while everyone else drinks, instead of tapping to 80% mana and eating/drinking
---
If they had an actual fking tank, people would join just for the quest.
---
You don’t. You max out at 300. There are very rare weapons (and enchants I *think*) that will increase certain weapon skills.
---
Edit: What I meant to say is you will still hit them, and that you can’t increase past the 300 base for level 60.
---
Lol! Yeah I still need to name all 3, I usually name them the same as my Twink to make it hard for enemy's to /tar me or name them after whoever our FC is in the Guild.
---
Welcome to mmo raiding
---
Bing Bong you are wrong
---
Yo, is a dungeon run even fun if you're not trying to put out fires?
---
I’d leave a guild that just let shit like this happen in a heartbeat.  Going to be absolutely full of drama where people are dickheads to each other and then act like they didn’t do anything wrong.
---
Not saying the guy needs to be kicked immediately, but he absolutely should be warned that he’ll be kicked if it continues.  
---
If you’re going to be mad every time someone is fishing for grats from the guild, just hide guild chat, or get a chat mod that allows you to filter out certain people/phrases in certain tabs, or find a new guild that doesn’t allow vocal displays of support between guild members.
---
Should be noted guideline becomes a PITA if you don't use it from level 1. Don't start in the middle. It gets really fucked up.
---
dunno. spirit seems like it has no value to an aoe grinding mage. i guess if hes not aoe grinding it could help
---
I hope the music changes accordingly
---
A flag carrier maybe. Or a warrior who wants the extra padding so they’re able to still deal damage without dying as fast.
---
Yeah it’s really obnoxious. You see ninja posts constantly on here and those people are nowhere to be seen.
---
"wait for me to do xx amount of damage if you have an addon, otherwise wait 10 seconds, if you draw aggro immediately I'll let you die" has worked well alongside marking enemies with skulls/X's for kill order.
---
Wait a second, I state what I'm going to do at the start of the run and I'm a ninja?
---
See this all the time, I now browse the AH with a finger well clear of my LMB. Could easily lose all my mount money trying to navigate all these fucking minefield auctions.
---
Can I take the reins of starting a pointless and escalating internet argument? It's been a while and I want to start something stupid. :)
---
I second this. For the longest time had my macros set up like this on live, until SW:P, MB, and DP were locked to shadow only... Still have Holy Fire/smite macroed together, with an alt modifier for HF.
---
Original to you is not OC.
---
Just because it’s content, and that you made it yourself, does not automatically make it original.
---
Moonglade. I like the isolated space away from the rest of the conflict and the fact that the people there are neutral and more worried about preserving the world than fighting in wars.
---
Lore of the Druids really made me like the class so much more in classic.
---
Do your chores, eat your veggies, give his mom the D, then put your balls on his drum set. That'll secure alpha status in the house.
---
I saw it all the time in BC and late vanilla because people were tired of getting shit ninja’d. Despite what you or anyone else may think, putting someone on blast in trade chat one time on a server with tens of thousands of players is not going to affect his future ninjaing.
---
I've been with this guild since week 2 so i dont really have much experience with other peoples systems, but I'm extremely pleased with how they do things. Our raid leader also happens to be our MT so obviously hes gonna get geared first, but that happens in literally any raiding guild.
---
Is that the woods from evil dead?
---
So you’re saying it’s only possible to hit a 62 with a 310 weapon skill
---
Found the T-rex.
---
Isle added a TON of daily quests, and was most peoples daily grind, but they existed before hand
---
Weird. When the randoms in my guild (30% buds 70% randoms) get excited and post stuff I get excited for them. Makes me happy because they're happy.
---
Ok awesome I’ll get it thanks is it also very useful in PvP ?
---
Feet of the lynx?  Seal of Wrynn?
---
no one criticize the tank ? 
---
Mage : Why the fuck can't you hold aggro for me ?
---
I thought about using herb/mining together so I, for example, could make better money doing Mara solo farming when I hit 60.
---
 
---
Regarding having to swap between tracking the nodes, isn't it neglible when you start gathering in routes? I am considering doing herb/alch, as crafting professions are a lot of fun, but I fear alch being a money-dump without the proper recipes/having to compete against other established alchemists on my server.
---
I know a LOT of people (myself included) who only play human for the OP racials, just saying.
---
Man you’re gonna have so much advantage over other players...it won’t matter if your skill is lower you can still beat them! Great job man!! So awesome
---
Pots and flasks? No need for that in Classic 😂
---
This is amazing!
---
I think most people like or don’t mind the look of human but the majority of people dislike the look of gnomes. That’s the difference I’m getting at.
---
I don't think Westfall is "dead" I think it has a mix of speedrushers and people who are going slow.
---
Unlike say Pagle who was a server of all speedsters
---
Phase 2 release date is all i expect
---
What I did when PUG tanking started to wear on me, is I would just play a dps alt until I got frustrated by too many bad tanks. By then I just want to tank so at least someone would be doing it correctly.
---
It's a delicate balance.
---
Still even without those you are sitting at 8% which I more than enough.
---
Oh.. my god.. The nostalgia is too damn much. Takes me back to a carefree world with no responsibilities. The only worry is if we would win or lose under the Friday night lights and if Megan was going to be able to stay out late after the game. Thanks for the throwback!
---
Where's that?
---
Night elf anything but druid = noob
---
Trolls = pve carebears
---
I got TrailBlazer boots equip, they are better then Feet of the lynx. /consider BIS for Hunters. Can argue lynx for rogues &gt; trailblazers though. Seal of Wrynn is Alliance only.
---
But you still lose out on the item.
---
Depends on your definition of fine.  I mean clearing a dungeon with a spec is one thing, but at what pace is an other. Divine Fury, Healing Focus, Improved Healing, Spiritual Guidance, Spiritual Healing and Inner Focus objectively make a big difference in xp/h (less downtime, comfortable healing i.e. people get less quickly tired and iritated to start to make mistakes, more utility to recover from mistakes).
---
Not at all, you will be fine to raid at 300 like everyone else. You will just miss / parry / do slightly less damage than if you were to find increases over 300. The only people having more than 300 skill truly effect are tanks, as missing/parrying is detrimental to their threat.
---
Fo shizzle
---
Any alliance on arcanite reaper want to coordinate swapping recipes?
---
So then buy pots? Lol obviously if it's a true even playing field, then they wouldn't mind buying pots.
---
But it's not. Its theoretically an even playing field, but it isn't. Just like how both sides could have better gear, but they don't. Obviously one side will have better gear because they spent more time on it. Just like one side will easily afford pots because they either have the gold or they took alching.
---
Idk, I just feel strongly about it because I used to duel in dark souls, and although you weren't supposed to use the equivalent of a health pot, it wasnt a big deal if you did
---
Yep it was just WoW moving to the same model as mobile games and such. Get everybody logging in every day.. boosts your stats and gives you the chance to sell to them. 
---
And yes if you wanted to be in any decent kind of raiding guild you had to do all the relevant grinds as they came out, no exceptions. What's even worse is that while every single one of those hardcore guilds complained endlessly about how "casual" it made the rewards, they actually made it harder and harder for casual guilds and players to participate on a meaningful level. If you didn't do your stuff EVERY DAY then you would never actually build up a meaningful reward, whereas if you played super hardcore they were amazing for filling in gear gaps. 
---
Now they've gone so far that you can just click a button and sail through raids to have purples thrown at you. What's even the point? Doing it again to have the same purple with a higher number on it? Even then you can never keep up.
---
My favorite is when you get that asshole tank that wants to use a 2-hander. 
---
Me -"We can make this, bud, but do you mind switching to shield? It would just save us all time and trouble."
---
Tank - \*ignore\* 
---
Me - "You don't even have a shield on you do you?" 
---
Tank - "Nope, just do your job and heal you pleb! Look at my numbers!" 
---
Me - "No shield, no heals then." 
---
Tank - "Fine, I'll find a real healer then." \*leaves group\*
---
&gt;  I think I’m gonna go level my druid instead. 
---
So you can tank all dungeons again
---
Trash server
---
Because you're making up a very specific case nobody is really discussing
---
that's very early cata so by that point 15k is still a significant amount of gold, especially for what he sold
---
I don't think those rules are fair to the person who needs an item as a legit upgrade. They get boned hardest. By losing an upgrade and essentially losing the gold cost if they don't wanna miss upgrade.
---
Normal humans have a capacity for empathy, and an empathic connection allows us to experience each other's emotions. Where you see selfish attention-seeking, I see someone expressing their joy so that others might share in it.
---
&gt; Any healers recommend any addons they use for healing?
---
i've raided Mythic and done high level Mythic+ keys on Retail and i've never once used a healing add-on, 'cuz, i honestly think it makes people *worse* as a healer, but that's just me. from what i remember, people always remember things like HealBoT, VunDoh, etc.
---
&gt; Also - any tips on a holy priest to farm gold? Trying to craft my truefaith vestments and only have about 50g.
---
look up maraudon farming as a shadow priest. there should be a video by Hydramist about it. you can do it as any spec, it'll just be slower, but it's something. all you need to do the farm is a minor speed increase boot enchant. 
---
you could also do things like AoEing dungeons like DM/Stockades/SFK with Holy Nova. SFK does drop quite a few good BoE blues that twinks love.
---
I'm willing to start over if you are, I have a 46 pally on bigglesworth and all of my friends quit. I'd love to have a dps (warrior would be perfect) to help me to 60. I can be your healslave.
---
Do you run Ice Armor while AOE pulling then?
---
I never said anything about win.  I said that paladin is defeated.
---
What you do is yell at your parents for sheltering your ass
---
Surprising amount of people here unable to recognise fairly basic satire.
---
Unlikely to have a steady decline? Have you even been looking at subscription numbers?
---
Gnomes: usually somewhat happy go lucky and somewhat dumb, or weird.
---
Humans: mildly boring try-hards who think they’re better than they are (moreso than normal)
---
Night elf: actually a girl, an effeminate man, or a 14 year old
---
Dwarf: alcoholic or old, sometimes both
---
Yeah I know a lot of these are stereotypes of the races in WoW themselves (in the lore or aesthetically), but I am talking about the people who play them.  People disproportionately choose races which reflect who they are, and we stereotype the people who play those races based on the stereotypes of the races themselves (in lore, aesthetically).
---
Good luck topping the DPS meters then buddy.
---
Not so much as you'll be even level.  Not sure if there are still some benefits there maybe.
---
I usually am the group leader in my runs.
---
And my lot rules is "need on expensive BoEs". Don't like it? Find another tank.
---
you can do both with the default UI.
---
for healing/rage/energy, go into Interface Options -&gt; Display -&gt; Status Text (Numeric Value).
---
for the raids, go into Interface Options -&gt; Raid Profiles -&gt; Click Auto-Activate On for everything. you can adjust more settings from there.
---
That’s what a Synth would say.
---
'Ability not Ready yet" - Is there any way to hide this text and sound, either in game or via a mod?
---
No
---
What a sad person you must be.
---
An attempt was made ...
---
You should get the addon called "wide quest log"
---
For me healing has been pretty chill.
---
When I tank, I put some music on the background and I'm so focused that sometimes in a mana rest I notice that a whole album played and I barely noticed it. When I heal, I do it watching the Rugby World Cup or some Netflix
---
LF carries, everything of value reserved
---
Tell ‘em there dreaming
---
Ah, yeah.  The old "you don't like spam, so you must be a psychopath" argument.
---
Seriously, dude?
---
Seriously?
---
ohh wow my question got downvoted.   I guess someone is salty?
---
I got two once on an RTV but never 3. Congrats!
---
This is exactly why I DPS - because tanking is awful.
---
I tried to tank but I was left asking myself... why am I bothering? The responsibility is enormous, the stress is constant, at least one DPS will reliably be brain-dead, selfish and lazy, and you're expected to know everything. For all this the rewards are terrible. World PvE is easy, you don't need end game tanking gear for it, World PvP and BGs are obviously not going to become easier so your rewards only help you raid. Not to mention a tank is a borderline thankless job, very few people recognise your efforts.
---
Then comes DPS. There's very little stress and responsibility, you can show up to content without knowing every tiny detail, and you can even be appreciated because at least one person will notice your DPS if you are doing particularly well. Most importantly for me personally is that you don't need to create two sets of gear, one for a main spec and off spec, and that gear improves your performance everywhere.
---
Honestly to those who do tank, I'm very glad you are around because I never could go back to it... it's torture whereas a DPS is bliss.
---
Oof, I joined a group the other day as a non-prot pally tank (they were asking for a tank for like the past hour and I was nearby the dungeon). They had two warriors and a druid.
---
I couldn't disagree with you more, I think the opposite
---
I like the responsibility of tanking and I like trying to hold agro when people are going nuts. I see it as a challenge. My greatest dislike are people with no situational awareness pulling pats or skipped mobs and people who don't finish off mobs as it messes their dps so they leave a mob with a bees dick of hp to run away and agro the next group. Just start charging for runs, may as well make some gold.
---
Most DPS do not expect you to hold all the aggro, even as a tank we feel compelled to. Nowadays, people know the tricks to survive/push through aggro generally and will just murderize whatevers on them quickly or blow a CD. Mainly you're there to take the focus, less so always have everything (at least until particularly difficult content)
---
this is just from my own experience as a tank and dps, though
---
so where does it end spending cash on duels? should i go farm hundreds of tubers? get ungoro consumes? should I be flasking?  the consensus is that grenades even the tables a bit and are pretty cheap and just fun. everyone potting and tubering is just lame and then you’d have to farm all day just to duel outside org for an hour.
---
Okay, I'll just send you a DM on reddit every single time something happens in WoW.
---
Because that's not spam, right?
---
Getting a 200g item for free just because it happens to be an upgrade for one person is unfair to the other 4 people. And missing out on your free 200g item is nothing compared to someone stealing it.
---
Is this the power of requiem?
---
Oooooh it's definitely similar thanks for sharing. Could totally be inspiration! I just knew the OP was based off of the AHIT because of the smug dance being from AHIT
---
It's historical meaning sometimes lends itself to those with those intentions. But by itself it simply means "god wills it"
---
How many moonkins you seen? I haven’t seen a single balance Druid in 43 levels. You’re alone on this one my friend.
---
I cried laughing
---
You have people in greens getting drops? Then your loot council has a very different mindset from most. It also doesn't sound like your guild is terribly serious about raiding if people are bringing non-BiS greens. 
---
Sounds like your guild is a nice place, but it's not going to set any server firsts, and that's the context OP was talking about: their friend left for a serious raiding guild. Good on your gm for spreading the loot out, but this simply isn't how most loot councils function. It sounds like a DKP system would have been a better fit for your guild.
---
My response was to your statement that a person should find another guild if they don't get a drop within "several weeks/month". We'll be farming MC for 6 months before BWL comes out. If you're in a progression raid group, you need to put your wants aside to clear the content. That means if you're not top or near top dps for your class, you won't get gear for a while. People who leave over drops are often blacklisted. I don't care what your experience is. This is how guilds progress quickly and this is what OP was asking about.
---
Do you hold the same disdain for people who have a ton of epics right now I wonder? Because if not then its a little bit hypocritical. People who play more *should* have more than those that dont. I mean theyre simply putting more work in, why is it bad if they are able to enjoy the fruits of their labor?  
---
People who are bad at pvp, will die to those with worse gear than them regardless unless the disparity is just *huge*.Ive killed players who are ?? to me way back in the day, I did it while I was leveling classic as well. Skill *will* pull you through more than not.  
---
Beyond that, wow pvp is not really balanced. It was never truly balanced and if you are pvping in the game you should just fully embrace it or just shut up by now because it is what it is, you cant fix it and now youre complaining about something you chose to get in to, which is nothing but absurd.
---
Dude, the "Grumpy Fuck" was just a normal player who was tired of this kid fishing for grats/comments.
---
This wasn't a one-time event.
---
This had been going on for a while, and eventually the kid got called out for, as he should have.
---
Yeah its rough in dungeons, but I love PVP and that's why I rolled it
---
I mean ... I can literally make my UI look like that in 2 minutes with Elvui. Congratulations you have hidden stuff on your UI. You sound like a fucking retard that thinks he's cool cause he hides most stuff on his UI. Let people do the fuck they want instead of making fun of them for choosing a "bloaty" UI, when you can hide most stuff anyway with a simple click.
---
Seriously? It's obviously a joke.
---
If you cut out all the BS like looking for more people by going through a dedicated tank and some guild co-ordination you get a ton more rolls at the loot.
---
Apparently the Hat Kid's dance itself is from [this video](https://youtu.be/yD2FSwTy2lw) from 2017. Knowing that it's based on Bob from Animal Crossing gives context to the kid's bored-looking face.
---
At our last raid, we had an open spot. A mage had joined the guild earlier in the day so we asked if he wanted to come along. He was level 59. He joined the raid group and asked "anything on reserve?". The GM told him we were loot council and he left the raid group and said it wasnt worth doing if we were loot council and he would pug it instead. Join a raiding guild, then pug raids instead... I was baffled lol. 
---
Like I said, I'm not in the "circle" of our guild and don't kiss ass of officers or anything like that. I just show up to raids and do what im asked and i might be one the best geared warlocks on our realm.
---
One day you’re gonna reach lvl 60 on that lvl 50 and that feeling will only get worse. If you feel that “something is wrong” and you want more out of your wow experience I believe it is always justified to reroll on a pvp server, even if you had a lvl 60.
---
If you do decide to reroll, I recommend Mograine. It has a near 50-50 perfect split and the community (on the horde side atleast) is good. I’m lvl 50 and I’ve only blacklisted 2 players due to dickish behavior. Your mileage may vary ofcourse.
---
Do not drop tailoring.  Drop skinning.   Skinning sucks ass.
---
Nah, Zoomer is younger than 14 now. You got left behind
---
I can't even say anything. I used up all my luck getting HoJ with my first ever kill with 3 other people rolling against.
---
Because most of the people on here are bad at the game, so loot council never give them loot.
---
So then they call it corrupted. it’s literally the reason masterloot was removed in retail.
---
That's what I'll miss the most once classic is over and I go back to retail :(
---
Just killed Rend for the Onyxia attunement quest and I can't decide at all!
---
I read that Mark of Tyranny is really good but I'm not sure if I'll be tanking in raids at all. 
---
The other trinkets are obviously good, but a little easier replaced.
---
**Edit:** I guess it's not such a hard decision after all since everyone is saying Tyranny hah.
---
My reaction too:)
---
The guy in this post made it clear that this kid was *constantly* doing this, though.  He probably said "ding" 60 times in guild chat, and has been linking every single loot upgrade he's ever gotten.
---
This isn't the first time this has happened.
---
Finally somebody in his guild was fed up and called him on it.
---
I don't overstack int. I swap to  spell crit/base stats gear for long single target chain pulls so I don't go oom and swap back to SP when I know ill have time to drink or for AoE pulls. We were pulling these guys one after another so I just quickly swapped for more int and spirit. My mana pool is usually around 6k. I am also specced into arcane power so I get an extra 10% on my mana pool.
---
Then you post it on reddit.
---
rofl
---
wut
---
Probably, some people just randomly downvote stuff for no reason
---
Germans don't get humor bro
---
I'll bet it's a fucking gnome
---
R.I.P. in peace GPU
---
thanks!
---
Probably 2 mages and a warlock
---
“Scamming”? Just wondering what that means to you mate. He bought an item on the auction house for a posted amount. What’s the scam? Take some personal responsibility aye
---
I unironically miss the old vanilla WoW era website
---
Good suggestion, but Oceania has no RP servers.
---
Also, if you aren't RP minded, RP players can be just as obnoxious.
---
The combination of tanks reserving orbs and greens and then tanking in a dps spec with a 2hander is pissing me off a bit as a healer. Had a tank today who told me 2hand tanking is the best because dungeon mobs don't do much damage. He then proceeded to drop to 40% health at the start of each pull. If I didn't babysit him, he would have died several times. You're not tanking at that point, you're just dpsing hoping mobs die before you do. I have to keep up mages who take aggro all the time, maybe we should call them tanks too.
---
Wait... Druid tank tier 1?
---
Isnt the tier set for druid a healing set?
---
Thats not what im Talking about. You dont Need flasks or pots to complete MC
---
can't find "black rock slider" either
---
MC and ony are tuned for about 15 functioning humans supported by a pack of N64 golden eye era AI.
---
btw I'm Spookpriest on myzreal and i'm actually a warlock.
---
It looks like normal difficulty is most suitable for you. There is smaller reliance on your team, you can have an impact yourself if you want, and yes loot is replaced.
---
If I placed classic phase 1 difficulty, it would be at normal of retail.
---
But you're missing 10% physical damage and more than 10% threat because of modifiers, plus the occasional OOC proc) That's a ton of effective threat you're missing
---
Okay, reread my initial post and stop derailing.
---
I've got nothing riding on this. I don't care on anything you have to say. The point is that a playerbase split 15 ways isn't sustainable. You understood that, but wanted to chime in with garbage.
---
Some of us aren't lucky with loot or roll, and it can suck to hear others getting there's.  
---
It's a bit like Social Media. You only hear good things from others, and if you're not experiencing any yourself, it can get depressing/annoying.  
---
Example:  
---
I ran BRD with GL. He got 3 bis from 1 run, while I've done 10+ and won no BIS (actually haven't seen any drop).  
---
Only bis I've won is from Mara, the ring which took me 3 days of non-stop farming to get\.  
---
Kind of annoyed because this is the same that GL wanted us to be bis ready. But some classes/players can be just unlucky no matter how much time they spend farming.  
---
But even then, I just stay quiet and keep leveling/farming hoping to get my bis.
---
I was hoping for #s from pve raids.
---
What are some realistic axes for a pre bis orc furry warrior?
---
They should really just be doing 3 man runs
---
There's a mage quest for the celestial orb/staff (can't remember the quest tho) the orb is pretty useful for those "oh shit I'm outta mana, no Evo, no gem" situations
---
Actually not sure what that is. If it's a newish item in retail, then no because it's been a year or more since I've logged on
---
Grizzle’d again
---
DS ruin feels so different than the deep affliction leveling spec, it’s super refreshing actually. It’s right you can’t give blood pact, but only one warlock needs blood pact and your guild can decide that beforehand. 
---
SM gets to use imp, nightfall and amplify curse. DS gets improved healthstone, more stam, more DPS and improved VW bubble at the cost of all the utility a pet brings.
---
Decide based on those pros
---
You’re just in that honeymoon phase with WoW. Sadly, it’ll pass.
---
Only 2-3 hours at night during the week after work.. but this weekend I probably put in an easy 25-30 hours between Saturday and Sunday.
---
i have (i think it's called) mks scrolling combat text. i don't see any error text displayed.
---
is it being displayed in chat? i don't get errors in there either. I'm inclined to think that an addon i have has disabled it and if it can, then there should be an option in the default options as well.
---
at work atm so can't check, sorry. also, can't check when im at home as i'll be playing -.-
---
I would pick a new server. I just need someone to play with I don’t really care which server I’m on as long as someone to join me
---
Yep! Just autocasting bite/growl is the easiest way, and it's effective enough to never really worry about it. You can leave them both on autocast basically indefinitely (I think you'd run out of focus about 70 seconds into the fight, which shouldn't be an issue). 
---
I'd recommend keybinding claw, though, and using it a couple of times to help spend your focus and generate extra threat when you pull a new mob. Growl+bite will keep your pet at really high focus for longer than most mobs will live, so using claw manually can eek out a little more damage (by increasing total focus spent, like I mentioned in the post above, keeping in mind that you'll regen focus in between pulls so you should try to spend it before then)
---
You also don't need to growl for the entire duration of a fight, so you could turn it off to get some extra focus for claw towards the end of a mob's life. 
---
None of that's incredibly important, though, it's just something that can help speed things up if you're bored while questing/grinding. You gotta decide where your tolerance for micromanagement lies lol. 
---
Also when thinking about threat remember that if you can see the nameplate of the mob in question, you'll pull aggro with 110% threat. But if you're far enough away that you can't see it, you'll only pull at 130%. You also have FD to drop all threat, and it's on a 30 second cooldown so you can use it really often - mana allowing.
---

Who’s joe?
---
Nope, I'm not sure how to do that or how it works
---
“Still shows”
---
Yeah... because it’s an archive of the site from 2004...
---
This seems so widespread, outside of bindings in the rare MC pug, I can’t remember this in vanilla. Is this some toxic private server shit that has developed in the last 12 years? Like ungoro mafias.
---
I mean you could argue it’s ok to have one reserve because it will help form groups that don’t have overlaps with gear they want, but man...
---
I saw one the other day, LFM UBRS Jed/Rend with about three reserves + need someone with UBRS key :D
---
As Heals...Duel-wield tanks, I agree and am generally fine with. 2-hander tanks, that’s gonna be a no for me dawg.
---
Fortunately most healers have tank friends, so the tank leaves too.
---
being a gay couple must he hard
---
Finding a tank is always a bit of a struggle. It will be a bit of a pain for a while, but you’ll meet a few. Be nice to the good ones, and eventually you’ll know a few good ones and you can run with them again sometime.
---
Tanking is a blessing and a curse. It’s easy to find groups, but you are at the mercy of every other player in the group. If they decide to play poorly, pull things for you, damage the wrong target, not heal well, there’s not much you can do except run around like a idiot trying to regain control. It’s thankless, tiresome work and often not much fun. So tanking for random pug groups is not high on my list of things to do unless I have a quest to do or an item I’m after.
---
That said, sometimes the masochist in me is up for it and I’ll tank stuff just for fun/practise or to help someone I know. And it’s fun to meet good people in pug groups, so I try to put myself out there from time to time.
---
You would be considered semi casual I would think with those numbers.  If that helps for comparison.  Many put in way more.  Just depends on your life situation, if you enjoy the time you play and don't neglect real life don't worry about it.
---
goddamnit
---
If you are that worried about it, just make a macro and a keybind for both. One with stop casting and one without.
---
Happy cake day.
---
w/ alch, at the very least, you can sell your transmute CDs.
---
also, depending on how large your server is, there may still be room for you. maybe not tho.
---
Trying is the key word lol
---
Ehh honestly just give me a dkp system. I want to be the one who chooses what loot I try to get. Not a group of people who don’t know me except by numbers.
---
I think it’s hard to sell the idea that you’ll get loot “when we want you to get it” to the majority of people. Doesn’t matter if they’re good at distributing or not.
---
Because proper loot council involves transparency with predetermined priority lists by class and player. The people who hate loot council aren't farming rep for hours to unlock the raid or making flasks and don't understand merit for contribution. They are at their first few raids and haven't sat in raids for weeks gearing others. The hour they spent inside is all they know. Not the 20 hours someone else already spent to even get them inside. And then these "entitled" players also are the loudest because people air grievances louder than satisfaction and contentment. Noone rocks the boat when they are satisfied and happy.
---
Loot council is also not the circle jerk let's have a chat during raid and call it loot council. People have a sour taste from that ridiculous system calling itself loot council. And it should be called something entirely different.
---
Yeah has to be some retail mentality crap stinking up classic
---
You can batch the blink with a blind. Otherwise nothing. You just gonna die.
---
Tanking can be a real chore at times, but i just take it easy - i only run a dungeon when i feel like doing a dungeon run.
---
And i don't mean for the loot, i mean, the act of running a dungeon and hang out with some people you haven't met before.
---
Right now with MC/Ony, sure.. but if you don't start optimizing for later content then there's a good chance you won't be able to clear it.
---
I wish people would stop trying to spin it as 2h tanking and just be honest with themselves. You're trying to do a 4 dps 1 healer group, that's it. There's a pretty clear outline of what a tank is. The only reason why things like deathknights got around it is they had enough tools to keep their health up to supplement the healer. At least they were designed with those intentions.
---
I remember starting WoW 15 years ago. How fun it was, and how bad we were.
---
Hunters were always a risk to have in a group, so I, the rogue, mastered the art of the pull. It also meant, never starting with stealth but, eh... it needed to be done. Our healer was a balance druid. Our tank, a tauntless Paladin. We approached everything carefully, planing, sapping... and managed to be fairly successful.
---
I did a rogue this time too. I'm bored after 2 minutes in a dungeon, asking myself why they didn't take another mage instead of me. All I see are aoe's... so I quickly lose focus.
---
Thankfully, I can open lock boxes.
---
Tanking is very fun. I loved it in classic. There’s actually a lot to do and your actions have real consequences and are the biggest factor in the success of the group.
---
Played all roles, have to say dps is the boring one.
---
Got mine going to 52-58 and got to victory lap quest areas. Super satisfying
---
If you strangle them
---
Yeah, dps might have to hold back.
---
They might have to hood back even if you had the extra threat.
---
It's still doable.
---
im hard
---
Artax, nooo!
---
There quests in booty also? I never went in there for quests. I’m 41
---
If you were in my guild and got a BiS gear, I wouldn't mind. It wouldn't be spam.
---
Plus if you have a problem with people linking BiS gear in chat, you could just ignore the person. Or send them a private message to chill out. But instead this guy puts the linker on blast in front of everyone. That's unnecessary, and even more of a toxic guild chat response than the thing he's complaining about.
---
Dwarf hunters: Always fucking noobs man. And it's a shame, because I always liked dwarf hunters.
---
Female Nelfs: weird dudes who love to stand around naked and dance in IF and masturbate over their toon.
---
Human warriors: Try hard knobs. 
---
Undead Rogues: Copse gank you until you uninstall. Will do anything in their power to just ruin your day.
---
Characters with female names: either a thot or a dude pretending to be a girl for attention. 
---
Gnome: fun or crazy, no inbetween.
---
I'll play how I want. It's a game and I play it for fun. I'm not really playing at the expense of anyone. it's a rare drop, emphasis on **rare**, so it's not an everyday thing anyway. I don't really care how people want to loot stuff. If someone in my group insists we all need or whatever, *I just don't care*. However it happens is fine because it's a game and it doesn't matter. In any case, I will continue to need the gear I plan to equip.
---
Also you sound very condescending. I don't know if you're feeling upset or something, but I'm actually not a stupid person so you don't have to talk to me like one.
---
Oh yea I did that quest I replaced the celestial orb with the spirit of the aque...

---
From what I heard we are getting the nerfed AV. So it’s probably going to turn into a Zerg to the boss pretty quickly once it’s out. No need to AFK it when it’s over in 10 minutes.
---
Does anyone have benchmarks on how long it takes to level? Like if you end up at 10 days /played to hit 60, how many days should you be at around level 30, 40, 50, etc? 
---
Not really interested in total xp or even number of mobs per level, rather just see /played.
---
We're gettin right into kink territory now
---
Well we don't have that chat log to confirm what was said before. There's better ways he could handle it then put this guy on blast in the guild chat for all to see. Why not just leave him ignored and go on with his life?
---
I mean I kinda get it.  If someone posted every green they found while questing it would get old quick, and most blues and levels are not that far off from that.  Ding 40?  Great.  Ding 60?  Fantastic dude.  Maybe even throw one in for acquiring class-defining skills like Chain Heal.  Probably should keep you hitting level 7 on your alt to yourself though.  Got the Triune Amulet?  Don't care.  The gloves that never drop?  Now we have something to talk about.  BoE epic?  Link that shit, yo.  It's about having some semblance of filtering what is worthy of celebration.  Imagine if a friend called you every time they found a dime on the ground.  For the smaller things it's not that hard to have a mini-celebration with the group you ran the dungeon with instead of taking it to guild chat.
---
yea I ran a fishing bot all the way through to legion. Never got any warnings or bans.
---
I won’t use it in classic because I am taking zero chances. But i’m like 70% sure it would work without getting me banned.
---
Bots are hard to find until they get so popular that blizzard can specifically target the one that is being used by thousands of people.
---
I have imp sprint and am holding out for pvp trinket, thennnnn I wont worry about mages.
---
I rerolled to pvp also, but when i got to the first contested zone i went back. i dont need that constant stress. but if you feel like thats what you really want to do then do it now before you invest more time in characters you dont wanna play in the end
---
Even though there's a mage in the party than gave him food/water. They'd still rather Life Tap.
---
I too hate when other people have fun
---
That build has the same mitigation as full feral, you only lose out on the threat generation which can be important in an MT / 1st OT role but less so in 2nd OT+ slots. You are far more useful to a raid running that spec unless you are in the top 2 slots of the tank roster which ideally should go to warriors simply because that spec you are running is better for your raid. I'm now full feral as I'm 2nd OT but I miss being able to queue healer or tank for dungeons and I'm hoping we get another warrior so I can drop down the roster again.
---
My girlfriend made a gnome warlock because she thinks they look silly and goofy... Don't worry, I made sure to spank her for that.
---
The runecloth bit was what made me think it was satire, but his attitude towards anyone who questioned it made me think he was actually serious.
---
I never said there wasn't better ways, and he should have just ignored and moved on. I was just pointing out that it as likely not the first time after you said it was "hardly every piece of loot"
---
I reckon you posted this to fish for even more grats you monster. Oh the humanity.
---
Grats.

---
Lol. No.
---
Yeah if you still have it, I'd hold onto it, if not, it doesn't seem like a huge loss
---
It took me 6 days. I was at 4 days at 40.
---
I’m about ten levels above you but I love questing with people!
---
I too played back in vanilla, and all the group's I played in needed on all epic BoE in random groups. I played from late 2004 until pre BC patch. Stop trying to spread a false narrative that people are more greedy nowadays.
---
You can't if you have good dps.
---
Apart from the RFC and WC where I have to tell Priest not to cast PW:S or pre-cast Renew on me (play Warrior), never had a issue with healers.
---
They had to kite it all the way there
---
To get another labyrinth-like dungeon with 20+ bosses again is the dream. I miss the format of dungeons being packed with bosses, even if they are easy.
---
Holy crap, its actually the guy from archvaldors video..
---
This is the kind of shit I think to myself when the mage in the group gets overly excited about his 30% drop rate bis boots dropping.
---
But I keep that to myself because I'm not an asshole.
---
Shattered Halls is a glorious dungeon, still my favourite in the game.
---
I learned how to really tank in that place. I was a new player, rolled warrior, spec’d Prot, earned my stripes in BC heroics, and then I wanted to get my T5 attunement which meant completing the timed run in SH. I pugged it for a week prior to practise, and after that I could tank that place with my eyes closed. Big pulls, no CC. Lots of disarm, concussion blow, intercept stun and kiting to reduce damage from 5 packs while I had a mortal strike debuff.
---
Made a man outta me.
---
Ambush
---
Vanish + Blind  
---
As long as the mage doesn't IB, you should gib them.
---
I would hope so considering T1 is prot gear, and mage vs warrior has pretty much nothing to do with skill.
---
Weirdly in raids you just stand back healing. It's very weird.
---
In general:
---
main tank/off-tank should get funneled gear. I need to go dps due to our large number of tanks, it sucks, but meh.
---
idk about healz/dps.
---
you might be able to ask how your loot council works, you should also be allowed to question why a piece of gear was given to a certain player. the loot council should be able to justify their decisions and should be open to criticism as well. 
---
it's much better than /roll as that just hurts the guild. for DKP, it's not great as people hoard their dkp. A good/ideal mix is DKP+loot council as it allows people to show that they want the item and the loot council to consider each persons wants.
---
I relate to this.
---
Never said I sabotage runs...normally. The particular instance I referenced had a lot more going on than just that. Tank wasn’t wearing a helm (halloween mask), didn’t want to wait until TWO of our dps even made it to instance, afk’d to eat a hot pocket for 15 mins once dps did arrive, and was a general turd to the entire group for “being retail bad” while pulling 2 packs of mobs at once. 
---
Whole group requested he be a bit more of a team player and he decided to show his ass instead. So after much deliberation, we decided to let him go down on a pull. He got butthurt and left. If that’s a sabotage, then yes, I sabotaged that run.
---
there's a lad on my server who has 8/8 earthfury, malistar's defender and an aurastone hammer after 5 weeks of mc
---
that's why loot council is stupid
---
[Friedrich](https://youtu.be/VYz7qeN5amk?t=103) disagree
---
You scared me when you said hearthstone, lol.  I think you meant healthstone.  But I went DS/Ruin, since I figure it's time for a change of pace.  It was only my second respect, so the next one is still cheap.  Thanks.
---
You're the gm of a racist, white supremacist guild? Nice job buddy.
---
The game became so efficient that the social aspect was killed. The achievement and prestige died.
---
A lot of the aspects that made Classic painful, had elements that provides satisfaction. Like not getting your BIS for 100 runs sucked, but when it dropped on run 101 it was quite satisfying. Looking for a group took literal hours, but when you found that perfect team it was legendary.
---
IMO it was global realm Dungeon Finder. Don't get me wrong, I was mad stoked when it came out. But I soon realized that... no one communicated, they didn't need to. People run so fast that communicating actually slows the group down and we can't have that.
---
People got so fast and good that people autopilot the game.
---
Blizzard tried and superbly succeeded in removing the pain in tbe game they removed a lot of the aspects that provides satisfaction. That said, I agree that games shouldn't be painful, we have vocations and jobs for that.
---
cus u can just change to DPS and be #1 damage w fury warrior too.
---
warriors are op in classic
---
lol yeah, wait till you get to STV.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
PVP servers are already screwed due to faction inbalance......when the honour system hits, it will get worse.
---
I mean, if you want to ruin your experience and have to quit wow, by all means, join a pvp server, otherwise, wait for BG's to launch (That is the true and pure pvp of wow).

Human females aren't too bad with the old models but human males look and walk like bipedal gorillas with pre-death rigor mortis.
---
Oh, I'm totally with you on that.  If you have a good guild with good leadership, loot council is the absolute best way to not only be fair in distributing loot, but also ensure that the guild gets geared properly.  That's one thing I've seen hurt guilds who don't use loot council.  They can end up getting geared in a really lopsided way.  Loot council prevents that.
---
so my sword shouldn't be enchanted due to WF? that true for both dps and mt/ot?
---
Gone are the days of small talk with the opposing faction's priest in AB when the match is so one sided, the losing team just idles out a 5 cap.
---
can't hunters just use freezing trap? lol
---
When I see messages like that in guild chat I’ll usually glance down, read it, then just continue doing what I was doing.  If I’m in a good mood I might shoot at “gz”, but I don’t feel any kind of way when I do see these messages.  I think if someone has a negative feeling when they see a message like that is pretty yikes in itself.

It definitely doesn’t have that connotation. Maybe to you, but not the masses.

Its a really funny phenomenon that when people try to come up with alternative versions of existing expressions ther mostly rhyme or aliterate even thiught the original has none of that.

Especially on reddit though.

---
That’s cause you are lol it’s easy to see. If your needing on gear for gold your a little bitch. Get good man, play the Ah, lvl profs, farm mobs, run dungeons without bein an entitled retail prick... any of those options are decent money makers. Just because you need gold doesn’t mean people get screwed, fuck you, every one needs gold, make that on your own time, not on a 5 man groups. Sad part is your probably not even a tank or a healer, gettin carried and entitled. Don’t know how to make gold, because you a filthy casual.
---
Priest+Warrior boss farm in dm east.
---
SM GY, far left, is the one for low 30's, real short, nothing special, keep on grinding out quests and mobs and come back around when you are inside of 2 level of the final boss.
---
Tank when you overlevel dungeons by a couple levels. Even one or two levels makes an incredible difference.
---
Yeah that can be fixed easily though. And in a raid setting hots don't matter in a single target fight
---
I mean, we all had a good laugh in the end. So it was quite a good time tbh. Misery loves company they say. :P
---
also, check the AH for some decent 2H as well. if you have the spare gold, they can be quite good.
---
I got...skiven's ...thing. it's a polearm and it got me through to 60 iirc. 9g for me, so that was nice.
---
Yup, make a macro, set up a script and leave it running. Only way to get it. That’s how I got mine.
---
It’s kinda stupid you have to do it but it is what it is.
---
It’s World of WARcraft. Make war, not peace.
---
Interesting! What class were you?
---
It matters less than p3 but we are well into release that most have finished farming pre raid BiS / levelling trades and can now focus on mounts. I think there is plenty of time without those gold sinks. I like running dungeons, seen a couple drops in DM already that went a long way to an epic mount such as krol blade and epic cloak pattern
---
That compendium costs an insane amount of gold atm. It's definitely not "whatever you can get" It's fine to spend your gold on a good but not best cool-looking epic sword but if gear didn't matter (as you say) why would you spend your hard earned money on it?
---
The effort not even comparable to mirah's song, which is just a dungeon quest reward. It takes hours of efficient gold grinding to get.
---
Also who's saying it's shit? It's the best mitigation weapon right now, doesn't it have its place in tank gearing?
---
The bis lists I checked have it listed as bis.
---
I can't imagine that people would be upset at something be sorted by the unit/$(buyout) of a good.
---
this is great
---
Yeah pugs can be rough.  I find while leveling alts you also come across some nice folks that didn't rush to endgame like us and are usually easygoing types.
---
No, I'm really not. I'm treating it as not a big deal. Someone linking BiS gear, even multiple pieces of BiS gear over time, isn't a big deal. The complainer could have just left his ignore on. Or let a guild officer handle it, instead of trying to police guild chat himself. Now there's unnecessary tension and drama in the guild, because he handled his anger wrong.
---
Monsters will never stop you getting through as long as you can just rez, run some more, rez, run some more.
---
That my friends was the point in the conversation where "molarg" was supposed to say, "oh my bad i confused that". Or "i have contradictory evidence."
---
But he chose shameful silence instead.
---
That fully explains why you're having a horrible time leveling warrior...
---
I have the same feeling so I just walk round flagged all the time. It’s not the same but with a lvl 43 warrior I’m not really keen on rerolling at this point.
---
People do bend over backwards to help the tank, it is why you get to reserve orbs in strat living, but i actualy love to tank and if i lose agro on a mob no big deal, as log as noone dies its not even a problem.
---
I'm an undead warlock.
---
I'm nice. I'll leave you alone or maybe help you kill your mob if you might die.
---
However, if you anger me, **I WILL TEAR YOUR SOUL OUT FROM YOUR BODY AND I WILL MARK YOU SO YOU WILL PERISH WHEN EVER MY EYES SEE YOU AGAIN**.
---
As you can see, I'm a lovely person.
---
BiS for damage dealing.  Fury, either 1h or 2h.  There is a small chance you may prefer later game gear over this if you're past hit cap, but it still has 2% crit and 18 STR, so you'll almost certainly use this the entirety of your DPS career in Classic.
---
I wouldn't recommend for tanking.  You'll probably find better blues more oriented for HP and damage mitigation.
---
PvP-wise, despite no stamina it is a power house you'll probably utilize until phase 3.
---
I swear I have before
---
Now every time you level up, have someone different in your guild whispering him and informing him of your achievement.
---
26 agi versus 60 AP *and* 1% crit.
---
It isn't 10 stam versus 8 AP, it's 10 stam+~0.5% crit versus 8 AP+1% crit.
---
There are +15 and +25 agi enchants (+25 is only for 2-hand weapons), but neither are currently in the game. They'll both be added in later phases.
---
Imagine if there was a Wow 2 with modern graphics.
---
This a no brainer, tyranny every day of the week. Take it from a druid that didn't pick tyranny and regrets it every day since.
---
I mean same kinda... but if someone announcing bis loot really pushes you that far over the edge it’s probably time to book a therapist because you’ve got some real deep seeded issues going on in that noggin. 
---
Just say gratz without attitude or say nothing?
---
Your medal is in the mail
---
There’s no incentive for a DPS warrior to tank. I’m a warrior. I’m not in a big guild, and even if I was, I’m not the raid tank. Why would I want to tank a dungeon? So I can babysit pugs that actively work against me and bitch at me when I roll on the DPS gear that enhances my character in the content I like?
---
I even like tanking but if I can’t be a real (raid) tank, what’s the point?
---
it's really just a mix of wanting to not be stuck in prot spec and the fact that you can not hold aggro for shit with a shield if you are dps spec
---
also it's not like we are in dps gear when we do this shit, we do wear full plate with defense piled on
---
&gt; Warlocks life tapping to around 20% health and then sitting there while everyone else drinks, instead of tapping to 80% mana and eating/drinking
---
this fucking annoys me SO much. i understand tapping during pulls, that's fine. but, if it's after a pull, eat/drink/bandage. 
---
DPS that sit there at 60-70% life after a pull and do nothing also irritate me. i don't immediately heal every spec of damage because it's not necessary. cloth drops so readily that you can afford to bandage yourself while i'm at 5% mana 'cuz the Paladin decided to use Rank 1 Blessing of Wisdom at 44 and refuses to judge justice to prevent mobs from fleeing and pulling more shit when it's obvious our DPS has a problem killing mobs when they run.
---
On leveling dungeons i feel like 2 hander is just superior. Sweeping strikes cleave ww. By doing the most damage you generate the most threat and just make the healers job easier, having to heal 1 target instead of four. And also clear everything faster. Just slap a shield on for bosses if they hit hard
---
&gt;You can farm 200 gold anywhere and in a few hours. 
---
Then the person who "legitimately needs" the 200 gold item can spend a few hours farming it themselves and buy one off the ah.
---
Looks like your troll is on some good lsd
---
I tried it myself in Classic WoW because I didn't want to lose the deposit (it was more than the 5% cut). I used a different character on my same account, and it said you can't buy your own auctions.
---
I wear 4/8 for the AP bonus. However, I’m at 5% hit with OEB. I will say, wearing full plate makes the questing and PvP experience a lot better. Half or better of your pre-raid BIS gear is leather. You’re basically a rogue without any tricks. 
---
My goal is to wear 4 pieces of valor, and be able to itemize the best Crit/Hit/AttackPower I can. I’ve exhausted myself running scholo/ubrs and still never seen helm/chest drop. 
---
I think my ideal set up (non-crafted / bought):
---
Helm: Mask of the Unforgiven (2hit 1crit)
---
Neck: Mark of Fordring (1crit)
---
Shoulders: Valor (1)
---
Chest: Valor (2)
---
Bracers: Armbraces of the Sadist (1hit 1crit)
---
Gloves: Valor (3)
---
Belt: Brigam Girdle (1hit)
---
Pants: Royal Eldritch Armor (1crit)
---
Feet: Valor (4)
---
Rings: Painweaver + Blackstone (1hit 1crit)
---
Trinkets: Guard Captain + Blackhands (1hit 2crit)
---

---
Tens of golds, sure easy - hundreds? Im not there yet
---
Quit
---
Aww thanks. 
---
Apps like Apollo should have a cake splash screen or something to make me better aware of that fact.
---
Yeah, just wasn’t worth dealing with notifications such as yours.
---
It always turns into the good ole boys club.
---
blasted lands has unkillable mobs.  they fight back tho.
---
My mate plays priest and he complains about warlock all the time.  
---
Especially if they life tap to 10-20% mid fight, my friend can't tell if they've got aggro so he heals them back to full. Than he gets aggro for all the healing he throws out and the fight gets more hectic.  
---
His biggest grip is they don't drink or eat and rely on healer to heal them, which than means he has less mana for next fight unless he drinks again.
---
Is it possible for Hunters to solo the DM Key process? Ie killing the Imp in Dm east solo?
---
Don't decide based on what you are doing today. As a druid your role can change over the course of classic, you should pick what will still be BiS at the end Naxx and Tyranny is that item whilst the others will be replaced
---
Womp womp
---
What a great post!
---
Gnomes are literally toelickers that belong in a cat ladies garden... taurens sell their milk to innkeepers, and humans are boring because you’re already a friggin human cmon guys
---
But defense barely does anything in PVP. You want stamina instead.
---
Unless you're a rogue :)
---
kirtonos is 75%H 25%A lol it is not 55/45.
---
It was that way during the first few phases of testing I was in. The Tauren player base was vocal they wanted to ride stuff as well ... so blizzard relented
---
its not actually every 30 seconds, they are exaggerating to make a point 
---
they get mana regen if they don't attack or heal anything for 5 seconds, if your healer at any points starts attacking mobs(other than aoe trash when there is no aoe in grp) you know you have a noob healer
---
Everyone I know who played a Tauren is a short or skinny person IRL.
---
Well yea that's my point. You want different variations of each ability and it's hard to find enough binds for everything. I already have F for mind flay, Shift+F for silence and Ctrl+F for fear, so a simple modification won't do.
---
2H works fine until the 50+ dungeons, then a shield starts to become more necessary, depending on groups.
---
Yeah i mean, i wouldn't react like that to someone but then at the same time maybe there's more to the story. I guess i usual fall on the side of needing more info before judging someone's reaction if it seems disproportionate. Guy still seems like a dick but maybe he has reasons to see his side.
---
So much more shit just goes so smoothly when you have a shield.  Pull too many?  Shield block revenge spam time.    Got a caster?  Shield  bash that heal off em.
---
THIS jesus nobody believes me when i say that
---
Roll an alt or go outside.
---
Instead of looking for an exploit, why not just go kill shit?
---
One or the other drops every kill
---
Too many things to list that trickled in over the years.  And Activision.
---
"Links" section. Yep that is definitely early 2000s internet.
---
You gotta set a new goal.
---
I personally enjoy leveling. So I'm doing alts as a goal.
---
Maybe you can maximally prepare yourself for pvp? There's like 30 weird items you need to be fully set up
---
Lol what a shitty perspective. Here's an idea, let's just do separate layers for alliance and horde. I'd hate to be a lil bitch like you afraid 24-7.
---
Same, I was actually bummed that people weren't saying it as we leveled up. If we were in a group with them and saw it we would always congratulate though.
---
I always take all orbs because i don't need anything in strat Eca. I can make good money like that.
---
I was playing LBRS with a warlock who would tap until almost dead and not try to get his health up. It was pretty early in the dungeon, so I thought he'd just drain or something, no biggie. He then got aggro while still at low health, and his response was to life tap, which got him one shot by the mob. He didn't specifically whine at me right then and there but he also fell down from a ledge and died, and got boss aggro and died then complained about the amount of deaths he had. And I was the problem. Clearly.
---
Being cocky and having a group of mobs neatly fold up your armor with you still inside it...  ain't the healers fault.
---
What about a healing druid?
---
&gt; A dungeon isn’t fun once you got everything you want from there and you’ve done it 20+ times. Tanking is not fun. Most of the time it just feels like babysitting and that you’re fighting DPS for threat. DPS will roll their face on the keyboard, take a dump on the ground and you’re basically there cleaning up the mess as fast as you can before they make another one. 
---
I want to just bring attention to this part. Because every single time I say this.. **every single time**.. I have a bunch of "yeah but..." responses from DPS about how they shouldn't have to wait, how the tank should be able to get aggro, how the instance needs to be *efficient*.
---
The difference between a tank having a really positive and fun time in an instance is **literally the 3 seconds you will not wait**. Those few seconds let the tank grab strong aggro, generate tons of rage, smash the crap out of adds with threat generating abilities and **enjoy themselves**. When you refuse because "lol it will be fine" or "learn to tank" or "I don't want to wait fuck you", the tank is not doing that. They are running around cleaning up after you like children and that is absolutely **not** fun.
---
When I tank on my druid I like to make big pulls. I HoT myself up, smack whatevers in front of me with a spell, go bear, enrage, charge, start messing things up. When I get to do it it's *really* fun. When I have a pally in group with me it's *amazing fun*. When I immediately have to run off and try to pull all the mobs off the mage or hunter who pulled before I got a chance, it's not.
---
So guess what I do now? I tank for guildies and friends, we have a great time (all of us) and we knock out the instances in crazy fast times. It's not hard. And people who refuse to let tanks actually enjoy the game rather than play cleanup for them are left spamming LFG for tanks all day instead of actually playing the game.
---
That's a pretty heaping waste of time!
---
It is indeed elvui, although not set up at all on this char cause it's my bank ait:)
---
Such is life.
---
No need to get upset over one person not liking your post.

Alternatively, you could have just blocked me or ignored me.

---
Kill enemies
---
Impale is not worth it right now, Fury prot is a joke as a MT, good in offtank
---
Help guild members. Open world pvp. Compete in dungeon speed runs. Get all pre-raid consumables. Get twink items ready for a character you might twink on. Gurabashi arena. Not use skinning on a rogue especially with engi? Work on your new second profession because somehow you still have skinning. Mooncloth level 35 alts for passive gold income. 1v1 dueling in front of your major city. Getting all the engi trinkets needed for dueling. Collecting pets. Gaining reputations. And the list goes on and on.
---
Right, and what I'm saying is that everyone in the group SHOULD agree that the person who needs the item should get it.  This "rolling on it because it's worth money" business is a bunch of crap.
---
As a hunter, your response to any accusation of ninja is "Hunter item"
---
People will get upset, they will cry, but they will move on.
---
It has been this way since vanilla.
---
Kui
---
preach brotha. Think all of us tanks are feeling the same way. i barely run with anyone outside guildies anymore just so it doesnt create the oppurtunity for a headache
---
Congrats! You won!
---
It is and it isn't. Really depends on the drop rate. If it's a guaranteed drop it takes longer. If not, then it speeds up as players finish up what they need for the quest and the quest loot goes FFA after the player loots the mob first.
---
When it works it works really good and when it doesn't it works really bad.
---
You...you can just walk up to it.

Why would a t6 guild accept someome who just barely managed to attune for the raid. And why would you not stay in the guild that managed to clear the raid before and then progress with them through the next raid. 
---
I mean progressing with your guild is the best part of the game.
---
I have strikers. It is best weapon until rhok, regardless of what some say
---
I am still way off from doing that. but when i do i will for sure be doing it again with alts
---
Its not a false narrative, that was the generally accepted loot rules on Dragonblight back in the day. I never was a part of a group that ran anything but.
---
Sometimes it truly is 30 seconds and I address these cases. 
---
Hitting with staff is sometimes better than only being instant bread after every combat encounter. 
---
E.g druid healer can go into catform before combat and hit a little without losing mana regen. 
---
Or a healer can use 1 or 2 damage spells right before or after healing impacting their mana regen minimally. 
---
Your "healers only heal" purism is not applicable to the real world and will not always lead to the best outcome "fastest dungeon progression".
---
Edit: instant downvote? If anything that is just *RidiculoslyPredictable*.

It's a default message everyone gets when they try to run a custom script. It's there to warn you, because some scripts can straight up delete all your items, trade your gold to someone else, yadda yadda.
---
I had lag spikes after I upgraded from standard broadband to fibre; managed to fix it by going into the settings for the router and updating it.
---
Haha :) I don't want the post to be about me, like I'm talking about Classic being too easy in order to boost myself. There are people much more successful and accomplished in Classic than me. I think what I should have added is that Classic is a game of knowledge and time more than execution.
---
If you know what to do and you put a lot of time into it and you are competent or above average at games in general, then you never hit a roadblock of "I'm not good enough at the game to do what I'm trying to do."
---
I used to be a progamer and I've played a lot of games on the side apart from the game I played professionally and I've always been relatively high rank. Most online multiplayer games are about improving yourself, getting better at playing the game. You know what to do but it takes time to develop the ability to do it. RPG's can be about that too but the RPG element always forces some extent of improving your character, not yourself. And not by doing difficult things, but by doing easy things repeatedly which can take a lot of time. So it's something I thought an MMORPG newb would want to know about. It's a very different kind of game than most other multiplayer games, especially since it comes from a different era.
---
As a mage, this is absolutely true.
---
But it's still a lot more fun to group with people and chat/talk shit rather than just mindlessly slaughter the new few dozen monsters.
---
Play a warrior and usually love tanking. But having shit DPS just means more stress for you. I've also been a dick a few times to try to prove my point... if people are constantly grabbing agro off me and I have warned them twice, I'll let them have a time with the next mob they agro (unless it's the healer). My second main is a healer and have usually found most tanks are... more responsible than other members in the group. They are people that are comfortable with leadership and taking that role.  The experienced tanks usually stand out a lot more and are a godsend when you have them in a group... everything just goes so much smoother. So to all the meatshields I say... Tank you, Tank you very much!
---
This is awesome
---
It took people a few more months to get to that point originally. But here are some ideas:
---
1. Raid log
---
2. Help guildies 
---
3. World pvp
---
4. Grief people
---
and it’s WC. shit gets replaced fast
---
AT that level you have one job. To take the initial burst of the pull and swing on the mobs JUST enough to keep things off the healer. You're the Mob waiting room that entertains an enemy or two till the dps come to kill it.
---
In about 50~ MC raids I've always seen at least one leaf or one eye drop.
---
I have heard of neither dropping, but that's purely anecdotal so take that with a grain of salt.
---
Kaiden?
---
All I can say is that it varies wildly and in general only people who are focused on leveling really care. 
---
my mage is lvl 58, 12 days /played, but I had no clue how to do anything at all when I started, have leveled several professions, have about 1/3 of my BiS now, and have regularly stopped to help RL friends.
---
I think the record for a mage is 3.5 days /played on the other end of the spectrum
---
lol i played PVP servers back in vanilla, and even in classic, They are trash just like the players on them :)
---
Nice grab on that name
---
You know what grinds my gears? Those fucking warriors that try dps and only end up doing 3k dmg in an exchange, while I’m busting out 10k as a mage. Then they have to balls to say “I can try tank” fuck you best believe you’re gonna tank, my 44 warrior in ulda. It’s not that hard to carry a shield and one hander ffs if u wanna dps be a rogue.

---
I hear people say:
---
*"200g is an upgrade for everyone, so why do you feel entitled to someone else's upgrades?"*
---
**But** as this is technically true for every single soul bound item you can sell your argument is fundamentally flawed as you argue for "always roll need" now.
---
You yourself admit the argument is more subtle, making your argument relatively irrelevant. 
---
The basis for "soulbound user rolls need is" he profits from this item more than the others do."
---
While this is technically true, the difference here originates in even the item winner having to evaluate to equip or sell as the gold might be more relevant to them right now. Which would make their situation identical to all other rollers if they decide on that path which erases the clear advantage. 
---
So the only exception I can think of for "all rolled need" is that the person who rolls need on their own having to instantly equip the item to proof them actually rolling for the upgrade and valuing it **more** than the gold. (Which is the core argument for a need roll anyways)
---
This obviously only works with a system of "trust"/" "social consequences."
---
Once the item in question is so valuable that no functioning social structure could balance it out this system falls apart and needs to be replaced with "need only"
---
**But the only true solution would be:**
---
If you roll greed on Boe it stays Boe.
---
If you roll need on Boe it becomes soulbound. 
---
Blizzard go fix this. 
---
So we can all be honest and all roll greed together, as even a one-fifth chance for the jackpot and a functioning social structure is sometimes better than a small upgrade and no chance for the money.
---
The memes though
---
Questing is your friend :)
---
I've hit 666 frostbolt. 420 CoC as well
---
Hunter is much more action packed than rogue lol, especially in questing. Chainpulling 10-12 mobs (sometimes at the same time) without worrying about taking pauses to drink or eat is the definition of action.
---
Hunter is THE class for making questing enjoyable. If you dont like questing for hunter you absolutely wont like it for rogue.
---
Just because your experience was different doesn't make everyone else's experience a false narrative.  I'm ok with anything as long as the rule is explicitly stated, however my vanilla experience was that people greeded, only needed if using and were expected to immediately equip. 
---
It worked 90% of the time, and ninjas were absolutely ostracised.
---
Uhhh...
---
It's probably obnoxious to say this... but.
---
Welcome to classic...
---
Did you expect to get the loot that easily? You cry about hours of attuning for Ony. Dude, that's just how it is.
---
Pug raids
---
One of a number of things from retail that I hope they implement in Classic would be the AH interface where you put in a number of whatever you want to buy and a maximum price that you're willing to pay. All of these ores and herbs and cloth and shit being sold in single pieces annoys me to no end.
---
So everyone needs to be just think like you? In case you didn't know, a ton of people all agree that rolling need is the right way to go. After getting something very expensive ninja'd from a group I'm perfectly content with everyone rolling need.
---
I won something nice and used it to buy 2 BIS items. I've lost an epic I would have used for PvP. You know what I thought? Man that sucks, but if I really want it I'll farm gold and buy it. I'm not entitled to anything like that, that drops in a group.
---
[I think you mean exposure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGJ_Dx6gjrs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=82)
---
I accept it as part of the game though. I dont have to find my preraid BiS. A good enough is already good enough. My guild can clear MC. If I have a better item in MC, I can just wait for that one instead of the item with 5% droprate in some dungeon that takes ages for a minimal bonus compared to item in another dungeon with 46% droprate.
---
Buzzword
---
I don't. I Greed unless it is an item I need, then I Need (obviously). Just seems like proper etiquette. As a level 40+ warrior tank, I only care about plate armor and shields with +str and +sta and 1-handed weapons like axes, swords and maces.
---
I dont really have to care about DPS, but if my dps is too low it messes up the aggro retain.
---
Well some people, myself included, just like having as many crafting recipes as they can. I always buy random vendor recipes wherever possible, even when it's some low level item i'll probably never make. I think that's especially true for cooking, where a much larger proportion of recipes come from sources other than a trainer.
---
I can't speak for the guy that dropped 15k on the recipe, but most likely he wanted it for a cooking achievement. The recipe once again became available a few months later (via cooking trainers), but nobody could've known that at the time.
---
There are better dps trinkets for ferals though. Tyranny remains bis foreva.
---
You seem to be leaving info out on purpose
---
I’m using zygor and haven’t been too happy with it 50+. I feel like I’m all over the place and sometimes I’ll get sent to get a quest in another zone and there is no quest. 
---
The in game arrow is nice but I’m not sure the xp/hr is the best. 
---
I’m level 55. Probably going to just run instances to 60 from here on out.
---
Sorry but these people that needed on it spend all day online, if they don't have enough gold one month after being 60 for their epic mount they really have shitty priorities. Especially considering it was two mages and a priest. I made enough gold within a couple of weeks for my epic mount from various dungeons/blues I would win with greed rolls. It's an absolute load of shit to sit here and say "WELL ITS THEIR MOUNT GOLD" when it actually progresses someone further than an epic mount which can also really be farmed efficiently at any time.  
---
Sorry for being a bit entitled when every group I join as a tank instantly AoEs and does shit to stop me from actually doing my job before I even get a chance to do it, then they blame me for not being able to hold aggro after being told to allow me to get threat, etc.   
---
But whatever, agree to disagree.
---
It makes it easier. I have friends in other guilds, but it is just so much better with your guild.
---
Since when is it my responsibility to tell people what to do?
---
Absolutely you want them wearing that 2 hander. It's the only way they're gonna be holding those enemies for the most part.
---
Old player just saving for replies.
---
Yup, it's basically trash after a few clears.  People bring in their alts to get it.
---
As a fellow feral tank you should re roll if you don't want to accept that there is virtually nothing for us in phase 1 + DM content. If you accept that and want to raid then you either pug and roll the dice on the quality of players you get or find another raiding guild.
---
What
---
Edit: I is dumb
---
Sure it's a great finisher, but you can only have 1 slow on a mob at a time and getting in CoC range just opens you up to being hit more if you don't know what you are doing yet. 
---
Like when mages coc, run, and start frostbolting and don't reallize that the mob is going to have time to close on them, or someone frost novas and then uses coc and breaks some enemies out of the ice
---
Man, 49 and still haven’t even seen a blue BoE drop from a mob let alone an epic.
---
Good friend.
---
no and it’s nbd imo
---
its having trouble on mobile
---
Tanking is low key a management job. Lots of responsibility, but you have an equal amount of power/influence, and when used correctly you can make the experience what you want it to be. 
---
Like any other management job, you spend 80%+ of your time dealing with corralling and accommodating the neglectful/irresponsible members of the team. You can coach them so they realize how they are impacting the group, I do this with egregious PUGs and majority of the time get favorable responses, but if they continue to drag the group down or make things significantly more difficult after you try to help them, then you can (as I have) eject them.
---
Choose your group members wisely, be patient and coach those who are receptive, and remove those who are not and detract from the team. Don't be a tyrant, but don't take peoples shit or neglect if it is ruining you and other the other group member's experience. 
---
Hope you get back into the tanking game soon! :)
---
Because reddit is stupid.
---
[Last week someone posted a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL5_IM36NY4)
---
Yes whelps in sos drop greens
---
get a full time job
---
Well i usually just remove the bad apples and enjoy the rest. 
---
And if you juice a few bad apples in a big bunch you won't really notice it. I mean there are even bugs in there.
---
Doesn’t take a degree to answer that one. You use spells so spell crit -.-
---
Most people don't.  The ones that do are basically ninjas that rely on people to hit greed, thus increasing their odds of winning shit.
---
IMO, if you use it, no. Those stats are fair for both classes. Suggesting a better staff was a nice move too. NTN.
---
Don’t you mean boar?
---
I. Don’t. Like. This. Place.
---
If it was a priest then that’s potentially 10spirit difference with spirit tap.  Either way though there are better weapons for hunters
---
Hahahahaha, so you just want to see DDODGE DODGE DODGE DODGE PARRY DODGE instead and STILL get a resist taunt? ;)
---
A pet that follows you around. Enjoy the pet, save it to auction it for more later or try to auction it now but apparently theres more of a supply than a demand for now.
---
Melee or hunter?
---
The faction balance is closer to 65/35 or 70/30 Alliance but Heartseeker has been awesome. Transferred there from Skeram when I was level 30 for 3 days because I was tired of dungeon spamming but Horde won't let anyone play out in the world.
---
People get so butt hurt over boe’s. If it’s an upgrade I’m needing regardless. As I feel everyone should do.
---
Free action pots
---
Haha. All true statements. I have hit 60 since this post and am still playing the rogue. I think at the time I was having a tough time getting  groups and wanted the ability to tank or heal.
---
That was awesome.
---
No chance a tank joins that group.  Tanks have unlimited choice of groups.
---
I was very confused as to why this was a big deal until I realized that this was classic and not retail.
---
So long as you have enough points in disc to get silent resolve, the healing aggro is real in Classic... it shouldn't matter at 40ish. You know how to flash heal? Bubble and great heal? Know how to and what to dispell? Yes? Then You're fucking set for pre 55. Only a garbage tank at that level will need that extra oomph in their heals.
---
Actually... what in Holy is even that nessesary? All I can think of is quicker greater heals and spiritual guidance to turn that spirit into healpower.
---
No.
---
Right!? I bought (I think it was BFA) because I wanted to be a dark iron dwarf. Once I saw that I needed to rep grind? No thanks.
---

You can dual weild at 20.
---
My aunt and uncle have put off rejoining their favorite game ever but when they do, we'll all 3 be playing on Westfall most likely. I'm currently a 41 Alliance Mage on Heartseeker (PvP) though.
---
on my server, someone was posting for like 4 hours, "looking for 2 mages LBRS speed clear, legs and gloves reserved"
---
Host pugs, sell the legendary and pattern reserves. Get geared and rich.
---
 Really?  I guess I am the ninja then.
---
What do the orbs do?
---
It's 50/50 from the chest.
---
For whatever reason, it's being displayed on wowhead as also dropping from Majordomo, despite you never being able to loot him since you don't even kill him in his encounter.
---
Don't look at the "dropped by" tab, but rather the "contained in" tab for these items, since they're in the Cache of the Firelord, the chest that's left behind after you beat Domo.
---
lol drama from people wanting gear??? how can there by drama by rolling 1-100. go outside if you are that upset over losing a roll
---
Can also just have enough people to start the fight while the rest remain outside the room.  Then everyone exits except the tank who stands inside the door (mostly out).  The adds will try to agro the healer and the boss will be tank n spank through the door.  Not sure if that is considered terrain abuse though so.....
---
Yeah very first time playing, brother in law got me into it to try alliance on a server but quit because there’s more alliance than horde apparently. Little do I know the mofo has been a horde scum bag his whole wow career (no hate just satire lol) I’m having a blast going through the dungeons first time and doing quests by myself. Learning what to watch for and becoming “wow smart” (street smart hehehe) is very interesting. Running into the douche bags that try smear my name in world chat is frustrating to say the least and I don’t hold back into saying truly awful stuff in pms to them till they ignore but that’s show biz baby.  All in all I’m having a good time and feel really blessed I can explore this game with eyes of a wow virgin.  Btw I know horde is the best for pvp. But I’ll die on gnome mage mountain. Alliance for us dweebs. Less than 3 
---
To live and let learn.
---
Pretty much every priest lvls with spirit tap
---
3% chance? Bullshit, it has dropped in at least half of the tribute runs I have done. You sure the stats arent messed up due to failed tribute runs?
---
I’ve tanked every boss in MC except rag so far. We’re totally viable. If they had ever made feral tier gear ide be a monster but I’m stuck in lvl 58 blues while everyone else gets gear that blows mine away.
---
People keep saying this but I must be missing something. 
---
 I do a lot of runs with my guild tank who sword+boards, along with mage/shadow priest/random dps, and I never even glance at threat meters or dps aggro. Just keep the tank up and smooth sailing. 
---
However, I can count two times this weekend alone that a tank with 2-hander has had mobs running absolutely wild. 
---
/shrugs

Lmao WC drama. Ur Allright, ur using it and it's not crazy that u rolled for it.

That isn't irony.  Tanks res loot because we are the most in demand role and can get away with it.  I have no reason to run live strat at all, if you want me to tank that for you I am resing first orb, you don't like it, fine, I didn't want to be in there in the first place.  
---
That is called free market economics.  You want to entice strangers to do something for you that benefits them in no way, you have to add an incentive.
---
The troll clearly had too much bruise weed
---
Just Stalagg things.
---
My server also did evolve to need on BOEs. Gilneas. It’s to make sure everyone gets a fair shake at it instead of the asses who wait till the last second to need and drop group.
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com is about as close as it gets so far.
---
Lmfao there's no way bro. No one is that beta.
---
I guess I am a piece of shit ninja.
---
It has the Blizz symbol before the name... “looks fine to me”
---
If only wow has a Ricardo.
---
Blizz icon I would think it is.
---
So I have to pull an asmond and ninja all the gear I want and tell my group they suck. I see
---
If we can kill children but not frick them, then what kind of society are we living in?!?
---
if they don't wanna EVER heal in classic, yes?
---
healing leveling content in an offspec is extremely trivial. if you want to be this dramatic and inflexible about it you should absolutely be a pure dps class.
---
How did the rest of the conversation go?
---
Yeah exactly. As a warrior I get quadruple my dps doing aoe with whirlwind and it just seems brainless to me to sacrifice that additional speed in a run that’s already 1.5 hours because the tank is an aggro whore.
---
Exactly, none of this matter, all these items will be replaced in 2-3 hours play time, it's a waste to even argue
---
Win 1-2 orbs in strat or do like 10 normal dungeons and you will have the gold for it. Or are you leveling by farming dragons?
---
As others stated prior data showed we were 50/50 however with releasing that data they immediately changed the balance.
---
5 second rule only applies to spells. You can wand all you want while regening mana.
---
Yes to both. I started feeling the lack of holy talents after LBRS . It is still doable, but be prepared with consumables for oh-shit situations.
---
no, retail has personal loot so thats impossible anyways.this is probably from pservers
---
Wanding doesn't reset 5 second rule.
---
You can right click report a character when the name is mentioned in this blocked chat channel invite message
---
What the game became was the run through dungeons. No one had to worry about aggro or mana or their healer or CC etc. Classic yep needs these tools again. Players who never had to probably dont know. I dont know if new players are being taught. I dont play much anymore so cant say. But dont think id be wanting to do anything but dps.
---
Or too many priests when most of the other healing classes are stacked with lava dredgers for fire resist.
---
They accused me of buying gold and banned me from the game
---
Yeah we got screwed
---
Now you know how alliance feels on most servers
---
Sounds to me you're just trash at the game. Imagine not being able to hold your own and cowering in fear without your Zerg. Lmao. I've always played pvp servers and never once experienced being too afraid to continue playing or anything inhibiting my ability to reach 60. go figure.
---
They are used for max level enchants and crafted gear!
---
Mate have you read my comment? It's not about getting an epic mount, that was a side note.
---
I made a point about boes you completely ignored and then you just went on a rant...
---
The boe is as attainable as an epic mount, you know what boe means right? You can farm the gold efficiently at any time and then just buy one.
---
Is it true that 2H is better for PvP? If so, why?
---
Well, did you?
---
What is CoD ?
---
What were you doing? They might have been checking if you were botting. When you whisper bots they have very generic and repetitive responses. Or don’t respond at all.
---
Really??
---
Ask your wife’s boyfriend for a computer for Christmas
---
People will tell you not to level engineering until 60, using grenades in world pvp is really funny though and you can get really dank trinkets. Having a gnomish net projector on a hunter is sweet
---
They hit like trucks from what I remembered--but I guess they don't now...
---
Greater water breathing potions and detect undead potions
---
I would say it is a real gm then
---
Man... What level water you got?
---
What is CoD?
---
lol. 
---
nuh im good, im waiting for the pure PVP experience in battlegrounds :) thats the only way to pvp
---
Well, thanks for saying this!
---
Still, this isn't about the amount of damage I do, but rather, what I bring to a party. But to stay on thread, I meant to say that my focus will often go out the window once everything turns into an aoe.
---
Cash on delivery
---
I send you an item in the mail and set the CoD (cash on delivery) price to 1g.  You have to send 1g in order to put that item in your inventory.
---
Yeah, of course use both, but when you have 15 rage from your white hit + charge, I highly recommend using revenge before sunder.  It causes way more threat.  When it's on cooldown, definitely use sunder, or save some rage for the next combo if you are getting miss, miss, parry'd.
---
lol.
---
you mad boi? lol
---
it's ok, you don't need to get your panties in a twist coz ur mad and bad.....lol
---
I think you might need to get better at the game lol.
---
Maybe let your mum play coz she is the true PVP Goddess
---
forsenCD change wife
---
Yeah, it's wild. It's a multi-phase fight involving different parts of a robot with insane fire mechanics, and at the end, the entire robot assembles and you have to deal with all the mechanics together. The thing I liked most about it was how dynamic it is. It was all about individual player awareness, constant and accurate target swapping, grouping up and spreading out *over and over,* perfectly coordinated.
---
There is just so much to remember and so much individual-player responsibility. You can't get carried through it. Everyone has to deliver perfectly.
---
The whole idea of “reserving” items in dungeons when looking for groups is ridiculous to me.  If you want to guarantee win the loot that drops, you need to have friends or guildies agree to help.  You can’t just “reserve” an item and then try to look for randoms that are more than likely trying to get the same thing lol
---
Cash on Delivery. The system you use to sell things through the mail. Sends the item, and the person can't take it out of the mail without sending the gold. 
---
This person meant to use CoD but instead just mailed the CoD amount to the buyer along with the cloth.
---
Samesies, loved every second.
---
I think you should reroll fury and switch your brain off, youll be much happier.
---
Tanks who like tanking enjoy the responsibility, the “leader” role. Doesnt have to be everyone’s cup of tea.
---
Back in the day in retail wotlk some dude had a wool cloth mafia going on on my server(Sargeras-US), bought out all the competition and relisted at like 30g a stack, and one of my buddies decided to capitalize on it, farmed cloth for hours in the barrens, and listed several stacks at like 16g73s, and then a few individual cloths at 1673g. He actually sold two of them. People definitely don't pay attention.
---
yea i did arena anger with banthok reserved and we had pally healers pretty willing to come
---
Used Classicwow.live’s guide to level up my Alliance Rogue. It was awesome. Minimal grinding and I was always one or two levels ahead of the guide without any effort. Not a great leveling speed but you will complete almost all zones before 60.
---
Now I’m using Zygor for my Priest and I like it a lot. No need to alt tab and waste time looking for cords. Works amazingly with Classic Codex.
---
In the end, it’s up to you. There’s not a single “best” guide yet. Some people say it’s Joana’s, others Judgement’s, but I liked what I used.
---
Didn’t like Azeroth Auto Pilot nor WoWPro’s because they kept bugging a lot in game.
---
Ok i agree, reading the first message of the post felt like you were telling people to stop using sunder
---
Its not a just warrior thing either, I have lost count the amount of times ive had to have the no PW:S unless you think im about to die, and if you cast renew on me or anyone else while i pull .... its going to make my life really fucking hard
---
I understand, have had similar thought on it but at 60 getting a group as a rogue isn't that hard to do, but your competition for the best items is the probem---but what class DOESN'T face that?
---
I always considered the patterns a little different. They're a relatively common drop from only one source and aren't worth a lot of money in the same way some BoE epics are. You can't exactly steal one to make a fortune if you aren't going to use it. Yet, farming a dungeon for the pattern and losing it to a warrior is, I would imagine, frustrating.
---
What healing text addon is that
---
Ok cool. Thank you
---
God I love this song..
---
Fixed the original post.  Thanks for the input.
---
Class and level? Get into groups it's a lot of fun.
---
underrated comment
---
I was in a decent group In St as a tank... A purple boe shield Dropped and I immediately told everyone I needed it because it was a huge upgrade to my shield and that I'd equip it straight away, needless to say they all passed and let me have it! I think If you find a good group of people and state early it's a huge upgrade they generally don't mind!, it also helped us clear the last boss who was Red to me! 👍😊
---
yeah running ZF at 44 vs 46 was a completely different experience
---
I read something that said youshould only have 2/3 points in imp blizz because coc doesn't apply slow on top of 3/3 blizz, whereas with 2/3 imp blizz the coc still applies. Is that true/ thoughts?
---
What cloak should I wear for MC/Ony? I am a 60 rogue and I have a cloak that gives me 12 agi and then I have another cloak that gives me flat 20 fire resist. What's better?
---
Both of those are definitely a big advantage.  Also bombs.
---
Is it not common to ask before needing anything in a grp that’s the way all my friends do it and the way most PUGs I’ve ran with have done it
---
You might be able to be honest about your situation with people. Maybe approach some guild leaders and say that you don't want to ditch your friends, but you aren't able to switch your schedule. You could be honest that you want the best tank gear, but would love anyone who'd be willing to help you out. There are nice people out there. 
---
Or like me, I'm not experienced with PvP so I'd appreciate doing my best in a raid with someone who's willing to teach me BECAUSE I'm giving up on all the best loot. 
---
If I had a level 60 on your server, I'd help. I know you were just venting, and I'm sorry you're stuck in this situation. I hope everything works out for you. :) 
---
PS. I would move my tank to a guild that supported the exciting part of the game I was missing out on and then make an alt to play and level in the guild with my friends so you don't miss them AND don't miss out on what you've worked really hard for. 
---
Oops. Got on my soapbox again. Peace- good luck :)
---
And yet retail contains many elements of things the community has requested.
---
Being a developer is a fine line between listening and ignoring your player's requests. Sort of like parenting, and it's easy as hell to go too heavy to one side or the other. But it's clear that blizzard has at least some idea of what their community has been asking for over time.
---
I’ll make a bitch out of you just yet. Right after I become your dad and sell all your stuff and make you gold farm for 20 hrs a day to learn your lesson for being a fat gay retard and a disgrace to your family. Poor mom probably made you feel so smart for having an iq below 7. You need a real man in your life to show you the way.
---
Lol what? You're over there saying there's no point to pvp servers despite the fact that the whole point of the game is there are two warring factions. Imagine being so afraid of someone killing you that you remove yourself from the instances where tons of players get together and raid your capital city. It's actually hilarious that there are people like you that would suggest these player created world events don't add any substance to a game. It's also pretty sad. Get better at a game? I'm not hiding in a bubble because people killed me a few times.
---
There's tons, also they're the ones in the area that are later in your lvling for the zone. I'm 44 and I still have like 10 to do from booty bay.
---
It shows on your default character sheet. Mouse over your weapon damage.
---
it stands to reason that if retail has personal loot, those coming from retail want to guarantee if their wanted item drops and it's only for them.. you know, personally.
---
I generally dont tap lower than 50% and if a healer is still trying to top me off I tell them to disregard me unless I get lower than 50%
---
Some people are greedy assholes, fuck um. 4g is nothing and certainly not worth getting your knickers in a twist over.
---
Who the fuck would pay 1000g for that!?
---
The N or G system is perfect. Actually it was invented by players. You play mmo not for gold, but for the people who surround you in the game. You should let people be unfair if they want to. It's part of the game, so you can know who can be your friend and who should be ashamed and ignored or educated.
---
If you do not understand this, then you should play the modern version of the game. A good community requires effort from the players themselves. Blizzard should not interfere in this process.
---
Someone posted a spread for all the race class combos, and troll rogues were far and away the rarest
---
Waiting caverns is even better, esp if you have skinning + herb, due to perfect deviate scales.
---
Lv69 water? He needed 21 stacks.
---

Hugo would.
---
Honestly based on that description, every single redditor would roll Night Elf
---
Why does she have fuck me eyes. I’m so uncomfortable
---
Silk bags only sell for 30-40s on my server.
---
Downvoting b/c not in English
---
Raptor Strike crits. For the brief window of time you end up in melee, make it hurt as much as possible.
---
It's tough when you run into a situation where someone instantly greed rolls on something you just expect everyone to need on. But it's a BoE. That means that if people greed roll and shouldn't have... you can just have a re-roll and trade it to the right person.
---
If someone refuses the second option there, bam they're a ninja.
---
ehh, maybe. I know reserving loot is a big thing on private servers however so it would make more sense. in my opinion the retail mentality is more about rushing shit or stuff like not letting the tank get aggro, etc.
---
Ikr hahaha, he probably waited just as long for his prize of attack
---
Quel'Serrar does not require deep breath, but rather the Phase 3 normal breath when she is on the ground.
---
This is what should happen, but I find it almost never happens.   There's no pressure put on the winner to let the people that got screwed to roll.  I see it all the time too.   I'd say 25% of people get screwed, because of the "fuck you, I need gold" system.
---
Server dependant I suppose, but I know tanks generally reserve the first orb on Strath live runs in exchange for tanking.
---
Well you deserved the ban if you bought gold. Good waste of time.
---
I used to feel the same way but any decent warlock will just lifesteal their own health.
---
Healers who understand the warlock class shouldnt even worry about healing them. I have a bunch of warlock friends who reiterate that they dont want heals when they lifetap. Its a waste of mana.
---
As a rogue who has had thousands of duels against the very best of mages in WOTLK (the same applies to classic i reckon) you’re at a disadvantage from the beginning. It’s basically his cooldowns vs yours, and you have to play and experiment to figure out how to come out ahead - and if you’re both good the mage will still win majority of duels.
---
I've been trying to sell one for 50g last few days. It doesn't sell.
---
Don’t pick a paladin, I’ve been working on mine since launch and it’s level 52. I get whispers all the time about healing but the issue with the class is you’re quite literally unable to kill anything in less than 60 seconds unless you’re full ret, and ret paladins don’t get invited to dungeons. I’ve pretty much told every paladin lower level than me to level something else if they want to dps. I don’t think blizzard could have spent less time on the spec, it’s fucking egregiously boring.
---
No it's a doggie dog world are you deaf?
---
If you use it I would say it's fine. If you needed for selling then no.
---
The usual on here seems to be people saying to need it for the ah i thought? 
---
Personally I usually ask, that's how we always handled it back in the day.
---
TLDR these posts
---
He does have a point though, and it was the same back in the days of Vanilla: if your class is able to heal/tank (but especially heal) expect to be asked to heal/tank fairly often regardless of spec and what you would rather do.
---
So can i just put my guy on follow then?
---
OK maybe dominoes is the same, I haven't played with it much.
---
for  what its worth, i liked zygor. but you have to pay for it. id rather not pay. guidelime sucked and aap stopped at 40. i might try classicwow.live next but its also nice to have an ingame addon
---
Lol
---
Ah, u done with the game, game over, better quit
---
Are you telling me, that the reason it doesn't work, is because it used to work?
---
Dunno, everyone here on other threads says need for the ah? I have not had anything drop yet in classic like that, in vanilla we'd usually just discuss or if one persons already greeded everyone would greed.
---
That’s a little bit of an overstatement. Any item with over 5 of any stat is kind of a big deal at that level. 12 spirt? That’s a lot, def a hunter item.
---
You still doing this?
---
Bfa bad
---
When you open the mailbox, the option will be to the right of the spaces for you to type gold amounts in. Default is set to 'send money', and there is another button for CoD.
---
People love to be spoonfed. Even though googling a guide is already spoonfeeding you, this is like going even *further*.
---
Yeah if i had a group where 1 guy rolled greed then everyone else needed and i won I'd let him reroll vs me.
---
Funny that's exactly what happened to me yesterday. 
---
Saw a Dwarf Hunter 6 levels higher than me running from mobs while I was busy with a mob. Once I finished off my mob he immediately came back and ganked me. He then did /spit on me.
---
I soulstoned once he left but of course he followed me and killed me again. Fuck Dwarves.
---
Druids. There is like 1-2 a raid. Lol.
---
Neither, let the feral druid use rip!
---
playing natures grace with 12% crit from gear and 13% crit from world buffs is pretty fun and you can finally compete with those flash of light/flash heals. but id still go with tyranny
---
I swear Rogues always go out of their way to attack the target you specifically DIDNT mark
---
I wasn't asked to heal, I was told I would be healing after advertising as DPS and being invited to a group under the notion I was being invited to DPS.
---
There's a stark difference, alas, you seem to be in the same category of failing at reading comprehension. So I will just stop replying here.
---
Retail wow bad!!!!!!!!
---
How is 12 spirit fair for both classes?
---
Lately all of my groups at lvl 60 everybody is so nice and I try to always get different classes so nobody is fighting for loot. So if an item for mage drops a mage gets it and vice versa. All greed on any other boe and shit
---
I don’t have eyes.
---
i'm sure it was a big help as you slept through 85% of the fight.
---
Minimum wage, minimum effort!
---
Trolls are stoners

Orcs are people with self esteem issues

Undead are selfish
---
Tauren want to be Alliance but don't want to be a pussy
---
Dwarves are smartest, best, and most generous players in the game
---
Humans are no-lifers with 15 ALTs
---
Gnomes are internet bullies
---
I play an dwarf rogue
---
Despite having the gear from a dungeon yet or not, dungeons aren’t fun let’s get that straight. 
---
90% of tanks don’t know the dungeons they run and mindlessly pull mobs as they progress through. 
---
The same 90% have no idea how to mark mobs. 
---
You say you that some dps have no idea of aggro or don’t care for it, which leads you think you are babysitting 4 party members. Not every fight u need aggro. Sometimes damage is quicker. This guy probably pulls 2 mobs at a time and complains about aggro being taken. 
---
We would love for you to play on your Druid
---
Searing gorge just because I know no one else would pick that. I could mine all day.
---
No it isn't, but the question was strange. It's not faction specific power shifting.
---
Basically if you are playing as feral dps, you need to power shift for the energy it provides, it's a massive increase in dps.
---
God forbid you actually use an item for its intended purpose. Why would you greed it? So you can go buy it off ah? What did they think the person who bought it off ah was going to do with it? Sell it again?
---
Somebody had to equip it eventually, it just so happened to be you; a person who needed it. Which is the ideal situation
---
I wanna be where that guy is.
---
Thanks for your input u/fuckherthroat
---
Why would you even set the buy out price that high?
---
80+ arenas without banthok dropping once. Expected this though.
---
Have you investigated 311?
---
Hey guys, I want to know if there is an addon which shows you the time left of a dot on an enemy. I am a hunter and want to know when I can shot another serpent sting before it runs out. :)
---
1% dodge and armor is almost useless for pvp lol wut
---
The 2% spell crit is shit for rdruid.   The class trinket + 2nd wind are basically bis.
---
Mulgore does have a great lawn.
---
I guess so - blizzard never wanted factions to be able to communicate directly.
---
It's because they more and more were making what they thought we liked, instead of making what made them happy to create. They made too much money and that made them into cowardly conservatives, afraid not of losing money, but of making slightly less. Spread sheets came to rule the company because no one was strong enough to hold back the bean counters.
---
Patterns and recipes are completely different, you farm that dungeon for that item. World BoE’s aren’t instance specific so that’s why they’re needed on, no one expected to get that loot from the instance
---
Back you vile horde! For the Alliance!
---
How is 12 spirit on a staff good for everyone? Like if the hunter does not  have a weapon yet, it’s better?
---
Now you realize that Blizzard tracks and watching abnormalities like a sub level 40 having 200g+ with no other characters.  
---
Gold buying is against the rules, enjoy your punishment.
---
i use this its quite good

---
The only thing I didn't like were the insults you directed towards me.
---
Saying I don't enjoy shadow isn't saying I disagree it is more efficient.  I like that priests have a decent dps spec.  I don't wish to play it.  There is zero conflict here about specs.
---
People downvote because some says that shadow isn't as good of a healing spec.  They downvote anyone who says they level as non-shadow.
---
If I was generally unpleasant and hostile, my comments as a whole would be downvoted.  Yet only the ones about shadow are recently.
---
&gt; don’t want to heal, I want to DPS. That’s where the conversation ends.
---
you said it not me.
---
make your own groups, i'm a rogue and everyone and their mum plays a rogue on my server and i had no problem doing brd only from 56-59
---
As well as the common trend with DKP of all your most regular players passing on upgrades because they don't want their DKP to drop lower than somebody else when the weapon/trinket from the last boss finally drops. So they aren't improving their character for your raid because they would rather wait for a specific drop which can potentially take weeks do drop and those upgrades go to some guy for off spec who buys it for a handful of DKP.
---
I don't know exactly. I was using the "cast !eagle eye" macro to "travel" to mount hyjal from the crossroads. But I got lost and found this mountain instead.
---
Why would this be satire?
---
The perfect run would be a run where everybody knew exactly what they were going to get when it drops.  That's just optimization.
---
If you had an item you really wanted that wasn't on that list, you could probably join and have it reserved, if that's what they're doing.
---
Pretty cool, but a lot of work to setup.
---
its 2019 gamers interacting with a 2004 game, that's really it.
---
&gt; "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all." 
---
Like of course you don't necessarily approve of everything posted in Gchat... but why do you have to comment on it?
---
Yoy forgot rogue
---
Same! Now they’re almost exclusively dungeon/attunement quests.
---
What faction you are matters considerably.
---
I want #s.
---
I agree with him. Only big things, like getting a good BoE epic, and such should be posted into gchat like that. But I just sort of filter all the spam out mentally.
---
Flag running.
---
There's about 0% chance of them getting  their gold back.
---
Thank you my friend! It says that you can use OmniCC as Well? I did Install it but that doesn't Work. ;( I want to see the numeric Countdown.
---
It really is
---
I would love to play with you! Add me on bnet! Ryhi#11913
---
if its a legit upgrade for them, they can buy it.
---
Got my mount today too and all I’ve thought about is how good it felt. Haven’t felt even the slightest amount of joy in retail since BC.
---
I remember that rumor. :-)
---
This lol.
---
I’m enjoying!
---
I’m used to playing OSRS so the grind is kind of my thing.
---
I play an Orc Hunter (lvl 40) and my roommate (who raids 60 priest) has kinda been guiding me through it all.
---
It amazes me how many people have this mind set it classic. I actually have this discussion several times a week in groups, because people just deliberately take whatever items they want with no regard for the party that is helping them clear content they couldn’t clear themselves.
---
nobody’s perfect present company included
---
i use it without omnicc and it works well with the numbers displaying (sometimes) i think i use the default wow interface show cd numbers option
---
then I suggest you forget about that ability, dont even train it :)
---
&gt;The ONLY good thing I’ve found about it is making your own groups whenever you want. You can invite who you want, get what items you want. That’s it
---
Speaking as someone who has leveled and raided as all roles across several expansions, that outweighs just about every negative. The main reason people don't tend to roll tank are two reasons: they don't get to jack off about meters and their role has a lot of pressure.
---
The latter just scares a lot of people from trying the role or sticking with it in general. The former has a cascading effect of making tank not feel rewarding to play. Easy content is a snooze fest as tank/heals, while DPS still get to have fun and blow things up. Most of your time spent in game is easy content. Even when you do hard content, you don't often get to feel like a hero unless you manage to down something after half the raid dies.
---
Healers basically have to do the same babysitting, but with fewer upsides. DPS struggle the hardest to find groups unless they have a hookup with a tank/healer, are over geared/leveled, or are a hyper meta class/spec.
---
So long as it actually IS an upgrade. Even if not BiS.
---
Rod of the Ogre Magi from DM North tribute IMO is better
---
Spirit is good for everyone when levelling.
---
You mean like rings/trinkets/cloaks/necks?
---
Not really. You only ask when needing when it is something that isn't an obvious need roll for you. For example, I asked before need rolling on the SM dagger that gives spell power because there was a mage in the party. It was a pretty big DPS upgrade for me at the time, so I double checked if he wanted it before I needed.
---
On the other hand, a +17 agi chest dropped and I needed on it without asking anyone because it is obviously a huge upgrade for me.
---
I didn't play a paladin, if I recall correctly spell hits don't count, so judgement of light is better for groups with alot of melee DPS. Wisdom would be good while the casters are trying to Regen. Of course, ranged characters like Hunter would benefit more from the Mana, as they'll likely be fAr enough away to avoid incidental damage
---
Tyler the Creator - Who Dat Boy
---
You just said you dropped him to 5% health.  How are you going to argue you had better intentions, lol. moron.
---
Thing is, that only applies if it is actually an upgrade.
---
Ooh, asking for their silver would be stone cold. Please tell me that never actually happens.
---
You are delirious :)
---
Priceless.

I got into a BRD run as a tank (paladin). So I proceed to put Salvation on everybody and get ready to pull. 3 of them were on the same guild, and they started bitching about Salv buff and removing it while acting like monkeys and bullying me.
---
Pulled as much as I could and bubbled +HS
---
Yeah but marriage is kinda like a third party thing
---
Very few Mythic guilds in WoD or Legion used DKP, or EPGP type systems, Loot Council was agreed upon to be the standard, and objectively better if you loot council was remotely good. 
---
I assume the shift in community perception happened when blizzard removed master loot and used a made-up justification of "corrupt loot councils" when doing so, it soured the reputation of them as a result. Preach made several videos on the topic in BFA beta.
---
Gnomes on my server legit seem to have a case of Napoleon complex. People using exploits to attack people in a town? GnomeS. Person grieving newbies 20 levels lower than them? Gnome. Person camping lowbies and lowbie GYs? Gnome.  
---
It’s always gnomes.
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah combined with other stats, as supplement. It’s not good enough to just go full out spirit for literally every class other than priest. Like if there was agi on that spirit stick, it would be fine. 12 spirit literally calls out hey I’m here for the priest in the group, take me. Wake up dude.
---
I love the aesthetic of voidwalkers. Cute ass blueberries
---
\*he finessed the finesser
---
Or when you run into the first boat on the right side of the docks in menthil harbour lol
---
Supply and demand. If people were generally not ok with reserving loot, they wouldn't join such runs.
---
not really ironic considering tanks don't need shit from strat live.
---
Yeah there are other stats. What's making you think it's just spirit? It's not great, and personally I wouldn't take it. But it's still better than nothing.
---
I'm fairly certain it's because so many horde were there for so long
---
Well m8 if they managed to ban your account, I'm willing to hazard a guess it's a legit GM
---
I am a hunter, but new to game. Why is Humar unique? Just wondering
---
Not wrong.
---
very true lol
---
There is some weird things happening with instance resets, I definitely have hit the limit on the 4th dungeon of the day etc. But in those cases logging in and out solves it.
---
Anyway to answer your question, it's from when you enter the instance.
---
until one night you leave the pub drunk and fall off the bluff ;)
---
What would the internet do without you?
---
If they are all the same dps and atk speed then use the one you like the best.  Avoid proc weapons that leave debuffs.
---
It definitely works, i do it all the time. Leeway works both ways so if you run right up to the mob to hit it, you will get hit twice before you are out of melee range. You have to make sure you are BEYOND the targets melee range and just dip back in when your next swing is ready.
---
Are you referring to the 2 stamina and 10 nature resist? If the staff he needed had more than 2 stam maybe it would be considered good for someone other than a priest. The quest reward is the one with stats that are decent for most.
---
I do not recall reservations being a thing in real vanilla. People joined grps hoping just to survive the instance. Now people want it done fast and get the only item they want and never go back. It's like vanilla but very similar to retail in the sense people want instant gratification.
---
at least he made sure your night was going good
---
before he made it go bad
---
My main is a priest. Made it to 50 then got tired of waiting for tanks.  Now I have a 43 warrior and I’m just about done tanking. It was cool to run SM 100 times and get every piece of gear that I could use. But now, I feel like I just run around trying to get aggro on 3+ mobs at the same time with no rage. 
---
I just ran RFD with 2 mages and a lock. I felt useless. Going back to the priest for a bit now.
---
A lot of people have different stances but a common opinion on reddit is that if it's an expensive item (Like edgemaster's, Warden Staff, Staff of Jordan, etc) everyone should hit need.
---
Logic being is that if you hit greed on Edgemaster's and some mage hits need, well, it's your fault for being a dumbass and assuming that everyone's always going to be honorable and ethical so it's better to just completely remove the possibility of shit being ninja'd.
---
Ideally though you'll talk with your group and agree on a plan (and never trust anyone who says "all greed" before anyone has rolled)
---
Wait, you can kill the demons prior to even getting the sinew?
---
You'd have to pay me at least upper three digits of real world money to run URBS for eight hours. It wouldn't be too bad if not for that garbage rend encounter where you have to wait two+ minutes between every fight
---
That part drives me INSANE
---
I have 100g on retail and 70k on retail yet they feel the same.
---
Eat a bag of divks says my 150 ish kills. Gz though
---
People have gotten real fucking stupid with the "reserve" chat.  Shouldn't really be a thing.
---
Why rolling something you hate firstplace? If you expected retail faceroll tanking I understand your frustration.
---
If you happen to be on a group wich DGAF about aggro, put up your weapon of choice and zerg the trash
---
Hint: party with guildies
---
I beg to differ man, it's the exact same game.
---
This time around your maturity has made you competent enough to rub shoulders withcomplete tryhards.
---
We used to use guilds to ensure we picked a group of players who where pleasant to play with.
---
So you're saying you haven't seen Mankirk's wife?
---
A huge problem, in my opinion, was the homogenization of classes.
---
 In classic, and even tbc/wotlk (although to a slightly lesser degree), each class felt unique and powerful in it's own way. 
---
However in later expansions, under the guise of "balance", each class sort of got blended together. Everyone could basically do everything, dispel, interrupt, (self)heal, stun, cc, etc. 
---
Also player characters became ridiculously powerful in comparison to mobs as a result of that, making "Epic" end-stages of quest lines feel like just another boar, and the "terror" of accidentally pulling 4 things at once completely dissipated, because regardless of your class you had 20 tools to deal with that situation.
---
Talents as well, the talent system changing from points-per-level to something more akin to a "perk" system, where you gain some spectacular thing every 15 levels, all those factors combined made it feel like it wasn't even the same game.
---
Everything over heroic strike! You should never be using heroic strike unless you'd otherwise be rage capped (which will probably never happen while lvling).
---
Between 2am and 4am during the battle in the barrens. Where have you been Mankrik? Tell me you filthy green ogre. I know where you've been. You was with her. It was all planned Mankrik. There is no denying. The evidence is clear, like the vast sea between Kalimdor and the eastern kingdoms.  
---
You murdered her. YOU killed her with your very own hands. Then you tried to hide her corpse, like the coward you are. Everyone was searching for her. Thousands of people got tricked by you. They claimed they've seen her in Blackrock. In the ruins of Ahn'Quiraj and you kept silent. You knew where she was all along. But you played it clever. Once you deployed your Schnitzeljagd, you waited.. and waited.. knowing she wont be ever found. But we found her corpse. You sloppy Peon and then, when confronted with her dead body, you had the audacity to play the victim card.  
---
No Mankrik. You will go to the stockade. No, to Arcatraz. No.. even better. We will put your tormenting soul into the vault of the warden, where you belong. Filthy orc murderer.
---
I was in a smallish guild in vanilla, and I don't really remember seeing anything like this.  I largely stuck to dungeons/raiding with guildies though, who were mostly competent and mature.  Still looking for something similar on Ashkandi... any takers?
---
Fantastic. Thank you.
---
Makes perfect sense now. Thanks!
---
Hmm I find healing very fun. Requires a lot more skill than dps and you have to be clutch often.
---
Why would you download the video and then upload it instead of linking the actual YouTube video? And why did you not give credit?
---
I guess for mage, what I need to do is to add the frost bolt damage + the ranged damage?
---
Cuz people are inherently greedy.  Learn to roll need and avoid it all together, if you win you can allow others who didn't need to roll or give it to the guy who is going to equip it.  You should roll need to protect whatever loot distribution system you think is best.  If you win you can distribute it as you see fit
---
It's amazing that every account that does this does not use proper grammar in their phishing attempt. I get that they probably don't understand what proper grammar is, but you'd think they'd be able to figure it out for ONE MESSAGE.
---
the leaf drop, gives you the quest to go kill the demons. But then there's another quest to get the sinew after. You can just get the sinew early is all.
---
Where's the scam? they got their 4 mithril bars for the listed price.
---
That's such a shame because my  LF Pala in retail is my favourite :( but cheers for the insight!
---
I was at first, but nobody wanted to listen.
---
Yeah blizzard decided to go into BRD and rebalance the dungeon because fuck it, right?
---
You're a fucking retard. Classic is a finished game.
---
I concurr. Their argument is "im helping you tanking"
---
I'm hoping it was more than 8 runs or else you really did need to be paid for their incompetence.
---
Uh what? Most people use Crescent Staff until they do SM Library for one of the 2 weapons there. Nobody is going from WC to SM in 2-3 hours.
---
No, of course you don't. You can stomp MC/Onxyia  as fresh 60s without an issue. The question isn't "can we down this boss." The question is, "Who is going to top the meters for this boss." At least for me, there isn't a point to raiding if its not to compete with fellow raid members.
---
Exactly, that proves my point. It’s pretty much impossible to break the rankings if you’re pugging or playing with a casual guild, because you don’t have the support. 100% there would be people who are just as talented at X class as someone in a top guild, but for various reasons cannot commit to a hardcore guild so they don’t break the rankings.
---
Greed rolls don't happen if someone need rolls.
---
Shhhhhh, these fools don't understand that 15-20s for the materials is an absolute gold mine later.
---
GL passing the Patchwork test
---
Are there any sites that can show me the BiS list for PVP as a mage?
---
I hope blizz allows xfers for alliance players on heavily horde populated realms. p2 isnt going to be fun at all for level 48+ characters
---
Greed rolls don't happen if someone rolls need.

---
I’m 22, was raised on the internet and Xbox 10 years ago was a wild west compared to today - full of lobbies with people shouting obscenities  at each other.
---
CSS and 1.6 were just as rowdy, either you missed out on that generation of gaming or your completely incorrect about your assumptions. Either way its cute.
---
Staying on your topic, gaming services are PC as fuck nowadays. I get autobanned for telling someone to eat a dick when they are rude to me.
---
No, that's what every adult says that doesn't just click on things without reading, and actually takes time to think about what they're doing. The OP isn't a scammer, they're selling an item for a listed price that everyone can see. He's just preying on the idiots who click without thinking, and that's not wrong at all.
---
There is literally no difference power shifting as a tauren vs power shifting as a night elf. Their racials do not benefit cats.
---
I like to see blizz being aggressive getting rid of the gold buyers.  Maybe it's more effective to scare people off from buying than it is to try and stop the sellers.
---
So, just become the ninja to defeat the ninja.  Also, stop blaming the victim.
---
I’m willing to put forth the effort. Define irony.
---
Not really, no. Mark of Tyranny is BIS forever for bear tanks. The other two trinkets are very easily replaced by preraid or MC trinkets.
---
I mean, unless they are in low lvl greens or whites it might not actually be an upgrade.
---
BoK, BoW
---
Its actually a remix of that by Chee, otherwise yup!
---
I came out of my shell when i started to assume that every other person is a nice person until proven otherwise.
---
Before this i thought that everyone is complete retard for some reason(after my bad college expirience probably) and that made me avoid people back in a day.
---
Gnomes are the best mages and locks in the game
---
Ooo Trivia Bot works for Classic!? I’m downloading that tonight !
---
Healing druids get Second Wind/Briarwood + DM book trinket.
---
I use threat plates and shadowed unit frames
---
Oh gotcha. Forgot the leaf is what gives the quest. I was about to get real excited to get the kills out of the way since I'm last in line for the bow drops in my guild anyway
---
Anyone can fall for a scam.  Most people are gullible, trusting, and rather dumb.  You might think you are smart, but you aren't.
---
Nah actually it works as a filter, if someone falls for it they have to be SUPER gullible and therefore easier to further exploit
---
Out of all the circlejerk posts here, this one is probably in my top 3 so far. Good work op. You could include picture of your mount taken from your phone though, so work on that please.
---
Haha thank u man!
---
huh, you're completely right.
---
Sorry mate must be half asleep here.
---
if this was on rattlegore I was the healer
---
&gt; I'm not sure if I'll be tanking in raids at all.
---
It's useful everywhere, not just in raids.
---
This is probably the 5th post about BoEs and loot that I have read in te last couple hours. I don’t know where things went wrong, but people used to actually have loot etiquette, and considered people other than themselves in terms of gearing up, and upgrades for party members that contributed in the run. Unfortunately simply needing an item with honest intentions anymore doesn’t work. Everyone needs everything, even Bop items, rolling os&gt;ms, or on some wep they can use but never will, and these goofy armor sets with stats that don’t make sense for them.
---
"Walking towards the enemy counts as threat right? Okay tank's good."
---
Lf1m heals Jed run, Reed reserved. The most ridiculous one I saw right there.
---
Learned the hard way that these weapons proc on sap. At least them proccing on gouge makes sense, since house does damage. Poisons and fiery proc on sap, too, but they proc before the sap occurs so it doesn't matter, assuming you don't have imp sap (might not even affect imp sap, idk).
---
Yeah. And I know. Like I say it makes basically no difference at this level, spirit is good until you get an upgrade (which is what the quest should give). It's really a non issue.
---
A fair amount of people have either spirit sets or just extra spirit on gear these days because the amount it helps when levelling. Less downtime means more uptime n all that.
---
Would it be scummy to join them, have them summon you, then leave and join a different group for strat?
---
Lol dude way over paid.  I wonder how the seller acquired said item?
---
It doesnt affect imp sap
---
I'm not 1000% sure on this, but i'm pretty sure agi does jack shit for wands actually.
---
I love these posts. Never stop.
---
Oh I’m not upset by any means, if I was I would’ve taken the latter action.  You’re as entitled to your opinion as anyone. 
---
It just wasn’t gaining traction, and I was hesitant to post in the first place, so here we are.
---
While you're coming off as very aggressive, I have to agree. I remember leveling in vanilla before BGs. As soon as you hit 48, you're lucky to not get camped. No matter what zone you try.
---
There is barely 400 mounts in the whole game you retard.
---
It’s insane how many people don’t understand this concept.
---
If the casters are getting the quest staff this isnt a ninja at all.  Only noobs would care
---
man what's reading comprehension and how do you do it
---
you don't *need* a full group to spam angerforge 5 times and instance lockout cap your group. you need one char capable of holding agro and eating the hits, one healer, and at least 1-2 strong dps who can aoe the reinforcements
---
if you are sitting on a party capable of doing the thing, and you add another person who is unnecessary and who competes with someone already in the group for the *5% drop chance trinket that's best in slot until phase 5*, you are going to cause drama
---
if the person is already in the group or if you need more dps to complete the boss, then a roll is a roll
---
but considering that you don't need a full group to do it, it's entirely possible to comp a group to spam arena and angerforge without anyone needing to compete for loot. and you should, because you're a reasonable human being who doesn't think "just roll 1-100, if that causes drama go outside lol" is an appropriate way to act
---
even with this I still prefer healing. It's the only role where each encounter is a new experience.
---
I think you're thinking of Ravager from SM Armory
---
Because most PUGs can't even do 8/10 MC and frequently fall apart on Onyxia. 
---
You're severely overestimating the abilities of the playerbase. People are still fucking awful.
---
I think a lot of people will clear at least a couple bosses, but full clear Naxx? I seriously doubt many will.
---
I leave groups if there are 2 warlocks nuff said
---
LFM tank and heals - everything reserved, even greens for disench. You can have grey items. Basically what I read when dip shits do this.
---
I’m going to have you guys drop group before we loot every mob so we get all the silver
---
There are some quests which give you BiS gear but overal I wouldn't worry about it too much. I would do dungeons to fill in the gaps between quests or to knock out a bunch of dungeon quests at the same time (like brd). Dungeons on their own aren't great for XP.
---
Can confirm happens regularly when pugging! I am alt’ing a tank and holy craps. Some dumb fools for sure. People who need on loot for their alts, need on everything, attack at random, don’t wait for threat... that’s the tank life. Playing a warrior is the most annoying tank for dungeons. I like the pally better but lack of taunt is hard. 
---
On my warrior I just don’t mark and charge, shout, def stance, Sunder everything as quick as possible, revenge things that are losing aggro, taunt what gets lost and sunder it allll. Seems to work. On my pally I consecrate and snore. 
---
And I’m only level 27 on both pally and warrior. So the noobs are in full force. I can not wait to get past the 40s because my hope is that there are far less noobs. 
---
I plan on friending the good players and bringing those dps as favorites. Smart players over high performers always.
---
A real asshole would've told him that those boots aren't even prebis and that he needs to drop 100g on a green for that
---
Who said they were lowbies? The alliance aren't send their best!
---
An underleveled tank is probably by far the biggest thing that can mess up the flow of a dungeon. I mean yes, DPS can go AoE berserk and be a problem but in cases where like I was like 5+ levels above the tank in a PUG  for whatever reason it's difficult to avoid pulling aggro sometimes even with just auto attacks. Actually being able to use abilities and clear packs faster feels much better.
---
I think the nexus between the value it might provide someone who wants to sell it vs the value it provides someone who will equip it now matters a lot here, at least for my personal philosophy.
---
With BOE greens and blues, if someone needs it then that potential money I lose will be recouped relatively quickly by playing the game. The lost opportunity is not a lot, and the immediate value to my friend is solid so I'm happy for them to do so.
---
But if it's a purple BOE, then things change. The value will be massive for anyone. It's also massive for the person who needs it; but slightly more because it's an item they can use now. However the nexus between someone who can use that money and someone who can use that item now is far smaller. And at this point I think the fairer approach is for all to need (I personally come from games where etiquette would be to sell it and split profits, or allow the person to keep it but pay out the cut to other party members - doesn't seem to be a popular philosophy here though).
---
Plus there's the simple fact that all needing will avoid ninja looting.
---
This is how it should be done. Don’t just rush in and need right away, communicate. Prioritize members of your party, than need some upgrades, don’t be greedy. If no one needs it, all fair game, anyone can go sell it and make some gold.
---
Holy shit I never realized that's a model village!!!
---
My personal favourite reply: LF2M Tank/Heals Outhouse run toilet paper reserved
---
Those aren't racials. Those are faction specific buffs.
---
Shamans have mana stream totem, grace of air.
---
If you are asking what faction has superior FACTION buffs for druids, it's alliance. Kings, might and wisdom will increase your damage considerably. As for % there's a lot more math involved.
---
My troll rogue at 30 straight looked like he was in the Org secret police. Fully red, textures matched, absolutely glorious. Now at 56 I look like Ony puked on me.
---
The drop %s on wowhead are wrong on just about everything.  Wowhead really needs to remove them till they get at least somewhat accurate info.
---
the mouse pointer in one of the screenshots is pretty great
---
Yes, in which case it wouldn't be an upgrade, and "upgrades are upgrades" wouldn't apply.
---
You'll always need agility so I'd say agility.  Agility is rogues most important stat from what I remember.
---
Disclaimer; it's been like 6 years
---
Yea, I was young and stupid once...
---
&gt; Shamans have mana stream totem, grace of air.
---
BoW is better, and you wont get GoA.  You will be lucky to get anything on the horde side.
---
Faction buffs as just as important as racials.  Moreso really...
---
You don't have anything useful to say, so just stop.
---
Anyone ever find a fix for this? I'm experiencing it too.

I love how they briefly describe some of the classes except for paladins, they very clearly specify that you can play as a holy Paladin xD
---
I think it's because they like to build 5 combo points and the marked target dies too quickly. I've really noticed rogues hate DPSing the target I've marked
---
How are you possibly surprised at the lack of items for feral tanks? This game has been out for 15 years
---
As a priest, I didn't take this because the crescent staff is better.
---
I never said everyone should go full spirit, but everyone having spirit items is good for downtime.
---
If your guild is wiping/might wipe go with fire resist, otherwise I wouldn't bother.

I’m the same as you.i love leveling and hate doing the same dungeon over, and over, and over....  
---
But what I do love is PvP. I’m just patiently waiting for BGs to start, so I can start getting honor and gear for that. Until then, I’m just running one dungeon every so often, and leveling professions and playing the AH til then.
---
Hunters are loot locked to the leaf... Guaranteed it or eye every single week and fill both weapon slots. Everyone else waits 12 weeks before seeing their first weapon drop and compete with multiple classes in classes that normally have a higher raid distribution. For alliance they are also the only class wearing mail...
---
They spend minimal dkp... Band of accuria drops... Their bis but not the raid's bis on the hunter by any stretch... Guess who has tons of extra dkp.
---
Then there is that druid who decided he is bored of resto and wants to feral.
---
Dkp is flawed.
---
Yes of course you won't get GoA, melee groups get windfury which cat won't benefit from.
---
Also mana stream is trash in comparison to BoW of course, but that's not the point.
---
The tauren racials vs night elf racials make no difference, as previously stated.
---
Alliance faction buffs are far superior to horde.
---
Yep! Saving a few epic twink items that arent worth much now. When BG's come out though...
---
wash ur back
---
As a priest I read this and think why the fuck is Truefaith (+ the 4 orbs you need) reserved if there isn't a healing priest in the group actually healing the damn thing.
---
For me it depends, if the race/class combo is bis for either pve or pvp, i just assume they're a minmaxer following a guide. If they're something else, I kinda agree with your list
---
exactly.
---
At least with bg's its a controlled environment. You can go in and PVP when you want, without having to worry about being spawn camped for hours because someone decides to be a troll
---
It also shares a CD with the far superior aimed shot.
---
because youre ignoring over 1/2 crit of value on barbarous blade compared to DW Bone Slicings. I could ONLY assume you were talking about DW enchants because thats the only way Bone Slicing Hatchets start to approach being as good as Barbarous Blade, but even then still arent, assuming the 2h enchant is in the game as well.
---
10 stam isnt worth anywhere close to 1/2 a crit and 8 AP.
---
Timbermaw rep awards 15 agi to 1hs and 25 agi to 2hs, they are however phase locked right now. There are no AP enchants for weapons ever.
---
I don't think I've ever seen someone so shamelessly justify a guild giving all the loot priority to the GM and his officer friends before. Oh yeah, just screw everyone else over because "I don't know you as well, so you might leave the guild... so you can have our table scraps."
---
Utterly ridiculous. 
---
And also just happens to ignore the issue of burnout and alts. What happens when you funnel all your gear onto one guy? Well, after a few weeks/months he gets bored raiding for nothing and either stops coming or wants to bring his alt.
---
So suddenly giving all the mage gear to your buddy isn't "keeping it in the raid" because he's sitting there on his blues/greens rogue. 
---
You know what one of the most common pitfalls I saw in actual Vanilla?
---
Guilds who threw all their gear onto their MT, for the sake of progression... who then lost that MT and all that gear because after 2 months raiding MC without anything more he wanted from it, he was burned out. Otherwise he was poached by another, further progressed guild (that's not an issue in Classic yet obviously).
---
None of this is necessary, my guild used a combination of discussion and rolling for loot, and we cleared server second C'Thun and halfway through Naxx just fine.
---
bro it's your guildmate... be happy lol. sounds like there's more to it than this.
---
You should keep that dagger forever.  Anytime anybody wants to talk shit, just link it.  Hell, I'd bring it up randomly in conversation.
---
"Hey guys, make sure we're not going anywhere that drops [Blue Dagger] because I'm notorious for ninjaing those shits."
---
what dagger was it
---
Uh, well there's an LFG chat channel so you can kill out in the world and either advertise a group or keep an eye on existing groups. You don't specifically NEED to be in a city even though people do LFG there as well.

I’ve never seen those trailers/previews in the download section and a quick google couldn’t find em; anyone have links?
---
It feels a lot more interactive than DPS, that's for sure. Shaman healing is mad fun with how effective chain heal is and all the utility from totems. The main downside is how slow I am at solo grinding. I'm definitely not raking in the gold and all the elemental farms are out since they are immune to nature damage.
---
That's not a thing, I frequently scatter FD to trap loose mobs in dungeons.
---
Yes, it's from his video. I also searched the comments and couldn't find anything. :(
---
Well, the quest sword ia also better for you than this ataff.

Don’t tell me what to do grandad.

update 2: Found it! Addon called Myslot

idk if sarcastic or not.

Stop being so mad and butthurt.

Typical PVP player

Found the female night elf player

Yes, I was FOR SURE implying that you specifically were robbing me by your choices. Very good reading comprehension. Sorry for being "condescending" to you earlier, you seem like a smart guy.

I use MySlot for swapping binds/hotkeys.

You still have to keep a notepad file on your desktop but it's less hassle than what you're currently doing. I do wish there was a neat addon like they have in retail like Action Bar Saver, but alas it's not available.
---
99% of the time I can't get past my ingrained healer's need to keep people alive. But occasionally... Occasionally I see that one fucking mage not giving a fuck, thinking I'm going to heal him thru his insta aggro on a boss, or the warlock who does the death aoe I can't remember the name of right this second (which is embarrassing since my alt is a lock), or the pally dps who likes to playtank, or the dps warrior who just stands there and gets cleaved, or the shadow priest who forgets they have their own shield. And I let them die. And I cackle and mentally high-five the tank, who never complains. I feel you, OP. I feel you and sometimes I go against my own nature to teach those idiots a lesson.
---
Again there's MASSIVE variables involved.
---
You can shapeshift every 3-4.5 seconds, but your gear is going to be one of the main factors to consider, how much INT you have. Larger mana pool = more times you can shapeshift. That's completely irrelevant here to faction buffs.
---
Duration of the fight. Another huge thing to consider, again you can shapeshift until oom, or the boss will be dead beforehand.
---
Latency, another factor. 
---
Macroed or not.
---
Wearing the Wolfshead helm? That's an extra +20 energy per shapeshift.
---
The tl;dr: powershift. Bring mana potions, bring demonic runestones.
---
there is no librams for several phases
---
The point is to make it unbelievable enough that only suckers fall for it.
---
tell your friend to toss a max rank renew on locks in between pulls.
---
that's all the healing i ever need outside aoe pulls where i inevitably pull threat.
---
let garbage locks die a bit and maybe they'll get their first aid up.
---
Don't talk to the group, just talk to the healer. Most of the time, they'll understand.
---
boneappletea?
---
The correlation of Undead = asshole is seriously amazing. We need some studies done into this because it's mindblowing how Blizzard managed to force every dickwad in Azeroth to roll the same race.
---
I'm doing my part and killing them as much as I can though. Ideally while they're drinking at 30% health after aoeing down a pack of mobs.
---
Other races are cool. Except gnomes - wish I could kill gnomes too. I can kinda respect the tryhard mages but personally I think 5% INT in exchange for being an annoying ugly midget with giant ears is a bad deal.
---
Boomers grew up in the 60’s, 70’s dude. Not the 90’s..........
---
ive combed through everything and it doesnt seem to be..
---
I know the variables involved..  Variables which are easily accounted for!  Like say preraid bis...  Run the fucking numbers.
---
You don't have anything useful to say that I dont already know.
---
Rolling need on BoE's is never ninjaing unless it's some organized run with specific loot rules for BoE's.
---
Disc is the best leveling spec until level 42. So more priests should, but they don't know
---
Priest wants spirit only. Nothing else really matters when leveling. Crescent staff is good though
---
The only tanks I ever have a problem with are warrior tanks. Paladins and Druids are typically able to hold AoE aggro in dungeons. That being said I am definitely a dumb dps that has his brain turned off in dungeons.
---
Also some people love The Barrens, and some people find it boring and let their mind wander to then dump it into chat.
---
[Post about this quest i made a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dafep0/ally_yesterday_i_was_running_from_theramore_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Tauren for stomp is better. Time to reroll.
---
Is the Furbolg pouch usable or is it just for the stamina?
---
Immolation Trap is very mana efficient.
---
Freezing Trap can make 3 mobs pulls easier to manage.
---
You can't buy souldbound items while you can buy boes. You can't target boes, they're lucky drops. People usually are targeting soulbound items. 
---
The 2 aren't comparable.
---
Boes are basically equivalent to gold unless there's a shortage of them.
---
The only way to get soulbound items is to get them to drop and their vendor price is marginal. Nobody is arguing about 10g boes.
---
He's not that type of person to do that. I've told him to do that too.
---
Not buying it.
---
Report me for what, getting sand in your vagina?
---
Wouldn’t you just use lokdelar? 26 stam and it has really good weapon damage for gritting raptor
---
I'm level 33 and spec in arms. I never played vanilla so tanking as arms/fury is possible but like I said I don't find any fun in tanking, especially with people who take aggro and won't give it back lol
---
Maybe when I hit the 50s I'll respec but probably not lol
---
The zoomers really are the heir to the boomers. It’s hilarious watching them use boomer as a pejorative since they’re basically the same.
---
I just tried to bind the shift+Num1 to another key and unbind it, and it said "END" was bound....wtf?
---
and it still wont work either.
---
Oh, as a mage, you'll just need to add your spell power to the base damage of your frost bolt which you'll find in your spell book or on your tooltips, then divide by casting time. For melee classes, the dps is where I mentioned.
---
Especially since it would have to have equal or better loot than Dire Maul for people to even consider running it.
---
Right click the icons on the pet actionbar. Then they'll get this sparkly effect in the icon
---
The default loot system is always the default, and doesn't need to be called out.  If you want ninja rules, then you need to state that at the start of the run.
---
Which kind of clutter?
---
I'd prefer not having any hints towards Cataclysm in my Classic, thank you very much.
---
Your family and friends should be more supportive of you, IMO. Even if your writing is not to their tastes, good family and friends support each other. They don't tear each other down. Not trying to sidetrack too much here, but be careful. You don't want people to be dishonest but they don't need to shit on you either.  
---
Back on topic, I enjoyed your writing here and hope to see more stories from you.
---
It is as dogmatic and absurd as a "obviously a bad system" statement. I don't see anything obviously bad here.  In fact, once such a system existed. It was not bad, it was just uncomfortable. Players had to spend a lot of time to agree who can press the button and who can not.  An additional button was simply introduced in order to save some time. 
---
This system worked well for years. No one has come up with anything better for this type of MMO for decades.  That is why it is perfect. The proposal to select Need for all BoE came from private servers. Where the community often did not live longer than a few months. This is just a nasty and stupid habit to get rid of. Just like that.

Hi, /u/ricefarmer2

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dkv4kl/why_does_the_word_meme_mean_something_different/). 
---
Regarding the Robe of the Archmage. Is it currently better to farm for the mats for the robe or farm gold and buy the mats on the ah, the fires are going for about 3-4g earth's for 8-10 Waters about 18g and airs at a nice 22g
---
Featured locations no mention of Horde locations can definitely tell who their favourite was in Vanilla.
---
Also check out the World Map the Alliance locations are all clickable but not the Horde!
---
If you want to be quick and efficient, play a mage. They do it all. Quest well, aoe farm, get invited to groups, quick travel, aoe dungeon runs, and more. My mage is level 52 now as I work a lot but I did almost nothing but Zul Farrak zombie runs from 44-52. Made a lot of gold and leveled my professions easily (tailoring/enchanting). Had a lot of fun too
---
0/31/20 as a MT is real dumb unless dude is DW tanking. If he's DW tanking already then you guys must be pretty well geared. 
---
If he's running fury/prot sword + board at this point, he's gimping his threat and slowing down your raids.  No way he has the crit to make it work yet.
---
Been stocking up on both gonna cash out in naxx
---
They share an enchant, i have +55 healing on mine. Loving that thing.
---
Not the ninja, but very gear illiterate.
---
This person can't possibly have believed that would actually work. No one is that damn naive after hitting 60 in Classic with today's internet people lol
---
Thanks I’ll take that into serious consideration.
---
New dance animations were advertised on the box for WotLK
---
No quests? Im 55 currently, and I still have a little bit of winterspring, both plaguelands, silithus, blasted lands and burning steppes to do with only doing dungeons once. Have you tried those areas?
---
I know it’s later in the game but in another raid, there’s an achievement for a mount called “only the penitent...” and you have to kneel every few seconds and it’s another Indy tribute
---
Bro ur just talking about pugging in general. Find a couple good ones to group with and all of your complaints are resolved.
---
Depends on how much gold/hr you are bringing in and what you are farming.
---
Essence of water I as a feral can pull in 3/hr if I am not contested.
---
Earths and Airs aren't terrible for mages to farm down in Silithus, just expect people to be grinding them as well.
---
But a mage can AOE grind in ZF zombies, for decent gold/hr (I think people are pulling 40-60g an hour consistently or something pretty crazy).
---
So it would be based around what you are able to farm and how much you make vs how many essences/hr you can potentially pull out.
---
After level 10 is where the real fun stuff starts for most classes. Druids get Bear Form, Hunters get pets, every class gets their first talent point. Horde can go to the Barrens. Alliance can go to Ashenvale or Westfall.
---
Any particular class that stood out as more fun?
---
Holy shit lmao told myself earlier if I ever play alliance i’d be a dwarf
---
This has been happening to a guildie and everyone told him to try disabling all addons. Not sure if it worked though
---
That’s one thing I like about tanking on my Druid, after a fight I’m full mana to top everyone off
---
Hell, its not even about the warlock needing on the plate.  Its about the plate wearer rolling  on it because they need it, but then selling it on the AH later instead of equipping it.
---
I judge my effectiveness as a Mage by my cc and not pulling agro - I don’t even have a dam meter installed yet. Don’t want to get in that mindset.
---
I appreciate but never expect heals - I carry health pots and bandages.
---
People expecting a healer for those while skipping Golem Lord too.
---
I have a relatively high "criticism threshold". As long as the instance is not a rolling disaster, I won't say anything about other people's performance, tank or not. I also appreciate that tanking multiple mobs is a lot more difficult in Vanilla than in subsequent expansions.
---
No its based on 3 gold vendor price versus 500 gold that you can invest into your gear etc.
---
I can sell 100 for 300 gold, then buy edgemasters.
---
Social anxiety gives no fucks about platform. It's based on interaction with other humans, regardless of setting. I'm sometimes more anxious about my internet interactions than I am about my in person interactions. I can't read social queues as easily... I sometimes overreact when someone was joking, I can't see facial expressions like smiles/frowns... It can be stressful. I'm sure it's weird for people who don't deal with it, but it's a thing. I has it.
---
«I’m just upset that I’m now hated by multiple people on the server»
---
I don’t really understand this. If what you say is true, they are assholes and not worth spending time grouping up with anyways. In fact, consider it a blessing! Now you know not to group up with them ever again :)
---
Enjoy the ban
---
I reserved the barons mount for a laugh, got death threats....
---
&gt; Too many factors involved.
---
There's really not...  Just be quiet.  I haven't asked you shit, but you just keep talking to hear your head ring.
---
Thanks for all the info, Waters are from toxic horrors in felwood yeah? So as far as farming goes running ZF is the way to go then? I'm currently specced single target so would have to respec for aoe farm
---
&gt; Except you argument is based purely on subjective worth, so yah, it can.
---
I love twinks but used to have a 19 hunter and it was the first and last 19 twink I made. Hope it’s fun for you but you really don’t do anything but auto attack and concussive shot. Major snooze fest
---
I believe it was meant to be 10 seconds of running kicked it in, but if you got hit you had to run 10 seconds again to get it back....
---
Your spec is a joke. That's why it's a meme.
---
Shadow isn't that good until shadow form. You want sprit tap but the next 10-15 talents is meh. Using disc you get zero downtime, and you also put 5/5 on holy crit since you use holy fire and Smith a lot
---
Melee classes for the most part but the other classes look fun I also want to play a class that has cool looking armor end game  (I realized I didn’t respond on my other comment so I deleted it and made this one)
---
8g ?
---
Weird way of spelling blueberries.
---
For horde it is better for longer than alliance.  However, most likely not when you have BWL weapons.  It will out DPS any bue weapons.  Maybe an orc with deathbringers is better - but bre+wf is competetive for now.
---
Your argument is pedantic. Everyone in the group which a boe drops contributed. If it’s a high value boe that can be sold then everyone should roll for it. Gold is extremely valuable in classic.
---
I wouldn't say that it's just different in WoW. Meme has become slang for anything on the internet that isn't taken seriously.
---
These VWs probably have a wife and kids back home. Ever think of that? No. You just want your own personal tank. He was probably in the middle of tucking his voidkids into voidbed while his voidwife is in the kitchen muttering about how he spends too much time at work. He finally sits down in his voidchair and turns on the voidTV to watch some voidfootball while cracking open a voidbeer and suddenly BAM, you summon him. You point him to a pack of quillboars and tell him to go let them beat the shit out of him while you spam dots. He pleads with you to send him back, but you laugh. You are a monster.
---
We are already nearing patchwerk dps with BiS right now.
---
I don't doubt that with DM buffs and optimized raid comps and other world buffs, we'd easily beat patchwerk's dps check.
---
That guy's a god damned trip.  The nerve of some people.  I hope he never got his Strat run and never does with bullshit like that.
---
Wonder how OP acquired said item...
---
So that's what I keep stepping on.
---
I wonder how many I've accidentally killed...
---
People need to stop getting butthurt with reserved messages, if youre not fine with those items being reserved, dont go with them.
---
Its understandable that they don't want competition on those drops seeing how rare they are.
---
How else would you advertise that? List every class and spec combination that might not roll on those and then make sure with them they dont need those items? 
---
It's faster to just say what is reserved.
---
I’d live off Lordamere Lake in one of those secluded cabins where you can see Undercity in the distance.
---
I concur.
---
But isn't it "kill all the top bosses" and then clear each corridor on the bottom level? I think the bottom level you need to do some corridors before the others but that's the only thing i can recall XD
---
They took it out I believe because of how insane that would be in pvp settings
---
Voidwalker.* You don't get a new one when you re-summon it.
---
Quit your job. Join the movement.
---
I believe the WoW diaries talks about horde zones being done last and being a bit rushed, hence why so much is crammed into barrens.
---
Except the law of numbers dictates that it all averages out.   So, there's no reason to be a dick/ninja.
---
I always pictured the tanks as fathers (strong, strict, protective), the healers as mothers (kind, caring, healing, nurtering) and the dps as childreb, some were good, some were bad but at the end of the day the parents had to guide them and clean up their mess.
---
Yes imo that is the most fair way because it prevents ninjas. But it’s not common practice I today’s Classic. If you want to stick with that, then make it clear in the beginning of the run.
---
The system has been changed on retail.  If you need on things they become soulbound.  The system we have is obviously flawed.
---
Remember it doesn't matter if you enjoy the way a weapon looks or how badly you want it. No matter how many jump runs you do to get the book while having fun with friends. If the min/max discord says it's bad, you are dumb for farming it. /s
---
I mean we get to melee her so it's only fair
---
This right here is why warlocks are all KoS
---
A tip is to look at what releases in the different phases and what is needed once that phase releases.
---
I did this the other day, I was using TSM to flip things that are posted at too low a price and was so dead tiered that i didn’t realise I just baught vendor food for 98s per item.
---
Not even mad, if you can be bothered to post a bunch of items that nobody auctions to catch out half asleep people using TSM then good on ya, my fault for being a dumbass
---
I love how we can combine a 14 year old video game and the Eric Andre Show to get dope-ass memes.  
---
This timeline isn’t all bad...
---
They might be trying to Sap and having it fail. Sometimes when I was a rogue in vanilla I would evasion off tank or kick/burn down a caster/healer if we lacked cc, acting as a kind of cc. 
---
It’s the kind of thing you need to talk to the tank and work out ahead of time though. It can be effective though. As a rogue, your main job should be to burn down the tanks target while feinting off threat and being prepared to spike damage up real fast if the healer pulls Aggro. Better you die and buy the healer time.
---
Wasn't there something back in cs 1.5 maybe where at one point if you borked out your graphics card like this through delete certain stuff it'd go all whacky but allow you to see through walls?
---
Bro they can announce every time the fill an exp bar shit still won’t bother me or even count down their bars and I’ll high five every time. can’t fade me bra
---
I'm 38. I'm probably just going to start an alt once P2 hits.
---
Even if they do, who cares? Just don't respond if you don't think it worth talking about.
---
I swear these people act like their monitor is gonna run out of ink from unnecessary words or something.
---
Transfer to Faerlina we need more potential honor 😈
---
The armor is extremely good against melee classes with bear form.
---
You're comparing a situation where you'd get 10s of thousands of dollars to a situation where you'd get the equivalent of 23 cents. Thinking you're the one lacking the "grasp"
---
That blows my mind every time. Why not just eat and drink with the rest of us. Instead lidetap while we drink and then just stand there. Make no sense
---
Tanking is pretty faceroll too, especially compared to something like pre-nerf cata heroics, where you couldn't LOS.  LOS'ing isn't really a skill, it's a cheese.   
---
The Aggro model in classic is stupidly broken.   Like I said, I'd take pre-nerf Cata over this.   I had no problems keeping aggro in those 5-mans, but they could be very unforgiving.   DPS had to keep CC's up and go all out before healers mana ran out.   Tanks had to mitigate damage, we had a lot more abilities to keep track of to do this.  Pulls were harder because we didn't have LOS to cheese it.   Bosses had *mechanics*, like lots of mechanics.  They would never get lost in the adds (looking at you WC).   Healers couldn't DPS because they needed all their mana for healing.   It was challenging for everyone.   Tanking in classic is a snoozefest compared to that.
---
Add all the time it takes to get everyone to the dung, and it's very unrewarding experience that the vast majority clearly would rather avoid.   If tanking was rewarding and interesting, there wouldn't be a massive shortage of tanks.  The tanking model in classic serves a very specific personality type, and it's not a common one regardless of what this sub may say.
---
But.. why? Why do you care exactly? How is it hurting you? Or are you just that bitter?
---
I rarely post stuff I do or get unless it's particularly noteworthy, but I really am not bothered if other people are happy to reach 40 or get their mount or whatever the hell else.
---
Huh i have a version of elvui thay has heal prediction probably a couple updates ago still works
---
This is why I stick to guild runs.
---
You have a serious need to be right. Blocking you because any discussion with you is worthless as you are not open to other people's thoughts/ideas. Have a good day, hope I never meet you in game.
---
Not op but as a MT and also ran hundreds of 5 mans literally... I see you. Trust me, any decent tank will notice you and you will get invites back over other mages.
---
A 700g drop is $300 at current rates. Pay me $300 if it's so cheap.
---
Sometimes it gets to be a bit much for me, so I have a couple different chat panels that limit what channels I see that I can switch to.  I acknowledge that people should be excited for upgrades and levels, and that me finding it annoying at times is my personal problem, so I just remove myself from that situation when it pops up, and switch to a "quiet" chat panel.
---
If I can convince you fine chaps to join me on the grobbulas server for some thrilling RP. I would be beyond thrilled to level with you! (Friends convinced me to join a regular server then all quit and having a hard time finding effort to start again on the server I wanted to join originally)
---
Sirspiffy#1433
---
How long of a ban?
---
Have you run Mara yet? It's a hunter loot paradise. Get this from the quest to kill Princess: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17753/verdant-keepers-aim
---
The proc can break scatter shot but I'm BM till 60 and it's a great ranged quest reward. Slap a +7 scope on that and it'll last you awhile. 
---
Weapon skill racial makes less of a difference for ranged weapons since the best endgame weapons are crossbows. You should always prioritize slower weapons with high top end damage regardless of type.
---
Call your friends and family and let them know that you are not dead
---
You don't know how lucky you are. I fuckinh hate warlocks. They do less damage than images and require about half the healing of a tank
---
Not to mention all the lingo and not knowing how people react because it's online, some people can be total assholes and go off at you just for asking questions or the like
---
Courteous to tank. I'm more curious how someone can ninja an item they can and do use.
---
Name checks out.
---
&gt;I don't think I've ever seen someone so shamelessly justify a guild giving all the loot priority to the GM and his officer friends before. Oh yeah, just screw everyone else over because "I don't know you as well, so you might leave the guild... so you can have our table scraps."
---
Thats not what I said. Items that are rare and large upgrades like a mageblade should go to people with the least likelihood to leave the guild. Period. The End. If you don't agree that's fine, that just means any guild you would be involved with leading would be a poor one. 
---
&gt;What happens when you funnel all your gear onto one guy? Well, after a few weeks/months he gets bored raiding for nothing and either stops coming or wants to bring his alt.
---
I'm not suggesting you funnel all the gear to one person. Never said that. 
---
&gt;Guilds who threw all their gear onto their MT, for the sake of progression... who then lost that MT and all that gear because after 2 months raiding MC without anything more he wanted from it, he was burned out.
---
Sounds like a bad guild. Not surprised given the rest of your comment. 
---
&gt;None of this is necessary, my guild used a combination of discussion and rolling for loot, and we cleared server second C'Thun and halfway through Naxx just fine.
---
None of this part of your comment is relevant to the discussion. 
---
I don't even use loot council in my guild. But the question was why people don't like it and about how it works. Rolling gear off to whoever can use it/wants it is by far the single worst loot system a guild can have and a sure way of losing any good players from that guild as fast as possible.
---
I've heard it's Queen Azshara...
---
Like I said, I ask or i wait to see what everyone else is doing and follow suit. Even back then I used to wait until others were needing, I've never been a ninja nor ever been accused of being a ninja.
---
Caster staff drops that's worth 500g.
---
* Caster could use the staff for its stats.
---
* Melee could use the staff for the gold to buy a 500g weapon for its stats.
---
This is how it was in Vanilla / TBC. People stopped doing that later on because BOEs became worthless.
---
It’s used in that context across all games not just wow.
---
I found it depends on the server/faction as time has passed. Double gather still doesn’t seem to make bank on Westfall-Alliance, yet I made a Horde on Mankrik and I am rolling in the gold. They both have similar population and respective alli/horde ratios, too.
---
"Follow up question, what is this, what is this?"
---
"Looks like a clamp of some sort."
---
"Yeah how-"
---
"I can't tell what this - what is this?"
---
"Yeah let's give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate"
---
\*applause\*
---
I try to recruit ppl like you for my guild, cause that mentality is what makes a successful raid team. Keep kicking ass, stranger!
---
Found this one:  [https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus\_image/image/65183904/Onyxia\_Key\_Art.0.jpg](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65183904/Onyxia_Key_Art.0.jpg) 
---
Much bigger than 1920x1080
---
I'll give warlocks a renew all day long as I can spare the mana, which is on most fights except for some of harder bosses.
---
Oooh that's nice to know! Thanks. Not sure if I want to rely on having windfury though, so I might still go with that one.
---
You’re like lvl 20 it doesn’t matter
---
You passed on beaststalker and it goes for 3g
---
I've made some pretty serious midgame gold fishing STV on my shaman.   I was fishing STV at 28, making shittons of gold for that level because of water walking/water breathing allowed me to get around the high level mobs and gankers with ease.  I could even keep up with people on mounts because I could run straight lines and didn't have to contend with mobs.   Astral Recall also makes it stupid easy to reset my run back to Grom'gol.  I was able to easily buy my mount, boost my professions, and buy all the BoE's for my level I wanted.
---
You ideally want to have both up, judgment of light for a whole group is an insane amount of healing. More so if you manage to keep it up.
---
Thanks!
---
Really? I did some runs with reserving mount and nobody baited an eye O.o
---
He did not make this.
---
I can’t believe you sold it for that much...
---
I just checked healing touch on wowhead and the higher rank always has higher hpm. Wait with downranking until 60.
---
Should I try and get an owl when I hit 40? I heard they are good for pvp?
---
How do I know what abilities to prioritise?
---
I ran a lot of dungeons in Vanilla, and the golden rule was that any valuable BOE was 'Everyone need'. This even held in TBC who also had some nice BOEs.
---
The gold you get from a BOE can be used to buy an item you can use.
---
Or just get to 60 asap and do the most efficient gold farming your class can do and buy the ores instead of spending hours running around lowbie zones hunting for nodes just to save the literal pocket change the ores will cost you. But mining itself isn't a bad profession.
---
Purely from a solo perspective (gold farming at 60, leveling ease, etc.) should I go Hunter or Druid? Looking to hopefully make this character to funnel gold down to alts.
---
Also, from these two, which would have an easier time getting into raids when I do decide to do so?
---
I always loved the little break spots they had in dungeons. That and the Gnome Refugee center come to mind.
---
If they aren’t worth a lot of money why not just buy them? I’m sure whoever wins the roll would be happy to sell it to a caster in the group :).
---
Oops! I must have been typing while you posted. Glad you found it anyways.
---
Great way to get snap agro on the pull as well if you have hots rolling, they also will gen threat towards you.
---
Shitpost
---
Eh, I don’t think “fast” is the best outcome. Been in plenty of groups that went super fast right up until they wiped. One wipe will instantly make that gogogo group way, way less efficient than a Conservative approach.
---
Fast is only as good as it is fast and smooth. Sacrificing smoothness for speed isn’t good. 
---
When I healed in vanilla, I wanded, but never cast offensively. I’m not going to risk popping a stack of potions to get through 5-10 mins faster. And now, on my pally, can’t wand.
---
Worthless? You still have boes being sold for 30-40$. I wouldn’t call that worthless.
---
That was on Grobbulous, it was an RP even to sack Thunderbluff.
---
Was super cool. I’m the guy behind your text bubble with the K.
---
What mentality? The guy didn't really ninja and he is making a Reddit post asking the community to judge it because he had doubts. Doesn't really look like the typical ninja to me.
---
&gt; tell your friend to toss a max rank renew on locks in between pulls.
---
if i'm drinking in between pulls, so are you. my job as a healer is to keep the tank alive, not carry your second mana bar around.
---
Tanking with a 2h is superior in every single way. You have no idea what you are talking about. The final dungeons, sure a shield is fine, but nothing hits hard enough that requires a shield for a majority of the dungeons outside of a few bosses. If you don't know how to heal then I can see it being an issue but that's a healing problem, not a tank one.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/mount-items
---
Wowhead says 791. Retard
---
do i need good gear to solo farm tribute runs / maraudon?
---
I was maintaining threat on 3+ mobs per pull most of the time and according to recount I took about 75% of total damage. Do you think that number should be higher?
---
I tanked alot in retail but that's nothing compared to classic so far.
---
I. Must. FEEEEED.
---
Poor guy. I'm still lvl 34.
---
Gnomes are literally the only reason to play Alliance, ever :p
---
There shouldn’t be N or G for BoE items, it’s only relevant for BoP. However, that’s what it was like in vanilla and #nochanges so I guess it’s staying. You can disagree with it and continue to misunderstand the most basic economic principle that exists, but you shouldn’t be surprised when people choose to act logically instead.
---
if its an upgrade and you equipped it right away, they're morons. the end
---
Can’t here to say exactly this. Tbh I liked stalagg more where I actually saw enemies out in the world
---
Yeah. That was clear miscommunication on his part. I woulda said right away I need that weapon, not after everyone passed.
---
The problem for me at max level is how much of my log is bottlenecked around things I need other people for. I have the Kitronos quest, which I can't do until I manage to assemble a Kit farming group for my t0 boots, which means I can't finish the In Dreams chain, which means I don't need Live Strat for Of Love and Family/Balnazzar's head...it just goes on and on.
---
Flying.
---
The death section is really interesting. It sounds like they were planning on having you lose XP on death.
---
I let people die all the time, but it’s on purpose. Rogue keeps pulling agro and isn’t using feint - hey buddy, I’ll Rez you when we’re done. Once or twice.
---
Try not being condescending
---
To be fair I did that on private servers.
---
Also to be fair I was literally botting as a programming exercise.
---
And also to be fair they banned that account.
---
Also this attitude is one reason why retail sucks so bad. People like you
---
That is bullshit. You WANT gold, they NEED the item.
---
But it seems to be an NA Issue, on my german server the greed/need system works out just fine.
---
Even Foror dropped and people were considerate.
---
if i need it i need it..if i dont need it i greed it. if someone else needs it as well let rng decide fate....as well as my lucky charm increasing my odds :p
---
Silithus has no quests, if you’ve done most of winterspring already you kinda fucked yourself. WPL isn’t great either especially below 55.
---
Well, I don't see any obvious reason again. Everything has been changed in retail, so what? Now it's a completely different game with empty realms. Is it better? I don't think so.
---
For real.
---
Did he win it in a raid then not equip it or something?
---
I like how genuinely helpful this comment was. +1
---
14/10/8 is the spec that's the best best until 42
---
I wonder how tf that guy got 1k gold to begin with
---
Get ravenger at 37. Put crusader on it.
---
I would imagine that's how it happened.  Kinda dirt bag if you ask me.
---
2h Tanking does way way way more threat and damage and wearing a shield provides an incredibly small reduction in damage taken by trash mobs. The only time to throw on a shield is a select few bosses.  Just because you had bad experiences with some bad players doesn't really mean anything. Forcing a tank to use a shield speaks more to your skill and knowledge than theirs.
---
Fishing schools and wreckage for mithril bound trunks, but you also can sell the fish (stonescale eel does really well), stranglekelp, and black label rum.  The trunks give you bolts of mageweath, bolts of runecloth, thick and rugged leather, level 40 greens, mana and health pots and the occasional 12 and 14 slot bags.   You farm up a bunch of stuff doing it, which makes it really easy to sell since you're not just dumping stacks of one item on the AH.   But I sold it all on the AH.  If I had to estimate I made about 20-30g an hour maybe more.  But you had to run the route at least twice, because the first run was always clearing out the schools no one wanted to fish.  But that's still *swimming* in gold for level 28-45ish.
---
if you're not putting out fires you can talk shit in party chat
---
I guess you're pushing phase 2 fast? We were 15 manning it and something went horribly wrong and several dps died to first deep breath, ended up with a 16 minute kill and good practice at dodging those breaths.
---
(Hey real quick before anyone sees can you explain what boe stands for)
---
Mage if you know how to AOE farm. Hunter if you want something a but more mindless but single target. (Arrows can eat up your margins though)
---
Mage takes a little finesse to AOE farm, not super difficult though.

Oh didn't realise silithus had nothing, but why have I fucked myself with winterspring?
---
The bandages actually sell?
---
65 35 is pretty much an ideal split imo, yeah leveling sucks but you'll get sick bg queue times and there are still enough alliance that you'll often roll horde in wsg etc anyway.
---
On Patchwork you'll love any mitigation you can get.

&gt;Tauren: always the ~~tank~~/healer that says”I’m so drunk/~~high~~ rn” right before going into the dungeon.
---
I just lost it. Literally me on Friday nights :D
---
If they NEED the item why don’t they BUY the item with the gold that they just WANT? Your logic is completely flawed. The money has the same value as the item, thus you both have the same need for it.
---
Buy top quality food/water, grind mobs when travelling from point a to point b, and don't waste too much time with professions or at the ah (unless you want to).
---
Dont post things that are incorrect. Do your research 
---
For the stats? ''Deja Stats Addon'' google that for classic should pop up
---
I was on same boat i leveled two characters to 55 on pve... I had great fun but even playing with my friends i was just bored... Now i rerolled to ppvp server and just hit 40 on my mage. Just need 40 more gold now haha
---
Hunter. Fastest leveler, best soloer, great gold farming. You also won't have to change spec to raid. Druid would technically have an easier time getting into raids but you'd almost certainly have to be healing which will make your farming more difficult.
---
From memory hunters don't have much responsibility in MC unless you are pulling.  I assume that someone else will be in that role but if they ask you to do it, just decline it ;)
---
Don't pull aggro, and if you find that you might, a pre emptive feign death is always a good plan, as if you wait until after you've pulled, it might resist. 
---
Installing a threat meter is also probably a good plan
---
Bind on equip. It means you can sell the item at the auction house as opposed to BoP) bind on pickup) which means you can’t sell it for full price.
---
Hahaha lol I'm cry-laughing here in the office. "bees dick of hp" lol, thanks man.
---
...I wont even bother explaining rested xp to u if ur so stupid that this is ur response
---
Wait until you hear the word ironic used.
---
I do, if they heal me the first few times I LT. If they don't, I assume they know the deal. Either way, people should learn that the priority people in a group are the (1st) tank and (2nd) healer pretty quick, considering no group launches without them (except for those crazy mage AOE runs, which generally require players smart enough to understand healer priority anyway). I get your point, tho. I do try to provide communication when needed.
---
Sell to the vendor, yeah.
---
This is my 2nd comment here because I wanted to follow up for some advice
---
40 arms warr finally going to try tank a bit harder, so far I have one particular problem. If I use a 2h I can spam sunder/revenge/taunt and I can get great threat, but take plenty of damage. 
---
If I use a shield my rage generation is piss poor... Is there a rotation for shield tanking that I am missing? Maybe just use shield for boss?
---
Yay, Dreadmist!
---
I remember pouring over every inch of this site at my campus computer lab between classes. Could not wait to play.
---
Oh gottcha. Thanks, friend.
---
Hell yea, min max leveling so hard, gotta keep that 3k per minute exp ratio up up up..
---
/s
---
&gt; World PvP and BGs are obviously not going to become easier so your rewards only help you raid
---
lemme know how that goes the first time you're playing wsg and a rogue with perdition ambushes you for half your hp or you get hit with a windfury crit from a warrior who has an obsidian edged blade and it deletes you from full hp
---
Insert the drone/sheep "GPU dead" comment, even though people have 0 clue about GPUs and why this happens, and just write it because they saw someone else wrote it thinking they are smart.
---
Just as an interesting aside, weapon skill is set to max in pvp combat.
---
Some of the screenshots I have never seen before. Some really good stuff in here. Professions -&gt; Mining. You can see Blizzard gifted a green mining pick to the character right before the screenshot lol
---
Do it, before its too late. just don't look back.
---
Just for the Stamina need to be 52 to use it iirc or 46.
---
Yeah. It's great to be a tanksta.
---
I've played a Priest(for the first time ever) since the launch of classic, and the only time I haven't heard the main tank say "this is going smoothly" was the first time I healed for an RFC run, as a lvl 14 priest for a lvl 13 warrior and lvl 16 rogue
---
The rogue kept pulling aggro and would give me a hard time when he died.
---
Since then, most runs have been "smooth" even when the main tank is using the Fury meta, and makes me use up more mana than I need to or when the ret pally dps decided that he wants to kill a second mob instead of killing the skull that the tank marked, then complains that I didn't heal him when he could bubble to save himself.
---
The tank is the first priority. Once he is full, everyone else gets a Renew while my mana regens, after we are clear. Otherwise, they get a rez.
---
Brought back some old memories of them just high tailing it away from me at just under the speed of sound.
---
Wtf you going dude? I command you to stop.
---
Basically you don't have to click party member frames to heal, only need to mouse over them. It may sound trivial, but it's a big difference. As for the macros themselves, just google classic wow priest mouseover macros.
---

Never seen more than 1 off a single node though, mostly it’s just 2 taps of thorium or 4 taps with some dense stone ;(
---
Eh not true, my playstyle I'm very vocal in voice/chat. I really use my Tracking to its fullest unlike other hunters. Which one reasons I made Hunter first instead of FC Druid as I can control a game in Solo Q's more / lead my team better as hunter then A Druid sitting on roof with support waiting for my offense to work.
---
Yeah I've seen plenty of 1 mil+ boes being sold in bfa, raiding guilds will drop a huge amount for a good boe at the start of a new tier, to the point of potentially realm transferring someone just to buy the boe then transferring back
---
Spoken like a true boomer
---
Your comment was literally extolling the virtues of a GM and officer-clique gearing themselves up at the expense of all the other raiders. "We'll take all the premium loot and you guys can have the table scraps."
---
You're even still going on about it, saying anything less would be a poor guild... despite the fact that, as I said, we cleared through actual vanilla without a single issue with an actually reasonable loot distribution.
---
I seriously think you have to be trolling with this bullshit, I've seen plenty of guilds get called out for funnelling all the premium loot towards the GM and his buddies, there was a guild on Arugal that got called out for scamming the rest of the guild to do exactly that recently, but I've never seen anyone so shamelessly admit it, and try justify it.
---
I really hope you actually TELL your guildies this, I mean, if it's so logical and reasonable that the raiders that aren't friends with the GM only get table scraps, then surely you don't need to hide that fact? Surely you're upfront about it?
---
Right?
---
You don't just consider it obvious and implied, and never actually spell it out? Right? Buddy?
---
Yeah posted in felwood for few days and mooched the rep lol

---
DPS are often a pain in the ass. I know how you feel. However, sometimes, there are things we can do as tanks to guarantee success in certain situations regardless of what our DPS do. I would love to review your combat logs and see if we can find areas for improvement. PM me if you’re interested.
---
To be fair this isn't exactly mythic level raiding. Simply a having a person is more valuable than all the consumables in the world. People who spend the time to farm do it for themselves because they want to. Also it could work even better with dkp as they would literally sell consumables to the guild for extra dkp.  Back in tbc the guid I was would give bonus to dkp to aneveryone ready with flasks food 5 minute before ntpull time. Worked well to encourage people to be prepared.  Loot council has definitely become popular but I cant imagine  it ever being really objective.  They can try to be and to be successful in the long term must appear to be so.
---
Because you still have to do 56-60. Gonna be dungeons or grinding unfortunately. You wanna go to wspring as late as possible
---
Apes are gnomes for pvp purposes
---
Thank you
---
 But this is classic wow subreddit. Retail wow baddddddd
---
You said it hasn't been changed in decades.  It HAS been changed and made better.  Nobody is quitting retail because of the current need/green system.  The obviously flawed part of the system is ninja looting.
---
Because BOE are so rare I like to have a fair shot for the jackpot when one does drop.
---
Black dragonscale in particular seems like it offers a nice mix of fire resistance while still granting both melee and ranged attack power. Also some decent armor and stamina if you care about that kind of survivability. In terms of hunters, tribal is basically just devilsaur.
---
druids have it bad all the way till AQ and arguably the gap widens between classes there to when it comes to feral/oomkin , so you either reroll a new class and chill with it for a while or you stick with it and make a name for yourself. 
---
Back in the days the good druids where few and far between these guys were the people you wanted to play with!  They all had alts to play when it got tiresome but their tenacity at keeping with druid was legendary.
---
I think what I'm trying to say is, if you don't love absolutely everything about druid re-roll
---
never played any wow, picked undead warrior, the grind from 1-60 wasn’t as bad as everyone said, even doing it solo. At 60, specced as fury, haven’t had this much fun in a game in a long time
---
Gotta take the layover in Stormwind
---
He’s a warrior, but yeah. Most of the problems non-malicious DPS are capable of causing can be mitigated with better play.
---
"One of our main goals is to ensure that players can enjoy World of Warcraft without having to invest huge amounts of playtime. " LOL
---
That's why they're my favorite pet. They're adorable. Somehow a lot cuter than fire elementals even though they're the same.
---
you have envy of others, but your time will come eventually if you can stick with it. 
---
Reroll if you don't absolutely love druid to the point you can't give it up.
---
99% of hunters feign death. 99% also sic their pets on the mobs attacking me that the tank doesn't see (even when I bring them over to him and spam chat I'm being attacked). In vanilla, hunters were one of my biggest annoyances. So far in classic, I've had a very good experience with them. There are the rando idiots, but it's not the norm in my experience. Maybe it has to do with having your pet tank for you when you're soloing? I dunno.
---
Hail fellow from Myzrael!
---
I love that storm crow was listed as a druid form - what did they have in mind for it if there was no flying?
---
Needing on BOE's is the default duke.
---
Im calling this a set up. No one who has that much gold would be so stupid to pay that much. Not fooled.
---
BG´s are cross realm, the realmbalance does not matter
---
&gt; dps warrior who just stands there and gets cleaved
---
To be fair, almost everything that cleaves does so in a circle around it instead of an arc in front of it.
---
Lots of minmaxing warlocks don't want to drain life because it's not optimal dps. I get that it's important for a lock to do, just seems that most are careless about it
---
Pretty much same here, people have been pretty understanding
---
For exactly the same reason we don't make people pay vendor price to the winner of a /roll for their items.
---

Or you can be a Paladin and get screwed out of the sweet crit for spell trinket for zero reason at all.
---
I wish there were more like you
---
Purely from a solo perspective, then Hunter. Both are very strong solo levelers (questing and grinding). At end game for gold farming, Hunter. You can do either solo Maraudon runs and sell the Blackstone Ring to people or solo DM Tribute for even more gold per hour (more intensive than Mauraudon runs).
---
Bird up for kelly
---
This my friends is gold trading. He prob bought 1 k gold
---
Always.
---
Agreed, but most warriors I've witnessed don't move behind a mob to check. This is most annoying in groups with a rogue who is not taking damage when the non-tank pally and warrior are.
---
Or of a guild that's leaders played For Honor? The knights in that game all shouted Deus Vult! and it is hilarious. Also it translates to "God wills it". So some white supremacists hijacked the term, doesn't mean I didn't have fun shouting it while slaughtering samurai on For Honor, nor does it mean I shouldn't smile at it when I see it.
---
Almost nobody outside of Reddit knows that Deus Vult has become a WS slogan, and nobody cares. Take your recreational outrage somewhere else.

Nah I reckon you got a case. Raise a ticket with them and say someone unauthorised banned your account.
---
Did you really rush a class to 60 without researching this fact first? Obligatory "15 year old game..." comment
---
Do you do this kind of, “sap square, sheep moon, I’m the tank attack my target,” style tanking yourself? If so, are you also a Tauren and do you stack mitigation?
---
81.4% of your spellpower for frostbolt. 100% of spellpower gets added if the spell is 3.5 second cast or longer. Shorter spells are scaled down from that.
---
See what help you get from is when the Legion invades eh.
---
I would doubt it.
---
PvP is the real endgame
---
There are no cracks in your exposed thoughts that suggest you would actually stick to the game even if you decided to keep going today.
---
Keep saying that shit while people are getting murdered by people enscribing that om their guns and shouting it while they do it.
---
Wir haben es nicht gewüsst, ey bro
---
This is common. Tanks and healers get blamed by stupid locks all the time. The dps race is one of the many things that pushed me away from retail but that mentality has sadly seeped into classic over the years. Dps is important but it's not the most important thing in many situations.
---
As soon as you mentioned "vendor" your point became irrelevant to this discussion. We're talking about BoE items that you sell on the AUCTION HOUSE for the SAME PRICE that you would buy them for. Of course its a different discussion entirely for BoP items.
---
New copy pasta
---
Ayyy lmao
---
Either a goldseller or someone extremely desperate to get their T1 belt.
---
Lol i just replied to one of his comments above saying the exact same thing before scrolling down here. Dude shot himself in the foot and is saying "I cant blizz has done this"...
---
As a tank warr, I hate grouping with warrs. A lock has at least a decent chance of not being a total buffoon. Warriors seem to almost always smash their heads on keyboards
---
A cosmetic pet/familiar that follows you around. Worth hundreds of gold on the Auction.
---
to be fair a rogue having a huge amount of gold isnt too amazing..they could pickpocket literally everything they come across and only buy things they need and thats probably an easy 200 there
---
yup did my first Ony raid since vanilla, couldn't remember anything about deep breath but remembered I could jump up and down to pad meters underneath her lol.
---
As an Ally on herod.... please roll horde somewhere else, we're already full lol
---
I know that you are trying to be funny
---
But mate it's not working
---
I too love having a rogue when I'm tanking for all these reasons plus they utility. Need a door or chest opened? Rogue can. Need a patrol stopped at a certain place, rogue will distract it. Need to find the torch dudes in BRD? Rogue can stealth in and find them and mark them. Also in BRD, when doing angerforge runs a rogue can save us a pull by stealthing to the goober and activating it at the beginning.
---
Gonna suck ass when P2 rolls around though.
---
Wowhead is shit, I don’t know why people keep referring to it.
---
Are of you one of the two locks in the raid? ruidhad a 58 lock get three items on the first run and that point we were just rolling for gear. You might as well be a redto druid and say how great things are working for you.
---
If you think I’m describing or endorsing corruption then you didn’t comprehend my post.
---
Yupp. The funny thing I noticed, it’s always the trash player who’s very vocal about all the others performance. And more often then not the tank or healer gets fed up and leave. The trash player will say “good they sucked anyway”. The group is disbanded and I get to repeat the circle.
---
It's not even a joke though, I'm just pointing out how stupid his reasoning is.
---
It was common on private servers, likely where it came from.
---
What skills is a 2hand tank going to use? Level him as arms first to get sweeping strikes? 
---
Interesting concept, especially if just go a lvl or two higher into an dungeon to migitate the higher damage.
---
I agree, I don't see the sense in this at all
---
If you walk into a guild and the first thing I see is that raid loot is being given to Dan and Tom, the RL's IRL buddies, on the basis of "they won't leave" that's both a huge red flag and a huge deterrent to raiding the first few weeks, because if you're the same spec as them you know you could skip a raid and lose nothing.
---
How did you all immediately know he was a gold buyer? Lol
---
It was literally the same thing in vanilla...
---
I thought I'd seen quite a few allies there while leveling, that makes sense. 
---
And regarding the run, it is worse yet for Horde - it's through Arathi - wetlands - Loch modan :) or via Burning steppes/searing gorge via redridge.
---
But lovely grind quests, for skinning especially! Best to come there with Frost oil, gyrochromaton (? Thing) and Healing pot + lesser invis pot and 9x blue pearl and those patterned bronze beacers for the turn-in quests. Had some downtime sending those from my bank character. Altogether awesome zone though.
---
Oh hey a female night elf... And another female night elf! And another one.... Oh look they keeping their female night elf requirement each page...
---
From the healer's perspective, why does it matter? Either or is going to be taking as much damage (dual wielding probably more-so, since they'll be sitting in fury stance more often and taking the extra damage from it).
---
Grats on the HoJ man. I got Padres Trousers (dm healing pants) over the weekend and im still hype about it. The grind makes getting gear so much sweeter
---
They passed on it? Like not rolling either need or greed? Or do you mean greed by passed?
---
Totally worth it, grats
---
just relax man, do some dungeons here and there or switch it up and do a bit of professions while on netflix. You don't need to farm 24/7 just often enough for yourself!
---
Take consumables, some people go ham and farm months worth at a time others just get a few when needed.
---
Guess you are just either from retail 10 or stupid
---
on my laptop i had in ~2004 if I switched from direc3d to directdraw -- i can't remember the two specifically, while playing counterstrike my game would speed up about 50x as if i were speed hacking.
---
worked online, too.
---
&gt;Pretend this is vanilla where you spent weeks on a boss and every little bit helped and now pretend that moonkin rolled on a huge resto upgrade.
---
this isnt vanilla tho, you wont spend more than 15 minutes on a boss and if you did then your guild's loot system is the least of your guild's problems
---
Lying your ass off lol.   Pirated server confirmed.
---
yes, most likely
---
Yes, look at the location on minimap. We are talking abou altar of storms from the start.
---
I love it when my guildies get some cool shit. People work hard for their loot and we progress together! I get excited when people hit 300 in skills even!
---
Guild are a community and if you're gonna play together every week you might as well make the most of it!
---
I know it's been a month but it's the one on Deviates delight
---
What's the profit in buying the devilsaur mats and crafting the set to sell if any?
---
Just stating the facts.   The pirated realms were filled to the brim with disgusting people.   At times that felt like the only people there.
---
LF39M raid on Hogger. Paw reserved.
---
Okay buddy :)
---
Happened to me the other day.
---
I spent like 6 hours in the bay of storms just fishing while drunk and watching a dude on youtube eat a bunch of decades-old military rations.
---
I Just replied and explained what was up and that was that, no biggie.
---
unfortunately not. def. wasn't a thing in classic - idk about retail.
---
i picked the wrong reward at the end of the tirion questline. 
---
i got the tanking chest, instead of the near-BiS ring (iirc). not a big deal as i'll be mainly doing dungeons but damn, it hurt. I also have a youtube video stating which important quest rewards you should pick and i didn't check before &gt;.&gt;
---
at least with the ony and rend quests, I'll make sure i check.
---

For silk it’s better just to create the bandage and vend. Ok my server, silk stacks go for around 43-45s so by the time you do that plus AH cut you’re better off just going the bandage route and get paid straight away.

While technically and upgrade for me a Staff of Jordan dropped in Uldaman when I was lvl 38 healer. Our party had Hunter and another druid as tank who rolled need on it after we casters did, but noone made drama out of BoE purple rolls and I won it. I ended selling it anyway for mount money, but would equiped it if mage or warlock would argue that I ninjaed it from em.
---
When people are 60 I'll congratulate every upgrade they get! Even big items while leveling are fun!
---
i just kited him to felwood and he was at 60% hp, am i bugged or wtf.
---
Crescent staff is a quest reward...
---
how do you get these damage numbers Font, i tried everything for hours but cannot get the font to work only for combat texts
---
Doesnt work. have you done it?
---
Ironic, given evolution of language is literally a meme.
---
i still dont understand this anti-reserve counterculture that's formed on this subreddit
---
in vanilla, nobody cared. TBC, WOTLK, nobody cared. RDF came out and it never was a thing again (besides in raids, when usually nobody cared)
---
but now people are talking about blacklisting people that reserve stuff. 
---
this is a ridiculous example (reserving all those items and runecloth? seriously?) but yeah reserving happens... if you don't like it make your own group and go with everyone else that hates reserving. good luck finding a tank that's running for a 1/200 drop and is cool with competing vs the rogue hunter and dps only warrior (without being monetarily compensated)
---
They were fine, just a bunch of dudes taking it slow wanted to get up to raid. I think we did about 35 to 40? Not too sure exactly how many we ran, probably 15 or so.
---
They aren't targeting 20-40 year-olds with high school diplomas or better. They're after 10-14 year-olds with a poor grasp of English. The biggest victims of this are dumb kids who also don't speak English as a primary language. Those stolen accounts stay stolen longer.
---
how did you do it?
---
Im at 50 attempts and he never goes under 50% I can kite him to felwood.
---
HAHAH too true :'D
---
I've grinded so many of the various whelps. Not a single drop. The RNG gods are not in my favor. D:
---
They funny thing is that just about every pvp server ranges from horde favored to do alliance even play this game.  So alliance will have great BG que times.
---
As an unbiased bystander, you're an idiot
---
as healer i approve, god do i hate this spellcleave/meleecleave offtank shit, everyone has aggro and takes dmg. :D
---
Can confirm.
---
I have also noticed the following:
---
Rogues really like their combo points and will hit the target that takes the least damage (ie the target youre not hitting with anything), thereby drawing aggro.
---
If a DPS dies, it is your fault....according to them...
---
You only get tells to heal/tank (im a dudu) when youre already inside the dungeon (nevermind you have been looking for a grp for half an hour), already in a group or both.
---
You're greedy if you ask to get all blues that arent needed by anyone... Even though you dont need ANYTHING from the dungeon (scholo, strat living). You're running a charity apparently.
---
Don't try to hold aggro from frost mages. They dont care.
---
This person did know they where the Hunter? Right? Zero leverage in that situation.
---
I hearthed out mid fight today. Perks of Paladin tank.
---
To be fair, the guild was one of my buddies I met on my journey, and we were drinking in Discord the entire run, made it really fun. Got a bit sloppy on tanking the last run or two though
---
How long does it take for you to complete one run with your gear?
---
short-med term, herb+alch is probably your best bet
---
alch has consumables which will always be in demand and herb supplements it so you're not reliant on the AH (which is good as some herbs just are never on there).
---
stuff like free action pots, limited invulnerability, fire resist pots, agi pots and the flasks are all desirable (flasks maybe not atm)
---
for pvp, you could drop the herb to pick up eng. but i'd probably prefer a max lvl alt before doing so - druid would be a decent herb as they can herb in travel form so if you are doing laps of a zone, it's quicker.
---
Lol typical huntard
---
You just charge, sweeping strikes, demo/battle shout down to 25 rage, serker stance, serker rage/WW, defensive stance and then revenge/sunset as needed. You’ll never lose threat if you do this right and just tell the dps to wait until you go serker stance. Which should take the normal 2-3 secs.
---
how are they the same?
---
Don't forget about escape artist
---
That's the "simple auction" price for his server, auctioneer addon needs to compare it to other items, if there were none there, the "simple auction" price is if you just put it up at its vendor value+ a bit or if you DE'd it and sold the shards, and once again the price of the shards could vary by server
---
Winter Squid is an easy one to grind and stockpile. Only fishable from mid-September to Mid-March and then they're gone for 6 months.
---
Yeah, it essentially gives around 750 armor in bear form.
---
Same could be said about Gnome Rogues. They aren't here to have fun, just here to ruin my day.
---
It will contain Dire Maul level loot, but itemized entirely for dead specs. People will run it, I assure you.
---
Bit late, but adding to what’s already been said.
---
I healed is full run as 51 holy priest. Not a single issue as long as your group knows you will be pulling some extra mobs here and there.
---
Only trouble we had was me pulling everything in torch room, and with a few unlucky flame keepers that was a bit of a pain.
---
But as long as rest of he group isn’t underleveled it’s no problem.
---
/r/whoosh
---
Cu back in a week bro
---
I used to do this in Wrath 25man onNA server. 
---
We called them Gold Runs. When we had the current raid on farm, our guild would bring 12-15 main team players and pug the rest of the spots. Pugs would bid on gear and etc, BoEs at the end too, all gear available, none of the guild members could bid. At the end of the raid the guild bank took 10% of what was earned and the rest was split equally among the guild members.
---
Great way to earn money and a side bonus of seeing newer players that were talented so we'd recruit them.
---
My sarcasm alarm went off on this one too. Probably a response to some tanks / tank-healer combos reserving more than one Orb. I can kind of get why Prot warriors would reserve one, but otherwise... Nah.
---
On Thunderfury I actually felt bad for the Alliance because every time I was running through a zone in a group of Horde players, one Horde would attack and the the rest of us would pile on and the Alliance would get steamrolled. I never experienced getting stomped like that as a horde player... Until I went to Tanaris. My Warrior buddy and I got mobbed by the Alliance any time we went anywhere near the pirates in search of their hats.
---
I'm going to go there and get revenge when I can dedicate play time to PvP.
---
my helm sucks ballz atm. so i'd be using it for both - at least until i get a better one.
---
once i have a bit more gear i'll switch to fury and then just tank dungeons as fury + 1H
---
i'm just not that confident in my ability to do so right now. sure, i could try but i'd rather not waste other peoples time if we wipe due to me being terribad at tanking in that spec
---
There’s a BM hunter and  MM hunter that I am at war with over thorium nodes in burning steppes. The BM one I always eat for breakfast even in pve spec, but the MM one scatters me onto a frost trap every f***ing time, uses FD perfectly and has engineering items to boot.
---
It’s really dependant in the individual hunter/huntard.
---
Yeah but in competent groups you don't need to be speccing for threat, your abilities combined with your DPS not sucking means it isn't a problem.
---
I'm not passing on a BiS trinket to cover for shitty DPS.. I can always find more of those.
---
The amount of inaccurate information coming from pserver players is ridiculous.
---
Personally I have it separate, a macro for feign death and a separate macro for the trap I want to lay based on a conditional.

I fuckin love Steve’s mre reviews
---
People actually make that mistake.It’d be like me misspelling something and when corrected saying “whoooosh”.
---
Meh, that’s my experience with 90% of horde (alliance this time, always horde before). Horde 20+ levels above, if not way more, camping for no reason, etc...
---
It seems like the orcs are the most chill, sometimes UD but hot or miss. The sheer number of people I run by and /wave just out doing questing who immediately try to hit me is amazing. 
---
Fun to chain sheep them while /laughing though.
---
I really hope I'm the most chill and not the complete weirdo... Lol
---
Winter squid , swift thistle , FAP's, Arcane crystals , essence of air, dream foil, black lotus, groms blood etc
---
thats why ppl sell high value item thru /2
---
it is true, there is only case it would be faster if there would be lot of monsters and killing non stop. but with this spawn rates and many people killing same mobs in same area, that never happens. so you don't even have chance to kill stuff faster anyway, mobs just don't exist. so go solo and get them faster
---
Get ready to.. tank on your druid.
---
As the only other class with a taunt you're seldom going to be asked to do anything but tank.  I've healed a bit, which gives the grp picking me up some flexibility in deciding what bring next, so I've been healing a bit more than usual. 
---
I DPS'd once before 30.  It's great though, wars can't heal, priests can tank.. but not for very long, but my druid can do both well enough to be totally fine at this time.  I get 'plate' at 40, and my heals are fine plus I don't have to have a war/rogue/priest alt to get most of the same experience.  Good enough for me because I do not feel like leveling 6 classes to 60 this time.  I got shit to do and while WoW is amazing I have other things that can't be compressed in my schedule like I had when I was a kid.
---
idk, i'd definitely feel poorer with 70K on retail.
---
100g on classic is ok, buty if you don't have your epic mount it don't feel too good either.
---
Nice hiss
---
As a warrior I’m so fucking jealous when I see people doing orange quests...
---
i hate everyone that posts "ding" in group or anywhere.
---
who cares
---
I see your impulsive warlock and raise with suicidal warlock; tapping to 40% hp and immediately jump in for Hellfire spam.
---
an auctioneer addon really helps with this. it collates all the different stacks so you can find sales in stacks that you want/need to buy in
---
I mean, that’s not the only explanation lol.
---
As a druid tank and former warrior, i think Warriors have it easier to get aggro in a leave group. In classic my swipe gets just 3 targets, costs 10 rage, my charge also 5 rage, and typically the aoe starts falling before my first swipe.
---
That leaves me ragestarved and unhappy.
---
Warriors at least get thunderclap.
---
Can we submit this for something to be shown at Blizzcon plz?
---
It’s the small character model - it makes moving around feel “better”, and surprisingly cloth gear actually looks pretty cool on them. Like mini dwarves.
---
Used to hate them, probably would never pick anything over gnome now.
---
Oooo what rules do you have macrod?
---
maybe he felt rich XD
---
You remember that you will see it drop a hundred more times after you get it :p
---
Spend some time quietly contemplating the stupidity of rushing to finish what's available and then complain when Blizzard doesn't rush to meet your pace.
---
I've got a 46 lock which I abandoned, a 50.5 druid and I just made a rogue. I'm still gonna play the druid, but I'm tempted to ditch the rouge and make a warrior. That way my main and alt can both tank, because I refuse to deal with that shit.
---
 But I like the rogues playstyle so I'm torn. I guess a fury warrior is basically the same as a swords rogue lol.
---
No hunter, greed roll
---
sure, that's why you capitalise on it and list random items at a high price to see if there are buyers.
---
not your fault that you've listed something that a gold buyer thinks is for a sale.
---
wrong on so many levels, windfury is nice but SLAM and proper timings is what made 2h fury work.
---
Boomkin do less damage than ferals at this point in WoW and run out of mana quickly hence them being called OOMkins.
---
&gt; I just don’t quite see the solution.
---
I'm not saying there's a solution, I was just saying I'm concerned and that this is why.
---
On classic I don't even have ONE!
---
One year is a long time.
---
I kept hiding on the boats and pouncing on people who had pulled too much
---
hugolighthoof...
---
Can we stop this shit already, you’d be hard pushed to find lower effort content, except if the pic was not a screenshot.
---
Just swapped the modifier to ALT and it worked perfectly...wtf is going on with my shift to not work?
---
Its the reason why i even uploaded the picture, i have been playing this game since the start, i have over 400 Days played on my main warrior which i stopped playing at 2015,  I have never looted a epic item from a mob ever!!! I was really suprised.
---
People who say "The game starts at 60" are wrong imo.  The most fun part is leveling 1-60.  
---
That being said.  I really enjoy farming and optimizing my supply chain -- I think if you watch Monkeynews stream you'll find he plays Classic Incan optimal way).
---
For example, I have a 60 Hunter that can run Maraudon.  But I realized princess on classic is slower than pservers and my hypothesis is that she drops fewer items on average.  So I have gone mining/herb.  I farm Tinkerer only but get ~1 Ghost Shroom, 6 Stranglekelp, 6 Blindweed, 8 Mithril Ore, 10 Solid Stone per run.  
---
And I can do a run in ~5 minutes+2 min reset.  But you may wonder...5 runs in 5 instances before lockout...what do you do? The rest of the time I farm Oily Blackmouths on a lvl 10 fishing alt in northwest Silverpine Forest.  I can get ~20 in 18 mins.
---
Then I have a future 29 twink that is an alchemist that uses Oily Blackmouths and Stranglekelp to make FAPs.  
---
My theory is that FAPs will triple in price once WSG comes out.  So I have literally 2,000 stacks of FAPs ready to go.
---
Right now I'm making about 65g/hr since Mitrhil is mooning.  Ghost Mushrooms have taken a dive, so I'm hoarding them until they go back over 1g. I guess I just find this whole operation hilarious.  It has 3 toons, 4 professions!
---
Also, I really enjoy world PvP.  Raiding is cool, but after 4 or 5 MC clears, I was ready to get back to the fun part of the game. If you want dungeons and raids, play retail.  They're better and more challenging on there.  If you want "the world" to matter, play Classic.  Farming, professions, world PvP are insanely fun.
---
Rogues are better dungeon tanks than tanks against things that hit reaaally hard, as they can pop CDs...
---
use the addon "neatplates" it shows the castbars of the enemys, what spell it is, and if someone interrups them it shows you who did it
---
After the initial glut of suicide mages at release I've been having much better luck with them.  Less crazy fuckers that just want to see a good pyro crit while the healer is drinking. 
---
Waiting for me to maul all three targets before a flamestrike + blizzard, frostbolt first rather than fire blast.  It's been nice really.
---
You need Theramore to link fight points in Feralas.
---
People know how to dps and what gear to wear along with us being in 1.12 where talents and gear are much better and people have proper internet and computers that can handle a full raid encounter.
---
Really!!!! Yeah he got ripped off, its worth atleast over 25g
---
not sure why you would go combat without AR ? sounds to me like you're trying the old seal fate/combat or hemo/combat route? .. ps. they are mostly terrible without fantastic gear
---
????
---
I’m sure you’re loads of fun.
---
That woild mean single target focus fire, not aoe everything on every pull.
---
I would be absolutely fine to not even tank the skull after an initial taunt and then have the dds go for it after me establishing some baseline agro on the group.
---
Most randos won\`t even listen and just say cleaving is faster. then some runner pulls another group because i had no time to pull the group back, we need to get to their casters.
---
another runner pulls another group.
---
3 groups without communication via ts in an experienced team = wipe
---
Fin.
---
I'm reserving all orbs and the group is full instantly. The deal is way too good for everyone. No time wasted looking for a tank and the runs are usually fast.
---
Ud are hit or miss, 80% dicks, 20% the most chill.
---
I have no idea actully, it could be :)
---
You know that a lot of people don't look at bis list or loot tables ?
---
stormgarde today, ran past a group of horde 10-20 levels higher than me (I’m just trying to get bandage book). /wave, they gank me instantly.
---
Spent the next hour+ making it impossible for them to quest by sleeping their healer during multi pulls, taunting them into pickling up adds, airing from a distance while trying to burn down a group, breaking cc’s, etc...
---
Did attack a skull s priest who I thought they’d called in who proceeded to camp me, in retrospect I think they were chill and just annoyed getting attacked by a cocky 31 mage.
---
Devolution != evolution.
---
7---hours?!!
---
I migrated from Faerlina to HeartSeeker. Just give it some more time. I have been watching the numbers and it is now 60/40 and headed in the right direction. I spent most of the day questing in STV alongside the alliance and only had a few cases of getting ganked.  
---
If I'm running into an area that has alliance I will wait till they pull a bit to much and I will help them out. 95% of the time that is one less person that is going to mess with me.  
---
I assist all alliance I see and I have never started a pvp fight. There will be plenty of time for that at 60 when the honor system is out.
---
[Icy Veins’ ranking guide is what you’re looking for](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/warrior-tank-pve-guide)

to reserve items

and you also play an expensive and shit moneymaker

I mean, we have like 18 item slots? Its gonna get old if you ask for grats for every one
---
From a class balance point of view, TBC was was good imo. Also some of the raids like temple keep or black temple is someting I will always fondly remember. I might be biased since I started playing just when TBC was launched. WotLK had it highlights, but I think that's when it really started to go downhill.
---
He's not the type of person that uses his abilities to heal his teammates? Maybe he should roll Hunter. I hear they're good at solo play
---
sold 2 pieces of  Elemental Earth  for 28 gold this weekend. it was a mistake from me - maybe it wasnt \^\^
---
Makes sense.  If you're bad, and you are telling people you are bad then you're going to take much longer to find willing loot-slaves.
---
i ran an LBRS group w/ 2 rogues and a mage.
---
it was heaven.
---
all 4 added to my friends list but as i have limited - and varied - playtime i can't always group w/ them. also, as i still think im learning the 60 dungeons i'd rather wipe in pugs and deal with that than show i suck w/ friends XD
---
If there's something i miss right now, its the summoning stones tbh. You still have to make an effort to get a group together, which I Think is fine, bust stones are amazing when you have to start re-creating groups.
---
try doing that with an alliance char: that'd be epic!
---
I know :)
---
Isn't this already something you can manually choose to see in your chat settings?
---
That cloud walker girdle (not sure if that’s the exact name) never drops!!!
---
Im a complete fucking masochist... I lvled a Disc Holy spec right off the bat...
---
And yes, it's veeery fucking slow. Unless you have any other person to level with. That said, get a pocket healer to level with and... you really can get shit done.
---
I thought it would be, but I couldn't see an option. I might be blind though.
---
Dal Rend, as in Rend Blackhand.
---
Deadmines is basically the reason I roll alliance, it's such an amazing place. Stockades I find horrible, and I always get lost in Gnomer...
---
This is the opposite- guy doing everything possible not to die 100 times.
---
Warlocks can heal themselves during fights. Locks are totally fine going into literally any pull at half health. I would encourage you to communicate with blizzard if you have a problem with the way the class was designed.
---
I've always been of the mindset that you roll need if it's an equipment upgrade and you're actually using it, or roll greed if you simply want to pawn it off.
---
But reading other people's opinions is interesting. I can understand the other viewpoint. If something is worth say 200g, that's a lot of money... Maybe it would be fair for everyone to roll need. And say if someone actually needed it but someone else won, they could buy it off the person for like half price or something. Kind of middle ground.
---
It's very easy as a hunter, get good and farm solo tribute runs.
---
If you know what you're doing you can sell chest items for 40g per item. And  if no one is buying it's still 60g per hour just from vendoring said items.
---
I had this issue on HeartSeeker flying into Org. Same error message, it hasn't happened again so I didn't give it much thought.
---
No it hasn't

El oh el.

I played Legion for a couple weeks and got bored so I’m pretty much completely new to WoW, especially Classic. I’m having a blast. Though I definitely enjoyed leveling more than getting geared at 60, I’m still having a ton of fun. I ran my first ever raid tonight and I was so nervous that I’d do something to fuck it up, but no, it was fun. My DPS was abysmal because every other rogue there was in way better gear, but I had fun and I followed the mechanics well as the raid leader told me. I actually got super lucky and got both my Tier 1 belt and my best in slot ranged for Rogue until Phase 6. On my first ever raid. That and seeing my friend get the Azure Mageblade were some incredible feelings of long-term gratification that I haven’t felt in quite a while.
---
So yeah, I’d say I’m having a lot of fun.
---
Shadow dmg and healing from locks generates more threat. It's quite easy to pull aggro from no threat to 100% with 2 back to back sb crits.
---
idc
---
but i see how it can generate discussion in an otherwise dead gchat. also, it does/can help foster a sense of inclusion in the guild. 
---
for such a mindless thing i.e. saying gz, i don't have an issue with it.
---
Unfortunately I think this is one of those, "if you have to ask" situations.
---
You can't have both up at the same time, they don't stack.
---
Reading the comments I judge that either I don't get a popular reference or I'm having a stroke.
---
Then don't heal them...
---
It isn't really, but if you're going to try it, get in now so you don't end up questing alone.
---
That's nothing. I don't even have damage spells in my action bars, I literally only go to instances to suck the tank's dick.
---
I go by the rule that I have to be two levels below the highest level of mobs/bosses in a dungeon to be tanking it effectively. I broke that rule yesterday and tanked Kraul (lvl 33 bosses) with lvl 30, and it was so incredibly annoying that I'm never gonna do that again. The game was like "You wanna pull aggro away from the mage? lol dodge, dodge, parry, dodge, parry, and now the mage is dead."
---
P I Staker?! Come on!
---
Depends on the setting of the group. Personally I would default to Light so your healing job gets easier, then swap to Wisdom if you are low on mana yourself (double up on Seal+Judgement for nice regen)
---
I farmed 1500 whelplings in badlands, found 1. Lucky you :)
---
All the healers in this thread complaining simply don't understand the warlock class design in the slightest.

First time I got there. Coming from Barrens I followed the signs I believe and they lead you through the path which takes forever and also displays some very shifty physics regarding a rock.

GMs don't usually make wild accusations, so it's fair to assume OP is in the wrong.
---
I am not into the dungeon drama BoEs bring and feel it makes more sense for everyone to need and if a person feels charitable they can give it to someone who can use it. If not they can sell it to them. If we all go into the dungeon together, play together, and win together, and then tell me oh well bad luck none of the loot is for you so if you need you're a ninja, that's a pretty shitty way to play as well. And hey, maybe an alt could use it so in that case I do indeed need it because I am all my toons, not just the one I'm currently playing.
---
What does that do?
---
dont lazy addons like leatrix cover this?
---
You need to get to the boss platform in 12 minutes, which is why a lesser invis pot is recommended.  if you do that, you can catch the hyenas before they take a 7-8 minute detour through mobs where you can kill them.   
---
Pull with aimed-multi shot and run up the top ramp on the west side in cheetah aspect. dont stop to shoot more than 1 time for multi shot and run to the end, jump down and fire another multi shot and then kite them by running up on the kings platform and jumping down on the south-west side when they catch up to u, then repeat the kite by running up and onto the taller ramp and finish them off.  keep serpent sting on all 3 as much as possible.

That's super lazy of you.

Why did you start on a pvp server then?

Back to topic: imho just call it a day. Quit wow and if you ever get interested again just play again. You have nothing to loose here
---
definitely but it doesn't actively hurt.

also, if it gets to the point where people gquit over something like that, then they're in the wrong guild/you dont' want them in yours.

it doesnt generate any discussion LOL.

Same here, I don't have a second screen so I put on a podcast so I see what's happening with the group and I don't have to alt+tab kn and out.
---
Honor System = P2
---
WSG/AV = P3
---
AB = P4
---
Dates?  Unknown.  'Attempting to follow a similar time release as Classic' so I'm guessing 3-4 months between phases.
---
The honor system will release with phase two, which will happen before 2019 ends. WSG and AV come out in phase three, and AB is phase 4.
---
Try searching wow classic phase schedule.
---
2h tanking is actually really viable for tanks until around level 50.
---
Yea I actually just found the podcast he had with tipsout, got about half way through today and was definitely the most useful source I've found on the matter so far. I was going to listen to the rest later. 
---
Didn't know he had a youtube channel so I will make sure to check that out. Thanks for the reply man!
---
I don't really remember much of vanilla and only really played at lvl 60 i  the last months but it happend quite often during tbc at my server people were running reserved groups so i doubt it started in tbc
---
Honor is introduced phase 2 (late 2019)
---
WG/AV Phase 3 (Spring 2020)
---
AB Phase 4 (Summer 2020)

In a year Blizzard will be selling microtransaction pets in Classic and the whelps will be worth less than they are now
---
Yesterday I almost died to a miner in Hillsbrad who was 3 levels below me, because I made the mistake of attacking him while I only had half health. Resist, dodge, dodge, parry, dodge, I only had 10hp left when he fled.
---
Honor should be added in P2, and it seems WSG and AV will be added in P3 and AB P4 according to [this](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-six-content-phases). 
---
The single timeline info we have is that P2 should be released before the end of year, possibly November or at least December.
---
Anything else is pure speculation.
---
Sorry, can you clarify a bit? People don't want to recruit hunters because their dps is low at lvl 60, relatively?
---
=
---
Reservations are a thing from private server and that's a shame
---
we consistently get 1 per try. We only have like 25 people and 10 ranged, so phase 2 takes a little while.
---
Especially not having heard about ANYONES neaning/review. Now with most games i will have heard all the good and bad stuff about it and that influences my experience so much..
---
A casual guild might take you for ony and mc, but as the raids get harder later on you might start feeling a bit left out. I mean, it's hard to predict these things, but that would be my guess. Ofc, you can always level the boomkin and then switch spec later if you have trouble getting into raids.
---
I'm not exactly an expert on priests, but I *think* a shadow priest would have less trouble than a boomkin? And priest also has the option of switching to healer later on.
---
Well did you?
---
Bruh what server has a stack of copper ore for 50g?
---
Tried and failed this. Me had a druid had problems with satyr :/
---
I get asked, I say: sure, give me a shout once u find 2 people to click. Then i continue whatever I am doing and either they get back to me or they do not
---
Part of wanting to tank is also to behave like a dictator in the group and that's not for everyone. If you don't rule the group with an iron fist, you will have lots of people pulling for you, running ahead of you etc.
---
If you tell them once that they will catch a kick and the reason you invited a warlock is to summon a replacement, they will get in line quickly. This way of ruling a group of people you don't know might be not something the tank signed up for. 
---
You really want to be a *leader*, if you want to tank.
---
a wolf is the best because u can use the howl to put it on the threat table without having to run it all the way to the boss and back. just use eyes of the beast, dash past the king, cancel the eyes of the beast and use pet howl. good to go.
---
Ah, should’ve figured you’d read up on it. 
---
I’m not certain about this, but generally you want to hit the hit cap(no pun etc etc) and then stack stamina, as the meta is threat generation and not damage mitigation. There’s not baseline as I know of though, but if you’ve read the guides I guess you know this already, so I won’t go on about this.
---
For dungeons both pala and druid is Better Than Warrior, so I don't see why ppl wouldn't be happy with them.
---
I'll take them over a warrior any day in dungeon spamming.
---
They already released Dire Maul, so are we not in P2 yet?
---
I feel like the problem is that they think 2h tanking is just as effective at 60 as it was while they were leveling, I'm pretty sure it drops off really hard around level 50. At that point you probably do need a shield for the damage mitigation
---
I actually didnt even plan to farm, it since its rarety. It just droped twice in between like 10 runs.
---
That's why I keep a spare soulbound Alcor's in my bags so I can need on them when they drop and say "see, I equipped it!"
---
Myzreal represent!
---
Dosnt work that way, theres a special script to it and i dont think alot has been figured out decrypting to using words
---
This is the reason I'm borderline abandoning my priest for warrior alt. I remember in vanilla healers and tanks were roughly equally hard to get for dungeons ( I played a DPS class back then), but now healers are everywhere so the bottleneck is just tanks.
---
Yeah as soon as I saw this i went and got the Theramore FM right away.
---
I must have missed that one
---
Not for me. I play retail about 2 weeks everytime a new x-pack comes out. I can go through all the raids within the first week (not at  the hardest difficulty). I never aim to "get to top levels". Thats just pathetic imo.
---
I simply cant do that in classic. Its a bigger time wall. 1-60, prebis, attuned and flasked takes more time.
---
So again, for people with a normal healthy lifestyle its for sure harder.
---
Doesn't matter.  As a tank trinket this is never removed.  You get healing trinkets in BWL that blow anything else out of the water, and you can go back over and over.  Hell even Nef's trinket is awesome for casting if you can get a guild to give it to a oomkin.  
---
This is literally your only chance at the mark of tyranny, and nothing else can go in that place to make you a better tank.
---
The price being low is caused by massive amount of people leveling and getting these drops. Once most people are done with leveling there will be far less drops and far more 60's with nothing else to buy.
---
Haha yeah, seems like blizzard took break dancing a bit too literally. Looks like he’s breaking his legs.
---
The Butcher or Butcher's Blade? 
---
If the DPS discrepancy between Cruel and the other weapon isn't very big you might consider keeping Cruel for the AP, as it will boost your MH swing damage + SS damage - both of which far outweigh the damage done by your OH weapon.
---
Wait shouldn't it have despawned like.. days ago?
---
[Titan Panel Classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/titan-panel-classic), one of my favorites. Thx!
---
Rejuvy gem.  I think we had druids with those in BC.
---
Eh, gonna have to disagree here. Herod hits like a truck.
---
Trash mobs, sure, I can face off against a single mob just long enough, but I'm not trying that against a boss (or at least not again) :p
---
At lower levels, the disparity between a proper tank and a rogue is lesser, but as you go up in levels, the tank simply has HP you don't, he even has more AC than you. When you hit the point where he unlocks plate, the difference is astronomical.
---
What's worse however is that ordinary tanks come pre-built with threat growth (their sunder armor creates high threat, heroic strike deals high threat, defensive stance increases threat, demo shout creates threat, battle shout creates threat, etc. etc.), rogues however have to hope they can deal enough damage to keep the creature's attention.
---
At one point during a dungeon when a tank failed to hold agro on a mob and it went for the healer and the tank didn't notice (he was surrounded by way too many mobs), I tried to take agro off the healer, but my damage was BARELY enough to offset the healer's agro via healing (I attacked the mob many times, with lots of SS and eviscerates, but they didn't turn for a long while).
---
Because P2 will introduce world bosses and they can't do that with layerd realms.
---
Posting about it on Reddit is a first step, so well done. Next is to keep in mind that the guild is a team, and in a team you should trust and cooperate with each other. Imagine you were the one to be in that position; wouldn't you be overjoyed?
---
Your team just got a boost, that's a good thing.
---
If you still feel bad about it you can try and talk with that warlock about it. Just say you're salty and that you really wanted to get that upgrade. As long as you also congratulate him sincerely keeping in mind his overjoyed state mentioned above I think it will only strengthen your team's spirit. Who knows what he might do to you as a favour?
---
No, I’m just not a greedy ninja looter like you guys. I don’t care the slightest what an item is worth. If someone in the group can use it he should get it. But apparently NA people are just a bunch of greedy assholes.
---
No, people want to recruit hunters as there as so few lvl 60 ones it would seem. Even in pugs hunters are rare.
---
People dont play hunters, it would seem, because everyone knows their dps will drop off in later tiers and you'll only really want 1 or 2 of them in the raid.
---
auctionator
---
I don't have the numbers, but there are plenty of pre raid bis lists. Take a pre raid bis list, and reverse calculate the numbers from those items. This should give you the base lines you seek.
---
At least thats what I'm going to do on my alt warrior preparing for MC.
---
Bustea's is ok, but it seems to rely more on grinds for half+ of a level more than most other guides I've used.
---
The original was so much better. Shame it got delisted https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2YTa6H50Jc
---
I am wanting to make one, did you find it hard to hear it up?
---
Yea this fight is an absolute bitch for healers unless you grossly outgear the event. Everyone should be ready to use a healing pot, bandages and all the CC they can muster - by far the most difficult stuff in any of the pre-raid content.
---
&gt; like a sub level 40 having 200g+
---
How did you know how many gold this guy have?
---
Try classic.wowhead.
---
I don't mind if they use 2H weapons it works well. Using 2H weapon while tanking is the same when I heal with shadow/disc talent. When everyone lvling and doing 5 man instances I think it's okey. In raids well f*ck those people.
---
I did not know about the layered world bosses, but that totally makes sense. Thanks!
---
We are not in P2 yet, no.
---
DM was an early release thing.
---
Booo hooo hoooo wahh wahh
---
Ah the guy who makes a thread for literally everything. It would be great to have a site like, I dunno, let's call it wowhead??
---
Probably still loot on it, in the video they got phased once it died so no one was able to loot it.
---
So should I not sweat about having a certain amount of defense or dodge going into raids like MC or Onyxia's Lair? It seems like hit cap and mass stamina are the two most important, and defense/dodge is just nice a nice commodity to have going in. 
---
And yea, it seems like everyone prefers a tank that can generate as much threat as possible. As far as that goes, it sounds like hit chance and agility/crit% chance are the best ways to keep threat on you.
---
Having more than 5 completed quests in my log makes me anxious, and I'm a calm person. 
---
Like when you forget something but know it was important and you can't help but sit and think what it was.. little itch between the shoulders until I turn them in.
---
I mean what if one is a chain and I'm walking right around the area I need to turn it in for the next quest in the book.  I really just need to do this.
---
Damn, those scammers are hardcore now
---
Ah, now I get it. blizzard threw me for a loop there. 
---
&gt; and it even got me uninvited from a guild as the g-master was the only one that did not know me even though many friends in that guild vouched for me.
---
fwiw if i'd vouched for you and the gm kicked you anyway i'd've gquit on the spot.
---
KUI Nameplates is what you're looking for. I personally prefer 'Plater' addon but that's just personal preference. Both are very good and customizable
---
Check his post history, he claims someone accidentally sent him 200g and 4 runecloth bags. Also makes mention of being able to freely buy stuff like gutgore rippers and etc.. on his first toon that isn't even level 60.
---
Then again you would be laughed out of the room for advertising the belt for 1000g
---
Tanking is babysitting, healing is the distraught parent getting home to see the babysitter died and now the whole house is on fire while the 3 babies are choking on legoblocks.
---
Your complaint has been noted with our customer services team, a sales rep will be contacting you shortly.
---
That's the difference, I believe almost everyone who is discussing 2-handed tanks is not talking about max level, but leveling. Max level dungeons for sure would be better with a shield in almost all cases.
---
Honestly Herod is a rare exception. I usually just abuse the stairs if i have a lot of ranged. He will hit a tank like a truck as well :/
---
I would say that actual tanking isnt really needed until last boss in ulda (not even then) and last boss in ST. Usually "actual tanks" are just 2h fury warriors in protection stance...
---
gnome rogues and warlocks are bitches who wait for me to eat and drink and then gank me even though im six levels lower. 
---
don't @ me
---
I relate to the opposite of this.  Alliance for most of vanilla.  "Theres ANOTHER way that doesn't involve the *__lift__*??
---
The point I was trying to make is, if you are smart enough you can trick the idiots who don't look at things like quantity or prices.
---
I'm sorry but I don't think that point about the AH being a free market is relevant.
---
Free market or fixed price - rolling need on an item you will not use is rolling need for the gold value, regardless of how the price is determined. With a bit of thought I've solidified how I feel a bit. A random BoE epic is always a need roll, no one entered the dungeon chasing that. However stuff like this, a pattern which has one drop location with a reasonable chance of dropping - it's the same as farming any other piece of gear, especially so in this case as the item produced is BoP.
---
Here's another question - if this was a green BoE enchanting pattern valued at 15g, should the whole group roll need or should it be given to the enchanter?
---
Maybe the healer is just not in the mood to complain. I can promise you no healer had fun healing the sorry ass of mister leather warrior stealing aggro as soon as the fight starts.
---
No I don't pvp
---
baby don't hurt me
---
If you get well geared dps theyll rip off the aggro instantly.
---
I bought gold in previous expansions and this is how it was done. They listed random BOEs and i bought them.
---
What? Just get mining and do the BRD/Sillithus mining runs.
---
Blizzard made pretty big strides post Honorbuddy to shut down the botting communities, by significantly tighten how Warden works (borderline illegally so, but nevermind that). So you are not going to see as many bots, as you would have a few years ago. Besides, Honorbuddy was getting to a point, where the profiles was so sophisticated, you would be hard-pressed to tell they were botting. 
---
Now, as it is with everything else digital; if you can cheat, someone will come up with a way of doing so. And if you care to look around, it looks like the next wave of bots are slowly starting to make its way into classic. They are using very different methods than Honorbuddy would, and a lot of them are still very raw, but yes, you can absolutely start to see them ingame.
---
Now, the basic bots are probably never went away. Fishing and farming bots are very simple in its patterns, meaning they are much more difficult to spot. Theoretically, a fishing bot requires more or less no inputs, and a grinding bot (say for ores or herbs), requires a few way points and actions as long as you are okay dying along the way. Where it gets complicated is on combat, questing etc, where botting can become extremely apparent, because you need to inject quite advanced logics into the equation.
---
Jokes on him. Good luck with the 10k bill to craft it...
---
I'm close to starting to level my holy preist. She will hit 60 having never cast an offensive spell. She's at five just from exploration, lol.
---
I like tanking, I find it fun. I like being in charge and everyother babysitting duty. And it's true that you remember the good DPS because the trully good ones are rare. But that's surely not for everyone I guess.
---
You could always reroll on a pve server. Solves both the reputation issue and the ganking.
---
Basically Crusader enchant, gloves healing enchant, and truefaith vestaments
---
No because ninja looter aren’t as common as you people want them made out to be. I personally think it’s just the attitude of NA people. A lot more ninja looter, so you invented that shorty rule.
---
Just bid and hopefully the auction expires while they sleep or busy :)))
---
Just for the record if you can get the night elf mount by farming rep up to exhaulted and get your alt summoned to the night elf starting zone pretty easily. In case you wanted to play a mage or something.
---
Thats 100% true for random groups. Thats why you should bring your healer and guild mates as DPS. This solves 80-90% of issues and tanking starting to be more fun.
---
Stifle your emotions
---
Detroit’s ok, used to be better before the suburban kids took over downtown.
---
Do you guys seriously not get that this is satire?  It's so beyond obvious....   I mean, they're supposedly 3 dps trying to reserve everything!
---
I've seen an MC pug being put together where all the epics and blues were reserved and people could roll for green only
---
Yea so I have an idea of a talent tree for a good mix of defense and threat generation based off videos and stuff I read. But as far as stat progression goes, for threat generation, is it just hit% and crit%/agility?
---
He's probably missing hit rating, there's still a 9% miss rate with 9 hit gear.
---
An optimized guild won't take you, that's for sure. Or maybe one.
---
Howevern given how even 25-man pugs raids in green roll over the hilariously easy content, any guild or group that isn't about "muh min-maxing" won't care that you are a boomkin and will take you just beause having one boomkin &gt; having a empty place.
---
For a Priest the massive spirit is actually very, very good. Only noobs would state otherwise.
---
Gold. Always gold. Always look for the farm that nets you the kost g/hour. If it was easier to farm the mats then that would be reccomended as the best gold farm since you could farm them and sell them. Its more unreliable, so you're better off just farming gold and buying them
---
I might reroll only for this ... !
---
for the most hardcore guilds, sure. but i do 380-500 dps on molten core bosses which is way more than what you need, and there are allways 4-5-6 hunters in our raids
---
Well the items are so low value it doesn't really matter if they sell for nothing. Like a couple pieces of cloth.
---
Nah man. This pet doesn’t currently and will never sell like you think. I know it was a big deal in vanilla, but it’s not anymore. Same sorta thing with stuff like Orb of Deception. People are not hyped over these things the way they once were.
---
K
---
You cant make a group in 3 hours? Lol
---
I always make dungeon groups by whispering people in a zone that is around the PvP required for dungeons. It takes me 10-15min on average getting a full group together
---
And even dare to look for a tank and healer with these conditions :')
---
The problem with the fire elementals is that they drop little else, while the value in greys from the earth elementals is decent.
---
Funny how these scumbag stories only come from the alliance side...
---
Clearly you haven't played a rogue.
---
EXISTANCE IS PAIN TO A VOIDWALKER
---
Somehow a sitr made over a decade ago with people that would be wholly unqualified today made a better site
---
If they kick people for clicking need on gear they need they’re bad people in my eyes, but I admire your faith in people!
---
It's really, really not.
---
I main a rogue but i do have a second 60 character thats my priest and im healing dungeons with. 
---
I dont care if a melee has aggro of one mob. If he doesn't die and the mobs die quick i rather have the DPS to good DPS than holding back and making the dungeon take twice as much time. 
---
Rogues/Warriors/Shamans can easily tank one mob. If the tank isn't shitty geared a healer totally can manage to heal 2 targets.
---
Usually its tanks acting like a diva when a melee DPS gets aggro from some random mob. It doesn't matter and i dont care either. Just press your buttons, try your best and let us finish this dungeon quick and stop being pissed and argueing with your dps because they aggrod a mob off you.
---
I think you can get out of the zone though, without completing it (it's a complete waste because the Gilneas storyline was great, but that's a different thing altogether).
---
Yes, that attitude is perfectly reasonable. 
---
I brought up the free market analogy because you started talking about vendor prices, and I was illustrating how the vendor is significantly different to the AH. As soon as you mention vendor prices you add another irrelevant dynamic to the argument when nobody is really advocating needing on a BoP weapon you plan to vendor. That’s why I said your other comment was irrelevant. 
---
Honestly I think the fairest way to distribute loot would be to have everyone roll on everything, then allow the people who would use the item to buy it off the other party members. Obviously this isn’t feasible due to the BoP mechanic, but for BoEs in pugs I don’t see why you would handle it otherwise.
---
That's because if you don't grind a fair bit early on you'll likely run out of quests at around the 45-50 range and later at the 55-60 range.
---
So? I didn't set for in several zones while leveling to 60. I did all the dungeons but only because I wanted to.
---
I already had mine like a week.  Get good.
---
i didn't wanna spend gold on it. need to do the scarlet monastery quest for the necklace rare just because it is a necklace
---
Blasted lands, burning steeps, un goro crater, both of the plague lands, felwood, Winterspring. That's 7 zones full of quests for the 50s not even considering dungeons, or just plain grinding. There is plenty to do.
---
He deleted the thread, but not his comments here. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/deunpt/lmao_someone_just_sent_me_200g_and_4_runecloth/  
---
Some people just want to take the easy way through everything, or maybe they just want to be better than everyone else by paying for it. Who knows
---
I've run it 4 times with 1st orb reserve. Its very easy to find a group and get it going. Even had a group kick a mage because he refused to allow it to be reserved. I got two orbs and used them for Crusader. Now that I got it out of the way, I'll probably hit it up for money makin
---
Whew. As a lvl 30 Hunter, I'm happy to hear that I won't be TOTALLY screwed.. probably. Haha.
---
I pick human cause I don't like the looks of  the other races. Vanilla models are ugly af (fite me).
---
Only other one I would play as is dwarf male or be female. Maybe Tauren male if everything on the horde side wasn't so ugly.
---
Shamans, priest and druid all heal late game, and their is more competition for their gear
---
yesterday i had a group blame me that im not holding aggro in DM and group dissolved after 2 groups.
---
Except i literally tanked what i could, but i hadnt even aggrod did they start damaging and healing. I had aggro of the main target, but the other 4 ogers where going wherever. There was no way i couldve gotten them back, and in DM, not having aggro kills, since the ogers hit pretty damn hard. 
---
Add to that that i was 57 and the dps were 60, but its clearly my fault :D
---
Implying I've ever waited 30 min for a tank for any 60 dungeon.  What's a guild?
---
Way to be a prick for no reason though, good look.
---
sometimes I wish I could ride on its shoulders like a mount. I would pay 1k gold if he was my epic mount
---
The only reason i bothered with putting things on AH that had a negligible price differ from vendor has been to get the economy going on my server.
---
Probably where the nightelves landed during wc3.
---
I knew this name looked familiar...
---
This is the same guy who posted a week or two ago about some guy accidentally mailing him 200g and runecloth bags. He ended up deleting it, but was concerned about getting in trouble if he didn’t return it.   Something so fishy about all of this, and also the inability to us google on top of based off his post history.
---
Is this the dance studio trailer ?
---
Really, as a feral DPS, it's going to be rare to find anything better than your BHB as well.
---
HoJ/BHB is going to be good for a long while.  Good luck finding a guild that will prio DFT to a feral druid.  You'll have to wait for all the warriors/rogues/hunters to get it first.
---
You could get an earthstrike in phase 5 to pair with HoJ, but that's a long ways out as well.
---
Number 1: If you pull it, you tank it.
---
The OP said it was casterS meaning not even a holy priest, but random DPS wanting to complete their collection with a robe they can't even wear and not sell because it's BoP.
---
They probably just wanted to sell the recipe themselves.
---
Honestly it's pretty good for tanks to help with threat generation. At least that's what the tanks in my guild told me.
---
There is pride in posting what is not perfect, in many ways it is a lot better than the all too common photoshopped perfect pictures often posted XD
---
No-Longer horder as i swapped side with the restart of wow for a fresh experience but that right there is a perfect horde pumpkin :)
---
/Thumbs up
---
Ive had about 80 hoj attempts and finally got it today. Had 2 other warriors and a shaman rolling for it and i won. I was exctatic. I mastered brd at that point and could tank it with eyes closed. Knew aggro range for each mob for each room and respetive levels. Keep grindin'
---
this is my favorite comment on all of reddit.
---
You don't need that much for rag you need 200+ unbuffed. If you get to 250 you have a 22% chance to resist 100% and almost all the rest is 75% resist. Even 50% only has a bit of a %. Taking 100% is a 1% 25 is a 7%
---
Good for you? Are you starved of attention or something?
---
I don't agree with the logic. 
---
Treating BoE items as BoP items does nothing valuable except add half a dozen potential problems.
---
It's tradeable, and exactly equal in value to everyone, because they can all sell it for the same gold value.
---
The only way to be simply fair is for everyone to have a 1/5 chance to roll on a gold-equivalent that is equal in value to all of them.
---
You don't need to open yourself up to ninjas, or guess the intent of a player, or check to see whether it's on the AH later, or whether they try to sell it on trade chat. 
---
Nah. Everyone /rolls. It seems silly that it's OK to /roll for a chest with an unknown value (and by definition potentially unequal in value to everyone) but not OK to roll for a BoE with a known value that is guaranteed to be exactly the same for every player.
---
Of course none of this makes sense for BoP items, because you are *forced* to do the dungeon for these items, and *must* be equipped on the spot, and *must* have everyone play along for everyone to get loot that is worth differently to different people.
---
My server usually has 14 devilsaur at 98g total. Every 3 days I use the refined salt to make the devilsaur leggings. I turn that 98g into 128g every time.
---
So you don't actually play tanks? Like do you even realize how shitty it is to play a tank if everyone grabs your aggro and you stand there with no rage? It's no fun at all.
---
Also personally every run where dps don't grab aggro is a lot smoother. I as healer have to heal far less, can do damage as well and the runs are super smooth. As soon as bad dps start to grab aggro everything is all over the place, I have to dump needless amount of mana in healing their sorry ass and the run takes ultra long.
---
Where do you think “Scale of Onyxia” comes from?
---
I just wanted a pat on the head too. ok
---
This 100%.  Owl/bat i believe has the best base stats for extra aggro of those.   
---
Im 60, MM specced with 10 MC epics, and rhok delar, i can keep autoing and multishotting without pulling aggro unless i go on a critting spree.  screech is incredible.  
---
My brokentooth doesnt stand a chance compared to the my owl's threat generation, nobody does.
---
You can’t play and talk shit on reddit at the same time, though.
---
Unless... that would explain why some players are so bad...
---
Me and most of my friends who are veteran players hit 60 in between 8-10 days played. Although alot depends on class a mage will obviously level faster then a warrior.
---
LFG means “Looking For Grandmas” people use it to try and find other elderly gamers to play with.

RTFFAQ - read the favorite frequently asked questions

Thats a bit of a steep price

How about 10,99$?
---
Hmmm, that doesn’t seem right.
---
Maybe I should look at the BiS lists and loot tables.
---
And i hope u know aswell that the staff is a reference aswell to lost vikings as the name of the shaft and medallion is lost viking backwards
---
when you really want to make sure blizz wont suspect your gold purchase for real money
---
[wowclassicbis](https://wowclassicbis.com) is an option. Combined with Wowhead and other class specific guides, it should be fairly manageable to figure out what the different classes look for in gear.
---
Back in Vanilla I don't remember anyone ever "reserving" anything... Was it just my realm?
---
go on?
---
Yes, you are pretty much the defenition of ninja..
---
I'm surprised people don't feel these are worth 1k. On gehennas EU, the molten core BoE epics range from 250g to easily 1k and above.
---
Ah, the classic “I don’t understand my class so I NEED on anything I can use and sort it out later”
---
Hahaha, get rekt loser.
---
I can certainly understand the allure of Classic and why so many have returned to the game for it. Never experienced WoW, but playing Pally has been interesting to say the least. The world, mechanics, actual progression and more sets apart the game for sure. Enjoying my experience so far, lvl51.. just don’t know if I can stick with Paladin forever haha we will see!
---

If you bought gold and then proceeded to buy their overpriced BOEs off the AH then you lost your money AND the gold
---
I didn't know Demoralising shout caused threat, that's nice to know. 
---
On the successful(ish) attempt we had the mages sheep one of the adds, while I tanked the boss and the second add, then had them burn the adds one at a time. Although one of the mages just stuck on the boss the whole time :/
---
Spirit while leveling is basicly as good as strength for warriors btw. The health generation creates alot less downtime in between mobs.
---

---
What exactly is untrustworthy about making clear rules that state "BoE are need", and then sticking to them? I can't wait until you people go outside one day and realise the purpose of currency in any sense.
---
&gt; So you don't actually play tanks? Like do you even realize how shitty it is to play a tank if everyone grabs your aggro and you stand there with no rage? It's no fun at all.
---
&gt; 
---
I've played tank from BC to WoD on retail. Sure i haven't tanked in classic but the concept is not foreign to me. 
---
Im not saying the DPS should aggro all mobs of you by aoe'ing the second you pull. Im saying if a melee tanks one or two mobs occasionally it doesn't matter... like at all.
---
If you can't hold aggro from at least 2 of 3 mobs than maybe its also a tanking issue. 
---
Stop acting like Tanks and Heals are the gods of dungeon grps and DPS players are merely peasants graced to have them party up with. 
---
Its that attitude that really sucks and is no fun at all.
---
On the other hand you will not become a raider eligible for loot if you don't come along to begin with.   
---
Also scraps nobody wants always get handed down to newcomers such as warlock T1 (PvP gear), choker of enlightment depending on how deep you are in into progression. If you ditch each raid immediately you might as well leave the guild and find a DKP one, because you will not see ToEP ever and getting it in your first raid.

My thoughts exactly. Hate undead and kill them when I can, hate gnomes and wish I could kill them.

Between the tail end of Tanaris and Searing Gorge, Un'Goro, Winterspring, the plaguelands, and a single questrun of ST, BRD and LBRS, I had questing to do all the way to 60. I didn't even do Felwood and Burning Steppes.
---
Like i said, i cant rly make a group for say ubrs, if idk how to lead or where to go. I leveled in sm from 28 to 44 and i made my own groups, but even then it took 30min-1hr and groups would disband very often (im not a mage or healer btw). Yesterday literally sat in kargath for 3h using the lfg addon trying to find ubrs/lbrs/full brd group, and couldnt find one. I even tried getting into groups that have some items reserved (another thing i dont like) and they still wouldnt take me.
---
What a failure, still he postad that blizz gm wrote to him about gold buying, need attention much?
---
This makes you an even bigger asshole lol
---
I would instantly kick you for this .
---
Oh for sure - its my own curiosity that kills it. I don’t have the self control to not look into stuff - and by the same token, as an adult paying for the games myself I think its just being smart ensuring a game is worth the purchase before buying. Theres positives and negatives to it.
---
A crappy boe blue dropped in DM West today the tank wanted it offered to pay us all 5g for it. We said if it's an upgrade and you wanna equip it just take it no worries. I will never understand the greed of some people in these games. Like a boe epic I can understand getting upset over that but come on.
---
Theres no schedule released, with the event being held in 11-12 days. That seems quite odd, indeed.
---
But i dont expect to have any classic announcements, MAYBE a classic "how it was made" panel. 
---
And i dont think we see Q&amp;A's. ;)
---
YTA - This is exactly the reason blizzard implemented personal loot in retail, because people like you don't have a clue what to roll on.
---
It's true tho, why would you share the loot when you can kill multiple mobs at a time or you can kill them faster than your auto attack ret pally pt member?
---
haha yeah my bad. posted it backwards.
---
Only responsibility is tranq shot on mag.
---
His name is cooler than yours, sorry.
---
If you feel like you want to reroll you probably should.
---
Just bear in mind, however, that once P2 releases there will be an increase in PvP activity (the extent of which is hard to predict) and then leveling might be more difficult since people have an actual incentive to kill you except for the obvious "Read means dead", "KoS", taking IRL stuff out on defenseless lower levels crap etc.
---
Always agi. You should only get hit by fire damage during the generally short phase 2.

Won't taking the shield off make me even Squishier?

She meleed me (Rogue) when I tried using special attacks (SS, Evi) on her in p2. It's not about levitate. Other member of my raid died this way as well. New strat for melee - don't hit her in p2 with other stuff than ranged weapons. It's not a DPS race anyway /shrug.

Well geared DPS can do that to a prot warrior too if they want. even a badly geared shadow priest will

You figure out how much extra damage your crit does (spells do 150% damage on a crit, physical does 200% - before talents). Then account for your crit chance and solve it from there.
---
If you don't wanna do the math, then look into if some variation of the old pserver addon TheoryCraft works. I haven't gotten it to work, but it used to show DPS for a given spell, along with other things.
---
Honestly I love the fuck up fights. In UD strat we pulled a mob of the elites and skellies and then a zomb pat and abom pat and once. Was pure fucking chaos but we pulled through cuz of 2 mages. I love shit show pulls where I have to check so much aggro and everyone has to make plays
---
no, its BoP (bound on pickup)
---
Could u explain how you did that?

Pre-bis is short for "pre-raid BiS". It is the best quest, reputation, crafted, dungeon, or raid BoE gear you can have before you enter the initial raid of an expansion. In this case, Molten Core.

Hahahaha don’t buy gold you trash can player

Managed a third class citizen Onyxia raid yesterday. The guild that "organized" it (I've never seen more than 4 of them online any time they were making a pug) ~~ninjaed~~reserved most of the loot. The raid had two warriors, one druid, three shamans, one lock, two priests, the rest were raid rejects (classes that there are too many of): hunters, rogues and mages.
---
I'm now focusing on leveling a warrior.
---
Thanks to the Light I don't have to deal with blood fury.
---
I'd also look at the estimated times for retail 8.3, which lines up pretty well with your guesses. I would think they would try to alternate content between the two games, as some do play both.
---
Dal'Rends MH isn't coupe of dungeons xD, this image is fucking gold though

So they are forming a 5 man group for wailing caverns and need a damage dealer and a tank.

Traded Ekeler this week for James Conner
---
It literally is the most basic concept in economics - using currency to represent the value of items. 200g represents many different items of equal value (which can be resold for the SAME PRICE)*,* each of which will only be used by certain classes. If the item that drops happens to be for casters, the warrior can sell it to the caster and buy an item of equal value. If its the other way around, the caster can sell it. I don't see how its so hard for you idiots to grasp this extremely simple concept. It really makes me wonder if you have ever bought something for yourself in real life.
---
Oh. Well... shit. :(
---
Deadly takes a debuff slot, which you are not allowed to do. There are a maximum 16 debuffs per enemy in Classic, so debuff slots are reserved for other stuff.

Use IP on off-hand and let Shaman put Windfury on your main hand.

Is that an add-on you use to highlight the class colour in chat? Super useful either way.

You can't just assume genders... This is 2019 m8:)

Best thing you can do is join a good guild. Was in the same spot you are, then I joined a very active raiding guild. It changed the entire game experience, there’s always 25+ level 60s on at all times looking to do the same content as me. We all goo in discord and blast through dungeons light years faster than any pugs I did.

---
Unfortunately, warriors are just insanely gear dependent so it's going to be rough until you get some stats on your character.  
---
That said, arms offers nothing to make you tankier (except for the 2% parry chance) so your tree isn't helping you do much unless you're stance dancing.  
---
I can't remember what level you get demoralizing shout / thunderclap / taunt / sunder, but those are the only things i'd recommend doing at your current level. I'm no warrior expert but I've been leveling one and the amount of time I spend in defensive stance is very small for most pulls except bosses that hit particularly hard. Your rage is tied to the damage you take but also the damage you deal, if your weapon is lacking your rage is lacking, if your rage and weapon are lacking your aggro is VERY bad.  I would figure that the reason you feel so threat starved is because you're dumping it into things like shield block and revenge instead of sunders.
---
A few tips I'd recommend from my experience  
---
1) Mark targets (at least Skull and X)  
---
2) Always charge in (if it wont put you in a bad place or pull extra monsters)  
---
3) Try to Charge &gt; bloodrage &gt; battle shout (if not up) &gt; demo shout &gt; thunderclap any 3+ pulls, the amount of damage reduction you get between demo and thunderclap is HUGE over the course of a fight even if it doesn't seem like it at first.  
---
4) Consider going mining/engineering, AOE threat on warriors is always kind of bad but engineering bombs help that a ton.  
---
5) Don't use shield block at your level, it's pretty much dog shit until you get 1 point into improved shield block (and blocks don't reduce damage by very much. It's more valuable later when you're in danger of getting crushing hit/crit by big boi bosses)  
---
6) Prioritize sunder armor, when mobs have less armor, you hit harder which gives you more rage and more threat.  
---
Most of the time my pulls follow what I suggested for point 3, then I will toss one sunder on each mob to get some solid base threat then swap back to attacking the priority target, using sunders as necessary. If someone pulls aggro, a quick swap to defensive stance to taunt then 1-2 sunders on that target is usually enough to bring it back under control. It takes some getting used to, but it's very satisfying when you get the hang of it.
---
And this?

It’s because he knows that you will sacrifice him at the slightest sight of trouble.

I don't play warrior let alone a tank, but I too think the Skarm videos and guides are very good - add to this that I usually hate video guides and much prefer reading over video material. He's very much to the point, not trying to push his view numbers with humor or idiotic behavior (like so many others) and his videos are quite informative.

Sorry not to be able to provide any real answers to your questions, just came here to recommend those vids and guides.

 How is there anything wrong with notifying people that you make social commitments to? Its not just any kind of "Videogame". It has social commitments hence the MMO aspect.
---
Sure, if it is Hand of Justice or Gladiator's chain, I might agree. But that ring drops all the time.
---
I bet you are a much more accomplished player than I. Me, I'm always slowly coming along after the good guilds have these raids on farm. I suspect your "almost never" is my "always".
---
He can park his ass eating with the rest of the mana users, or bandage, or he can start the next pull at 20% health and stay there for all I care. I'll gladly top off any warlock that eats/bandages, even during fights when I can spare the mana. But the assholes lifetapping and expecting the healer to fix their shit can suck it.
---
You say you're approaching 60, Id say keep tanking, collecting gear and when you can tank UBRS, then you could start with MC:(
---
There is an option, ignore channel invites in social tab
---
One thing about loot councils is that they can create a sense of "unfairness", esp in the beginning, because people with worse gear will get the good items first =&gt; People who carried the raid and farmed their prebis will be last to get upgrades
---
There is no need for prot pre-55 basically. Arms is leveling. Tanking while leveling will be your best bet for groups and faster exp
---
Watch 'Hot Fuzz' and be enlightened (and entertained).
---
They annoy me too. Thing is, when 90% of people don't use some kind of ah addon your actions will be listed at the bottom for all of those 90% if you don't put in singles.. And things often don't sell.
---
The only time i tested out alliance i played a dwarf this is so accurate xDDD
---
There's a definite case for that kind of loot distribution, some PUGs do it for raids.
---
You bid gold for items, gold is split 40 ways at the end of the run.
---
However it has a heavy bias for classes capable of farming efficiently. The current system is not perfect, rolling puts the guy on his first run on par with the guy on his 20th. Which stings when farmoling a rare item like BoJ, Savage Glad chest or Reed.
---
As pointed out, no rep farming tabards.
---
Your best bet, in addition to doing the quests you've done, is to look up on wowhead or other sources where to find quests that boost OG rep. BGs will be another source of rep once they come out in P3-4, but other than that, cloth turn-ins are your only option. Or get Baron mount or some other rare drop.
---
I’ll put in bids all the time but someone else will come along and out bid me.
---
As long as the dps aren't dying it's honestly fine.
---
I'm sorry Mr staker.  Could you describe the swan?
---
Hmmm....maybe I should roll up a mage alt. I'm not good with rotations, perhaps the simple 'frostbolt x 1000' is what I need :p

But then I'd sorely miss my rogue's toolkit :/

Gnomes only have 4 fingers...

All cleaves are 360. You cant evade them currently. People don't kniow if it is a bug
---
Dont have any numbers but i'd say a really good portion of people are still not 60, so 1k gold is a shit ton right now
---
Then again there really isn't a whole lot to farm for outside of arcanite items and herbs for consumables.
---
How does Blizzard not block the name Blizzard?
---
Glwt, tried selling 2 of these never sold.
---
Warlock class quests are also really nice.
---
Yea for sure, the thing is I definitely have been doing good with gold, currently lvl 52 and I already have around 600g, so I was thinking of what gear to buy vs what gear to dungeon grind as I get closer to lvl 60. Didn't want to blow money in areas where I may regret down the line, so I just wanted a better idea on stat progression before pulling the trigger on something. People in the comment section have been super helpful though, so I think I know the direction I'll be focusing going forward.
---
You read all that?
---
Okay I will try to make it reeeeeally simple so maybe you can follow along. 
---
A BoE item worth 200g on the AH drops, but only casters will use it.
---
Which is worth more to the caster, 200g or the item? 
---
If the gold is worth more to them, then it represents 200g to the caster. It also represents 200g to the melee classes. It represents 200g for EVERYONE. Everyone rolls on it, why the fuck wouldn't they when it is of equal value to everyone? The process is fair.
---
If the item is 200g or more to them, everyone rolls - effectively, the caster is rolling to make 200g *or more*. Everyone else is rolling to make 200g. Everyone is happy, the process is fair. 
---
Go ahead and point out how this is unfair to anyone involved, I'll wait :)
---
Reminds me of the WKM room in Post Cata Orgrimmar.
---
Personally I don't "farm" shit that isn't dungeons. Sure my 2 60's don't have their epic mounts like a few of the people I know.
---
But i also don't hate myself for farming those god damn Felwood satires for 6 hours
---
At the moment i have the same feeling that i only need the raid bosses.. But soon there will be PvP Awards, so if you're not only a PVE player there will be soon alot of things to do. How about PvP trinkets? Did you got them all already? Jobs, do you have the rare recipes or plattern, like me i try to farm crusador..? There will be always something todo in classic.. even if its not only for you, there are some things you can help your guild to become better and stronger for p2 and p3. I just helped the Maintank to farm Dire Maul for the magic tank weapon..
---
I've never done a dungeon on a private server and in my experience/memory of vanilla, we needed on BoE epics when they dropped to avoid someone ninja'ing. Sounds like you're pissed you never solved this problem and insist others are lying when they utilised the obvious solution. Enjoy.
---
Existance is PAIN for a voidwalker, Jerry!
---
Best bet is to scatter the first blink and run away in cheetah, if he doesnt immediately iceblock+cancel, you can combo him at max range and stay away from rank1 frostbolt range.  next blink use concussive shot and cancel his rank1 frostbolt with feign death and try to outrange the next one. if that doesnt work things might get ugly, but hopefully u got some good hits onto him

Are you gonna fight diaboromon next?

as alliance, enemy race affects who i gank because it affects how they treat ppl at times

Welcome to strat and Tanks haha.
---
My war hit 60 today and was flooded with "strat tank?"
---
I'm not the one who makes pre-bis sets with guides though. You're probably right, this is only being written from a perspective of people on the leading edge, but you're barking at the wrong person lol.
---
Still, I think most raid craftable and raid-boe items are too pricey to merit being put on reasonable lists. Just like I don't believe any pre-raid gearing list should include freezing band lol.
---
Not a huge fan of the concept of bis lists in general.
---
&gt; Tanks and Healers are often the more mature and good players. That really isn't some new shocking revelation.
---
haha if you say so.
---
Yeah, bindings dropped yesterday, one tank left
---
Nah
---
Lakeshore seems cozy. Lake fishing, mountains, forest just down the way. Not too fate from stormwind
---
Im trying to understand your question since I dont think anyone else has correctly understood it.
---
Say we have a weapon with 20 dps and an attack speed of 2.0s it deals 40 damage on average. however you have agility and attack power so you get say 12 dps from those stats. that brings your dps to 32 dps. attacking at 2.0 seconds. dealing 64 damage on average.
---
Now is your question which dps figure is used when using sinister strike for example? like is it using that 20 dps or 32 dps?
---
I believe it would be the latter because building stats would otherwise be useless for making sinister strike deal more damage.
---
And thats why tanks and healers are now charging CASH for their r, AND reserving loot like orbs.  They got all their gear in a week, and now hold others to ransom
---
So there are no stats yet you use words like "statistically", alright.
---
Now, I play a lot, but I've farmed somewhere in the region of 12k since release, and believe me, 1k is not a lot.
---
I. Dont. Trust. Like. That.
---
It's an even easier question, did you hold enough aggro to not wipe and no one yelled at you? Then you did good!
---
By the time youre doing WC he should have fear learnt unless he has chosen NOT to to so.
---
And aye priests can burn their mana pretty fast but once you can start down ranking your spells properly etc they're fine.
---
not to mention a blade bis for a caster usually has stats you cannot even use such as spell crit, spell damage or similar so there are no reasons to need on it unless all you see are the weapons base numbers...
---
Yup youre an A-hole... its similar to a warrior needing on a epic staff becourse it has higher damage values than his blue weapon which is also a douchebag move :)
---
Big cringe
---
Me in DM. Charge into flower. Pull tree and wipe.
---
Group: 
---
&gt; It's okay. Bad luck.
---
Mage walks through the garden, pulls patrol. Gets insta kicked.
---
Haha I feel that. Posting a rare drop or great piece is one thing. Ding 40 or 60 or mounts is fine. But the old guild I was in had people constantly posting "ding 26!". Like damn. No one gives a fuck lol
---
Use the a wiki and welcome to end game mmo content
---
If you want to see someone without a life, look at Frostadamus. He's got like 12k+ gold at this point, farmed it all while streaming.
---
You could in vanilla when you f'd up the bid price log in alt and straight up buy it, now you cant, but you can remove an item from AH even if it has a bid on. I freaking dispise this change.
---
Healer here. I love our guild's "main" hunter. We hang out in the back, he keeps an eye out for me, and he feigns the second he gets aggro. We're the palls in the rear echelon.
---
VC is deadmines
---
Sorry to break it to ya, lad, but 25 silver won't cover your mount. Keep vendoring trash and you'll get there.
---
I've happily done vendor trash farming runs before, particularly in the higher level instances.  I'll still get several gold.  Granted, the attitude suggests that he's almost certainly an asshole in general terms; but my point is that I could still make money from that group.
---
It's literally 50/50
---
Majordomo will always drops one of them.
---
With improved voidwalker it's actually decent at holding aggro, give it some credit
---
6 phases of same lackluster talents and cookie cutter builds with a few dominant classes while others are left behind is a good way to kill the game for a lot of people. 
---
This isn't 2005 anymore where one game was dominating your computer and play time and most people played 2-3 games max.
---
Now you have Steam, Battle net and a lot of other similar options with multiple games at the tip of your fingers and you can switch in a matter of seconds. People aren't waiting around patiently for content, especialy one that's already been done.
---
You have DM East jump runs now. Duo it with a healer or just spam strat and reserve orbs.
---
Follow Joana's guide
---
That just doesn't make sense though, this is literally just asking for certain classes that won't roll for the loot which people did in classic, but with the addition of people that already have it or would be fine without it but still want to run the dungeon. Are you willing to run arena/anger/golem if sav glad and hoj are res but your a caster? Why the fuck not??? Do you want those items? Just don't run it. Want to res those items? Be able to make a group.
---
As a healer, I’m fine with locks tapping on the basis I have enough mana to heal. I’d rather locks tap and do more dps and is move through the dungeon quicker than visa verca. Similarly, I recommend tapping from 30-40%, as in my experience one heal will heal 60% of your health, so to avoid over healing I’d prefer you tap lower. The worst is when a lock taps to like 70% and is still pretty oom

Tauren: Always chill, hardly ever ganks, if they do try to gank just /no and they will stop, decent amount of backpeddling
---
Orc: Same as tauren, with the exception of a few pvp gods here and there, and /no wont stop them
---
Undead: Always ganks, thinks theyre top tier 1 pvperz but theyre mostly just average, loves to teabag and flame, ragequits if they get ganked back
---
Yeah because a lot of that shit probably isn't worth very much. If someone needed on a 10g blue as a serious upgrade, then fuck it, let him have it. If it's a 1000g purple, however, then I'm needing on that shit.
---
Just let him die, he will get it. (In the end, I always end up saying them but that's cause I am too nice xD)
---
The lighthouse in Westfall, I want to live at the top, and nobody knows I live there, and there's a button that I can press to launch that lighthouse into space.
---
Alright then. I'm actually on your side that calling literally (another destroyed word) everything on the Internet that isn't 100% serious "meme" is dumb.
---
really?  I've seen it like 2-3x.
---
Happened to my group too, we wiped after the boss spawned, ran back and he was still there with two adds, easy kill.
---
I killed those things for 1.5 levels before 40, not drop there either. Skinned them all and collected a bunch of Small Flame Sacs that are now selling for 40-60 s each, depending on day. 
---
Ran around doing some Herbalism the other day in SOS and killed a few whelplings and actually got it. Sold for some 70ish gold, did not bother saving it for later.
---
Sigh, what a horde retard yet again
---
what about those who play dps classes like rogue and hunter? Are they teamplayers? Literally can only fit into one role
---
1k gold isn't a lot of gold.  There's so many brainless people in this thread who can't farm gold lol
---
That bias is always going to be present in the game as long as gold exists, and classes have identity. Also, if all raids were run that way the guy on his first run wouldn't be on par with the guy on his 20th - because of the fairer loot distribution, the guy on his 20th would have much more gold from selling previous loot, thus would be able to buy the rare item. In actual fact, it reduces the significance of RNG on loot, by removing the variable "can I use the loot".
---
You might wanna check out the [Blizzard ToS agreement](https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/b8a1574a-8137-44ad-acf0-11c92e90b26f/blizzard-termination-of-service-agreement).

In b4 it's a caster dagger
---
Ohh look at me, I am an OP spriest.  Grats bro!
---
haha what, if an item was worth 300g that dropped? youre telling me I should greed? everyone needs the gold and its not worth risking a greed roll
---
Played only BFA. Was enjoying it for about a month. Then when I hit max lvl and geared myself through dungeons, got bored with WQ really fast and by the time they launched the first raid I was already done with the game. Also, even though I got used to gazillion abilities, it always felt like I started reading a book from the last chapter.
---
I've played Vanilla since launch, lvled up a tauren warrior to 37, ditched it to play a human lock with friends that is now 47 and made a hunter to play with my gf which Im really excited about since I finally got her to give vanilla a 2nd chance, since she's more of a "retail kid". Even though I might get tired when I reach the end content, I have so many different things I wanna do that I don't see myself getting tired of the game anytime soon.
---
Thought so. The bane of wow as we knew it!
---
You can tank in any spec, it doesn't matter.
---
Lol, you Just did. :D
---
This is yet another example of what emotionally happens to adults, when as children they are raised in daycare.
---
nope. tried that too.
---
Casts the max rank aka the unmodified version
---
See, I've never really understood this argument. What makes vanilla more of an rpg than BfA ? The mechanics are the same and there are even more of them in BfA. Take transmog. That serves role-playing, among other things. There are way more races now, and 3 more classes. There are more toy items and items with special effects, and way more gear to choose from. You can carry all your pets and toys and mounts in an infinite capacity collection instead of having to clutter your inventory with it.
---
I'll agree that the world in BfA being huge and mostly empty is disappointing for a role-playing perspective. If there's nobody around there's no reason to even try and roleplay. So you could only really roleplay between 110 and 120. What solution do you propose for that ? They're already trying to make it better : they're synching everyone's level in leveling zones. A level 50 can group with a level 20 and both are going to be at around the same level. I guess we'll see what they do to improve it more. And I also agree that flying probably makes rp less of a thing. They're trying to cater to both kinds of players by only adding flying half-way into the expansions, but that's still not enough imo. Wish they'd just remove it altogether.
---
But other than that, what makes retail less of an rpg ? Is it the fact that you're funneled into this hero role ? Because in vanilla, as a human, you're funneled into this "new recruit" role at northshire, as night elf you're funneled into this "new student and protector of nature" role in teldrassil, every race is funneled into a specific role, and you're always funneled into this "courageous and heroic adventurer" role throughout all of the quests up to all the raids. Rpers don't care and they overlook that and make their own stories through addons that allow them to write backgrounds and share them with people. They can still do that in BfA.
---
Or, is it something more intricate than that ? Is it the feeling that you're in this huge, unknown world, full of places to explore, things to do and people to meet ? Is this what you're looking for in a game that you're not finding in BfA ? Well then, you're looking for that "wow newbie full of wonder" feeling that classic brings back to you because that's when you started wow. You're looking for nostalgia, not role-playing ability. If someone at the age we started wow with the limited knowledge of games that we had back then played BfA for the first time today, I'm 100% certain he would feel mind blown and excited to discover all of it, and years later would come back with nostalgia to rediscover his favorite rpg in which he first felt this sense of wonder and could explore this huge, unknown world full of places to explore, things to do and people to meet.
---
To expand on this, I was at 315 FR this week and was still getting knocked back on Rag. Additionally, even when fully resisting the knockback, the threat drop was still happening.
---
My understanding was neither should be happening. Is this normal or a bug?
---
You're in the minority here, everytime I've posted this question to a group everyone has agreed. Seems like this subreddit is the only place where people that think "need for upgrade, greed to sell" voice their opinion, because there sure aren't many in game that feel that way.
---
DM = Dire maul &amp; Deadmines.  glhf
---
Hey! Uncalled for, all weapons are hunter loot and you know it!
---
if its an twink item, people will pay alot for such an item
---
How does armor work in classic? If I sunder them and lower their armor does it increase the amount I can hit? Or the chance to hit?
---
&gt; I actually prefer healing 40 mans like MC because you get to slack on most fights. 
---
Yep, it's usually trying to snipe heals. Hot damn, I'm playing a Paladin and I oftentimes have to snipe heals on the goddamn tank I am assigned due to how bored the other healers are getting.
---
Everything everyone has said in here is wrong. They don’t all spawn at the letters on that map, and there is no Dino that spawns after 11 minutes always.
---
i guese i have bad news for you
---
queue times will increase when phase 2 is aproaching, because of the deactivatoin of layering
---
blizzard is hoping people will finaly start to migrate to other servers with the free transfer when the queue times get unbearable
---
I announce every time I ding and when I get a significant gear upgrade. People in my guild do it too. We congratulate and feel excited for each other at progressing together. 
---
If you feel so demoralized that you have to block someone for an entire week you’d probably need to see a therapist
---
I like the attempt to cover the name, but any man of culture would see the inglorious reference :p
---
Also, what a fucking moron.
---
Yes, paladins (and hybrids in general) seem to be designed around 5-mans and pvp, not so much raids. That's why we're mostly relegated to just healing in raids. Unfortunate, but not more boring than spamming frostbolt/shadowbolt/[generic damaging ability] in my opinion.
---
The auction house is gettin that deposit money
---
As long people keep playing there will be a quetime
---
Are you just arguing for the sake of it or just trying to get a humble brag out there? You're wildly incorrect if you think most people are walking around with over 1000g in their pockets.
---
Lol this pos was banned for gold buying.
---
I have the most vivid memory of my then Guild Master trying this out in 2005, much to the amusement of everyone in the guild. It would make sense for Blizzard to come to their senses and I’m happy to be proven wrong. (:
---
I just read this in the voice of young Sheldon Cooper. What is wrong with me?
---
Yes but do u think his total rested exp from 1 to 60 is 1.5 lvls? I cant believe i have to explain this. In 2 months he likely was logged off for a few days at a time and the rested xp added up. Also i was 60 in 4d 22hr without rested, but i assume he got by with an OK played time because of rested because i assume he is a typical stupid shitter american just like u guys seeing as i need to explain this to you
---
TIL I am brainless for having a life.
---
Those nameplates are standard in Elvui.
---
Top bar is titanpanel
---
Que will increase once P3 gets closer as that will bring BWL &amp; Battlegrounds.
---
You picked a full server or didnt take the chance to jump so you cannot really say you didnt expect this right ? :)
---
Even when helping friends I’m holding a grudge. Got my mate of 30+ years a Foror’s last week. Bastard didn’t even pay me for it. Sure he’s the MT. But still. I’m a healer, I can’t farm!
---
This isn’t a false narrative and my vanilla experience was also need if going to use otherwise greed.
---
Stop trying to push your experience onto others .
---
I’ll acknowledge other experiences to my existed and also that they are as valid as mine.
---
Objectively is it more greedy to sell something for £££ other people could use? Potentially, but that’s for everyone to have their own view on.
---
I genuinely do not know what is so hard about tanking compared to all the other roles. I personally heal but I will easily tank once I level my alt. None of the roles are difficult.
---
lol this is so god damn true it hurts. This happened so many times.
---
Well, you can stay in a capital all day, spamming /2 or pay the cut.
---
Or join the run, when noones looking get nekkid and mess up their run.
---
If warlock fear banish a guy
---
As pally BoP a tank/melee DPS
---
Priest bubble that warrior
---
Hunter lave growl on your pet
---
Mage sheep that nearly dead mob:)
---
Warrior "accidentally" hit that AoE fear
---
It's more efficient to throw a HoT on than wait for them to eat/drink to full every other pack.  They still have to eat/drink/bandage anyway to top up, but they dump their mana on the mob way faster than you do yours on the tank.
---
Basically the same, the Heroism is more blueish whereas the Valor is more silverish :-)
---
Well, that kind of confirms what the other guy in the chat is stating xD The need for gratification from someone, and therefore incessantly posting this kind of stuff in the guild chat. It gets old REALLY fast.
---
if the blue is considered bis for twinks then yes, if it is just a leveling blue then nope.
---
19, 29 &amp; 39 are the most common twink level ranges.
---
an item for lvl 20 or 30 is usually garbage but if it requires 26-29 its valueable :)
---
The one time I ever told anyone about an achievement was telling EPL general chat when I dinged 60. Immediately had someone telling me to stop seeking attention.
---
I like to confuse people when my midget is tanking all these baddies. Extra points if I use world enlarger prior to meeting the party.
---
I just ignore these people
---
Ah, thanks, that actually explains a bit. I might try to sell that ring via trade so I don't waste the AH deposit over days while it's not selling.
---
Warriors are tough to level alone, but popular for dungeons if you're willing to tank. Dunno about paladins, but I imagine they're easier to quest with than warriors thanks to having some healing abilities.
---
Why shouldn't they? That's about how long the phase 2 pvp situation with HKs but no BGs lasted originally.
---
Happy cake day though!
---
Guilds will bring at most one of each to a raid.
---
Fair enough.
---
I have a similar problem. Made 1 of every class and of every race. Leveled them all to about 15 and got extremely burnt out. Took a break for a week and started a female orc warlock (mainly for the demons). The thing that I found out about me is that I like all the classes, so I need a different incentive to keep me going - so I decided to max professions and have a go at gold making and since then I haven\`t had any thoughts of rerolling. So maybe if you are like me you don\`t need so much a class to stick but rather - a different goal? Hope I helped.
---
“A lot of gold” is relative. 10-15g for an item that will make your character stronger for 10+ levels (which could be 10-40 hours of time played!) sounds like a good trade when you’ve got 1000 gold on your main. I bought weapons for my rogue to level with and haven’t regretted it at all, and bought wands + boosted my priests tailoring as well - they’re both mid 20’s and leveling so much faster than my main (mage) did. Then, there are BiS items for twink pvp characters (lvl 19, 29, 39) which are sought after and presumably will become much more valuable when BG’s open.
---
10 seconds?!? Is this onyxia?
---
This is when I'd just go "fuck you, pay me". If they want my time I want something for that time. Either gear or gold.
---
I used Zygor as well and lots of quest items remained after I had finished the quests, so double check in case there are so items you can get rid of. :)
---
Is resistances really better than +3 agi on cloak? Just interested, maybe the +5 does more at lower levels.
---
Cant you enchant +5 all on shoulders by having an argent dawn exalted guy apply it to your shoulders?
---
If you have 600g and want to tank I would recommend investing in a pair of stonegrips aswell as some stockade pauldrons.
---
Both are very good and are only replaced with tier.
---
What? Which realm is that? After my guild imploded a few weeks ago I've been trying to find a decent raiding guild and *no one* wants hunters on my server. I finally managed to get into a third class citizen Onyxia pug yesterday and it was pretty clear there which classes are the raid rejects no other raid groups want: hunters, rogues and mages (mages probably because too many of them leveled up too fast).
---
get rekt
---
[I know that feel.](https://i.imgur.com/GykLf1v.png)
---
MMMMMMmmmmmm?
---
It's just much much slower if you're stacking 4 warriors in each dungeon who need HoJ. If you spread out the classes you're ensuring everyone has good chance at getting what they need and then good gear isn't wasted if it does drop.
---
It's 1-2% on 5 bosses, and 10% on another.   That's actually a decent chance.
---
Neither, and I'm aware most people don't have a whole lot of money, because they're lazy. What I'm saying is that for a level 60 character, getting 1k does not take that long, nor will it get you very far in the grand scheme of things, thus I don't consider it to be a whole lot of money.
---
People are way dumber than you give them credit for. Like to unbelievable degrees.
---
And yes, a LOT of people don't understand the concept. In their minds they NEED the gold they can make off of selling the item. #logic.
---
I can comfirm this. I am so happy my friends convinced me to play on a german server and not an english EU server or god forbid an american server.  The mindset displayed here by some NA players is so pitiful and despicable.
---
Night Elf females are pricks.
---
Well then you must be lucky because most warlocks I've encountered mana taps till they have %10 hp left then starts hellfiring and expect healer to heal them all the time. They blame the tank or healer when they die.
---
A few hours? Oh boy, lemme tell ya...
---
I love the simplicity of this answer! Well done.
---
Thing is they stood kind because you've tried.
---
I experienced similar things being a Paladin tank and not having a taunt. There's quite a few mobs throughout dungeons (first to come to mins is Gnomeregan Endboss) that have aggro resets. Not being able to taunt a boss(!) back is pretty difficult. Eranikus in Temple is another scenario where you absolutely need a taunt OR godlike DPS.
---
Not having a taunt turned so many fights three times harder than they would have needed to be but the groups understood the issue and kept fighting. Even when ultimately we've failed the dungon people re-invited me back the next day. Turns out 99% of a dungeon in a good timely manner is worth much more than searching other tanks for hours.
---
Is there a alliance version of this? A place to go and get something cool in deep horde territory?
---
Blizzard has said like literally 10000 times now. Layering does not effect que times.
---
You clearly have no clue about shamans. Tier 1 is effectively a downgrade across almost every slot compared to dungeon gear except in the specific case of the 8/8 bonus. You want to funnel one shaman the set while the others focus on maximum +healing dungeon and off set raid gear.
---
People like you are evidence of why non loot council systems are shit, especially DKP which would have split the set items up.
---
Yes you should. Everyone needs gold. BoP is also worth gold, you still don't need them to sell them. The value doesn't matter.
---
at lvl 60, 14 ap = 1 dps
---
if your weapon has a swing time of 3 seconds that would mean it adds 3 damage to its minimum and maximum, there are also cases where fast ones perform well in case you need to dump a lot of rage as a tank you swap to a faster weapon for a lot of heroic strikes, hemorrhage &amp; gift of arthas is nice towards fast weapons too.
---
weapon speed depends upon gear, raid setup &amp; talents but just never get a weapon that has speed between 1.9-2.1 as they are close to garbage aside from offhand if they grant good stats.
---
I have no issue healing dps.
---
Nope. 
---
A Boe item has the same value for everyone, the auction value.
---
A bop is worth its vendor value for those not equipping it and far more than that to those who can use it. You think HoJ is worth 1g to a melee class? So the item is now vastly depreciated.
---
I'd give you the vendor value of a item I need gladly if I could but if you ninja it you can't even trade it back. The item is now spoiled.
---
Staff of freaking westfall, the real mvp of my leveling experience as a war.
---
In the capital cities part:
---
&gt; Adventure areas - Despite all the utilitarian purposes of cities, there are still many treacherous places within their darker, more confined districts. Exploring these areas, you could very likely come across long-lost family catacombs, ancient sewers, or perhaps a secret society bent on rekindling arcane, malevolent powers.
---
Sounds like there was more stuff planned than just RFC and Stockades?
---
&gt; Player-vs.-player combat areas - Players thirsty for a bit of friendly competition can try out their swords and spells on each other in the combat arenas located in the cities. What better way to hone one's skills than against a fellow player?
---
I guess they scrapped that and just went with dueling
---
I've been seeing a few warriors charging for tanking some of the instances no one wants to do - RFD, SM GY, Temple of hakkar, ST
---
Sorry that might of sounded arrogant. I checked earlier this week cause I was like wtf is with all these quest items.
---
I had a group of people put me on ignore and telling me to KMS after I "stole" their chest out in the open world. It was in JinThalor Hinterlands, I was on a 60 and aggroed while trying to open it - when running away I came back and a Hunter was standing around it. 
---
He couldn't solo the elites and he was planning on attempting to freeze the mob and loot the chest (you cant loot them in combat) so I said fuck it and walked up and grabbed the chest. 
---
These guys were convinced I am the asshole, trying to pull the whole "I was here first" but the truth was I literally was on it a minute prior, just had to leave to de-aggro. Don't let these kind of people affect how you feel, they are always misinformed and usually assholes about it.
---
Holy stupid lmao. PvE realms are in a different battlegroup.
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't but it will be a Band Aid on a bleeding stump. The concern is that having released DM early and BGs to they might do the same with BWL and there is only so much Classic content.
---
DME lashers, requires holy nova and \~6k mana.
---
Pretty much every nameplate addon can be configured to look just like that.
---
Must be a dominance thing.
---
Or you could double your chances by inviting people who need something else. The problem is that there's nothing else someone would need because everything of value is reserved.
---
Dennis. Rodman.
---
Took the Scepter of Sargeras from Gul'Dan. That's pretty big. And then used that army of demons to fight the Legion.
---
Yea at lvl 34 you can probably unbind heroric strike and Rend (just memeing but srsly but them on a not so important key bind) spam whirlwind, sunder armor and maybe hamstring. Whirlwind is a extra attack next to your auto attacks and with sunder armor you reduce armor and fish for overpower procs and with hamstring you fish for deep wound crits and overpower procs.
---
I am pretty sure that is not possible. Blizzard doesn't allow said "if"-clause, because this would allow you to put your rotation in one macro.
---
People are salty about TSM because with TSM the "1 item stack" listings skyrocket. In turn making the AH unusable for almost everyone else who wasn't/isn't using TSM. Well at least it's why I hate it.
---
Hey, this isn't so bad and could pass of as something from 201..
---
*\* sees rotating\_globe.gif \**
---
...oh.
---
Sounds like it's impossible for you to farm it?!?
---
I ran a dungeon with a lock who needed on everything because he “needs gold”. Kicked his ass out after the second time he did it
---
Could you imagine the amount of xp needed for a level!
---
Would make gaining a level all the more satisfying.
---
This is all true and most of the tanks burned out on our server. I personally rerolled a hunter, because i'm sick of dealing with all the retards on a daily basis. The problem now is those same people go in raids and start doing their shit there.
---
Also hamstring does damage so if it procs you get a full deep wound dot on your target
---
Darkshire would be my go to too.
---
Had (Have?) my HS there a lot when you could go anywhere with different means of teleportation in retail.
---
Stitches only comes out when people are questing there due to translating the letter. So it will be calmer with less people.
---
Yeah, you'll have way better luck in the chat channels, since they don't rely on other people using the same addon. You can post your own lfg message, or whisper people who are posting lfm messages.
---
Anyway, I'm questioning why you're even playing if you're not really enjoying the game? I mean, you know best what you want, it just doesn't sound like you like it very much.
---
You can intercept the knockback... but sure, more FR the better.
---
He still doesn't know.. oh boy
---
I think you're wasting your time personally.  I wouldn't worry about it until phase 3 gets closer.  You could have made thousands of gold instead which is far more valuable.
---
If you currently have 32g at level 60, and consider yourself to be struggling with gold, I would say that you're probably pretty lazy, yeah. If you want more gold, just farm it, it really doesn’t take that long.
---
And if he doesn't do his job properly you literally sacrifice him for some fancy bubbleshield...
---
Alright I checked the spreadsheet and while unbuffed my ap was only off by 20. I did find that it automatically translated crusader enchants into the static average amount of ap you gain. So that could be something. But if you feel like it's erroneous, then you can either forget about it or see if you can find answers from the discord. I haven't used it for that long or really dug into its core.
---
Corrected for Mages: 
---
&gt; Number 1: If you pull it, you kite it.
---
The US mean price is 834g. Depending on your server's population, it could be more or less.
---
For anyone wanting either sash or savage i found the best way to do it is to 3 man with a tank, a caster and then have a healer getting all the boes/shit bops. That way everyone has a reason to come
---
Seriously, the auction house is so much more bearable with an addon that shows index.
---
I don't know which dungeons you're talking about, but in higher level dungeons, 2 mobs on anyone but the tank is probably certain death in no time. UBRS, Dire Maul, Scholo, etc.
---
Tanking in Classic is probably a lot harder than what you're used to.
---
A lot of tanks I've healed are in dps gear too. I'm talking devilsaur set dps gear. And if you bring it up you get told "you don't know what you're talking about" like in this very thread.
---
No that's wrong. Layers are only added or removed during the weekly restarts and the number of layers dictate the cap.
---
Not OP but i assume it's because he wanted to make sure the tank didn't need it, and if he did he wouldn't have needed on it.
---
You should do a bit of research ahead of your current level to find out what gear to go for.
---
For casters (mages and warlocks) the natural progressions in weapons is usually:
---
1. [Inventors Focal Sword](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17719/inventors-focal-sword)

2. [Arbiter's Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11784/arbiters-blade)
---
3. [Witchblade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13964/witchblade)
---
For combat swords rogues (which I assume you play) the progression starting from SM to UBRS is usually (and this includes sidegrades that can be skipped):
---
[Sword of Omen](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6802) (quest reward)
---
[Vanquisher's Sword](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10823) (quest reward)
---
[Jang'thraza the Protector](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11086) (if you're lucky)
---
[Thrash Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17705) (quest reward)
---
[Firebreather](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10797) (not that great tbh) 
---
[Lord General's Sword](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11817) (imo still not as good as Thrash Blade in main hard, but you can switch TB to offhand)
---
[Phase Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13182) (hard to get)
---
[Ebon Hilt of Marduk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14576) (hard to get)
---
[Mirah's Song](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15806) (quest reward)

[Dal'Rend's Tribal Guardian](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12939) (UBRS Rend)
---
[Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12940) (UBRS Rend)

It's okay to be new to the game and/or not to know everything. We have all been there. But, if that is the case, you should always ask before taking action. It's better to learn from others by asking before doing, because doing before asking might not make you a lot less popular. Just like you've probably learned by now.
---
This makes no sence
---
Lmfao do adults no longer know how to function or think for themselves?
---
Even without charges aoe spells exists. You could just have a bunch of lower levels in Blackrock Mountain to keep people from pvping there if lower levels gave dishonorable kills.
---
What is tribute?
---
You'll have to wait until 48 unless you feel like leveling up a Teldrassil owl.
---
I don't mind melees take aggro early so much (as long as they are following marks) because I just let them tank a few hits before taunting+ sunder to get safely back on top of the threat table. Mages and hunters opening with aoe, deserve to die and learn, I am not running after them.
---
Can't understand why you handed him two set mats at same time. I would have traded him piece by piece to avoid gettin scammed.

For the giantstalker belt?  Holy shit.  What's the name of that site?   I used to know it.
---
I Prefer to play with Gnome Tanks because they constantly have to be aware where they are standing or not be healed because they are behind a bump in the road or a table.
---
Besides Blizzard must have made the T2 Warrior set with Gnomes in mind.
---
Now have a look at how long it took retail to get that feature. It's really astonishing. Even more so since classes only get changed with a new expansion but AH overhauls ... lets make it a patch.
---
im pretty sure that addon isn't very popular, you'd probably have much more luck looking in general/world chat. Good luck!
---
Nice gift! :) The six demon bag is pretty cool.
---
All I mean is, if he clearly said that he’d return the items to you afterwards it can make a difference. 
---
Thanks for the downvote for that one little point though 😂
---
Just one of the reasons I run 100% of the dungeon groups I'm in.
---
It is not
---
i use the standard blizzard raidframes.
---
the addon for the healprediction is called healcomm.
---
I think this will continue to be a grey area until blizzard says something about it. I could see the people doing this argue
---
/cast Sacrifice (Rank 6)\*
---
Need if I want to equip it, Greed if I want to sell it, same as BoP items. I wish everyone thought like this, it's been a nightmare getting my archmage robe pattern even when I try to talk to the group about it at the start of the dungeon. I don't really know why everyone is so obsessed with gold, there's not much you can do with it.
---
thanks, i will look into it :)
---
I'm conflicted as resto druid because when the group is pulling mobs 2 by 2 I could be DPS'ing without healing the tank. But you never know when your group is going to make the mistake that will make you regret the mana spent to morph into a cat or cast some spells.
---
&gt; the warlock who does the death aoe I can't remember the name of right this second (which is embarrassing since my alt is a lock)
---
It's Hellfire, and it can definitely be used for good effect in instances if the Warlock is confident in someone else's threat. I've been running many dungeons with a Feral Druid tank, a Warlock and a Mage. We have no problems AoE'ing most things down with Hellfire, as long as the Warlock starts just as the Mage AoE burst opens.
---
This ^
---
You
---
Never will at this rate.
---
The last time any US server had it for anywhere near 200g was 9/25, and that was probably on a low pop server with limited buyers.
---
Horde better options?
---
Barf colored human, broken back longear human, dead human, cow. Okay they have one other race i give you that.
---
It increases your damage. Armor = damage reduction
---
In my groups ( were mostly Brd farm runs )
---
NEED ON ALL: Boe Blue, Epic, Bags, Librams.
---
Just to clesr everything up beforehand. No one ever had any issue.
---
I think this will continue to be a grey area until blizzard says something about it. I could see the people doing this argue that you can use wow gold for anything so long as it’s not selling it for real money ,but I really don’t know.You are completely right this could be extremely damaging to the classic community.
---
the first satyr boss?
---
his sacrifce can be line of sighted with a bit of practice, just pull him to the doorway
---
if you struggled with the endboss, i cant realy give you any adivce its a gearcheck more or less
---
Yeah I agree that pretty shitty. And trust me, as a tank i hate shitty dps... But i think that's just some passive-aggressive bullshit that's not *teaching* anyone. It's just making the run take longer.
---
The better alternative is to TELL that mage what they're doing wrong. But it seems some people don't have the guts to do that, so they decide to feel good and spitefully let someone die, instead.
---
I don't think there is anything my class can get from PvP that is better than what I can get from PvE. Maybe the exalted offhand from AV but I'm first in line for the staff from nefarian so there's probably no point in grinding AV rep.
---
I don't want to play outside of raids so I think it's perfect that this game allows me to do that. In retail you have to do a lot of stupid shit that you don't want to do just to be able to raid mythic, that's a really crappy system. 
---
Classic is much better, no matter how much or how little I play I'm always on equal footing with my peers.
---
The troll character really fits in this :D
---
I guess you should not buy gold you fuck
---
Druids are better at tanking dungeons than healing though. I'd say the number of characters capable of tanking isn't lower than of those capable of healing.
---
Yep, I'm going with the guy above me too. They could have stretched it further by stating that tank and heal spots are reserved too and that you'll be subbed out on boss fights and back in for trash only.
---
No we are in demand because not everyone is willing to put up with the headache tanking for randoms actually is
---
Imagine how many flasks you could have for PvP purposes that could simply outmuscle the 3second stun every 15minute.
---
At this point Tidal Charm is more like a PvP vanity item.
---
8/8 tier 1 is however incredibly good for hunters
---
Grinding 1k gold is what, 40 hours? That's why it's pretty arrogant to say 1k isn't "that much"
---
Why should layering affect the que? The people are all login in to the freaking damn server. No matter if 1 or 1000 layers.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I'm aware of the difference to private servers, hence the question. As stated, I don't care about exploiting game mechanics to attack more often, but interesting video!
---
Elemental actually becomes better than enhancement around your level, just check the next rank of lightning bolt and change spec at that lvl.
---
I'd suggest taking elemental mastery at first as it can really help in leveling situations, more than nature swiftness.
---
When you start farming your pre-raid bis I would then Respec to standard full resto as your mana will be suffering initially and the dungeons ramp up in difficulty.
---
Once you get some good raid gear you could most likely respec to elemental.
---
If they are not a well known BIS like Staff of Jordan, some twink items are going for really low prices. I believe it will get higher when battlegrounds are coming.
---
This is the one thing I find that sets vannila and classic apart. I played mage in Vanilla and as I can recall, mainly only aoe during BRD Emp run or Strath ocassionally. Mostly I was invited to pugs as essential cc (and dps). In Vanilla, most random whisper would be "would you like to run xxx, we need CC".
---
No one wants to piss off tanks because the power dynamic is skewed as hell. There just aren't that many tanks and when you do find one it's better to be overly nice to them than to wait another hour. As (melee) DPS, sometimes you just *can't* play the game because no one wants you and I find that worse than having to put up with sub par groups.
---
you can make a group where the caster get omnicast boot and sash, healer get the trinket, someone get gladiator and someone get hoj and 4man that shit, but everytime i tried i failed to get a caster cause they seems to be damn casual on my server
---
Yup. Im an experienced tank and that one drain life allows me to get 2/3 sunders/revenge on all the mobs and hold them through multidot for the rest of the pull. Im usually chain pulling dungeons where caster mana is always the bottleneck so both having the warlock free lifetapping while also not getting a significant amount of heals is the fastest.
---
Don't worry too much about gold during levelling. It will come in time.
---
As long as you have 90g at 40 for your 60% mount, you're good to go. I would recommend investing in 14 slot bags (10g for 4 on my server), as they will net you more money (store more, sell more) in time.
---
Hitting with staff is not worth being in shield-bash range, and now you can't heal when you need to and the group wipes.
---
The target? I'm pretty sure it's just the healers that need the addon.
---
\+to hit is as (if not more) important for tanks as it is for DPS. You don't want to miss too much as a tank. For my warrior at 60, I'm going to go for 3-4% +to hit on gear. This is relatively doable to attain with pre raid bis without punishing your mitigation too much.
---
Crit is nice to have, but I weigh Agi way higher since you both get mitigation and treath from the stat.
---
In the beginning I'll just try to get as much stamina, armor, defense, and parry as I can. Bonus mitigation will come from dodge and Agi.
---
Just reported it after failing to dismount a failed ganker who was trying to escape, hopefully more people also report.
---
Clueless asshole 😂
---
How long did they ban you? I have a buddy who wants to buy gold and I’m trying to convince him to not do it, if you got permanently banned then I think I can convince him.
---
As a rogue I like to think im a good group player when it comes to DPS. I always highlight the marked enemy before the pull. I will wait a good 3 or 4 seconds after then tank has got the aggro before attacking. Once marked is down i tab through until i get to the next enemy whose health is dropping ie the one the group is attacking (only if there is no secondary mark) If im pulling to much threat I use feint - if things are getting rough I have evasion and if its really bad vanish so i can pull back and bandage.  But I have seem a lot of bad DPSer's out there so understand why we have a bit of a bad name
---
If your shaman friend is number 2 dps while also healing you, then you're the one playing with bad players. If you're playing with dps who can't outdps a healer, then it's easy to think your tanking is viable, but if you start playing with dps who do enough damage to pull aggro and force the healer to switch to them, you'll start seeing why 2hander arms tanking isn't always the best. 
---
And before you say those dps are bad players, nobody running classic 5mans is running around like it's a +22 mythic dungeon on retail. Mistakes happen and they're expected to happen, but when the tank is running around as a fourth dpser, the leeway for recovery is much smaller, because he takes a lot more healing mana to stay alive. 
---
The fastest runs I've had have actually been with prot specced and prot geared tanks and geared and competent dps, because we were able to pull several packs at once and the tank could stay alive while we literally aoed the dungeons. That's something no arms tank can do in current gear levels.
---
Imagine being sick of running UBRS. All I ever see is "LFM UBRS NO ROGUES". Ok then.
---
He lacks the required knowledge
---
oh damn
---
Makes sense ! I have a bank alt who lists all my auction stuff. Low level stuff goes up twice before it is vendored or  D/E. the higher stuff for a bit longer.
---
The WoW grind compared to OSRS is easy mode.
---
Ahhh man, 40-45g is such a stretch, even with herbalism.
---
All depends on the price of Dreamfoil and Gromsblood on your server, I guess? For me, that just seems so far fetched.
---
there's 2 guys w/ it on my server.
---
1 is 150g + arcane crystal + my mats
---
i haven't talked to the other guy yet. i'm about 5ish days away before getting all the arcanite bars so we'll see if a 3rd person has it by then. even if it was only the 1st guy, i think it's an alright deal I have the wicked claws, the arcanite bars are about 500 - 600g and ~100g for the rest.
---
Shadow can do it too. Dunno if it's faster or not.
---
FYI gathermate only records nodes you've found mined, but it's still worth it once you've done a zone loop
---
possibly.
---
i've heard of Aux, auctionator, auctioneer.
---
How are you level 32 with all those FP's but doesn't have theramore?
---
There is an Addon to track your Mana while in Cat Form, which you can use to at least help with point 2
---
Yo what’s the name of this absolute banger
---
Actually had some guildies tell me that chatting in the guild chat with other guildies is bothersome and that I should rather whisper to them.
---
Like, tf is going on?
---
I dont know. Blizzard customer service has always been top notch for me. They're litrally the best company ive ever dealt with in this regard. Make sure you talk to them via the chat, not a simple ticket, and they'll sort you out.
---
It is faster for Shadow, as most of the Princess kill is down to SW:P, which does more damage and lasts longer in Shadow.
---
Easily done either way though.
---
It is not worth it at all. You want grenades for stuns and there are plenty of competitive trinkets that do a more reliable job in your non-PvP trinket slot.
---

The secret is to not give a fuck about dps \^\^ I just let them die. I taunt for the healer and I tell them to attack the marked skull and if anyone starts dps on something else then skull its his issue. I never had a single complain when dps died in an instance. I never had a healer die before I died ... 
---
Tanks determine the speed of the run. I hate it even MORE if I´m dps and I need to follow someone who stops for 5 min. every pack to mark and CC single ones while you know you can just pull through. 
---
Through.. I really hope I can continue tanking with my dps spec after 50 ... don´t actually want to play prot
---
I actually changed my mind on the subject recently. I now use growl+claw instead of growl+bite. Seems to be better dps, especially with the pet focus regen talent.
---
Way to throw away 50g.
---
The stare into nothingess is strong in this one.
---
&gt;Elemental actually becomes better than enhancement around your level, just check the next rank of lightning bolt and change spec at that lvl.
---
Id argue that with the gear OP has, enchancement will be superior. ESPECIALLY if he/she doesnt have full set of int / spell oriented gear.
---
"the reason you invited a warlock is to summon a replacement" - this is BRILLIANT. I have to add that to my "tankinng for dummies" macro.
---
That’s wrong. Many vanilla servers would blacklist you if you pulled this shit and no one would group with you afterwards.
---
for your guild maybe. 
---
it's a minor inconvenience, complain here sure, but just deal w/ it.
---
I use it all the time...
---
No fishing gear yet.
---
20 hours, tops. Probably less than that, but let's say 20 for arguments sake. In the scope of an mmorpg, 20 hours is not a large amount of time.
---
literally said it was inspired by a reddit post. Stormwind is my favorite city so thats why I wanted to do it c:
---
where do u see this?
---
Do you apply MS &gt; OS in that case if you're a hybrid class ?
---
Got it. So you play with bad players. That’s all you had to say instead of this long winded post.
---
Not possible :)
---
If I have mats, I demand the item itself from the worker. Give me that devilsaur leggings and gaunlets &amp; I'll trade you the mats + fee. 0 chance to get scammed.
---
If you are the crafter and LFW for devilsaur set, just have one of the item itself so you can give people trust.
---
Air and Fire elementals are immune to nature?
---
appreciate nonetheless
---
You saw someone with the Halloween ghost costume on.
---
There's literally no difference. Either you have a shield or you do not.
---
Because more people fit on the server with multiple layers.  
---
Every layer acts like an additional server.
---
While leveling, no. In dungeons and raids, sometimes. Pvp, yes.
---
I've been cycling between sunder and revenge. Revenge is great for threat.
---
I'm in no rush to 60, actually been taking my time and really enjoying it. So much to learn and explore in classic as a noob :)
---
*sweats profusely*
---
because mostly redditors are young and lean heavily left and socialist.  they want everyone to be equally bad instead of rewarding people who put forth more effort or are naturally better.
---
Spellcleave doesn't run a tank.
---
That’s because you don’t. No one here is talking about tanking in devilsaur kid.
---
Definitely a PICNIC issue.
---
Problem in chair not in computer.
---
The point is that for ultimate min-maxers, you use grenades AND this trinket.
---
Look at ur servers discord
---
damn, is this what it feels like to be a "user"
---
I will lock this one away. Good acronym.
---
Considering one level can take 5 to 7 hours (or more on pvp realms), I see nothing wrong in celebrating it.
---
Yessss. My wife and I have been debating the question asked by this thread since we started playing classic, and dungeon finder is a great example of the larger problem in my mind for just the reasons you’ve said.  It’s funny to me too, because I’m a wrathbaby originally.  Dungeon finder was always a thing for me, and I never quite understood why the old timers made such a big deal about how destructive it supposedly was... until now.  Turns out I infinitely prefer a world without dungeon finder.  I’m so much closer with my guildies because I’m grouping with them every day to do dungeons.  Not to mention all the random non-guildies I’ve grouped with as well; I still regularly play with at least a few people that I met in dungeons before even hitting 60.  The social aspect of classic has been huge to me; in all the time that I was actually playing retail, I never experienced such a level of server community as I feel now, and I think dungeon finder and cross realm zones went a long way towards destroying that.  It just boggles my mind that Blizzard ruined it like that, like they had such a good thing and they wrecked it in the name of convenience—but you’re right, it was a gradual process, kind of a death by a thousand cuts.
---
a little bit of north STV but skip if you are getting pvp camped
---
gnomeregan -once/twice
---
hillsbrad foothills has few quests
---
RFK - once
---
shimmering flats - plenty of quests
---
desolace at like 35/36 - plenty of quests
---
SM-Lib/Arms/Cath - Arms has no drops but decent exp, for Cath avoid Spellcleave
---
The Warrior is Arms 31/20/0 and I am Elemental 31/0/20.
---
Yes we both use an Oil of Immolation for the Imp Adds on the last boss as the two dynamites arent quite enough to kill them. (depending on how the fight goes and you're still floating a lot of Mana you can also use Fire Nova Totem instead of one dynamite and the two oils)
---
I even ask "Is it okay i I need on that?" in guild runs where we have a standing rule "Need if you need. Money is greed".    
---
(For off-spec we have the addendum that primary spec takes priority)
---
When you have to heal them is the worst, because its concerting your mana to their mana, and your mana as a healer is arguably a lot more important
---
Most people can't pull off 50g and hour, not everyone or every class can do Tribute runs. In the scope of someone having a social life, 40 hours is definitely a pretty significant time investment, especially when you consider those 40 hours are essentially mindless grinding.
---
I also feel it seems like a very regional difference. It would make for an interesting scientific study to find correlation between views on this and political views IRL.
---
The people in the All Need camp seem to be preoccupied with the value they lose, whereas the people on the other side are more preoccupied with the "what if I'm the one who needs the BoE as an immediate gear upgrade".
---
I feel like it could be linked to attutudes of for example health care, where in European countries it is often funded by taxes (people agree to fund a system based on solidarity "in case they themselves need it one day" vs the mostly privatised "I want to get the insurance that suits me best according to my needs and means" system of NA.
---
Error between seat and keyboard
---
No. This is a fix for a very popular exploit back in the first year of vanilla OG. People were using teleport hacks to collect all mobs in a dungeon (with a mage) at one Spot, and then kill them all with Blizzard without the mobs being able to reach / hit them as they were hovering in the air (hack).
---
In order to stop this hack, blizzard basically removed the range limit for mobs up to the sky (so that the people doing the exploit wouldn't be able to do this anymore). This stayed in the game as a precaution against this type of exploit until today. It worked but introduced some weird behavior with some encounters. Before this was introduced (don't remember in which of the first patches), Ony would also not hit anyone melee whilst in the air.
---
The problem is that we have no real clarification from Blizzard, i hope it is illegal but we dont have any.
---
It's not true. Just say you don't know the way or the packs and let somebody explain it,mark for you and tell you which packs to pull.
---

they wount let 9000 people that are now on 2 layers be on one,
---
so they will reduce the server cap to 6000 on the last remaining layer, thats why there will be bigger queues again
---
Growl + Bite = aggro  
---
Growl + Claw = higher dps until focus is drowned
---
idk about the membership card sorry
---
Were they ever worth buying in Vanilla?
---
They are selling gold from a different game for real money
---
Agreed however there are a few good SP pieces that are BOE and relatively cheap usually like the Dreamweave set. For the rest just get some heavy int/spi greens or blues lying around. There are some cloth boots from tanaris as well... And quite a lot of good mail when you start BRD.
---
It takes a really good weapon for enhancement to take over so unless you have Kang or executioner I'd switch to elemental around that level. Ymmv, just my experience.
---
i'll keep that in mind. thank you
---
Groups kicking people you don't like is such a power trip. Got a rogue kicked from a run because he wouldn't open a lockbox for me. That kinda power goes straight to your head.

You can upload or copy the image link and paste it to Google Image search for the original one btw. (There's a little camera icon on the left inside search bar) Works like a charm.

Oh yeah for sure, I'm mostly talking about regular dungeon groups where the tank pulls a pack at a time. Also, they should be switching to their shield and then tab sundering once they've generated all their AOE threat
---
At what level can a warrior or paladin solo angerforge for hoij?
---
setting up runs is a pain in the ass cause any caster that wants in will want arena, and other melees will roll against you.
---
Do you need t2++ gear to be able to solo this dude?
---
I disagree with you 100%
---
Says the guy who's playing with dps who are losing to a shaman who isn't even doing dps full time because he's healing. Maybe you guys are just amazing, top 0.0001% players, so please don't go around spouting about how viable 2hand arms tanking is when most people don't have the skill level to reach your results.
---
/moo
---
I think it's one of the best designed zones. Rich in well-written story, but also the flow of questing is very natural, very streamlined; yet without handhold-y feel.
---
Maybe they had it? In pugs you sometimes have tons of hunters, but a serious guild would only have 2-3.
---
I remember back in TBC when we farmed countless instances and basically lived in Karazhan, a tauren hunter who's name I unfortunately forgot was one of the best players I ever played with: from manipulating threat with MDs, using his pet to protect the healer, or well-timed traps and expert kiting to cc/relief the pressure on the tank: that guy knew his shit and was nothing but pleasure to run dungeons with. Plus he had that super-deep, resonating voice in vent which spread a feeling of "don't worry, i got this". If you meet  players like this, you learn about the difference between merely playing a class and mastering it.
---
I think without auto run I couldnt play this game.
---
It's like people want to take part in a community in an MMO or something.
---
Good luck farming gold then, i myself had 50% of mats ready by mining rich thorium before i realised noone even has the recipe, all went to ah for epic mount.
---
Sad thing is though, that the itemization in classic is pretty bad.
---
When 70 % of your item slots are filled with cloth armor, it's pretty hard to fulfill that Uther fantasy.
---
Of course there are bad pugs, but it’s not that hard to find a good pug raid leader.
---
How tf do you have 600g at 52?
---
Every healer and warriors can do jump runs. Rogues can pickpocket. Warlocks can solo mara or dm. Mages can solo mara, dm or zf. Hunters can solo mara or tribute, which is a lot more than 50 per hour, by the way.
---
I am as surprised as you. I remember tier 1 belts costing about 250g, defo not this much. Insane.
---
Probably has to do with the fresh launch, tier 1 the only tier out there etc.
---
It works much better if you see part of your game screen while Alt Tabbed. Run the game in full screen window and resize your browser to be smaller.
---
Talented cheap shot gives 3 cp, if you time your opener with an energy tick you can land two as for full combo points and a kidney shot just as cheap shot wears off. You're free to murder your target for 6 more seconds, then you gouge into restealth into another opener. It's 15+ seconds of one-sided combat that's easy to pull off with some practice and really hard to answer for most classes before PvP trinkets come out.
---
In retail, I knew some guilds in EU realms raiding in US times because of people in situations like you, but the opposite.
---
You can check realm discords and ask for guilds raiding in EU times.
---
If I'm going to buy something for 1k, I'd rather whisper the seller and offer 975 so we save 25g each.
---
It is faster to group up, when there aren't a lot of people  around, as you can attack the mob camps, not just individual mobs. If there are enough mobs to go around more people = more effective. + class synergy
---
"Guildies are there just to do the raid with so I can get loot, I don't care about them otherwise!"
---
Queuetime will only get worse since Blizzard wants to remove laying for phase 2.
---
Sen'jin Village in Durotar,  the beach is nice here.
---
Or maybe Gadgetzan in Tanaris, because i like deserts.
---
I been fully prebis for some time now, but I like to go instances just to get some cash in a different way than just the same farming. So the deal breaker for me here is the runecloth res.
---
Very nice.
---
&gt; Much bigger than 1920x1080
---
Seems to be 5600x3150. phat
---
cheers.
---
luckily i don't need it now. so i can grab/buy a bar or 2 a day and then get it done.
---
Why do you need castsequence? 
---
Just do 
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast intimidating shout
---
/stopattack
---
(Yes just #showtooltip works, without the name because of the WoW: Legion Macro api that is used in Classic)
---
Stop.. Please just stop... You are so toxic with your attitude
---
Nobody here is talking about tanking at all. There's plenty of discussion about 4dps 1 healer, however.
---
I've seen a couple on the AH for 200g, but not the giantstalker.
---
Soloing Mara is what, 35g an hour? That's 30 hours of non stop grinding, assuming 0 downtime. That's still a lot. I don't get why it's so hard for you to see that not everyone has 30 hours to pour into a mindless grind for virtual currency.
---
That is the problem, they seem to be "The same game" on which why its a gray area with NO clarification from blizzard!

---
Going to try my luck on here:
---
I have a Cat pet that I picked up but it won't learn Claw. It had Prowl and Cower when I picked it up. I taught it Bite and Growl, when I try to teach it Claw nothing happens, is there a limit on there number of abilities?
---
How much more dps are we talking though?  Like a 1% gain?
---
You’re an ass plain and simple,.. I would have blacklisted you for life from any grp I’m in
---
Chat with people, get a friendly guild and make friends with the people you meet, that's the most compelling aspect of wow classic
---
layers can be dynamicly be added or removed, and no, layers dont dictate the cap,
---
for example,
---
imagin 10000 people on release day fit on one server, 
---
they made 10 layers because everyone is in the same zone, but as people begann spreading they reduces the number of layers (still 10000 people online at a time). 
---
the number of layeres does NOT dictate the max number of people online,
---
when they go to one layer they will also have to reduce the server cap because there are still to many people online, they will reduce it to about 6 or 7000, so we will have more queus again.
---
Where do you get this data from?
---
Maybe you shouldn't be in such a guild then where people care about the progress of others?
---
Yo what addon do you use for disenchant material? I couldn't find something that worked for classic
---
Why don’t you read some of the well thought out responses on this thread explains how BoE’s are no different than gold before spewing your pointless argument. How about you try to argue with logic instead of emotion. I know very well what my class, and others should be using. Your probably the type of person that freaks out if a dps warrior rolls on a leather BoP BiS if your playing on a rogue.
---
Which is an amazing price for saving 72-150 hours
---
mhmm leveling a profession is wasted gold, it sure is a weird game
---
Had the same happen a couple of weeks ago, but got the Dark Whelpling. Planned on selling it but never managed to get it sold and eventually I felt I just didn't need money that bad anymore so I started using it myself.
---
So, you are a tank and your gf is healer. Your gf does exactly what you say (hence the pet, I guess) and you are free to act so arrogant. Well, ok. Do not expect an applause. You just do this, because you can. If you hadn't had the pet, you would be less.... arrogant (sic). Cool story.
---
What add on tells you the predicted ah price?
---
as i said i level enchanting so no vendoring
---
Why is it annoying? You're doing it here too with your comment.
---
Damn, I planned to start farming it soon... Thanks for the heads-up.
---
Thing with flagging PVP on is, that you always be on a disadvantage. You will never have the element of surprise, and you will mostly be attacked by people who are confident, that they will beat you.
---
Well, that escalated quickly
---
Doesn't scale well, but agreed it's very good in certain level ranges.
---
It's also possible they simply responded to your honesty. You have to start doing the dungeons at some point as a tank but the level range can make it difficult. However, if you are doing your best with the level difference what is there to criticize? The very fact that you cared about your performance makes you worth enough as a tank to keep going.
---
The number of people in a area doesn't change, be it 3 solos vs a party of 3 you stil need the same amount of mobs. Groups are always better. Take less damage, less food breaks + class synergy.
---
Anyone know how to turn off the bottom information except for AH &amp; Vendor Value?
---
Great, thanks!
---
Sounds like Discord is where are the real discussion happens instead of reddit, eh?
---
I heard people tried and it doesn't look completely out of reach, but probably not going to happen in the currently available gear as there isn't much you can do as a warrior besides fight him head on.
---
Ironfoe is objectively bad unless you're human in which case congrats I suppose
---
Gnome Rogues are 100% sociopaths.
---
they pick that race/class combo so they can inflict as much psychological damage as possible.
---
But we should hand hold dumb, instead we should ostricise it so it leaves the game.
---
As a priest I second this.
---
As a human who cares about the loot as it's low level scrub wars so far.
---
Though there is a good chance that the OPs lack of knowledge is going to cause more dilemmas later on in the game. Popcorns in the microwave.
---
Grats! Only 6 more to first talent point!
---
only need to replace that warden staff with unyielding maul now
---
I got to level 60 yesterday and changed my mage spec from the Icy Veins single target leveling frost spec to the arcane power frost spec but I really miss my ice barrier and ice block. Is there a suitable spec in which I can keep my ice barrier and ice block? Because I really miss the survivability
---
darkmoon card malestorm and heart of wyrmthalak are up there cause of mcp haste
---
Main war prot here, been leveling a druid elf to ventilate too, just picking flowers in the forest and taking in the atmospheres of the zones. I feel you brah.
---
Well. Not everyone uses reddit. Also not everyone uses discord. But serious guilds are available in our discord. Maybe your server's discord is active too.
---
No, maraudon is super easy. Even easier with imp cheetah, but you should be ready to turn it off whenever princess throws a rock at you.
---
For tribute gear helps a lot as you have to kill the 3 patrolling hyenas that does a shit ton of damage. They can be kited but catches up to you pretty easily. Be prepared to FD and reset, even if you don't manage to kill any.
---
The boss itself is just about taking your time and is not a dps race, but more damage means a shorter fight.
---
LFM=Looking for **more**
---
Whats a foror?
---
Or don't take a valuable raid weapon from your dps and instead just get an edgemasters and a quel and call it good.
---
Acting like quel isn't a top tier contender for tanks until bwl is silly
---
Too much insects in WoW food
---
For me the slump came between lvl 35-45, it was really tiresome and tedious to level up and almost cancelled my subscription. Now im stacking up quests to hand them in together and tactically using rested xp so feels way easier and faster. Maybe its just my imagination but hopefully for 55-56 this weekend....
---
Arms PvP is really good, grab some pve gear and a big ass weapon then just go to town with it. If you have the funds then grab engineering for some extra explosives. Best of luck!
---
I'm talking about well knows BIS items. Not well known blue items.
---
Guys, Flurry Axe vs Bone-Slicing Hatchet for orc fury warrior off-hand? I've met plenty of people repeating "flurry bis" but they don't know why.  Sure an extra attack is great even if the weapon damage isn't that high, but I feel that with 5+ dps and 0.7%+ crit chance they're at least comparable? Also one doesn't cost 250g.
---
After all this time, I finally have learned the truth!
---
Thanks for your input.
---
I do fine canceling my autos myself, but I'm choosing to look into making a macro to eliminate the possibility of accidentally breaking my own fear/incapacitate.  That's an option I have.  Macros exist.
---
but muh enchanting.
---
great game design btw, top notch
---
I dont think willpower is what he is LOLing about. While 2-3 hours works well for you, it is no secret that amount of time doesn't get you very far in this game. 
---
I dont understand the shit talking on here sometimes.
---
Depends on if (focus gain &gt; focus spent on claw alone). But should be neglectable
---
just do arena. it’s 2 extra mobs and a ~5 min encounter, I get it adds up but soloing (if possible) would take even longer
---
Stolen
---
Animated one on wallpaper engine, epic style.
---
I run instances as a healer/tank combo with my bro. If theres certain look one of us badly want we just dont invite classes that might roll on it, everyone wins.
---
Rolling need is also the only morally sound thing to do.
---
Öhm... Together with salvation I never loose aggro expect the hunter does multi shot to soon.
---
Even then I say wait 3secs after concentration and it is an easy game
---
Dreamfoils were 80-85s/piece last i checked (its been few days, sold bunch on friday).
---
There's always room for one deep frost mage in a raid for Winter's Chill debuff.
---
This is so great!
---
You can never fix stupid so it's better to take steps to prevent it than to just tell these people to fuck off forever.
---
Druids suck at tanking... I'm afraid there is only one tanking class in wow, and it's warrior
---
What threat meter do you use?
---
Being the class that can use it doesn't entitle you to free gold.
---
Sigh, now I know you're just trolling. 
---
Enjoy your 12k gold, I'll enjoy the 12k $ I decided to make instead.
---
Ok don’t even know what your talking about. Those are Bop’s not even BoE
---
you have no clue which servers blizz is going to combine into a battlegroup, and only servers within one battle group cross over for bgs. You cannot know this because blizz didnt release any information about this yet.
---
In original vanilla, battlegroups consisted of a couple servers only, and not on 'all servers'. What blizz should be doing is combine heavily alliance favored servers with heavily horde favored servers into a battlegroup, but is there even any heavily alliance favored server out there?
---
Also, there can be more limitations, like do RP / RPPVP servers cross over with regular servers? RP servers have naming restrictions, and RPers will certainly complain when their oponents are called inappropriately.
---
It's nice to see you describe it as walls you built around yourself. You're already over the hump acknowledging that!
---
Just remember to not focus on the negatives. Generally you'll have as many bad experiences interacting with others as good ones - but the negative ones stand out in your brain more because human nature is to torture ourselves and obsess over bad things that happened, it's part of how we learn how to avoid them happening in future. Shutting yourself off is a solution, but not a good one!
---
Focus on the good experiences. Joining a good guild is a great start but remember - even good guilds have SOME shitty people. Or even good people doing shitty things.  Nobody's perfect. Don't let it get you down, focus on the positive things being with them lets you do.
---
I dont know how to answer that.
---
I log in and start killing shit and quest
---
I grouped with people to dungeons but beyond that I kept to myself.
---
I think it's the book to start the Quel'Serrar quest
---
Zoomers have ruined classic.
---
I second this grobbulas has awesome hilarious people
---
Or maybe they're mostly mages now....
---
You know what really is disturbing? All that was implemented into the game from DAY 1.
---
It might not have been the most stable thing they started... but at last everything they promised was there.
---
Not as a "Live service". Not in future expansions. No "plan", no "roadmap". They sold what they had.
---
They're comparable, but Flurry Axe is too low level and you can't put the 2% crit sharpening stone on it, only Dense Grinding.
---
Once that pattern is floating around your server I'd take Bone-slicing with 2% crit for sure.
---
Yes but our guild already has multiple Winter Chill mages. Is there another viable frost spec or should I go winter chill’s anyway?
---
I'm really not but you're free to believe whatever you want.
---
Didn't you allys have another capital somewhere? That one with all the hippy elves. Doesnt it have an acronym too?
---
Currently leveling a shaman since i really love the "Elemental warrior" fantasy, Is Enhancement viable at all at 60 or are all shamans expected to go resto?  If so are there any builds where you can go resto/enhance so i can heal in dungeons but still fight stuff in the open world? Thanks :)
---
you should be using neither in raids, its a waste of a debuff slot.
---
I have tailoring/mining on my main mage and I'm considering dropping mining for herbing. As like Frostadamus pointed out in his video the profits from bars fallen down consideribly (RIP Thorium bar prices) and as I'm all over the place with my mage it's hearthbreaking to see all that dreamfoil growing around (and recently I found more black lotuses without herbalism tracking than arcane crystals dropped). How are your mining results right now?
---
I also have an alt (lvl 30 going to 35) with alchemy. What could be good second profession for him? Second tailoring for mooncloth cooldown? Was initially thinking about making him herb/alchemy but I won't do lvl 60 on him anytime soon and not-soon.
---
&gt; I only announce shit at 20, 30, 40, mount, 50-60. Blue boes .
---
jesus
---
Flurry axe only if you have the money to drop on it.  
---
Flurry is considered BIS because the extra attack that it procs is for your MAINHAND even if Flurry is in your offhand. So a fat slowboi axe (like Deathbringer) will get the swing when Flurry axe procs.  
---
Bone-slicing is an excellent weapon, but it's not nearly as good as Flurry.
---
I'm feeling like that at level 8 so this fills me with fear!
---
Sounds like you should ask your guild. Ofc every mage wants to play deep frost because they can farm and pvp in it as well, it's up to your guild if they require you to play arcane.
---
Can I play Fury in PvP as well? I really love Fury and don´t really want to play with a 2h weapon since its  so slow and the game feels like I need to wait 10 seconds to press 1 button ..
---
I am level 57 and I think I have 9 days already. Don't sweat it. That being said I am leveling with guild mates and sometimes we have to do quest areas multiple times. As long as you are havin a good time all good.
---
I’m not raiding on it, I’m doing dungeons. In dungeons druids are more than fine. But I also don’t see how it’s relevant to the post?
---
I leveled disc shadow hybrid up until 48. Healed everything fine and pvp was okay too. Spirit tap and wand specialization are your friends leveling .
---
I'm in bed feel in bit glum then I watch this video and I'm smiling for almost 2 minutes straight. Thnx mate
---
I wonder. As a casual player is it possible to get that gear status I need to be at least a bit viable in pvp? Also was hoping the 1vs.1 situation would improve a bit more, but I guess that train is gone
---
Back story here is OP was sent 200g by mistake and some runecloth bags.  People told them to send them back or risk a ban.  OP said they wouldn't give it back because they need the gold.  They have now been banned.  
---
LOL.  Karma.
---
I'm almost 30! Phone cameras are so good nowadays you can hardly tell. Ironically, I'm probably just getting old and can't be arsed with people moaning at everything anymore.
---
Actually you really don't want to use a shield early on, you'll get no rage and threat will be a nightmare with average dps players. As long as your tank is switching to shield when he sees he's taking alot of damage, you shouldn't really care about that. I have been tanking every dungeon dual wielding and switching to shield for harder mobs/bosses, and messaged my healer about it. They've always been fine healing me.
---
One thing about tanking : You get most rage from damage you take. If you block a lot, you'll get no rage at all and won't be able to hold anything. That creates this weird thing that prot tanks in their raid mitigation gear will have a hard time to hold aggro on anything because they block/parry/dodge so much that they will barely get any rage.
---
&gt; I think the officers are extremely fair 
---
Because this is basically what it depends on and all it takes is for them to be mostly fair and sometimes not. Because of how officers abuse it to gear themselves and their friends up at the expense of the rest of the guild. No matter the performance or participation. It's cool that it works in your guild and everyone's happy, but the system is just too easy to abuse.
---
Same, I think retail WoW killed the minor things like singing.
---
Because the primary point of doing dungeons etc. is the hope FOR AN UPGRADE. Not to supply items to the auction house. So when one drops, they should get to toll need on it IF IT'S AN UPGRADE. Which is exactly what they were hoping for, *and the point of being there in the first place*.
---
You cannot have epic drops inside pickpocketed boxes.  
---
You can find only money, rogue's poisoning items and junk items.
---
Cant you see that he straight up ran out of arguments to justify his entitlement for free gold?  Doesn't take long for the reddit mob to devolve into insult spitting primates when they can't argue their case like actual human beings.
---
Every PvP Server is Horde heavy.
---
Most more than others.
---
On the other hand most PvE Servers are Alliance heavy.
---
So it is going to suck if you play Horde on PvP because you are going to have to farm a lot of honor from far less enemies. Also when BGs roll around the waithing time will be long and you have to farm honor in the Downtime.
---
For Alliance on PvP it's going to suck because there will b ea lot of people wanting to kill them.
---
For Alliance on PvE it's the same problem as Horde on PvP. With the additional problem of people not flaging themselves PvP.
---
So the only people who are in a good spot are Horde on PvE servers. Enough people who want to PvP on the other side and nearly no waiting times in BG.
---
Hmmm, breaking this down and analyzing the completely asinine comment
---
I would assume that solo leveling a warrior for you was too frustrating for you to handle.
---
Its okay, not everyone can be a masochist.
---
Now go away, go play with people who pretend to care about you.
---
Loot council is great for smaller tight knit hardcore groups.
---
In fact its far and away the best option.
---
However classic raid sizes are too big for it.
---
And dkp is more fair for a group that size
---
this isnt the Trade Channel...  
---
get lost !
---
At this point I'm really curious who can find the most fucked up flight path available because this comes pretty close.
---
They never once have a logical argument against what your saying. All they can do is raise their hands and shout “but need means you need it look there’s a coin next to greed your selfish your a terrible person!!” Just once I’d like them to come up with an actual reason, just one reason based off of logic and not emotion.
---
The description for DPS us top nitch and I fully agree as a DPS nyself.
---
the most expensive fish on my server sells for ~10s which is the stonesclae eel. So thats 2g per stack that means i need 40 Stacks or 800 fish. That means about 4 hours of fishing if i would just get the stonescale and nothing else. It also only works if i were to sell everything on the AH. Also i would have to level fishing to the max
---
&gt;It takes a really good weapon for enhancement to take over
---
Well, he/she has Ravager, super nice to have multi target dps. And in that level range people want to invite him to instances to melee cleave groups, so enhancement boosts the group dps. 
---
The ele style of play in levelup is super annoying (for me), when you spend more sitting on your ass than anything else. I would keep on doing enhancement, but focus on getting more int gear from now on. You need those for restoruns anyways later on. And if you like the ele BOOM, style of play, sure its at least on par with enhancement.
---
I'd say it's mostly really fun but sometimes the sheer amount time you have to invest to get things done or to progress is a bit...daunting. I haven't played WoW back in the day where I would have 5+ hours of time to waste but now that I have barely 2hours things like waiting for a group to form for half an hour really sucks.
---
Even if it's no permaban he will lose the gold anyway. So it's a lose-lose situation.
---
I mean, the OP clearly knows what they've done is wrong they're just trying to make themselves feel better. You can forgive this behaviour at lower levels, but Maraudon requires quite a few hours of level to get to in Classic so by that stage many 'newcomers' should at least know what items are for their class :)
---
My understanding is that the extra attack from Flurry Axe applies to your next attack period, not necessarily the next Flurry Axe attack. So if your main hand is crazy slow with high damage, then the extra attack there is worth way more than, for instance, a super fast dagger.
---
I could be wrong, but this is why I think Flurry Axe is "BiS".
---
Of course, getting something much, much cheaper with a slight damage loss is also a viable option. It really just comes down to what being "best geared" is worth to you.
---
Thats what I figured.
---
All I can say join a guild if there are no RLF to play with on a daily basis. Playing on your own really doesn't cut it in WoW. Make some friends and try to level together. That is the real journey and it start right at level 1.
---
For the people shit talking, the Hunter was 7/8 Giantstalker and has been clearing MC since 2nd week of Classic with no belt drop. He lived inside Mauradon from launch and now lives inside DMN soloing tribute runs, the 8 set bonus is worth a lot more than 1k to him.
---
You always exit MC at the NPC, not inside the instance - even if you entered through BRD.
---
Bailing out from BRD via the MC portal is a thing.
---
Yeah, I figured those 2 are a must so they were the first talents I got. I have 3 in renew, 2 in pw:shield and 2 in holy specialization. I want to make my way down to searing light.
---
Can also recommend using the thornling seeds that you loot inside the instance along with stoneskin totem.
---
When retaliation is up I just use that, else use a seed at 60% keeps the imps off the healer along with some dynamite
---
Haven't played one, but from what I've heard they are something like shadow priests, good in small number to support others but won't compete for top DPS. They have bunch of totems that rogues and warriors will be grateful for, and for the entire course of classic you will most likely end up using [Nightfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall) which is a huge boost to your casters.
---
Those warriors sound like they're trying to be a certain twitch streamer or two. As for pugs above 30? I think once you hit 20+ or 30+ if I'm honest, you reach the curve where there are decent players who stuck the game out.
---
Yeah it's expensive so it's a raid consumable.
---
Does NOT stack with windfury so only the OH gets the sharpening stone.
---
1v1 situation will get *better* but it will still be pretty poor. At least when up against shadow priests, mages and warlocks.
---
They are eldritch abominations who live in the void and want to destroy all of existence.
---
i(priest) ran rfc with a druid tank, 2 hunters and a rogue. I made a comment about sorry for the all leather needs and they all laughed. 
---
what the fuck has happened to people (granted, of course rfc means fuck all in 5 minutes time)
---
Dwarfs confirmed narcissists
---
Level some professions, Skinning, First aid, fishing are all great to have. Cooking too if youre that hardcore.
---
There are two trinkets with armor in the entire game, this is one of them.
---
The other requires grinding Enchanting to 235.
---
I'm a level 53 warrior and I usually tank for the most part, while my gear and specc is all Arms.
---
Saw a group looking for a final DPS for maraudon the other day and figured why the hell not, it's been a while since I last did anything but tanking so let's try it.
---
As it turns out, my dps is absolutely fucking insane (did 300 dps constantly on trash and ish 200 on bosses, even at my level) and the whole group loved me even though I pulled aggro every now and then(kinda often tbh). Even the tank was all cool with it and even encouraged it because my damage made the run go so smooth.
---
So that was nice. Also didn't have to deal with all the responsibility and toxic dps players flaming you for their own shortcomings.
---
Now, tanking for that group would probably have been a blast anyway because it was a very nice group with a great healer, but that's that. Will try to DPS more often in the future, I think.
---
Way to get around this is create a gnome get to level 7 then get the tram to sw &amp; start questing from goldshire. And you’ll always be 1 or 2 levels ahead :)
---
I do not recommend leveling a warrior as a first character(Im 45 warrior myself)... take something easier to play like lock or hunter.
---
Take pace, match the quests with your lvl.... do dungeons and enjoy the game
---
The solution for that is simple actually, and I'll respond to that thread after I finish this.  
---
Flurry axe procs a main hand swing, but it resets your swing timer. It's the EXACT same mechanic as sword spec / hoj when they proc off an offhand swing.  
---
What I mean by this is if your swing timer is halfway through on your mainhand and Flurry axe procs, it will INSTANTLY finish your mainhand swing but the progress toward that swing is lost.  
---
The reason it's not noticed with Thrash blade is because the main hand swing has to complete for Thrash to proc, it can't cut it's swing timer because the swing has to actually happen for it to proc.
---
The best tank I've had so far was a druid, held aggro like a true beast
---
This was the case on my realm pre-DM, but since it released all decent herbs have dropped in price 20-50%. Pretty shitty.
---
This is aux
---
I mean Warpwood Binding from DM is pretty close from a dps perspective.
---
Exactly. That’s just why I find it so weird that so many tanks are whining about people who DPS
---
Ashbringer EU?
---
Leatrix plus addon
---
I like the fact that you censored your name but forgot about the character selection

I was talking with regards to healing, not that *there was literally no difference between 2h and dw.*
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
On the other hand the classes you mentioned are equally left out to dry, therefore if you know you are a good player, go with the proper spec for PvP, like to communicate and be social, then shamans and priests will flood you with friendlist invites. 
---
I never have a problem finding a good shaman who wants a buddy to actually do stuff in the world and in dungeons. 
---
If you are out in the world on your own as a warrior, it's your own fault.
---
Honestly it's getting really repetitive trying to explain how currency works to people who have apparently never had to buy groceries for themselves, but basically gold is this really cool thing that lets you easily trade one item of equal value for another item of equal value. 
---
THE definition of ninja looting is deceiving other people in your group for personal gain in regards to loot. I'd encourage you to specify exactly whatever rules you use as soon as you form a group, because any normal and sane person understands that BoE epics are all need in pugs. Also, that way all of you pretentious idiots who like to randomly call innocent people ninjas for following generally accepted practices and preach about the spooky ***bLAcKliSt*** can be insufferable in your own little group without annoying others :D
---
Most obvious gold buyer post ever... screenshotted before he gets nervous and takea it down... lol
---
Wait... i can use a gun as paladin? Just have it in the slot?
---
Great, so you can itemize for threat in other gear slots. Mark of Tyranny is the best choice here.
---
If your guild requires flasks, they're probably blazing through MC so you won't ever get to drink to full mana anyway so distilled wisdom would be quite a waste.
---
So you're playing with an ele shaman who both keeps you up with lesser healing wave and does more damage than other dps all while never running oom, as you mentioned in a previous post. The dps from a fire nova totem, a chain lightning and several ticks of magma totem will in no way do more damage than a mage doing flamestrike+cone+"maybe an AE or two" unless there is a serious gear discrepancy or the mage forgot to train his max ranks. What does "maybe an AE or two" even mean? The sequence you described of fire nova+lesser healing+chain lightning+healing wave+magma totem would take a gcd+1.5seconds+1.5seconds+3seconds+gcd (not to mention a lot of mana, but your shaman friend doesn't go oom so nevermind). Flamestrike+cone of cold is 3 seconds. That's a lot of "maybe AE or twos" in the remaining time. 
---
There is also no way SS+WW with a wf totem is "instantly" taking all mobs do 1/2-3/4 health unless those mobs are non-elite. Judging by your other replies, you're also talking about putting on tank gear but tanking with a 2hander. If that's the case, there's no way you'll be doing enough damage to top dps unless you're playing with freshly dinged dpsers in greens (who are the type to pay for runs, so maybe you are). All your anecdotal evidence screams exaggerated bullshit. And like I said, the actual fastest way to do dungeons is with a prot, shielded tank pulling multiple packs and three actual dpsers cleaving and aoeing them. 
---
Also, I'm not the one who's mad, you're the one who's replying to all my posts in this thread and calling me kid.
---
Bad players are bad, ultimately. DPS that AOE with no regard for threat or ignore the target markers can cause a wipe, healers who don't manage their mana correctly or are too slow with cooldowns can cause a wipe, tanks that don't know their limits or how to maintain aggro over multiple mobs can cause a wipe. 
---
I've seen toxic examples from every class in the game.
---
And thats why you should try to stay in eastern kingdoms as much as possible :P
---
Because 
---
a) they can not read
---
or 
---
b) personal style need.
---
Im not good at wpvp at all but for Fury [this might work](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LhhxzhbZVVzVTxoVo)
---
To me 50s passed by real quick. The moment you can enter normal BRD runs or start farming for BiS gear in some other way, you can completely forget about leveling, it just happens somewhere along the way.
---
You should have made him already beginning to disappear.
---
Ogres in alterac mountains around 35. Rfd and rfk have elites in front of their entrances. Most dungeons have elites guarding the entrance
---
Got it. So you don’t know what you’re talking about kid.
---
Holy shit this is the most accurate statement I've seen in this sub!

You should run 31/0/20 until level 60 and then respec to 30/0/21, for the simple reason that you can't get Nature's Swiftness until 60 anyway. It's worth taking Elemental Mastery in the meantime.
---
Keep in mind that enhancement has less downtime and you'll need a lot of water. But it's quite fun!
---
Leave danny the street alone you giant cockroach!
---
Yeah, dreamfoils were even more before Diremaul on my server.
---
Mining is great for DM east farming, otherwise not so much.
---
You also don't need tailoring until P4 once you got your archmage, there's very little room for profit.
---
You should seriously consider going Disc.  Farming is a hell of a lot easier, and your healing output will be largely the same.  As Disc I'm farming Mara, DM-E lashers, and making good money from fishing/herbalism.
---
Otherwise good advice, but I would not want to farm mats for a pair of those every time (or keep one pair of the set on me). Rather just sell them away when value is still good, or ask for mats from whoever wants it crafted and make it for them on the spot. 
---
I am sure many others feel the same way.
---
same. I always kill undeads and trolls, because they always  seem to attack  me when I'm fighting mobs.  I always /love and /hug taurens. They never gank.
---
Orcs are 50/50. If they seem boring and don't use emotes back at you, kill em.
---
And many times said dps will then spitefully ignore what you asked them to do, regardless of how politely you asked them.
---
I had a ret pally throw on Righteous Fury when I asked him to let me get at least a swipe in before attacking.
---
Ugh. Today I organised a group for WC and the Tank kept needing on everything that dropped, then ignoring me when I tried to bring it up. I warned him, I messaged him explaining why he shouldn't do it incase he was new, I warned him again, and finally I kick him. So what's he say? "Lol good luck finding another tank." 
---
Wtf did he expect was going to happen? Lol.
---
?? Where did you get " typical stupid shitter american " from?
---
Then find a guild of likeminded people who only join a guild to raid and not for the friendship/community.
---
if someone posts a price,and someone is willing to pay it, (especially if they have enough money to not notice or worry about the bottom line) then I'd say that's pretty classic supply and demand capitalism. 
---
If the purchaser sent a message to the seller and said, "woah dude I totally screwed up there and missread the price, could I please get a refund but offer you an extra gold for your troubles" then as a seller I would probably say "yeah sure."
---
Especially as the OP has noted that he mistakenly posted that price.
---
which is why he's downvoted, people got hurt when they read the truth :P
---
Typical huntard
---
Think of it more like this: what percentage of the wow population would have 1k gold
---
I would venture to say less than .1%
---
Depends what you do, ele is not supposed to cast until mobs are dead, you do 2 bolts, a flame shock and auto attack so your Regen can kick in.
---
Also keep in mind that striker's mark is SIGNIFICANTLY better for fury warriors or rogues. I bet you tilted some melee dps, hehe.
---
Brilliant, Thank you for replying. I had checked that page but clearly not read it properly.

You just don’t understand the difference between BoE and BoP

The reason for this is because Flurry axe's proc makes your mainhand swing instantly, but resets your swing timer.  Basically it just finishes your swing no matter how far into it you were.
---
If you're 1.5 seconds out of 2.7 into a swing, it will finish your swing instantly, shaving 1.2 seconds off your swing, but it wont give you ANOTHER additional attack. Unfortunately it can also proc if you're 2.6 into a 2.7 swing, or if you're .1 into that same 2.7 swing. 
---
The reason Thrash blade doesn't experience this problem is because the swing with Thrash blade has to already connect in order for it to proc, so when Thrash procs it is ALWAYS at the most optimal time.  
---
Another posted showed a screenshot of his combat log with 2 mainhand swings in the same second is because at that particular moment his mainhand and the offhand finished their swings at the same time (the offhand very very slightly after actually), the offhand procced Flurry which made his mainhand swing again.
---
Tens of gold is accurate, I see a lot of streamers having only a few hundred gold and they get donated gold a lot.
---
Well fuck you anyway Void walker, you suck at tanking, the only thing you're useful for is sacrificing.
---
Probably nice for the classes who can farm them efficiently in dungeons, but a kick where it hurts for herbalists and classes who can't farm it (resto shammy, oh yeah)
---
How is the arena trinket obtainable when the quest requires you to be lvl 35?
---
As this is not the auction house i actually pray for you to be really at a poker event...
---
Nevertheless, you should verify before start...
---
Well it is a valid option, you might luck out before you have turned in all those 1000s of Runecloth!
---
Thought I'd put it out there.
---
no, you should opt to actually play classic instead of sitting in instances for 30 levels like retail
---
Years of talking to americans
---
You should consider yourself lucky.
---
My main is a warrior tank, with a druid tank following close. But I'm building a fury set for my warrior and considering switching to purely feral dps because of how awful the dps in 5-mans are. I feel like I have to choose between AOE-spastic mages/warlocks or melee who somehow don't understand how threat works but want to tell me how to tank anyway. 
---
I lost the Hand of Justice to a hunter and the tank trinket off of Emperor to the dps druid that replaced the hunter after he left. I lost the Draconian shield to a ret pally because he "might tank at 60" (we were all already 60).
---
Now, to be fair, I have met my share of awesome people, too. But a vast majority of the time the awesome people for me are the healers. I think I have 2 warlocks and 2 warriors on my friends list that I've met through dungeons and liked enough to add. The rest have been healers.
---
Except you reserve because you dont want competition.
---
Who of you is hiding the Padre's Trousers? I know it must be someone because they never drop. NEVER.
---
I feel like classic is bringing back the greed in people
---
As you are an orc you have access to wf which has a chance to trigger an extra attack from your offhand every single swing (1.5 seconds). This swing + wf generates rage.
---
I'm tauren, so I just went with Dalrends and edgemasters, however its marvellous to see an orc warrior strike once and have 50 rage due to OH swing + flurry weapon proc + wf.

Take it easy dude. You're going to keep having bad conversations on reddit until you learn how to respond calmly. [Literally\_Pelley](https://www.reddit.com/user/Literally_Pelley/) was nothing but polite and well reasoned with you, and yet you accuse him of trolling when you yourself are getting emotional.
---
Just take a step back and re-read your conversation and you'll see what I mean.
---
Not trying to start another argument here, I actually agree with your viewpoint and to be honest it sounds like the guy you're arguing with does as well, which makes your inflamatory response all the more unusual.
---
There's no need to be so "us vs them" about things. You're not going to change anybody's opinion by angering them - nobody wants a rational discussion once things get heated.
---
I miss the PvP rankings and the AQ War Effort standings.
---
Yes, you're the big time asshole for doing that. this is the same as the warrior who needed on my gun yesterday in Gnomergan, claiming that he thought my lvl22 green bow was better.
---
you're a dirty ninja.
---
That's often the problem in my experience. I used to enjoy tanking, but not really any more. I find more often than not that the group doesn't allow me to tank: Almost before I get my first hit on some mob in a a pack the hunter has usually fired his multi-shot, or the mages started using blizzard. Or when I'm carefully range pulling a pack the warlock will either dot up everyhing as the pack runs towards us (note: at this point I only have 1 arrow shot which hits for 35 damage on 1 mob) or he will shadowbolt crit for 1500 before the mobs have reached me. Or maybe the fury warrior will charge in and immediately start doing whirlwind and cleave. 
---
Everyone has become so dps horny these days that it can be an actual nightmare tanking. I've tanked for many many years in WoW and I used to enjoy it, but for these reasons I've changed to play a fury warrior in Classic.
---
Tanking can be absolutely amazing if the group will let you tank, or it can be a nightmare. 
---
To dps'er reading this: I understand dps want to do as much damage as possible (that is my own view point as well when I'm dps'ing in an instance), but please note that you can f**k up everything for the tank which - as in the case of OP here (and in my own case) - just reduces the amount of tanks in the game simply because it's not enjoyable.
---
Its just to have some thing there
---
you are a very stupid person :/
---
Had a mate buy G back in wotlk, 10k I think. Got banned for a week and gold removed.
---
So if anyone here is asking how long they got banned for in the hopes they can buy gold and keep it.... Nope.
---
That's because you're a fool in that you're incorrect in your conclusion that people "don't understand currency". Lol, that I even have to put that into words, to you.
---
The point is, that some people (lots of people) think the loot should be available to the group members who totally looted it, not immediately sent over to the AH. 
---
No, the definition of ninja looting is exactly as I said. 
---
Not going to waste time explaining it to you, cause it's simple AF. But it's no surprised a ninja looter doesn't want to be *called* a ninja looter. But that's what you are if you NEED roll an item you can't use/learn/equip.
---
Any normal/sane person? Lol. Ok then my entire server is insane then, because BoE/tradeable items have ALWAYS been greed rolled. Every time. Even an epic. Multiple epics if you count the pattern in LBRS.
---
And no one's ever ninjaed in one of my groups.
---
I think it has to do with the horse's wierd gait (a really fast trot). kodos dont have a "run" animation like the horse mounts' gallop, they just move their legs in kind of a power-walk. Looks strange especially at epic speed.
---
Op didn't ask how to make the game harder, he asked how to make it easier so how about you keep your opinions on this to yourself.
---
Well sure, the healers are out there and equally useless when on their own.
---
I was simply trying to answer OP's question in regards to what to expect. If he mainly has solo wPvP in mind, he just simply shouldn't get his expectations up because he read that well-geared warriors are good in PvP.
---
And the irony is that more than 50% of people playing "tanks" are actually bad and just scream blame at others to cover their own failings.
---
It will get worse before it will be better. Once you obtain some decent gear (especially weapons) and hit gear you will have a better time. At around 40 its getting better. The pay off is one of the better PvE dps classes, very unique playstyle and a lot of fun charging around. Not going to lie but I really love my warrior. \^\^
---
I suppose I've never noticed that. Gonna look it up thanks.

You can do this easily with weakauras.

finally a usefull comment. thank you
---
gonna try it out
---
How to waste 45min lol
---
I'm really trying to understand what you're saying so if you could bear with me that'd be great lol. On the screenshot he provided, the log says "1 extra attack" from main hand proc, and 2 main hand attacks and 1 off hand attack follow. On the other screenshot, the log says "1 extra attack" from off hand proc, and only 1 off hand attack and 1 main hand attack follow. Even if what you say is true, and I'm not sure I fully understood it, shouldn't the second screenshot at least show 2 off hand attacks in succession like the first screenshot did?
---
Thanks for this comment. I see you have a good capacity to think critically and articulate thoughtful responses.
---
On the servers before classic; boe was fair game on expensive items unless discussed before. Just how it was. Greens and crappy blues were always greed. Bops are greed unless you need them. Needing on expensive boes stops others from being able to ninja. If everyone needs on expensive boes theres zero chance of a ninja loot
---
Dumb question time, why does 2H mace go to prot warrior? 
---
Is it bad for DPS?
---
&gt;  LFM UBRS Jed/Rend 
---
I joined a group with that message. Ended up waiting a few minutes for them to fish for Jed cause they didn't already have him. Then we did the whole thing 6-man instead of waiting for more people, and I was the only one needing the trinket.
---
Seems they really just fished for Jed to get more people to join. I ain't complaining lol
---
200 iq
---
Yeah your not going to get a logical response to this from the other side. You explained it nicely, but I have a feeling they stop reading a third of the way through because they have trouble understanding the concept. Then emotion takes over and they respond like a chimp shouting gold is greed or something of the sort.
---
The problem here is that there's no agreed upon line where announcing personal progress crosses to attention whoring. That's one of the main reasons to join a guild instead of pugging stuff, to celebrate small and big progressions made by you and in turn congratulating when your guildie does.
---
I could very well argue that since Classic is so easy there are no real major milestones and nothing is worth celebrating. Downed Rag? So what, so did everyone else already. Got epic mount? So did like 80% of lvl 60 players.
---
What's the point of a guild anyways if you can't celebrate the progress you do? Guildies are meant to be more than just people you raid with.
---
Saya the rtard with a dumbass edgy name. Go fuck yourself noob
---
It really depends. When I helped my tank friend farm HoJ it was worth it for us to reserve HoJ. Sure we could have instantly formed the group. But then if HoJ drops he rolls against 3 other people. 
---
So in the end the super low droprate would once again go down to 1/4 of it. With the reserve we spend 20 minutes looking, but it was still a lot more effective. When it got late at night we took the reserve out, because there simply werent enough dps willing to do it with the reserve.
---
It is all a calculation if effectiveness. What gives you the chance to farm the items the fastest.
---
Sentences like this always have to be read with the addition "...as compared to other MMOs currently on the market." Compared to other MMOs in 2004, WoW didn't require a lot of playtime.
---
Never had any experience playing WoW before, and always felt it was a gaming experience I really missed out on. With the release of classic, a bunch of my friends who played back then all got the game, and I thought it was my chance to experience this game. I leveled a Warrior to 20 and by then I was completely burnt out. I didn’t have any game knowledge and was needing their help for every quest at that point. I took a couple weeks off and then rolled a Druid. In the last few weeks I’ve gotten it to 35 and I’m having a blast. Love the community aspect of this game. All it really took for me was a class that was a bit easier for a newbie to level solo and some research to figure out how to level more efficiently.
---
If everyone needs, nobody gets ninja'ed.
---
If the etiquette is "everyone greeds", then some asshole will always roll need regardless of the rest of the group.
---
That's why I always say "all need" in group chat whenever a high value BoE drops.
---
i think the current transfers lets you dicide witch low pop server you want to go, iirc the destination servers are all low or medium pop
---
You can invite players to loot the chest in tribute runs even if they wasnt part of the dungeon 
---
So you can sell the most sought after items for a few hundred gold each time
---
*requires flash powder*
---
Fuck!
---
If it takes you a few minutes to start getting them don’t be discouraged. My luck personally has been to not get any for a while and then get 2-4 back to back and then not get any for a while. 
---
The burning charms also sell on the AH for 5-10 silver each just so you know.
---
My nizzle!
---
Thanks for the info
---
Bloodvine set bonus is optional but in the end I decided to leave tailoring. Farmed winter night pattern and already sold one so I'll make few in the mid-term. Plus maybe I'll be able to stash absurd amount of living essences to make CC starter blue to DE to large brilliant shards if during CC farming price will rise etc. Plus the bags here and there... and TBC has some pre-raid/raid tailoring BiS too :D
---
The 2h maces you look at probably have faster attack speed - a mace and staff may have the same DPS, but different damage ranges and attack speeds. 
---
For Enh shamans some staves are actually very decent, at least unless you get your hands on the axe/mace that's supposed to drop from a dungeon of the same level range - sometimes you just don't get lucky enough to see those drop, then why not grab the staff?
---
So if I buy gold for someone I don't like I can get them banned? Blizz can't possibly know who actually made the transaction, it's 100% external to them.

Apparently nobody gave a shit about how much you needed to vocalize that you didn't give a shit.
---
You have to have well defined metrics for loot eligibility and special rules such as bindings are or aren't reserved for a tank or that priests can or can't get Aurastone etc. No loot decision should come as a complete surprise to anyone. If you don't have this kind of a baseline, your fair loot council that seemed to have worked just fine this far is always at about 5 minutes away from imploding when an officer makes an unjustifiable loot decision that's obviously personally motivated and tells everyone to shut the fuck up about it.
---
But that is just stupid. If you reserve the item, someone who might have it already or just doesnt care about it can still take part.
---
Is Deathbringer + Bone Slicing Hatchet better than Lost Woods + Deathbringer?
---
Bindings are for thunderfury which is a 1h tanking sword which can be finished once BWL releases.
---
You're thinking of sulfuras - the legendary drop for this is the eye if sulfuras from ragnaros.
---
mage, spriest I can get .. why do locks murder warrior? you have 6 sec. immunity against fear and fury even have 30 sec.... 
---
i was expecting to murder a lock within those 36 seconds \^\^ .. except coil and sacrifice what else could he do to stop me?
---
What a stupid reasoning
---
Are you saying I'm a LESSER WIZARD!?
---
That's certainly possible.  But at least that way you *tried* to teach them something. And someone told them the best way to play. Letting them die doesn't tell them what they're doing wrong. They might not even be a textbook *douchebag dps*. They might literally not know about threat mechanics.
---
If they keep doing what you specifically told them not to do, I just kick them from the group at that point.
---
Tauren Hunters. They're always terrible players, pull half the dungeon with their pets and do no damage. 
---
Troll Warriors. Also usually pretty bad.
---
What u/Kreuzi4 said. Why don't you have a look at your migration options?
---
In a pug, I'd say you should ask if you can need to equip. Usually if you do, they don't have a problem.
---
No, a ninja is someone who takes an item that is more beneficial to others than himself. OR he plans to sell it because he's a jerk.

OP is clearly a ninja.

Every Tauren shaman is a bro. Every single one. I specifically chose Orc just to not ruin the Tauren Shamans reputation.

Nice!
---
If the tank is to low, he can't even keep a single mob off the healer. Been there, done that, tanked most of the dungeon as shaman heal.

3 ogres spawn, and there can only be 3 ogres up the whole fight. Keep 2 CC'd and you just have to kill one

I and most pvp'ers I know rolled alliance because it seemed pretty clear horde would be overpopulated.
---
I’m a level 33 alliance mage and have just started working on gold to get 100 for my mount at 40. I’m at 6 gold right now. My professions are tailoring and enchanting both 135 
---
should I keep these professions or abandon them for something that’s going to get me a lot more money? ( I probably have enough mats to get to 170+170
---
Should I be spending gold on gear upgrades and start saving for a mount later?
---
Thanks bud. I know of the site but googling the name it gave info and instruction thats not in classic, i know that now.
---
Getting that 10th perfect scale for that lvl 18 blue belt is worth a mention tbh. Even if it's low level, easily outperformed item, shit takes a century to farm and the dedication is real. 
---
I did farm it and it was hell. Took 4 hours lol, but i still have it at level 34 so worth it :)
---
As a holy priest, is saving for the epic mount my number 1 priority or can I invest in truefaith vestment and hide of the wild now? Just hit 60. (got a guild which is waiting for more healers)
---
Theres alot of pre quests that lead into other quests and zones.
---
"uhg... ah... no... that's rancid"
---

---
&gt; You can't exactly steal one to make a fortune if you aren't going to use it.
---
Even if it's not a fortune, it's still a nice chunk of gold. I've been needing on every robe of the archmage pattern that drops and so far in the 4 times it's dropped, everybody agreed to let me have it lol. And I don't even have tailoring.
---
Oh wow, people actually want this. I got this from an UBRS run, tried to sell it for 350g (was 400g at the time), got offered 250g straight up but said no. Then someone asked me to CoD it to him for 320g and he'll accept while he sent gold from his alt, then I see him typing in trade chat "WTS Pristine Hide of the Beast" in trade chat the next 3 days without accepting the CoD, so I couldn't try to sell it. At the moment I still have it, 2 weeks after getting it, and the price has dropped to 160g and I can't get rid of this thing no matter how hard I try.
---
Now I regret not taking that 250g. At this point I'd vendor it if I could but it has no vendor price either. :(
---
Its a cool way to ding 60 either way, grats!
---
“Sorry brah, lockpick too low. Just gonna hang out in the dungeon after last boss it’s kind nice in here”
---
I played on various private servers and now classic - these pants have never dropped for me. They are my curse. I had full T2 faster than getting those pants. 
---
Checked off Animated Chain Necklace (Strat UD) and Briarwood (Reed) off the list in the past few days, but the pants remain the final boss for gearing my Priest. Or lets say second last boss, the final boss are the healing gloves from the Princess in BRD due to the lenghts of the instance and my unwillingness to look for groups.
---
These numbers are likely skewed by the high number of asmond alts that came over to Horde side.  Check characters at level 60 and the split is 55/45.  Overall 60/40 feels pretty accurate.
---
In dungeons you should focus on single target dpsing with aimed shots and multishots (provided you are not breaking cc's). You would go out of mana very quickly if you were to sting every target, and while it might do some damage it simply isn't worth the bother.
---
No it's no problem at all, it's a bit confusing until you get it so no worries.  
---
In the first screenshot, the log says 1 extra attack from mainhand proc, but if you look at the damage number right before that you can tell the first swing was an offhand hit. So to translate the first picture's combat log it would be
---
OFFHAND SWING (you can tell from the low damage)
---
(You gain an attack through Thrash)  *  
---
REGULAR SWING  (This is the attack that procs Thrash)  *
---
THRASH SWING
---
OFFHAND SWING
---
* - These things happen at the exact same time, the combat log just reports the "Gain attack" before the damage number of the swing.  
---
That's why the next 2 things in the combat log are main hand swings. 
---
On the second screenshot it shows 
---
(You gain an attack through Flurry) *  
---
OFFHAND SWING finishes (this is the attack that procs Flurry) *  
---
MAINHAND SWING is instantly finished  
---
OFFHAND SWING crit
---
I still have gotten mine raiding w carrot
---
which class?
---
Makes error in his own post, gotta love irony
---
Again, excellent contribution to the discussion. Do you care to point out exactly which part you're having trouble grasping or is all of it a bit hard for you to read?
---
It has 2.5 speed.
---
If you are playing as a hunter, please do some research into playing one as well.
---
I see three options if you have a key:  open it and call for roll, ignore the chest, or sell the key to the winner.
---
I see how you getting the chest would be fair, but the first reaction from most people would have is pnly rolling is fair. It's not worth the drama and possibly getting kicked for 1 chest. Plus having to go through the drama each time another locked chest comes up.
---
Source?
---
I recommend go into full ele tree. EM can either kill anyone while leveling or you can do some 4,5 man pull every 3 minutes
---
&gt; Tanking is not fun.
---
Why are you playing a tank, than? Tanking can be pretty fun.
---
&gt; you’re fighting DPS for threat.
---
Exactly. Find the challenge in that. Otherwise you'll never be a happy tank in classic since that is literally your only job: Fighing for threat. Make it your challenge to never lose aggro. 
---
It's pretty fun, tbh.
---
haven't seen any invites in weeks now it feels liike. dunno what happened
---
I disagree with this sentiment, good solid dps makes a run much smoother on the healer and tank by taking care of interrupts, stuns killing mobs before the healer goes oom, and general having situational awareness to stop a potential wipe..
---
Bad DPS are low value, but so are bad tanks and Bad healers.    Its just tanks and healers of all skill levels are harder to find so people give them way more leeway to be primadonnas.
---
I personally refuse to group with people who have the mentality that a role has less value or importance just because it might be easier to get a warm body in that slot.  Good players of all roles are a god send.
---
In terms of reserving shit.  I dont care if people do this or not.  If they are reserving somethiong I dont give a shit about, I will go on the run, if its something I want, I wont.
---
Beyond that its just letters on a screen that have no impact on my life.
---
Doesn't anyone use max rank multi-shot?
---
You've angered Blìzzard!
---
Ah cool buddy. Well good luck, I’ve been playing for a really long time so feel free to shoot a message my way if you ever need a hand.
---
It does get a bit more interesting in the later instances when incoming damage starts to ramp up and your toolkit gets bigger. There will be more decision making involved instead of just spamming Heal on everyone as you do in lower level instances. As you start accumulating gear with +heal, downranking becomes a thing. Dispelling will also play a more important role.
---
But if you are always running with super geared people, then yes, healing can be quite boring. It's when things get crazy due to a bad pull etc., that it gets really fun. That's when triage and proper mana management is critical. And if you can turn a seemingly impossible situation to a win, you'll really feel like you made a difference.
---
I'm a healer, I don't think we're in much demand. I still search for ages for a pug group.
---
Slightly specific question, but can 'Stendel's Wedding Ring' be fished up in Westfall in Classic? I like fishing and this seems like a good thing to try and farm for some gold. Any special requirements for it to be fished up?
---
Thanks :)
---
That system is the retail one I believe, and I'll be down for it being implemented but for now we have no fix so the all need rule is fairest.
---
You need to add the retail player that comes to classic to smash 3 buttons and don't even care about role, aggro or anything, that's how retail works, sadly.... it's not totally their fault.
---
In dungeons/raids? You shouldn't use it at all.
---
Hahaha this is so accurate.
---
I know right ? I hit 120 the other day in a dungeon and people just replied stfu when i said ding 120. Just didn't feel like playing anymore so i went classic.
---
it’s fine, you’ll use the philosopher stone later on to. transmute arcanite bars or other things which do net you a profit
---
Literally nobody is twinking yet, people are only *talking* about twinking.
---
I heard that talent wasn't good, but idk.
---
I would suggest getting a healer and 1 dps to go in and farm with you.
---
I made a macro and when i sign in on odd hours i first go to winterspring to see if there is any left, stay there for an hour or so and then start leveling.
---
Its decent gold, you just smash 2 buttons for an hour straight.
---
They sell for 20g on my server, so Quick money, around 2 patterns a day.
---
Epic mount is mostly a status symbol. Useful if you're gonna be running loops around burning steppes for thorium or looking for black lotuses, but otherwise its just a status symbol.
---
Can't watch Payo anymore since i saw the clip of him showing his keyboard. It will be forever burned into my memory.
---
Damn that's a good ring. My alt is lvl 37 and even I would still use it.
---
Good point of course but that is more related to how good of a player you are not the class itself. If you charge a mage or spriest in wpvp or even in a bg where you are not close to any teammate then you're going to have a bad time.
---
Always make sure to get the transaction in writing.   Before trading ask in chat " I am trading X and you will give Y?"  And then trade after they say yes.  Do this in pug groups too.  Get loot rules in writing.
---
What is set bonus ?
---
&gt;  Who cares, it just makes the job harder for the healer and he’s not complaining. 
---
You really don't get it.
---
If you make the tank's job harder, they simply aren't there. They are levelling an alt or playing another game or digging in their garden.
---
It's like playing DPS smooths out the brains of the player or something.
---
&gt;I disagree with this sentiment, good solid dps makes a run much smoother on the healer and tank by taking care of interrupts, stuns killing mobs before the healer goes oom, and general having situational awareness to stop a potential wipe..
---
It's not about who contributes more to the run.
---
While you keep spamming "LFM Tank for Strat live" for 20+ mins I write "LFM 3DPS for strat live first orb reserved " and fill my run in seconds. Are they warm bodies? I don't care as long as they can do some dps I'm good.
---
It's not about who does more, it's about competition.
---
I like how you consider yourself the smartest but forgot to include night elves. Uh oh.
---
Their hides are becoming sentient!
---
The things i find okay are every 20 lvls imo. Travel form unlock, mounts, max level, i definitely don't mind that. But every other level inbetween, there is no reason to.
---
I don't know what everyone's complaining about honestly. I was able to afford my mount as soon as I hit 40 on my paladin.
---
sad story but why blame whole comminity
---
For leveling you skip prowl. At max you don't need it for raiding or PvP.
---
A caster dps would be good if they need banthok sash. Adding a few minutes to each clear is worth it to avoid lock outs
---
Tauren Hunter, thats why i am a DPS. My mind can drift off and it doesnt have such an huge effect.
---
Everyone in here saying this is gold buying, as if people only invested money wisely.
---
Male Tauren warrior: I think you are 12 years old or some old dude chilling his life while playing a bit after his 9-5.
---
Gnomes: people just wanting to troll, walking memes
---
Male n811 Hunter: I just hate you for existing; and you are probably bad at the game but your class makes up for it.
---
There's no internal cooldown, but swings between both weapons inevitably come un-synced even without sword spec, flurry, thrash, HoJ etc due to parry haste.  
---
General rule of thumb is you want a very slow hard hitting mainhand if you're using anything that causes you to get an additional swing, even if it only cuts .1 second off the timer it's still a damage boost.
---
U need it and sell it? Shame on u
---
Did my very first Quest run, only Mage/Shadow/Hunter, guess I was lucky
---
I've been tanking all content with 5% hit as a Feral (so Weapon Skill does not even apply to me) and it was fine. So 9% seems to be overdoing it and at some point, you are neglecting your defensive stats by looking for hit on all pieces.
---
First time wow player. I’m pretty addicted as of right now I’m 60 epic mount almost prebis and it’s been one of the most fun nolife gaming times a while
---
Yes.
---
You know this and keep doing it.
---
The system is designed for about 3x as many gatherers as producers, but there you are, with two producing professions blaming game design.
---
You've been told how it works, and it fits with your experiences.
---
So. Either abandon your professions for a bit, or replace one of them with gathering, or be OK with not having a mount till 47 or so.
---
This is kinda my point but in reverse. xD  
---
My point with the post was that tanks often whine about other people, that i personally find unfounded.
---
I remember Dreamstate being kinda tryhard, but i think thats mainly pve content.
---
I spent my entire retail wow life on a PVE server. No regrets.
---
rolling on a pvp server here but only level 16 so no ganking yet.
---
i levelled an alt on a pvp server and honestly it was similar, juts longer because some twats would gank you and cause more corpse runs in contested areas.
---
at top level, at least for me when it was 70 when i was playing, battlegrounds satiated my pvp inklings.
---
if you think you're missing out, classic wow will be here for years, just do it
---
Stating hoj reserved will deter any melee dps from joining your group too but i know this sub hates players reserving items
---
The best advice i can give you and even more as you are an hunter is..kill everything you see when going for quests or to city.
---
Also makes you perform better in Arathi Basin but yeah
---
Prot warriors dominate tanking, Fury warriors dominate DPS, and Arms warriors dominate (well, probably exaggerating a bit for this one) PvP. You pay the cost of a harder levelling to get a dominant 60+ class.
---
If you're getting to where you are worrying about HOTW vs LOPT, you're no longer a casual.
---
Counterweight and elemental sharpening stone.
---
I mean yea that sucks for some people but gotta admit that sounds like a fun mechanic.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20040724074310/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/priest.shtml
---
The alpha/beta era pages are a real treasure trove too, such as the above version of priest with two mana burns and a spell that removes enemy threat from a friendly target.
---
I'm playing rogue, been level 60 for about a days playtime. Switched to combat daggers which is great for pve but it doesn't seem that great for pvp. Is there a spec that is good for both?
---
Also I'm saving for my epic mount rather than buying devilsaur gloves+legs... Is this a good idea? 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12963/blade master-leggings
---
 my legs
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13957/gargoyle-slashers 
---
my gloves
---
I think I would be mad just waiting to ding after each quest turn-in 4 hours into my level
---
&gt;You clearly have reading comprehension issues. 
---
Coming from the guy who claimed on two separate occasions that if I wasn't running with his ridiculously dumb loot system then my raid was obviously bad... and then dismissed my proof that such an idiotic loot system was needed in that my raid worked perfectly fine without it.
---
&gt;All I said is that you want to give the very best loot to your least likely to leave players. The least likely players to leave a guild is layered out from the GM to Trials. That doesn’t mean every single piece goes to a handful of people. Stop being dense. 
---
And, because you seem to be incredibly slow on the uptake here, I'm calling you out on such a ridiculously selfish, bullshit stance. Keeping all the prime loot to your buddies while giving everyone else table scraps is why guilds implode, it doesn't work because people don't like being screwed over for loot.
---
Your argument is literally the perfect example of why loot councils fail: Because the loot is given out on purely nepotistic basis, to the GM and his friends/officers, while everyone else is marginalised.
---
&gt;Also I’m curious what ridiculous system you think is good for a guild. I’m sure this will be funny. RIgHt BuDdY? rIGht?
---
You're just gonna avoid my question?
---
I'll ask it again then.
---
When you've been previously running your idiotic, selfish loot council, do you make sure that all new members and raiders know they're ineligible for anything good? That all the best gear is going directly into the pockets of the GM and the officers?
---
Or do you just leave that as implied and then shrug when you wonder why anyone would complain "They're less likely to leave though!!!!!1111oneone"
---
C'mon buddy, simple question here.
---
I'm curious to see other people's rankings of the vanilla battlegrounds. 
---
1. Warsong Gulch. Come on guys, this is the best BG. The polarized setting between two of the best zones in the game in Barrens vs Ashenvale resonates with low level endearment for those zones, and also hammers home the theme of Horde vs Alliance better than any other battleground. The strategic and small nature of the map is more satisfying to me because the gameplay is more dense. CTF is a classic in every competitive game for a reason, it's always a thrill.
---
2. Arathi Basin. Yes this means AV is my least favorite, but hold on cause I'll explain myself. The dynamic and hectic nature of this BG was never my favorite because I find the more traditional offense vs defense setup of WSG more fun, but having to constantly stay moving and adjust your strategy on the fly, and the engagements that style of pvp lent itself to created a very improvisational and reactionary sense of play that I do like. It keeps you on your toes. Also I don't like Arathi Highlands aesthetically so that doesn't help.
---
3. Alterac Valley. I played this one a lot less than the others, but I think that was for a reason. On one hand I can't fairly judge it because I don't have a lot of memories of playing it, but on the other, my time playing it seems fairly forgettable, which is why. I love the idea of raid vs raid tactical pvp, and I look forward to giving it a thorough second chance and probably appreciating it more this time around, but I remember I never really got the hype. Again, I'm a lot older and smarter now so I expect to have a much greater appreciation for it.
---
No, it was added in cata. That ring would be broken in classic for level 60s, and also had a stat that wasnt in the game yet (crit strike)
---
It takes trust, my guild is pretty damn hardcore, but we're still using DKP until the group of 40 players have gotten to know eachother well enough to truly trust in a loot council system.
---
Jokes on them, I want ALL the blues, no shards for you, get rekt!
---
Depends what you class as dps - doing that with a load of rogues and mages? no.  Dps warriors taking most of the agro? Yes.
---
Thanks to ElvUI that pop big icon when party members have curse so I just hover cursor on their frames and spam my de-curse macro ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
At level 45 or thereabouts there will be a nice little pile of 5-8 quests in Tanaris (remember to hop down to the harbor town as well for the pirate quests).
---
As Horde, I had quite a lot in Feralas and Badlands as well, and a bit in Swamp of Sorrows.
---
&gt; to misunderstand the most basic economic principle that exists
---
Maybe because I couldn't care less about economy ? Gear should go to who can use it. Period. The fact that you see an item as a pile of gold instead of seeing what is before your eyes (the item) is totally irrelevant to me.
---
Why the cursor part?
---
&gt;MAINHAND SWING is instantly finished  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;OFFHAND SWING crit
---
So these two are the "extra attacks"? Cause there's a line before the off hand crit which makes it look like the offhand just timed another swing. Also this means the mainhand always comes first on "extra attack" procs? And that's why it looks like he's simply attacking normally? I guess this guy really needed time stamps to gauge this properly.
---
Orc is for people who can't play PVP
---
When you have a 30% chance to just outright resist *any* stun, then you don't deserve to win any pvp fight.
---
Not using it in small mobs I understand. But there’s no reason to not use it on bosses.
---
Not as Horde really, I'm currently 50 on my 2nd character and on both I've never grinded mobs for xp. Just chaining quests while doing every dungeon just once for the quests. 
---
On my 50 I still haven't touched Searing Gorge, Ungoro, Felwood, Azshara(except for the first 2 lvl 45 quests) and I still need to do the 6 elite quests in Hinterlands.
---
My buddy did most of his leveling in dungeons and always had problems finding appropriate quests for his level. He never leveled in Dustwallow, Swamp of Sorrows, Feralas, Alterac Mountains, Blasted Lands yet claimed there weren't enough quests so he was forced to dungeongrind. It took him +-12d to hit 60 and I had to drag him through it from level 40 up.
---
Not so much "Max Level" as "Content you can't faceroll".
---
Sure, if you completely out-level and out-gear the content, go ahead and have a DPS pull everything. It'll be fine.
---
Speedruns only work on content that isn't worth doing.
---
That's expected. Either change your zone and find more appropriate quests or grind a bit - you need the cash at 40 anyway and quests alone won't make enough for you to buy a mount.
---
Its useless when you gain nothing from armor, whats so hard to understand
---
Spriests are definitely top tier in PvP and in duelling scenarios, the same is definitely the case for warlocks. Regarding you notion about fear in your other comment, if you can keep yourself clear of any fears against a warlock, you are in the clear to tear him up. This is of course implying you have CDs or consumables available for this, because if not, you are pretty doomed.
---
That's the general thing about warlocks and how fear breaks (read: doesn't break) in Classic - your margin for error is so incredibly slim and a single full duration fear means you are done for.
---
Exactly! Point of playing game is to have fun, why not share it? I also totally agree that while im very political, i never discuss politics in game. Im here to have fun
---
Dont forget a horde revenge can trigger windfury whereas Sunder can not. 
---
Skarm mentioned that the stun that every deep prot tanking 5men has, is supposedly generating threat as well.

I get that servers cost money, but they charge you? Did not expect to see a pay to use game info site.
---
Good
---
It was that hole in Sunken Temple, wasn't it?
---
Have you tried having your friend add Sniper scope to your bow instead? 
---
Also isn't having 4stats on your chest better for you? I know to drop rate is smol but we have it in our guild. So chance is there is someone out there o n yours too.
---
Not a troll, paladins are literally god tier.  Only bad players think they're bad.  When you compare their kit to other classes and you realise that they have 2 viable pvp specs, and 3 viable pve 5man specs, and 1.5 viable raid specs - you'll realise that's above average on spec balance for most classes in classic.
---
Yes mine did too until I updated it. I did not want to install the Twitch client but did because updating the majority of my addons has become a whole lot easier and quicker that way. I usually launch and check it before I start WoW.
---
I'm dumb, where's the lift? Can't see it in shot.
---
Don't forget that they get sacrificed as well.
---
If you outgear and outlevel the dungeon, then, yes, go faceroll it. Hit random buttons. Equip greens 20 levels below you. It'll be as fine as if you tanked it as DPS.
---
Hell, give the mage or the rogue a go.
---
Everyone can pretend to tank, if you beat the content before you step into it.
---
Like I said it was less than 1 hour past the finish of the first run so you were at 5 lockouts and can't enter a 6th one.
---
Yeah that's something that person brought with him. What a terrible mental attitude to have in life.
---
If you need, you need. I heard about people litterally needing forror's away from a tank warrior in DME, because it's not bop which I find to be extremely scummy. If you can use it and it's am upgrade you need. If you want to sell it, you greed. The roll system is pretty clear.
---
All need is a pretty standard loot rule for huge value boes in dungeon groups.
---
Oh okay. Yeah it's the same mechanic between the weapons and HoJ. But when you said "another wf" you were referring to the main hand hit which resets on flurry proc. But then isn't that main hit also considered flurry proc? Heheh who knows.
---
Is there a viable BiS list for troll hunters? (including DM loot)
---
I guess it differs from every other race since I probably want to use a bow and only go to 6% hit chance instead of 9%? Or is a crossbow/gun really worth losing that racial bonus on bows?
---
Ooooh that's cool. I use Prat, but never really delved deeper into options. I'm definitely going to do this. :) I like a colourful chat, haha.
---
There was a guy who wanted to trade 1g to 2500g in retail. As in you get 1g for every 2.5k you trade him on his server. 
---
I looked up gametime prices. It was actually cheaper to buy gametime and trade it for gold on his server and trade him than to buy from gold sellers lol.
---
Gold sellers at the time were at 70€ for 100g. Whereas a gametime package went for 170,000g on retail. So you would get 70g for 15€
---
Oh yeah it's not free. It's gotta be a lot of effort to collect this data, and classic is very hyped so people are trying to make buck where they can (look at all the paid leveling guides).
---
Hi, sorry if this has been asked before, but I haven't found a satisfying answer jet. Sorry again for this question is very, VERY basic but I just dont get it right..
---
What's the best way to built AoE Aggro as a Tank? I read things like spamming battleshout, or spamming demoshout, or spamming thunderclap.. I tried it numerous times but just cant get it to work satisfyingly as I loose aggro all the time, tabbing from mob to mob to use Revenge or get Sunder Armor on all..
---
I had no real complains from groups or raid (as I am lvl60) but I just dont feel I am a good Tank if i cant get more than 2 Mobs to stay on me and not beating the DD's oder Heals into a bloody pulp.
---
Sorry for the grammar, not a native speaker.
---
Thanks =)
---
Laughs in Stoneform
---
For BoE epic that people who wouldnt even use it needed on it... yea I give a pass to the guy for selling it when everyone rolled need.
---
I agree 100%. People just want to faceroll and think they're losing time by being smart/patient. I'll always swear that you save time by being patient.
---
Sure the gear is bad, but arguably not the worst itemisation for a class/spec in classic (ever tried a feral druid?).  Part of classic's charm is the terrible itemisation.
---
UD are by far the worst try hards.
---
How can I make a macro to cast Battle Stance, then Charge then go into Berserker stance?
---
Well, if avoiding any fights count as a draw, then I guess warriors are alright? I guess you have a point in saying charging headlessly into your death is playing your class wrong.
---
I'm strictly talking about fighting, and the charging scenario you mentioned does, in my mind anyway, count towards the strength of the class. And warriors do unfortunately not come out on top here.
---
Any reason you didnt just keep herbing and did the tailoring before getting alch?
---
Never use serpent sting in raids, it takes up a debuff slot which in turns lowers raid-wide dps. I barely use serpent sting, even for dungeons bcus of how mana intensive it is and low dps it is
---
The t1 belts and bracers seem to drop extremely rare, way rarer than on pservers. And the t1 belt for hunters is extremely good (although now there is a pretty decent alternative available in dm:w). I've seen several hunters in world chat looking to buy one for \~500-700g since several days or weeks, and have already been considering just selling instead of using it, if I would ever get one on my hunter.
---
That's good to hear, druid is the class I was most interested in. I always liked them as healers, but from what I've heard they have been on the low end in vanilla healing. Being able to also provide decent dungeon/off- tanking is just what I needed to make the class stand out more for me in the late game.
---
You clearly didn't play one early Wrath.  They absolutely dominated at 80, the only reason people didn't notice because at the same time deathknights were unkillable and 3 shotted people.
---
&gt; And then your run with people who cant do basic mechanics proceeds to take twice as long.
---
there is no need pretty much anywhere for anyone to execute any mechanics.
---
You're going off the rails with stuff that have no  bearing on the argument at hand.
---
Being a good or bad tank/healer/dps has nothing to do with reserving stuff. 
---
I reserve stuff because the moment I broadcast I'm looking for dps/healer I get about 10 to 20 whispers and I can pick whoever I want. That doesn't mean that I'm not polite when in group that I "not respond to hello" or get butthurt.
---
&gt; because by then I already have a friends list and a guild full of people I know are good players and not dicks, whose company is enjoyable.
---
Assuming other people don't?
---
No this is wrong. The number of layers dictate how many people can be online at the same time and layers are removed manually at weekly maintenance not dynamically. Otherwise low, medium, high and layered would change on a daily or even hourly basis which it is not, layered is there 24/7 or not at all.
---
You should quit talking out of your ass and do some research, Blizzard officials have gone through this multiple times.
---
What addon is displaying you that Battleshout is missing?
---
Pretty much none of what you said is true.
---
38 is when drain tanking takes over from wanding, but I was using Succubus since about 22 or so when I did the quest.
---
Warlock is currently 50, haven't gotten around to doing Felhunter quest yet, oops.
---
Thanks for the answer. Yes, resists on the King aren't an issue, you can simply jump down and play the clock game. Resists just below the ramp to get upstairs or in front of the courtyard's door are way less funny though ...
---
If you can't keep up the determination and dedication to reach maximum level, then maybe the game just isn't as fun as you thought and you're possibly better of playing something else?
---
Lol did I strike a nerve? I understand how the class works, buddy. I'm complaining about the stupid warlocks that overdo it.
---
search youtube for cooking/fishing guide, you can level both at the same time by farming a couple of spots and just cooking everything you fish. You'll save a load of money not having to buy food, and can make food that gives decent buffs whilst levelling. Most fishing/cooking trainers sell a few recipes but a decent guide will tell you which are required and which arent!
---
Stromguard Keep. 36/39 Syndicates. Casters and stealth melee elites.  
---
Those casters are fun to kill with the dagger-ambush spec. High crits guaranteed! (been killing em for a while  to et my lv up too!)
---
downside: plenty of mobs, easy to pull extra. use slowing poison as they run.
---
He thought he could, but he couldnt.
---
Doubt that, I don’t expect to see modern retail micro-transactions unless they select Classic+ as the route to go down.
---
My succubus always wants to frick.. getting kinda old
---
classsic you think you do
---
Just look at all of the people on this subreddit who claim that they like flying mounts, daily quests, heroic dungeons, and all of the other crap that was added with TBC.
---
Those are the types of additions that sent the game careening towards where it's at in retail right now. We know the negative effects that kind of stuff had on the game, yet people still want it added to Classic.
---
People just see a feature that seems likable but they can't comprehend the effect it'll have on more important aspects of the game such as immersion, the economy, player interaction, etc.
---
Nah orc is fine my guy
---
I'd first check with the individual if they're okay - maybe something traumatic happened to them? Depends on past actions... But definitely don't see a place for that sort of behaviour in a guild.
---
Orc is THE BEST race for warrior
---
From my experience, which is obviously anecdotal, I've seen shitloads of them drop.
---
Priority works for the first one or two loot drops before people get antsy. You can't tell someone they won't get Perds until early next year right off the bat or people will bail, and criteria has the unintended effect of making everyone ignore everything but that. People treat that shit like they do at a job; if they know "helping guildies" is the metric, they'll sign up for every event rabidly. If it's sending in mats, you'll have everyone grinding gold but too busy to help out others. Also makes gearing even more of a competition imo, which can be problematic. 
---
Funnily enough, we actually have a Bonzo in the guild. Man is dedicated as hell, farms every consumable and always flasks up to turn his oomkin into a boomkin. It's actually really cool to see someone try to make their gimped class functional.
---
I. Will. Not. Show. You. My. Genitals.
---
People have always been greedy.
---
So everybody in the group rolled need? Wouldn't consider this as ninjaing then because everybody had the chance to get it. Thats probably the reason why nobody wanted you to equip it.
---
&gt; c) they can not find one with decent additional stats.
---
Additional stats on weapons do fuck all when you're leveling. Getting a good weapon should be the primary concern. Getting a slow speed is a bonus.
---
I want to help my lvl 51 friend get Mara drops with my 60 hunter without grouping with randos. How close does he have to be to be eligible to roll on a boss? And is it viable to kite bossesback to entrance before finishig them?
---
I don't really get how I'm "condemning" anyone. My experience is that 10% of the people are awesome, 20% are ok, and 70% are just absolute garbage. This makes it really, really stressful to complete runs that I'm not overgeared for.
---
So instead of trying to herd the cats in 5-mans as a tank, I'll sit back and relax with a dps role - while also reducing the need for the tank to herd cats. Seems like a win-win to me, except that now I have to wait for 30-60 mins for a group. So if I have a time limit, I'll tank. If I can wait, I'll dps.
---
If I had to guess, it's because most of the "good" people have found guilds by now and aren't PuGing anymore. But the reason doesn't really matter.
---
You can say your lies all you like.  Quests give a flat xp value per quest until it goes grey, this is how vanilla has always worked.  You can literally see what the xp you're going to get is on wowhead or any addons that add it in game.  It only goes down when it becomes grey to you.
---
The only viable race is gnome. Also don’t play a warrior
---
First down was a bit of a hassle to everyone. Second down was very smooth. Third week felt too easy. Fourth week we've downed Ony and MC on one evening. Now I pretty much don't even want to log-in anymore because shit's too easy...

I'm not sure about that. Sure you can post 1 item stacks with every auction addon but with the popularity of TSM the number of 1 item stack postings seemed to increase. As far as I remember the default for TSM is also 1 item stacks?
---
I can't put any numbers behind this but it's my personal reason why I hate TSM. Oh and that dude that told me for an hour I was stupid for using the wrong price by accident on an item that he sniped with TSM and how awesome TSM is and blabla ... man that guy was annoying AF.
---
In addition while TSM can do what you describe that isn't its out of the box setup. Compare that to e.g. Auctioneer that will just scan the AH and give you a suggestions at what price you might want to post something. TSMs default behavior for inexperienced users and popularity have greatly contributed to making the AH useless for everyone that isn't using TSM/some other addon like TSM. It wasn't great before but TSM didn't really help. It might just have diwith a general development but that's the issue I personally got with it.
---
I really wish WoW would've moved to a buy/sell offer system sooner (at least for commodities).
---
Alright then.
---
Thank you sir.
---
Hey, i'm looking for a addon where i would be able to move some buff.  
---
For exemple i would like "Slice and nice" buff on the left of my char when it's active, while keeping every other buff on the top right of the screen.  
---
Any ideas ?
---
my level 25 warrior proudly wears the staff from BFD as mainhand. and it's a blast.

Voidwalker tank (imp. voidwalker in demonology) until you get 70% pushback reduction from drain life (affliction), then drain tanking build.

After this, at level 45, I moved back to soul link but that is a personal reference (much safer in pvp server). Now I'm level 42 and I have soul link + succubus with master demonologist and I'm drain tanking again.
---
Healer shaman being #2 in dps is complete bullshit :D 2h Tanking can be fine but its definitely not optimal for all group setups. If you run triple mage then sure do it since you need to drink after 2 pulls anyway, but in 3x rogue 1x warrior 1x healer group is better to use shield for mana efficiency to minimize downtime.
---
If you minmax everything then troll might be a bit better in some cases and in other orc is better. Even UD might be better in a fight where fear immunity (at least once every 2 mins) is helpful. 
---
In the end jsut play what you like most.
---
No the mainhand swing is the extra attack, the offhand swing is a normal offhand swing.  
---
Without timestamps we can't know for sure how much time was shaved off of his mainhand swing, it could be anywhere from .1 of a second to a full swing. 
---
The mainhand swing is the only thing that ever benefits from extra attack procs, you cannot proc extra offhand attacks through any method at all. Anything that procs an additional attack using an offhand weapon only ever procs a mainhand swing.  
---
You are correct that is why it looks like he's attacking normally. The benefits of extra attacks through something like Flurry aren't absolutely extreme but they add up quickly over time.
---
Not to be that guy, but I would pay all the moneys to have that thriller dance on my undead.
---
its not greedy if people line up to get in the group
---
Thanks. İ am not hardcore player. İ would just do raids with my casual guild and sometimes pug.
---
Just get auctionator. Automatically sorts for lowest buyout. I realized the problem of the classic system within 1 minute and stopped using the auction house until I got an addon for it.
---
Mages. Steal your mobs for their epic aoe farm, blink, poly, snare and slow when I gank them.
---
Now I'm a mage, I don't have them now. I'm a hypocrite.
---
Hamstring kiting was huge on private servers because you could equip a big slow 2 hander and trade blows 1 to 1 with a mob as opposed to the mob getting 3-4 attacks to every 1.
---
With melee leeway on Classic it's less effective but any attack you cancel out from your opponent is effective healing. So it's still useful, just not as good.
---
The dwarves in Thandol Span or whatever that bridge between Wetlands and Arathi is called. Around level 28.
---
Soooo a retail guild is what he needs.
---
Yeah, been doing 2man DME's with a warrior. Its pretty good with mining, herbalism.
---
I don’t know how it was in vanilla and I don’t care. We tested it in classic and it gives different xp for different colors. You can go test it yourself or you can stay here in comments being an ignorant fuck, the choice is yours.
---
You can't have windfury on an offhand, it only applies to your mainhand. Flurry extra attacks can proc your mainhand swing which then proc windfury though. Windfury CAN proc Flurry axe, but that would require Flurry axe being in your mainhand (which it shouldn't be).
---
That's not what anybody's saying; youre just arguing for the sake of it, ignoring the what people are saying to you and blindly continuing to spew hate at people who arent disagreeing with you.
---
Take a step back and look at yourself, how do you think people reading this see you? Your first instinct is to insult someone trying to help you.
---
Anyway whatever, I dont care enough to continue this, I can see you just enjoy being rude. I guess if thats what you're on reddit to do, you keep on doing you.
---
Warsong Gulch is amazing. It's action packed and reasonably-sized, almost feels like an Overwatch match. That said, I loooved the immensity of Alterac Valley. That one feels like a Battlefield match. I actually disliked Arathi Basin, can't think of any redeeming qualities over the other two, I'd call it "just okay."
---
This is all well and good until some Asshole Needs after everyone else has greeded and leaves group.
---
To stop people ninjaing, everyone needs.
---
If someone then genuinely needs the item, by all means let them have it if you are so inclined.
---
/cast battlestance
---
Then hotkey it to the mousewheel.  You can add weapon swaps in also if needed.
---
I mean, HoJ runs aren't actually that long. Get in, two doors, 2 packs, Arena, 5? packs (or just fear and skip), Angerforge, 1 pack, Argelmach, reset.
---
Best case scenario, 12 minutes per run.
---
Get a weak aura
---
That's not it at all, I'm not telling the guy to become a healer, he's still a shadow priest just like I am but my point was to use your full kit since you still have heals as shadow while regular dps don't.
---
I guess it's a matter of preference, personally I'd rather heal some to get the loot I want rather than wait for a long time with this meta.
---
I only have about 1,5 bars for all spells I have heals if Target is friendly and dmg abilities if Target is hostile:
---
Example:
---
/Cast [harm,nodead,exists,nomod]shadow word: pain,[harm,nodead,exists,mod:ctrl]shadow word: pain(rank 1), [help,nodead,exists,mod:shift]renew,[help,nodead,exists,mod:shift,mod:ctrl]renew (rank 1)
---
So basically all things on hotkeys are multi purpose.
---
My hotkeys: (1/2)-5, qertyfg. All with different functions depending on the modifiers/targets
---
Atleast you have a choice...
---
Even though my paladin is ret main and Blackhands is pretty much bis until naxx (or drakefang which has other prios), I would still rather take EotB if I could for offhealing/spellpower-memes/pvp.
---
Yeah and thats why this  is shit, it's nice that you hit 60 and its a good achievement, I don't mind you sharing it at all, it's just that theres atleast 10 posts like this every week on the frontpage.
---
oh man it is like I am watching it all over again.
---
thats an honest to god great idea!
---
ill soon be ready with my warehousing so ill use that on my next twink :)
---
Can you ticket a GM for a quest reward swap? Asking for a friend (who is a stupid idiot sandwich)....
---
Nice, I assume he is fury/prot. What type of gear does he have? What's your Mana/mp5/+Heal?
---
I just did a full quest run 2 days ago. Did like 9 quests and got the hoj. Me (rogue) + tank rolled. I wondered. Easy. Was lvl 54.
---
Sloice and noice
---
Sorry for what?!
---
I looked at some screenshoots, it's exactly what i'm looking for ! Thanks a lot (
---
After level 40 you'll get about 10g per level in quest rewards and from vendoring random greens. Spending 15g on a *solid* weapon upgrade is definitely worth it after you've got your mount.
---
Posted an example under OP
---
Diana's Pearl Necklace is apparently not in the game yet
---
Yesterday a paladin HoJ'd my shammy right into the path of a skull level dragon rare mob, in the badlands.
---
I don't think he misclicked cuz he also melee'd me a bit before the dragon aggroed.
---
He didn't stay around for second round.
---
I looked for him, and will keep looking, for ever (thx spy!)
---
I dare them to refuse and search for a new tank =O
---
Blaumeux has been good so far. It feels mostly balanced.
---
Pickpocket as much as you can. The random lockboxes you get contain a lot of poison reagents and other powders. After the first 20 when I first got the skills, I haven't bought a single powder in 48 levels. And even store some excess above 20 on my bank.
---
Mograine
---
Lol yeah same, I literally said this yesterday
---
Ive seen a couple of lock/priest/rogue bracers and belts raiding since week 2, but so far 0 for hunters or warriors. And apparently im not the only one, seeing what some other hunters on my server are willing to pay.
---
I did Strat Live for the first time as a priest healer, and the priest robe recipe dropped off the last guy. I felt like a dick needing because the recipe sells for like 200g on my server, but like, I'm the priest, it's literally required for my BiS robe so I needed it. I was happy to see everyone else passed at least, and I got a congrats.
---
&gt;I don't really get how I'm "condemning" anyone.   
---
&gt;70% are just absolute garbage.
---
&gt; He fire nova totems, then lesser healing waves me, then chain lightning, then healing wave, then magma totem. The pack is then about to die while the mage could only get a cold of cone, flamestrike and maybe an AE or two. 
---
Alright, let's do the math. 
---
1) Fire Nova Totem: GCD
---
2) LHW: 1,5 sec
---
3) CL: 1,5 sec
---
4) HW: 2,5 sec
---
5) Magma Totem: GCD
---
That results in 5,5 seconds cast time + 2 GCD's. A Mage can land Flamestrike + CoC (3 seconds + GCD) and still have 2,5 seconds of cast time + an additional GCD. That's not just "maybe an AE or two". You are misrepresenting the example (and then in turn your argument) and whether it is because you are blatantly lying or simply don't know better, is hard to say. 
---
It does make it rather silly when you are accusing the other person about not knowing what you are talking about. Do you even know yourself? 
---
I'd love to see your arguments supporting how a single Nova Totem proc + a single Chain Lightning does more damage than a Flamestrike + CoC + 3-4 Arcane Explosions. And that's not even assuming the Mage is properly specced for dungeon-AoE'ing (i.e. has Blastwave etc.).
---
t1 mage set is trash, the first bonus is the only thing worth getting with the bracers, boots and head
---
he's referring to warden staff
---
But then you get drama, because god forbid the people view it that way. Bob and Jim get salty over being equal to Bill who, in their eyes, hasn't done as much for the raid as a whole and hasn't committed much time. Bill hasn't seen Jim's solo work and is wondering why TF they're equal, and then feels his performance in raid is secondary to guild politics. Bob points to the 20+ gear items he brought to everyone, all the rings and staves and such, and asks in discord how he has contributed equal to the solo farmer. 
---
Loot Council is great until someone doubts the system for even a minute, then everything falls apart
---
Really? In both my runs that went up the last 3 bosses we had at least 4 belts/bracers drop.
---
Why does it take 5 pulls?
---
Dwarf Antifear rota.
---
Let her breath to death.
---
I wouldn't pay that for +4 agility.
---
One of my favourite moments as a priest is drowning victims with mind control
---
Actually ive been able to get them alright, i just wanna get em more efficiently :p
---
Depends on your priorities. Personally I went for one BiS item and then started saving for the mount. Going back I'd probably start saving right away, because current raid content isn't hard at all and you should be perfectly fine with pre-raid BiS from dungeons.
---
There is still a lot of time until BWL releases and I don't expect that one to be very hard either. An epic mount on the other hand is always useful. Especially if you are interested in PvP as many PvP-groups will require you to have one.
---
That's not true. In the beta, Undead spoke Common and could talk to Alliance.
---
The reason they removed that is the only "conversations" to be had were shit-talk...
---
Play what your friends play. If n/a, try both see which one you like more.
---
1.12 AV didn't have reinforcements yet. The only win condition is killing the enemies boss.
---
im like 4 days 20 hours @ lvl 41. whats ur secret on leveling that fast?
---
Currently raiding with a loot council for the first time of my life, it's working fine and everything is clear. We have spreadsheets for every single item and players are even passing on their successful rolls because someone else can get a new set bonus with the item. The spreadsheets themselves were discussed with a variety of players.
---
Perhaps not, but it's clear that in not doing the decent thing and returning the mail, Blizz has interpreted that transaction as illicit trading, be that correctly or incorrectly.  Still feels like karma has been served.
---
This might be a better discussion in a dedicated thread.
---
I loved Alterac Valley. Even as a relatively rubbish pvper I felt I could contribute.
---
Just started leveling up a warri tank just because I'm fed up looking for a grp for 2.5 hours on weekends. And that's just lfg as a healer....
---
Common mistake. No its not, its fantastic in both dungeons and pvp. But yes, most of it is not worth getting for raids. Eiher way, the way people talk about gear that isnt bis in a raid setting means I can keep getting great loot for zero dkp so keep going :D
---
People are ready to pay a lot for items.
---
Need righteous orbs for the tailoring chest, atleast the priest one
---
F
---
wenn man die letzten zahlen anschaut war es von der Anzahl der Charaktere her etwas um 1,5:1 zu Gunsten der Allianz
---
Damn this pic is cool
---
Makes me actually want to raid lol
---
Unles u are a balance freak id sugest classic atm
---
Raid guild. Can confirm we had 3-4 hunters in MC.
---
Really cool mate ! I just wonder how you will fit so much spells once you level, even at 10 you won't have enough space :(  
---
Really dig it though !
---
&gt; (3) Set : Increases the range of your Mend Pet spell by 50% and the effect by 10%.  Also reduces the cost by 30%.
---
Yeah, I don't think hunters buying BoE belts are really getting it for the set bonus...
---
Nice
---
Just have a bit of patience. Still advertise HOJ as reserved, remember to set a master loot at general.
---
It takes about 30 mins to build up a group, maybe less. Install ClassicLFG addon also.
---
I am about to start an alt. Most likely a priest.
---
The end goal for professions would be Tailoring &amp; Alchemy.
---
While leveling, should I bother with Herbalism? And if so, which of the other professions should I replace it with?
---
My main is a warrior, so I won't have a huge amount of money to send back to the Alt.
---
Thank you in advance.
---
People who are serious about PvP won't be there standing around for hundreds of hours, they'll be ranking I'd imagine.
---
Mining is mostly great in DM:east atm due to easily available rich thorium veins, for open world herbs is better usually. Especially since you can camp some lotus spawns so your mount doesn't matter.
---
I have the same professions and was in a similar situation as your level. 
---
I just stopped levelling proffessions and sold everything until 40. Can pick it back up afterwards. You come by gold easier past 40 so even if you have to wait a few levels for mount it won’t be too bad
---
If you want to experience a real MMORPG, go for Classic. So much of the player interactions and actual character progression that has to be earned is gone from retail. Retail contains so many quality-of-life changes (read: not improvements) that parts of the original, real MMO/RPG elements were lost in the process. Retail is only about end-game mythic raiding, whereas in Classic the whole leveling aspect is a struggle and a journey, and once you are max level it's a different game again. Mythic raid mechanics in retail are without a doubt more intricate than many raid fights in Classic, but aside from that, you only have some chores to do each day during log-in and the game feels hollowed out. 
---
I Have not played BFA so I am sorry if things have changed and it's somehow managed to become better than the previous expansions.
---
You need to edit this comment as ASAP as possible.
---
It's not efficient with OH getting yellow hit cap when HS is queued.
---
Why do you make this post then?
---
DPS will generally try their best to screw over the tank. Dropping AoE the second you pull, etc. In cases like this, it’s simply not possible to tank them all. 
---
Apart from that, it sounds like you got the right idea. Don’t spam your shouts, but it’s generally a good idea to apply them once. If you’re arms, Sweeping Strikes is good for AoE tanking. 
---
All in all, in those groups where the DPS are being absolute cretins, focus on tanking a few mobs, specifically the elite melee ones. Let ‘em deal with it themselves.
---
Back in the day I started as a dwarf paladin, quit 1 or 2 months after lvl 60 and then went on to play horde ever since. I basically was already a horde player by heart I just didn't know it yet. This is damn accurate.
---
Lol. Well the paths are definitely correct on that map.. are spwns just randomly any where along them?
---
Definitely true, but paladins are the autoattack kings! (Hence, why I designed this on a paladin) You'd never have room for all of your utility though, not on any class :p
---
&gt;You really want to be a leader, if you want to tank.
---
That is certainly true for all the guild maintanks I've got to know over the years :D
---
Lesson 1 for a guild MT; Always be as arrogant as possible and always look down on everybody else from your high horse because "YOU COULDN'T DO SHIT WITHOUT ME! KNEEL TO ME FOR I AM YOUR ALLMIGHTY GOD!"
---
I guess that's just part of the job :D
---
Technically, he was right.
---
Hey guys
---
I am playing a level 32 Rogue and I have a question about off hand weapons
---
So I am doing a combat build for leveling (obviously) and I am supposed to have swords in both hands or don't I?
---
Because I got dropped some nice dagger the other day which actually was better then my off hand sword
---
So is it viable to equip a dagger in my off hand of its better then the sword in my offhand?
---
Bit late to the party on this thread, but saw no one mentioned this so I will. If you're looking to make levelling easier, but still play the MMO and not just dungeon farm, or use intensive strategies like hamstring lifting then all you have to do is this. STACK SPIRIT ON YOUR GEAR. I cannot stress how good spirit is for a warrior levelling. It should be your primary stat. Even over strength.  It increases your out of combat regeneration. And whilst levelling, not allot can have a huge impact. I dont have the exact numbers. But around 35 I started focusing on spirit gear. Dont know what I got it up to, but about half my gear had some spirit on. It made me regen about 5% HP every 5 seconds. So killing mobs doesnt go any faster. But you have NO downtime. No need for food or potions (accept in combat or over pulls). Just kill 2 mobs, and regen 20-30% hp as you move to the next one. I cant stress enough how much smoother it makes everything. You can go one step further and have a spirit set that you switch too as combat ends. And then switch into a damage set just before you fight. But I found that took up a lot of bag space. So didnt bother.
---
Lol! You're surely not alone. I went up this way on my first time going up freewind post. Only saw the lift when I was up there.
---
Yep, got Rhok on October 4th.
---
&gt; and don't even care about role, aggro or anything (...)
---
&gt;  (...) that's how retail works,
---
Thats also how every dungeon in classic works since we play the overpowered pre BC talents. Its more of a problem of bad players per se.
---
Can you share the addons you used to get this look? I really like it! Very nostalgic.
---
To get answers in regards to the 5 piece set bonus. Just saying that ''mage t1 is trash'' is wrong and something that would give a lot of new mages the wrong idea and maybe pass on great loot.
---
weakaura is a VERY powerful addon. i built half my ui with it. if you need a specific info about anything, just make a weakaura for it and make it look clean and nice to look at :)
---
Saying HoJ is reserved is reasonable. Not everyone is going to want it and those who do just won't come.
---
This guy is trying to reserve everything. Including the fucking cloth.
---
At least they're honest about it. Today I saw "LF1M tank Strat UD" so I whisper and he's like "need cloak?" I'm like "um yes?" And he goes ":/" and doesn't invite me. I /who'd him 30m later and he was offline.
---
Fucking absolute moron. Who would do an instance if you didn't need anything?
---
ahah I did that because as you mentionned, it is easy even for a child to understand the topic, and yet you could apparently argue for days that you're the one who really understands how that works, even though the only reason you think it's how it works is because you're a selfish ass
---
What class earns the most gph right now?  Hunter or mage?
---
I can give you a list, and answer any questions, but I am not sure about putting out a guide because it was an extremely long process lol.. probably 20+ hours just to get it to my liking
---
So you're equipping t1 shoulders over brd shoulders?
---
I have a similar thing with my mac. Is there a fix for this?
---
I agree so much, sadly i’m always the kind of person to pass on that shit if someone is actually going to equip it, then subsequently fight tooth and nail for a world drop that works for me..
---
Truth is anyone in my position eventually crumbles and becomes the toxic asshole that is above..
---
That's how Blizz GMs roll.  To be fair this instance is quite tame, on the instances I had GM assistance in Vanilla, they were practically roleplaying.
---
just start the macro #showtooltip \[harm\]Shadow Word: Pain; Renew
---
And pick the ? Icon, then it will change the tooltip/icon based on what you're targetting.
---
I don't use these macros because i prefer mine so that if i target an enemy and press heal it will heal the target of that enemy. Means I can happily DPS all my abilities and just cast a heal when the tank needs it, also i just mostly heal with mouseovers.
---
So I got an icemail jerkin drop and have no idea of a general ball park price I should be looking for. I'm not after an exact price just a range it could be worth
---
I'm kinda spastic irl anyways so I just roleplay whenever I stab that plain old air around my targets.
---
Me as a fury warrior trying to dps iron guards in ubrs
---
I don't think he should be dropped :) it's a stressful job!
---
You keep Mark and swap armor from other slots is the point
---
So how would you like me to express my experience, then? Just avoid saying anything negative? I'm not condemning the player base at large, just sharing what has happened to me.
---
But if you think that this is a sweeping condemnation, maybe you should examine which category you fall into.
---
Earthfury has been very balanced since I transferred.
---
Alch/Herb and bank all the cloth you get levelling?
---
Otherwise you're going to need to be buying herbs constantly to level Alchemy.
---
Runecloth?
---
I can understand reserving BiS gear. I don't approve of reserving high-value gear you plan to sell, not wear, but at least I see why somebody would do that. But reserving RUNECLOTH? That's like reserving "Gold", what, are players meant to inform you whenever cloth drops from a body and then trade it back over to you?
---
Allright so there is "retail" and classic wow
---
Retail is the games 8th(?) Expac so there are more races more classes, more zones and a lvl cap of 120.
---
The game is more polished than classic is but because  it has 8 expacs of content it can be overwhelming for a new player.
---
Classic is the rerelease of how vanilla wow was 15 years ago. It is simpler and because it only got released A month ago it will be a game with alot of players and the game will feel more like an mmo than retail does.
---
Pro's and cons of both
---
Retail
---
- More fluid playstyle
---
- Better class balance
---
- More overall content
---
- Fewer useless spells. In classic every class gets maybe 25 spells but your rotation will consist of like 2/3
---
Classic
---
- Simpler to learn, u only have to learn the vanilla wow and not all the additions that were added throughout 15 years
---
- The community will feel way more alive and active atm
---
- Not as much endgame content as on retail
---
I would probably recommend classic right now. The emphasis with classic is way more on leveling than endgame and for a new player that's probably a good thing. + Because it's so new classic will feel very crowded vs. retail where its way emptier when you're lvling up.
---
Overall I think retail is the superior game but for a new player it is probably classic
---
Layers are not affecting queues. Only players you see.
---
The 8 set is really good. %15 multi-shot and volley.
---
&gt;Orc has the best facials for PvP warrior.
---
I always prefereed female Night Elves when it comes to lewd situations, but each to their own.
---
Last 10 lvls for warrior are easy, just tank Mara -&gt; BRD -&gt; LBRS -&gt; Strat/Scholo while you level. 
---
Bad geared warriors are awful in pvp, good geared warriors are still tough to handle in 1v1 world pvp encounters.
---
I’d use skinning in place of herbalism unless you plan to farm maraudon/lashers with the priest. Easier money as you don’t need to go out of the way to pick plants. Neither tailoring/alchemy are particularly useful but the ability to make your own bags with tailoring with cloth(less important if you have a main but still useful) and the fact that if you plan to do late game stuff with priest, then you’ll want 300 tailoring for true faith vestments.
---
The interaction with people, porgression and MMO RPG thing is what interest me the most, I'll surely give classic a try then !
---
IMO it's AV &gt; WSG &gt; AB.
---
I mean i’m not trying to need on flask / tailoring patterns but fuck they could be sold to get some much needed upgrades. 
---
If everyone played with that mentality the game would be awful, I just play Tank for my IRL friends and guildmates now. Screw that attitude.
---
Well, you can macro it together with something you spam regularly anyway if you want - just without the /stopattack.
---
\#showtooltip  
---
/cast Intimidating Shout  
---
/cast Heroic Strike (or whatever, I don't know warriors)
---
You can way better alternatives to mark than other slots that’s the point
---
Sold the same belt to another guy for 1500
---
Join a guild or at least find a couple players to stick to for dungeons.
---
Classic was never a soloplayer game like retail has become the last years. So rndm grps historically are very bad most of the time.
---
Yes, bracers, boots and shoulders(since I use t2 head atm). I chose shoulders over gloves since Hands of power is is just as good but the t1 shoulders have a bit more raw stats than gloves.
---
If you can get tribute runs on farm then probably hunter.
---
Miss is fine, ambush being dodged is the one that makes me lose my shit.
---
its funny how you write a 10 sentences essay to tell us at the end that you have no idea wtf you talking about.
---
Get real, bears are great on 90% of boss fights.
---
Just a list of what you're using would be awesome!
---
I can appreciate how much time and effort it takes to get *just the right* UI setup. :D
---
There's nothing else like BHB though.

You can master loot it from basically the beginning of the dungeon, only have to kill one of the patting hydras, have them stand there and kill princess closer to them. Google mara princess ring master loot location and you’ll probably find a few videos.

Simply not true - stop spreading misinformation.

[This map](https://web.archive.org/web/20041103034309/http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/worldmap.shtml) absolutely looks like the sort of map you'd get in an old RPG box, like the one from [Might &amp; Magic 7](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mightandmagic/images/0/01/Antagarich_big.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190423115843&amp;path-prefix=en) I used to have on my wall as a kid
---
Yes, don't bother with crafting professions while leveling.
---
Mind you, tailoring is pointless on priests after you get truefaith, though tailoring+alch on an alt makes sense if you don't plan to play it very often.
---
Using it at later levels i didnt think it was THAT bad, definitely some "maybe i shouldnt have done those quests already" moments; the guide doesnt account for deviation at all of course, so if it says "just grind mobs" dungeons are always an option.
---
While leveling it really doesn't matter much, at least not until you've got 5/5 Sword mastery. You'll be missing out on 2-3% chance that your OH will proc one more attack right now if you go dagger in that hand instead, and your OH still only does 50% of its damage (boostable via DW spec talents). On higher level you should shoot for having 2x swords, but don't sweat it while leveling. Chances are the dagger is faster than many OH swords at your level, resulting in more / quicker poison procs from that weapon.
---
Some tier list consider other trinkets above HotM. The one that gives 25 to all stat can realy be good unless you are tanking a very slow boss.
---
LFM Onyxia, everything including the oxygen in the cave reserved.
---
Deserved the ban. :)
---
I will never join any run ever where something is reserved, even if whats reserved is not something I want. The whole premise of reserving stuff stinks.
---
Its a fine premise, if you're cool with the tank taking all the greens etc for gold, go for it, I just feel like its greedy.
---
honestly. I'm not always looking at my stacks of necessities everytime i leave a city or go to a dungeon
---
In a raid setting you will never use Serpent Sting.
---
In a 5-man dungeon setting you're likely wasting mana by Serpent Stinging every mob. You'll do better for your group by applying your considerable single target DPS rotation to one mob at a time.
---
Our raids never seen any priests boes. We had tonne of warlock/mage/druid.
---
there are plenty of hints and lore regarding oldgods, Deathwing, pantheon, Sargeras in classic
---
it was planned all along my dude, check some random books (Scholomance comes to mind)
---
So you’ve chosen second option. Disappointing.
---
10-20g (I play Horde on a pretty well populated server). It’s one of the cheapest epics unfortunately.
---
I've found popping both heal over times before pulling to be good enough at generating aggro for most purposes.
---
Only purpose it doesn't quite work for is dealing with impatient mages.
---
Give the poor boi some vacation already he’s. been getting pummeled for 15 years!
---
Assuming you're talking about princess, have them stand at the south end of the entrance area with the hydras (just before the tunnel entrance) and kill boss at the north side of her room. You can even see each other on the minimap if you stand that way.
---
Slow down cowboy, he doesn’t want to go to THAT void.
---
What is the addon for the overlay? I used to skin the UI for my druid back in the day. 
---
Did you use a Viewbox (or however you call it) addon, to not render anything under the skinlayer, to not obstruct the view?
---
Obviously you have your right to express your experience, that's a given. But i think some tanks would benefit from reexamining how their expereinces actually went. Was the mage horribly throughout, or did he AoE too early one time and caused a wipe? Obviously that's bad play, but not an indication of a player as a whole or how they played throughout the dungeon.   
---
And i just don't understand how you think you are not condemning the player base at large, when you say that almost 3/4 of the player-base are "absolute garbage"
---
Thanks. I didnt remember what to actually look for. I will definately theme my UI Druid style, once I got the time for it :D Just like back in the day ^^
---
I think the problem is that you are trying to make my experience a representative of the entire WoW Classic population. I'm saying that ~70% of *THE PLAYERS I HAVE GROUPED WITH* have been horrendous. There are quite a few explanations for why I probably have a worse-than-normal sample out of the general population.
---
My point was that I have many, many counter-examples to show that dps players are just generally bad in PuGs, which explains the perception that tanks have.
---
I actually think that there are many more good dps than tanks overall. Just not in PuGs. So we are quite justified in how we approach dps players that we don't know, or haven't grouped with before.
---
&gt;why would you wait until the end to need it or say anything?
---
I wait until the end, but I say something. If he would have just needed, they might have too because they think he's a ninja. Then he'd have gotten kicked and might not have the dagger
---
I always say "I'm gonna need, but i'll equip it immediately"
---
Usually people don't get upset with that
---
Everyone is super greedy.
---
Im basically the only healer in my entire group of friends, and I heal their dungeons all day, even if I rarely need anything from it, and they keep taking everything for OS, or for their "I might need that nature resist green for AQ some day"-specc. And im too good of a guy to call them out on it. They are generally good guys irl, they just transform into massive asses while in game.
---
Then when I need some Strat UD runs for gear, there is no way in hell they'll help me out since they already gotten all gear from there.
---
It’s like those scenes from old cartoons where people bend over to pick up a quarter , unknowingly dodging a bullet.
---
You and your monkey!
---
I always have 2 stacks of Instant Poison, Flash Powder &amp; blinding powder with me wherever I restock, so never an issue for me.
---
pssst... you can get the Night Elf Warcraft 3 theme too... ;D
---
265\*
---
hes lvl 38. he can't do strat.
---
I have got the addon. It still doesn't excuse the way people are manipulating the system due to the bad UI, I know it can't be fully stopped but I hope something can be done to minimise it.
---
Going rate is like 15-20g for the ring from Princess on my server.  
---
I can’t imagine anyone paying hundreds for it.
---
They shouldn't. If everyone were to need on BoEs then the person that actually needs it might not get it
---
Nope, especially in classic good dps is insanely easy to come by.
---
How is that any different from any other item dropping though? Just because it can be sold, it doesn't make the person that can use it need it any less? I like to play for items I want to drop, don't give a shit about the gold, more about the sentiment. I've farmed all the essences instead of buying them when I know I could've farmed in ZF for a couple of hours instead, it's just not the same.
---
Thanks for these pointers! Still farming up pre-raid bis and haven't been able to raid with my current schedule, sitting on some 200ish healing and 35-40 mp5. Perhaps Dark rune/Mana pot usage and some elixirs (I got Herb) can compensate to some extent, will have to give it a spin.
---
Got them on my first try. Now that Mindtap Talisman on the other hand...
---
idk anything about pallies but on my priest, I have all the spells that don't have cooldowns hidden from view. He might be able to do the same.
---
I've had the same problem as you. I've joined a guild and it was clear you are now either going into full melee dps and compete with Rogoues, Warriors and Hunters or go into a "mage build", which supports to some degree both speccs, Elemental and Resto.
---
Just try to get gear from now on for Spellpower &gt; Int &gt; ManaperSec &gt; Stamina &gt; Spirit. I've respecced to elemental as soon as i did my first maraudon run with 46, as i've got the stave with ManaPerSec. I even was so lucky and got the shield AND the dagger from Maraudon, so weapons slot were fine. But the Stave is from a quest, so it absolutly fits your leveling.
---
Try to get your hold on a trusty tailor, they can build you a headpiece, gloves and legs with spellpower. The rest should be replaced step by step or if you want to buy some green INT gear from the auctionhouse. 
---
I'm now 56, leveling is faster then enhancement and just as mana consuming for me. With Enhancement i've had very weak int, and without WF proccs it was stunningly hard to kill creeps, even with a (on lvl 41-45) 45dps 3.40 weapon. So you had to use Flameshock and Searing Totem anyway, or get your Lighning shield up. So after 3-4 mobs u had to drink. Thats no other with elemental, but you much faster, as you kill mobs consistently.
---
Another nice thing is, you can now allways be DD or Heal in Dungeons, we've done multiple BRD clears with me as single healer (And your Class sets are designed for Elemental/Restoration).
---
No need for devilsaur. Using axes as an orc you can easily get your +6% hit other places. Lionheart is 2%, truestrike shoulders is 2%, brigam girdle and or rend bracers and you're pretty much set on the hit. The pants from prince in DM W is as good as, if not better than, cloudkeepers. I'm enjoying my AotDW / flurry combo myself. Hoping for a Deathbringer drop tonight :)
---
it's a feature
---
if u need it.
---
Ah dang your right
---
Air is yes, Fire is immune to Flame shock and searing totem.
---
You only transfer to low pop servers, because the purpose of this is to balance out player distribution.
---
As opposed to 20 hours farming a dungeon? Ez choice
---
Na that's some bullshit. If the priest in the group is a tailor and the pattern drops, he gets it. Plain and simple. If you need it for the gold then you're a ninja and an asshole
---
What if that BOE is a big upgrade for one of the players ? It's dumb, if you need, you need. I you want moneys you greed. That's simple right ?
---
Just say "gz" and move on.
---
The guy posting it probably cares. You can just congratulate him and make him feel good about himself for 5 seconds.
---
If you can make someone smile by just pressing two buttons on a keyboard, why not do it?
---
I think the better argument is that "if you really need a boe, you should buy it" and if you get it as a lucky drop it has basically the same value for everyone, as others can sell and buy their bis boe item from the money they get. This logic fails too when you remember that vendoring and disenchanting are possible too and it's impossible to set a good threshold for value of all need.
---
Of course there's such a think as tanking 2h pre-60. The 2h warriors, especially with Ravager have the best threat generation overall, and considering they're mostly plate anyways, it isn't even a challenge to heal.
---
Oh i didn't know this already exists, thanks.
---
no server is displayed as layered in the realm selection list at 4am
---
at about 7 or 8 the servers change to layered when they get full
---
Warlock here. I just want you tanks to know that you're doing a great job, I respect your role and I too want the run to go as smoothly as possible. However unless I go afk for the first 15 secs of a pull I will pull agro off you with my first SB cast. I'm sorry in advance, thank you for the taunt, and the healer is used to me hurting myself so I'm sure he/she won't mind if the trash mobs also hurt me a little bit. I can take the abuse.
---
"Oh, you're approaching me? Instead of running you're coming straight to me?"
---
I heard that private servers had other loot tables for lockboxes, reports from there might have screwed the wowhead data on these. It's at least screwed up drop rates from all kinds of other sources, be it quest drops or whatever.
---
I love you Frodo. I truly love you.
---
Dunno about that. I don't like this reserved bullshit so I don't join even if I already have the item or don't need it at all. Sometimes it's kinda funny, because I'd totally tank a Strat and I have a cape, mask and everything but a rep, but this shit is rererved, so they keep spamming for tank for hours. And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who prefer to avoid these kind of groups.
---
Obviously i am talking about fast and save, wiping is not fast. 
---
You can add a measure of fast/save and fun to makenit more clear what is meant.
---
Ohhhhhhh. I thought at first that it triggered an extra attack for, well, the weapon that procced it. Then I thought it triggered for **both** weapons. That explains a lot. Yeah, the "extra attack" meaning it only resets the timer kinda cheapens the mechanic. Well, I got 50g to my name.. thought I'd make some bank selling the Flurry I dropped! Guess I'm stashing it for later!
---
No where close to that on my server. Be lucky if you get 30g per hour
---
I got a gutripper in one
---
"u pull u tank" if you say this shit never tank again please
---
There's nothing else to say. Your a dagger Rogue and a dagger dropped. That's it. You deserved it
---
"Ok wait here I will LoS pull all those casters to a nice small pack so we can aoe"
---
Do they ever listen? Of course not.
---
Came here to say the same. 
---
Looks very neat and wc3ish.
---
Sure, you're right that i take your personal experience and expand it to the general player base, but if i didn't this entire discussion would be pointless. How are we supposed to have a meaningful discussion about the behaviour of the roles, if we don't extrapolate general assumptions from our own experiences. You even do it yourself in that comment.  
---
&gt;My point was that I have many, many counter-examples to show that dps players are just generally bad in PuGs
---
This is literally you making a general assumption on the player base at large based on your own experience. You can't just make a general assumption on your own experience and then get mad when i take your own words of generalization and use them as examples.
---
After tank nad hunter did. If I didn't I wouldn't had chance to upgrade if I wanted to. Usually if someone rolls need, while others greed for BoE he must immideatly equip it. But here everyone just pressed need.
---
Problem is dps don’t over aggro one mob. They over aggro them all. They ignore marks. Attack every mob. Switch over before they kill them. And that doesn’t even include the warrior initiating with sweeping strikes and cleave before the first thunder clap is out. 
---
DPS threat management is horrendous. And they don’t learn because healer always go the extra mile to save them. The best thing you can do is just letting them die. Maybe they learn after lying on the floor for half the dungeon run. 
---
Like it’s getting so bad that you join MC pugs and leather warriors instantly initiate on golems before the tank has even out one skill.
---
It's good to see that you are a mercenary with friends. If we run with a friend who is tanking we all cover their repairs at the end.
---
I've been talking only about max level tanking. Even shamans can tank if we're going to include low level content.
---
Yeah, I definitely remember there being reservations back in vanilla as well as group stacking.
---
Lol dude. Tanks are in high demand. You aren't. It's simple economics. Reroll a tank and donate your time if it makes you that butthurt. I'm 100% sure you won't though lol
---
This isn't outside you absolute dunce. Your argument makes no sense and you're trying to justify screwing levelers out of upgrades for less gold than a Mara drop vendors for.
---
First... Try... brb, looking for my jaw. Fell somewhere deep down.
---
im a rogue and also get whispers for stealth runs, even without the reserve BS im not doing them. im not gonna do them and roll against 2-3 other people on the damn thing
---
i spent 14 hours in BRD this weekend 4 manning Arena/Anger/Gol (5 per hour) and we never saw a HOJ, never saw the chest or the caster belt or the healing trinket. This was with a group with only 1 person rolling on each item, fuck dealing with other people with droprates this bad
---
And retail is just easier to gear with from what I'm told.
---
To be honest my Ex-girlfriend in that time made herself a female Nightelf. She went on her first quest, died and never touched the game again.
---
When my horde-guild imploded from weeks wiping on Vaelastrasz (my girlfriend was gone by that time) I turned to this Nightelf on the graveyard... and it would be my main for the next years to come until my new alliance guild had beaten the Lich King.
---
But that... is another story.
---
In fact I when I quit WOW I wrote everything down as a post in the Blizzard realm forum. It would be nice if that forum would not be gone :(
---
Not once have I had this issue. I have two stacks and haven't ever run out of one stack before. It's not that hard to check your inventory when you are in a city and replenish poison and powder.
---
I don't know what you area talking about i thought we are just harvesting apples here.
---
Except a large amount of boe epics are trash, very few are pre raid bis, even fewer won't get replaced in MC, and that money will most likely go towards an epic mount which you don't fucking need.
---
Stop this lie already. Warrior is the best dps in naxx with the best available gear something that 95% of warriors will never have. Until then rogues,mage,locks are the best dps in the game
---
And I thought the priest belt @ 400g was ridiculous xD
---
[I'm sorry Thogthang, it was right infront of me all this time](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/5/5c/SummonedVoidwalker.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20071127191745)
---
Tier 1 is awful.
---
For dungeons/raiding, blue bis and max frost damage greens do much more damage and the fights don’t last long enough to warrant needing a large mana pool.
---
For aoe farming, they offer little to no advantage over some decent int/Stan greens you can buy on the AH.
---
By all means roll on it, but if you’re a DKP guild, just save for T2.
---
The orc racial is so op, especial for Orc Tank Warrior.  
---
Also the stun resist racial is also very good for PVP purpose.  
---
Every class has its pro's and con's but Warrior on the Horde side have more PRo's than Con's
---
Says a lot about you if this bothers you.
---
Ah my bad didnt even think about that. Time to dance naked in IF.
---
sucks. he rolled first im guessing
---
&gt; the dragon scream
---
pretty sure thats the [wednesday frog scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du-TY1GUFGk)
---
&gt; wish I could kill gnomes too
---
BfA has you covered https://ptr.wowhead.com/item=173951/nlyeth-sliver-of-nzoth#comments
---
This is correct.
---
Thanks, and I agree. I used to raid with a similar set up in retail, but never mythic or anything crazy. It's doable.
---
1g for 20x level 55 water? Where can I find you? I NEED you in my life!
---
The lack 55 food/water from Argent Dawn is 60s per 5.
---
Was bored at work an evening, just ran around using my \~15 fps work-laptop getting FP all night. Best call ever.
---
 Please can someone walk me through poisons? My undead rogue is about to hit level 33 and I’ve never taken the time to look into poisons, beyond doing the questline ages ago that taught me the basic poison skill. However, I’ve never bought the mats to apply any poison or level up the skill.
---
I did RFK last night with a rogue of the same level and while his gear was better, I’m presuming the application of poisons to his two swords contributed to him annihilating me on the damage meter. Well, I hope it’s that. 😅
---
Tbf I’m such a rubbish rogue that I’ve never even used flash powder yet, so you’ve gotta bear with me here. Poisons work like weapon enchants, right?
---
How long do poisons last?
---
Should I always have poisons on my weapons?
---
Are poison vendors in most cities?
---
I mostly run dungeons, because I like grouping with my guild and other players. Are there specific poisons I would benefit from more than others? I’m on a PvE server.
---
Also is it easy to level up, similar to enchanting or lockpicking, where you can just apply it over and over again to get better at it and unlock better poisons? How much is it expected to cost me to max out at level 33?
---
A lot of guilds officers don't understand gearing well enough to make pure council worth it. I'm MT and its extremely tricky to explain that defense cap is BS and daggers are mostly BiS for tanks atm, for example. We've mostly avoided drama also, luckily. But I see a lot venting about it on class discords etc.
---
The price is paid while leveling.
---
Still looking for a player with a lot of free time (\~8h a day or so) for leveling on Ashbringer horde side, me warrior and you preferably a class that can heal. Hit me up if you are interested.
---
You mean the post 3 weeks ago by the actual creator? https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/db5rea/
---
Absolutely not. Frostamus currently has over 13000g from farming DM on his mage. The AoE farm of mage is significantly more lucrative.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2cVfm6TIwo
---
So ninjaing is ok if it is worth enough. Good to know. /s
---
I mean, I regularly see things get sold on AH for just over what it would sell for at the vendor, which means when you count the AH deposit/cut, the seller is losing money. So I think some people just don't do their research.
---
Pretty much sums up what my own understanding was, just wanted to confirm if any new metas had popped up on private servers since I last played classic. Thanks bro.
---
yeah but if you can get the 6 BOP pieces chances are good you can get the 2 BOE pieces without overpaying ridiculously for them
---
I like AB best, my room mate back then even made an addon to call out the movements of the alliance which still has iterations out for retail.
---
2nd is WSG, least favourite is AV... But I'm getting a warlock to 60,so that might change.
---
Also most of their warriors and rogues. Turns out APES just like being memes.
---
Yeah and on average it is 40 runs for it to drop. So  8 hours. Now do this 4 times. So you spend 20 hours just farminf HoJ.
---
r/choosingbeggars
---
I may agree with you if you are leveling some alt just for fun or playing with friend. But when you friends are lvl 60 who allready have some pre raid BiS and you are still 43 no wonder you start looking not only at exp bar, but exp/h too.
---
And note: the official channel name is “LookingForGroup” not “LFG”. 
---
Some people have gotten confused by that.
---
This most likely existed even BEFORE WoW, but as my first foray into MMOs really only started with WoW, I always got the impression that people learned and internalized minmaxing was FROM WoW. People learning best rotations to deal damage (for example, to maximize damage with a combat rogue, it's supposed to be better to only hit sinister strike AFTER you've swung your main hand. Except I'm not going to do that because it's crazy. I'm not going to focus on my weapon swing meter, or try and only hit SS after the swing, I just want to play the damn game), people learning about the whole BiS thing, people minmaxing talents, and such like that. Sometimes we just want to play the game, and not try to see if we can solo Kazzak or whatever.
---
How many times have I thought I hit the wrong button only to realize in death I have no flash powder left
---
Yes of course. the UI is horrible and this shouldnt be happening. It does though and until it stops addons are your best bet.
---
im totally new to wow, i just hit lvl 54 and im looking forward to doing the late game dungeons but its not at all clear to me which i should be trying to do.
---
Wowhead seems to say they are all 55-60 but on closer inspection that doesnt seem to be the case? I get the impression i can do some of BRD but also i dont really understand the acronyms people use for groups/runs so im not sure what i should be saying in chat to LFG.
---

---
A level 2 *human* hunter wielding a *shield*.
---
xader??
---
Nice. Looks like Ashenvale moonwell is closer. Best one is in Silithus. Right behind FP.
---
21/25/5 is awesome
---
just mind boggled that someone would risk losing their account over something like this. the GMs are going to return your materials, and the scammer will receive either a suspension or perma ban, which hopefully is the latter. why do people do stupid shit like this?
---
Its not, but it helps Claw
---
It's worth 200g+ and will get more valuable when pvp comes out. If you equip that while leveling you're a moron.
---
No I genuinely have no idea what money is for please elaborate I'm a simple man that steals his groceries.
---
Imagine thinking wow gold is at all related to real money.
---
Either go for 9% hit if you have no sources of +weapon skill, farm Mugger's Belt from Dire Maul North, or buy Edgemasters off the AH and use, for example, a fast dagger such as Finkle's Skinner, depending on which +weapon skill item you get. And get 6% hit along with that. Stamina and armor are very valuable stats while your healers are poorly geared. Later on, you'll be able to invest more in offensive stats such as crit.

**&lt;Cyrus&gt; | Alliance | Shazzrah**
---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/)
---
**Introduction**  
---
Cyrus was founded over ten years ago back in early 2009, and has enjoyed success in MMO's such as Warhammer Online, Aion, Rift and World of Warcraft. Originally a PvP guild, over the years we learned to appreciate the joys and drama of raiding - and some of us have even learned to stop standing in the lava. It's not often you get a second go at things in life, so while we might not still fit into the same pair of skinny jeans we did 15 years ago, we are certainly going to take this opportunity by the horns and throw ourselves into some classic old-school guild life!
---
You can read more about our history here: [https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/)
---
We are currently running MC every week and recently have started running 2 x 25-man groups for Onyxia.
---
\*\*Raid Schedule (UK Times)\*\*  
---
Monday - PvP Night  
---
Wednesday - 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Thursday – Dependant on progress  
---
Sunday – 7.20pm to 11pm
---
We will also organise Battlegrounds and World PvP nights.
---
**Member Expectations**  
---
Cyrus is a focused, progression-based guild for mature, skilled and team-orientated players. We have a long-established leadership committed to getting the most out of our members and ensuring everyone is working towards their own and the common goals of the guild.
---
Our raid schedule reflects that of a more grown up / responsible lifestyle, but we still expect members to be highly active, to participate in other guild activities and to ensure they are fully stocked and ready for when it's go time. You’ll need a thick skin, a good sense of humour, the discipline to know when to speak up, when to shut up and the dedication to constantly improve.
---
If this sounds like what you are looking for, don’t hesitate to apply on our website:

---
As a healer who constantl has to look for tanks unless guildies are available: I wish I could dictate where the group goes, which groups to pull, which items I want etc.
---
That said I don't think it's that bad, just like you said, after a while one notices good players and invites them again and again, maybe even get them in your guild. 
---
I have been pleasantly surprised by random dps sometimes whom I don't have to babysit ("dismiss pet before jump", "start dps after sunders" etc). They poly, sap, banish, they use their cooldowns on overpulls and patrols, they overaggro the mobs attacking me when tank is unable for some reason, even had a rogue use cheapshot into fullkidney for cc purposes, without landing a single white damage hit so the initial aggro from bodypull was sufficient to make sure the mob still ran to the tank. It was beautiful to watch.
---
What about Recipes , patterns etc.? always need?
---
Is this not wonderful? You are both right and wrong at the same time:
---
[Link to clarify](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/acqxup/til_that_quests_always_give_the_same_xp_except_if/)
---
Grats dude took me 13-14 days.
---
you can just use the Save option
---
Gnomes are the only reason to ever play WoW in the first place. All other races are trash, I instantly respect someone more if they're a Gnome. Dwarves are alright too.
---
Sells for 50-60g on my server, atleast thats what theyre listed for.
---
I couldve bought it for 30g weeks ago, bought a dark one instead for 20
---
so many people getting stuck on echeyakee not knowing they have to blow the horn lol
---
Ok, if that's how you want to force it.
---
But if you're complaining about sample sizes, then why should the "good" samples not be thrown out, too? Or is it just because I disagree with you that my data are invalid?
---
The guy that actually needs that item gets ninjad.
---
You don't ever need an epic twink item while you're leveling. Ever.
---
It's just a feeling. There is a 69,900 gold difference.
---
FAQ for classes, can warriors solo level?
---
Well yes, but no...
---
Do people even see anything when you learn recipes? You could probably just keep a stack of AD tokens, though their short cast time might give it away :D
---
Sure feels like it would have but i could be wrong
---
In-fight hard modes, or just pushing the big red button before the fight :D
---
Finally killing Mimiron hard-mode was one of the most rewarding things in 15 years of wow.
---
not funny
---
Tbh, I’m okay with there not being profession items with 4 day long cooldowns that require you to go to one of a very few specific locations in the world to craft.
---
People already charge enough for simple stuff, this stuff would be insanely expensive. Most players are poor as shit even after 2 expansions of them throwing gold at your face, they could never afford that stuff.
---
Rogues get thunderfury
---
Yeah its not like wow has a free market where prices are determined based on supply and demand, and you spend gold to acquire items.
---
Yeah, I know. I knew the second I wrote that comment and looked at the picture, but I am done deleting my comments. Also - Fuck elevator boss.
---
Sure but at the same time it is easier than just not inviting whatever class may be rolling on it.
---
I've been trying to sell one of these for a week with no success. Even down to 29g. Got it in the same exact way though, we might want to hold and wait for people with deeper pockets.
---
Fellow group leaders, whats' your threshold before you kick a player? I usually tolerate all kinds of just outright bad players and give out a lot of friendly, then not so friendly warnings before acting. But sometimes I feel like the only way people learn is facing actual consequences, and it's probably reasonably easy to ignore the crying tank in the chat if you still get to complete the dungeon and roll for loot. 
---
Would you kick
---
- A DPS who keeps intentionally pulling after being asked not to
---
- A player who ninjas chests "because he saw them first"?
---
- A player who kills a mind controlled healer or tank, leading to a wipe
---
- A player who unintentionally keeps screwing up, pulling additional mob packs or triggering stuff he shouldn't?
---
- An outright terrible or half-afk player who doesn't pull his weight?
---
- A player who keeps talking bullshit in group chat?
---
- A player who intentionally screws the group over, e.g. by massive pulls, because "LUL it's fun"?
---
Totally impractical, but that's not the point!  This is hella cool dude.  Nice work!
---
I dont Think either should be thrown out?? I think it’s somewhat reasonable to use the sample sizes. You were the one who were mad that I used your data as a generalization?
---
It all started with a magic sparkly horse...
---
Most of this sub is filled with spell clicking noobs. It is what it is.
---
Thanks for that, I’ve a few stacks of cloths I’ve been saving up might just continue to do that and see where I am by 38/39 if I’m short of a mount might be the best option to sell them off
---
You can reenact scenes from WC3.

How I had 26g at 39 grinded in arathi till 43 and made 300g. If you're willing to find mobs that drop stinky loot you should have no problem. Not everyone is selling their body for mount money lol. :d
---
Thank you. oh well its better than nothing!
---
At least you don't have to deal with the mount ...
---
I'm well aware that is supposed to be how it works, but I can't say anything other than that one of the homing beacons gave me like 800xp despite being green in my quest log. The sites list these quests as giving 4k+.
---
Not really. Because how things scaled a were balanced you really couldn't rush to the bosses. Well... i guess if you were a highly organized raid and geared really well, and you wouldn't need to bother with PvP.
---
I meam like... suicide AoE fear was a powerful tool to get the enemy team to wipe.
---
But the thing was there was other things to do in the BG. Upgrading mobs, summoning the elementals. These were valid and good tools.
---
How dare you assume their gender!! XD

PSA: 8set bonus is 15 pct. damage increase on volley and multishot (aoe), so for a DM farmer that's essential.
---
\*ahem\*  
---
you think human paladin was an accident?
---
That's interesting. I'm Arugal horde. Our nightfin prices (once cooked) head up to between 5 - 8g a stack!! While our eels on the other hand are comparable to yours in price.
---
Thinking of the flavor part. Going out into the world and doing some ritual to create a special type of magical fabric only available to masters of a certain profession.
---
You know the higher the speed the better consistent dps right? 
---
Lower speed, like the crossbow, is good for pvp / bursty fights. 
---
The only thing you can auto attack cancel with on a hunter is multishot, where as aimed shot it is fine / the same if you just shoot it faster and get it on CD faster. 
---
Also the stats on it trash most blue weapons lol, it's really no contest.

As a warrior I actually like tab targeting to hold aggro on 3 mobs but only when the DPS allow me to do it. I put up a skull and hit that one few times, tab and hit, tab and hit, then back to the first one again. All while standing in one spot taking a beating and keeping shield block up. Those pulls are some of the most fun in the game for me.
---
Which of the Zandalar Tribe discords is the biggest one? Kinda annoying that there are three.
---
Yeah, this is why I won't complain about people stealing aggro until things start to look bad or I know a difficult pull is coming up. I focus on keeping the aggro of the group and taunting anything that tries to go for the healer.
---
I need about 3 fiddy
---
As long as you remember every key bind you have set up you can just hide the rest of the bars while keeping them active.
---
(stop enjoying things I dislike intensifies)
---
As in, not using stings so that you have the mana to cast an extra aimed/multi. Depending on your mana pool this might be an issue, depends on what gear you have.
---
Because it's fun maximize your character for each bracket to see just how powerful you can become. It's also fun to crush higher level characters in duels and outdoor. It's also fun to solo kill 10 people in a bg.
---
Can you post your build. I'm heading in this direction (have the 31 in Shadow) but the 20 in Discipline is still a bit of a mystery to me.
---
Any specific examples on the ADDON-issue? I ran a pimp'd out UI when I played retail many many expansions ago, but when I jumped into retail, I only use a swing-timer mod for my warrior, and it's mostly a QoL-thing and not something that helps me understand what is going on. Maybe it's because I'm a veteran, and I've done it all before, but right now I'm enjoying the "lack of information" getting spammed at me from 20+ addons.
---
Every time I log in for a 2 hour + play session I /who to look for 60 mages wherever I am.  I offer 1g for 4 stacks of water and they always bite.  I either offer 1g for a portal, or 50s + the portal reagent.  Mooncloth cooldowns as well as arcanite transmutes are a bit different since they are not fixed cost.  These will forever be variable based on what people are willing to sell them for.
---
I can't speak for mooncloth, but people are willing to sell their arcanite CD for less than 5g because they don't intend to use it for themselves and they don't want to buy the materials.  Mooncloth mats are cheaper than arcanite though, most people don't want to shell out the 40g+ for an arcane crystal.
---
&gt; "You wanna pull aggro away from the mage? lol dodge, dodge, parry, dodge, parry, and now the mage is dead."

Unless you are getting some shenanigans like being able to reserve all orbs in Strat Live, it’s the best a priest has.
---
None of us want to go back to kiting that fat bitch around in Mara. Was so damn boring.
---
I think you should draw the line at wherever you feel like its not worth it for you - I won't try and dictate to others what that may be :)
---
 Maybe 10g isn't that significant to you so you don't bother - you'd rather have the goodwill of others/warm fuzzy feeling that comes with essentially donating your shot at the loot. Maybe 50g isn't that much, maybe you hardly play so 5g is worth a trip to the AH. As long as the item is of equal value to everyone (i.e. it's not BoP) then I think it should be up to everyone whether they roll on it or not. Also, don't forget item price on AH is purely driven by demand - so you know which greens are going to be 100g because it's going to be the good ones! 
---
Not to mention, if someone actually \*needs\* an item they can always offer to buy it from whoever wins the roll.
---
I'm a dedicated alliance player, but I always play dwarves.
---
Same lol
---
Yeah I'm similar to what you've said.
---
OP seems to have made no announcement about intention and needed right at the last minute, probably why they accused him of being a ninja.
---
Just to add BRD is a bit of a trap because it has two separate sections.
---
We did the "arena" section starting from 52 with guildmates, and pugs generally accept 54+. You may see people lFG "arena farming". There's an area where you get a key to the second area, which is an indication you're meant to do it later.
---
Angerforge will be a blocker for below 56 or so. I won't take less than a 57 through the Lyceum.
---
Killing 400 of the same mob because it has .3% chance to drop an epic
---
I actually double checked and I remembered wrong, Nightfin goes for about 6~7g per stack (exact same as squids, not eels as I'd misremembered)---and doesn't change cooked vs uncooked, it's just slightly quicker to sell cooked.
---
Where do you fish at that you get 3~4 stacks of nightfin in an hour?
---
Holy shit hahaha
---
EQ vet here played from 99-04 then quit when life got busier. Hopped back in 2011 in EQP99 up until when wow classic released.
---
Spent a loooong time figuring out which side to play on, pvp vs non pvp server etc. Theeennn I tried a bunch of classes to mid teens.
---
Figured out I like tanking so right now I’m spending my time between a warrior and a druid. I’m very surprised at the ease of leveling for warriors (L25 now). Super easy to find groups and also soloing hasn’t been bad at all, maybe that coming from EQ makes everything a little bit easier since only a handful of classes can solo. 
---
Been enjoying my time here and I doubt I’ll touch P99 anytime soon!
---
I was just as confused as you. If it eases your pain, I lost Benediction the day afterwards to a 59 Priest who rolled a 91 over my 85.
---
There's no way to tell which docs are relevant for classic wow client and which are for BFA one, but that will work for me. Thanks.  
---
&gt; Going through addon sources is still the best way to learn though.
---
It's the best way to learn everything in programming, actually, but i've needed some kind of reference to look up things quickly.
---
...for a druid?
---
Wow someone actually payed 1k gold for that :-/ just find a raiding guild and get it after a couple of raids? What the hell
---
alot of people are like that, one of my IRL friends are like that and he is one hell of an instable dude. i think that's pretty common, cant see happiness in other people's achievements
---
Ah yes forgot that one.  Remembered the bwl fights but not that
---
If you unstuck your character through blizz website (Not game) it auto spawns your character in westfall. Much shorter run to SW that way.
---
I'll always remember him for that 118 24 7 advert. Isn't he the same guy from the Savlonic band too?

nelfs: 8 y/o playing the game for the first time

You can buy food from vendors. Once you got a stack, go out and farm mobs that drop food, that your pet eats. Your earn some money and some xp along the way.

yeah but seriously fuck all caps, it's not a pleasant form of communication.

Well then it would seem the guide is right, while the loot table on the actualy box is maybe incomplete.

Hey, I'm honored you looked through my comment history to find out more information. The last guy that told me to "get a life" and "I don't have any friends" is the reason I posted that picture of my friends and I, with the celebrity the subreddit was based on. He too, did a deep dive on my comment history and replied to a post of mine from 3 months ago just to call me an asshole, so of course I put him in check. I have a great life, family, job, house, car. Feeling pretty good about my life in it's current state. Also, since wow classic was released, I also started learning to play piano and can already play 2 songs from Zelda. I feel much greater sense of accomplishment learning those songs than I did when I got my mount. I'm not a grumpy kid like you on wow subreddits then just go home and play wow all day. I have a life, many hobbies, and a somewhat successful youtube channel while also being licensed in my field of career choice. I hope you can find a way to bring happiness into your life. Take care.
---
I'd tank this... Under the condition that those three pass on all greens and pay me 3 gold per head.
---
I think that works out to be fair.
---
Got an Eye of Flame a few weeks ago, guildies told me to hold on to it for later phases. Do you guys agree? If not, what is the approximate value of one?
---
I think the only antisocial one here is you.
---
15 gold sounds really cheap for that item. I can’t answer your question but I would buy it at that price
---
Im not planning to play a Twink in BGs, i just saw couple of Posts, where people showed there lvl 19 twink gear
---
Gotta grind certain mobs for that bread sometimes
---
&gt; the mats became quite cheap since DM was released,
---
Just mentioning on this robe that the demonic runes are BoP, and you could be farming a long, long time to get enough. I've had terrible luck and selling runecloth that dropped while farming these has pretty much paid the rest of the mats.
---
Tribute ring goes for 40g on my server

Are you high?

Raid healing shamans would aim at offtier and 3T2 while tank healing shamans can go 8T1 until they get stronger offtier 3T2 build. On say Twin Emp I was spam healing one of the tank/lock combos and mana efficiency was a thing so 8T1 was handy although later on with few extra off-tier pieces from AQ40/BWL I stopped using T1 as it began to feel inferior/not needed. All comes down to fight duration, healing required and if you are using mana pot and runes on cooldown (T1 could be the poor man set for such long and intensive fight).
---
As for raid gearing - if someone gets good/BiS offtier item then he/she stays offtier on that slot and partially in general untill full-tier shamans get their stuff. Similarly how a warrior getting BiS 2h is locked from 1H and so on.
---
Any rogues out there doing brd pickpocket farm? Just tried a run and it was fairly miserable, got about 3 or 4 resists leading to a few deaths and none of the stuff I got was very profitable asides from a few vendor golds.
---
Im pretty sure the aggro dump happens regardless of knockback resists. The FR is ease of healing and reduction of knock backs to allow melee to immediately return to dps’ing.
---
In the end it won't be twinks vs  innocent lvl 16s with 320hp, because those will quickly realize that the 10-19 bracket is not for them.
---
It will be mostly be lvl 19 twinks vs other lvl 19 twinks and that can be a very nice tactical environment.
---
If you are a non twink and want some sweet WSG action, wait for the 20-29 bracket  (there will be lvl 29 twinks but far less)
---

15g is like 40-45 minute dead farm from a hunter. Is it worth it? Well, yeah. But not worth to consume 1 trinket slot for 24/7.
---
Male form of a succubus is called an incubus, which I believe is where the band got its name
---
It's not as good as pservers, but as you could see in the video there is still a way to make it better than zf, albeit it's a bit harder
---
Paladins are still the best main tank healers in Classic right? Is there any theorycrafting out there about how a Resto-Moonglow built druid out MT Heals a pally?
---
You are very talented.
---
WHY DO YOU CALL
---
You just have to cultivate an healthy deep discomfort when you don't have a nice neat stacks of reagents.
---
Hunters need that mindset the most.
---
Goto this [Blizzard Support Site](https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/wf/wow/197/834/submitted) and select your new character to move. Your level 1 Nelf will be ported to Westfall.
---
Fuck that noise.
---
You know damn well the "DPS warrior" is gonna roll on my 1h axe when it drops...
---
They are from a quest that you take from the other continent
---
Think it's one of those things that need to be annoying. If everything is super easy and convenient it takes away the impact of the "highs", also gives the items more value since they require a time investment. For example, look at profession items on retail, many are on the AH for almost their vendor price because they take zero time investment or effort to create which in turn makes professions rather(not counting rare recipes) useless.
---
If the healer wants to see his outgoing heals to be displayed on the unitframes, it is enough for him to have the addon.
---
If a Tank wants to see the incomming heal on him, he and also his healer have to use the asson.
---
Not even an exaggeration, come watch me do it on twitch...also I literally counted the gold for the 5 runs that I did in an hour...
---
The first half of BRD is like 48-54. You only need 55+ if you want to go past Angerforge. You can do a lot of quests and Arena runs way before that.
---
But we literally turned in the SAME quest in the group and we got different xp. It was green for some people and yellow to others. I’ll try testing in again tomorrow night.
---
I play on Azuresong as well and have noticed a huge increase in lag in the last week or so. I'm in Arizona.
---
If I'm understanding this correctly, you're saying 0 dps is better than any dps because any dps might piss people off?
---
Won't they get more pissed off cause everything could've been done faster?
---
Classic WoW uses modern APIs for the most part I think.
---
Your raid needs any more rogues? LFG
---
I've run about 100 dungeons and I've only had seen one instance where a player felt entitled to something available on the auction house - that was a pristine black diamond a paladin thought he should get for his mount.  I'm eu btw.
---
So what you’re telling me is to make a lvl 29 twink...
---
When people twink it’s to battle other low level thinks....it’s a break up of the same shot every day grind of 60! Sometimes you want to just have some simple pvp.  If you haven’t done it, you probably won’t even under stand but try it maybe you will like it
---
Yeah and they will ruin classic by changing a lot of stuff and this and this and that. Stuff that you paranoid doomsayers say always end up untrue
---
This thread is just filled up with people that has never been above 100 gold and have no idea of the value of that belt.
---
Get mark of tyranny ofc, stop over thinking stuff.
---
There are bosses and mobs with armor reduction, so going over cap isnt so bad either
---
Thanks, I guess that settles it then :)
---
What do you mean with "no idea"? I play very little now... But the mechanics are exactly the same as old vainilla... Which I am ashamed to admit it  was kind of my whole life 15 years ago
---
2.4 or slower mainland 2.0 or faster for offhand. I used cruel barb mainland til level 29. I doubt whatever you are using is better than it. At 29, get zealot blade from the ah for like 4-8 gold. That will get you to almost 40.
---
lmao, it's not because you convinced yourself that your 'rules' have sense that it's commonly established. Anything goes in a duel, it has always been like that except in your head apparently
---
That night elf area tunnel quest that doesn't drop because you are not in a group. Fucking hate that starting zone now
---
Gnomes are always looking to gank you, no matter what, gnome mages and rogues are fucking scum.
---
In general, bears can't use anything that requires an activation. I'd stick to passive effects.
---
This is a scammer and an asshole, but not a ninja.
---
It's situational really.  If we're talking about playing hunter pre level 60, I'd say just put up serpent sting on your main target.  If you put it up on a pack of 4, you'll be half way through your mana just from doing that.  If we're talking about dungeons here, you're going to do pretty good damage just by keeping SS up on your main target, and auto shooting.
---
I'm not saying it's fun as such, but compared to running UBRS for Dal'Rends...
---
At resistance cap, you aren’t immune to effects. You’re capped at reducing damage and effects by 75% (on average). The aggro dump is happening regardless of resists, but I’m not sure if thats intended or not. Knowing Classic and vanilla mechanics, it probably is.
---
I play on PvE (Normal) server since the beggining. Reason is also I have friends there. But ive never lacked pvp experiance tbh, even playing on normal in retainl i got a lot fun by spamming bg and arenas (i even peaked at 2100 3v3 rating).
---
Now in classic I also have to play on Normal, but at least I can invest all the time in leveling (since i dont have much time now) and in late stages I will participate in pvp activities as much as I would be loving to. 
---
I dont recommend reroll, enjoy time with your friend and wait for bg and arenas, which you can play with your friends!
---
People tell me  2 things.
---
One that 308 is all I need and others say even 321 weapon skill is great and useful.
---
Right now Mooncloth goes for 28G on my server. I'd love to get the Mooncloth bag recipe but the recipe is a world drop and horridly expensive. Buying it would be hilarious because Mooncloth bags go for 28G.
---
I'm not sure, but it looks like I have a slow day at work so I suppose it's research time.
---
The Essence of Agony is what gets me. I don't need that shit for the next 40 levels! At least it sells for a decent price.
---
Ty.
---
big time. Ty
---
I put that Maraudon princess quest item in te bank, because it has the same icon as Sungrass, then I was wondering where it went.. Good thing I remembered you can put it in the bank! :D
---
Booty bay has the most cozy and interesting inn in the game, that's for sure. Although, the place does have the highest percentage of scum and villany in the entire world of Azeroth.
---
Classic has a small amount of content that is difficult to achieve and therefore has meaning.
---
Retail has an enormous amount of content, and only a small portion of it is difficult - the rest is simply artificially elongated via repetition. There's so much in the game that nothing has a unique identity. Once the new content comes out, everything before it is redundant and only has cosmetic value. The world is dead, and everything is handed to you if you log in to the game enough times to meet the arbitrary requirement. Can't do mythic raids? That's OK just wait a few weeks for your dungeon cache loot of the same level - you'll reach the same level anyway. Can't get the mythic mount? That's OK there are 20 recolours of the same mount, one of which you can get if you commit to subscribe for 10 years!
---
They know exactly where the game went wrong - they've just got better at monetising an inferior product. Now we're being re-sold a 15 year old game and are thanking them for it.
---
Not bitter, I'm loving classic - but modern day Blizzard is a disgusting husk of the old company.
---
It's a reasonable argument, though. Sure, they may be BoP vs BoE, but the logic is still the same. 
---
"Everyone Needs gold :) :) :)" can very easily be a slippery slope to everyone rolls need on everything. Especially if you have an Enchanter in the group who is now rolling Need on everything. After all, they need the mats to level enchanting or sell for their much needed gold!
---
The only reason I can ever see people arguing that Need should be used by everyone on BoEs is simply because it's worth 100g+ instead of maybe 6g at a vendor, but gold is gold, so why not roll need on everything if Gold is needed?
---
Honestly, this all really just boils down to a simple concept: Communicate; Establish and adhere to the rules everyone agrees on before the dungeon is even started. If someone doesn't agree with your rules, replace them and move on. If you can't get a group because no one agrees with your rules, maybe you should reevaluate your rules.
---
If there are a tonne of horde I have it just to sac in case I get ganked.
---
My zygor guide ran out of quests at around half way into 59 so gave me time to grind some dungeons for gear.
---
Dem hunters lol :D literally garbage trinket for them right now after DM was opened.
---
I remember heroic dungeons being fairly difficult. That's what I missed from bc, the need to CC and mark each pull or you wipe.
---
Yeah that'd be an incubus.
---
LFG addon? just use chat, never had to wait more than 10 minutes to find a group as a DPS.
---
Boomkin mana regen set or item? Sign me up.
---
Right so you agree with my point that DKP is bad because people bid on items without understanding if that item is best for them and therefore rob the raid of effective loot distribution? Thanks for proving my point. Again, if this is about YOUR loot, pug it. Why is this concept so difficult to understand?
---
Nope they said there not going to do any of these type of tickets. They want to be as hands off as possible.
---
 Working with virtualized servers daily tells me that's not how it works, not even a little bit. 
---
The server has a fixed amount of connections it can handle. Let's say 10 for the sake of the argument. So 10 people can login. 
---
Now I create 1 new layer giving it 2 layers in reality. 5 people in each. 
---
I can't now add 10 new connections to fill out the layers because the physical server can't handle more connections. 
---
It's just more space per player. 
---
So when layers are being removed it just means more people becomes visible. Instead of you and your guild farming devilsaurs uncontested all day you now have 3 more guilds that's been doing the same thing but on their layers there contesting you in your farm. 
---
Some muppet at Blizzard thought it was a good idea to explain layers as "seamlessly spawning more severs". It would be more accurate to say they are splitting the server into identically looking segments to help uncrowd the server for easier leveling and farming.
---
If you're horde, ignore /u/Homunkulus, two-handed is the way to go in raids.
---
That said OEB and BRE, or even spinal reaper for Orcs are all better than sulfuras for warriors, with the added benefit of not costing a literal fuckton.
---
Technically it's the best weapon for enhancement shamans but if you for whatever reason raid with one he'll be using Nightfall anyhow.
---
Sulfuras is a PvP weapon and should be elibile for anyone willing to shit out the gold needed for it to dominate PvP.
---
(When wotlk expac comes out youll be able to see it in yout statistics tab of your achievment interface)
---
Keep it for later phases. Most players aren't even 60 and if they are they don't have the gold to spare yet, still working on epic mounts, crafting bis items etc.. the economies on every server are still fresh it will take at least a year to 'normalise'. Look at osrs for example, I played since release in 2013 and the economy was all over the place untill about a year in. There simply isn't enough gold floating around yet.

These 2 are BiS for literally the whole game. There's no reason to waste gold for anything else
---
Will it come out ? Or will it stay as a version of classic forever ? Like burning crusade ?
---
I’ve always experienced it with wow on macs. Only way I’ve managed to avoid it is to keep wow in the foreground.
---
I read your voidwalker's name as ThoughtThang.
---
Funny because what sparked this post was my last run with random guild members.
---
[Or just one](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dkrhom/just_got_to_swamp_of_sorrows_killed_one_whelp_and/)
---
Nobody knows.
---
Rush rush!!!
---
Like Kungen said, you should only use loot council if nobody will personally care abouy loot.
---
guess I should see if I can find a better guild.
---
Excuse me, I actually have corruption, a curse and shadowbolt. That's like 50% more than 2 buttons.
---
Just make a new character, easy. /s
---
I was close on grabbing blackhand as I was going to have to DPS in my raid, as I didnt want to grind for HoJ. 
---
Got HoJ just a handfull of runs in BRD luckily. Super thankfull for that.
---
Why would I want an eskhanders? The proc is okay but no weapon skill makes it a garbage tank or dps weapon.
---
Taking ACLG from your dagger rogues is a dick move. I guess its an option if none of your rogues are going daggers or already have it.
---
Alcor's is a private server meme. The most important thing about it is the speed which you can get from Finkle's or even Julie's. The DPS increase from Finkles to Alcors is negligible threat-wise.
---
Foror's is ~500g on my server. That's basically nothing for what is clearly the best option for a tank weapon unless all your dps don't need raid weapons anymore.
---
I had the option to take Gutgore but passed to a rogue who wanted it for pvp because it's going to see a lot more value on that character than on me and Quel is just straight up better especially horde side with windfury. Passed Eskhander to another tank because I have edgemaster's so it's just straight up worse than a blue axe/sword/dagger.
---
Loot council more like officer loot
---
If people are dying... it must be the healers fault, they should have healed!  /s
---
I did get kicked out of a BRD. It was 4 guildies and me as the healer. I guess they had to blame someone :P
---
He's actually in my guild. We are having such shit luck with boe epics in mc and he's been sat on 7/8 for a while. Gold means nothing to Hugo.
---
Reading through all the comments, not a single fucker has said Orgrimmar.
---
5%, plus .04% for every point of defense they have over your weapon skill.
---
Probably whatever the holy bis is
---
"Hey guys, that's an upgrade for me, so I'm going to need it. That ok?"
---
Sometimes this can start a pseudo-vote within your party. I think most players will be sympathetic towards your needing of an upgrade, so even if one member disagrees, they will probably be in the minority and you'll be fine needing the item.
---
This has worked pretty well for me in the past to make sure I can get the gear upgrades I need without pissing off the other people thinking I'm just being greedy.
---
Sounds like he has to me..
---
&lt;Solidarity&gt; on Westfall is now recruiting RAIDERS!  We will be starting soon and raid times will be 8PM Friday and 7PM Sunday server time.  Reach out to me, Ronnie, either here or in game or Alexsїa in game.  The following is our list of needs:
---
Warriors - FULL
---
Rogues - High
---
Hunters - FULL
---
Mages - Medium
---
Locks - High
---
Pally - Medium
---
Priest - Shadow Priest only
---
Druid - Medium
---
I've seen groups pugging MC and Onyxia already on Mankrik.
---
I think your wand macro is broken, one command is missing
---
Horde - EU - Bloodfang - PvP
---
I am looking for leveling partners. I have a 60 rogue already and alts for every class between 15-35. I´m tired of playing mostly alone and am looking for some guys who feel the same and want to team up.
---
Dude, how.. can we get a tutorial or some shit on this?!
---
Twinking is a lot of fun, both as a means to let off some steam and as a very tactical pvp experience, especially if you roll with and against good premades. Can be annoying for the regular player starting out in a specific pvp bracket, but endgame, a fresh 60 vs a raid equipped 60 is equally difficult in pvp.
---
Fewer skills and less op gear makes for very fun matches, I'd personally go for a 39 shaman (had one back in the day) or druid twink, rogues are great at all brackets.
---
If you have a 60 main, getting the twink gear is rather easy, in fact, in your grind to lvl 60, you'll end up finding some good twink items for personal use later or you can save them for when bg's drop to make some decent gold.
---
Min/Maxing became a lot more widespread in WoW in the Wrath days when gear score became a thing.
---
-cue some guy who's going to tell me he min/maxed UBRS back in 2004.  great, good for you.-
---
Back in Vanilla and still in TBC, people ran instances  with whatever warm body was attuned.  Only thing people cared about was "How much FR do you have?".  As the game went along, more and more addons and websites were created to help you squeak 2% more damage out, and now here we are 15 years later, where people are bringing the 2019 min/maxing, personal loot mentality to a 2004 social game, and we see this.
---
For most of those I'd start calling them out and if they do it again I just kick them. And I don't give a flying fuck if it's the tank, the heal or my mom.
---
The achievement system, barber shop, I could argue the fact that all specs are viable to an extent is nice. There's more I'm sure but classic is classic and it's such a more fulfilling and rewarding experience
---
They are not considering the group I want with I run with the warrior who doesn't need it and weekly arena angered under 8 minutes we still hit the instance cap per hour. When we also clear golem it takes just under 15 minutes which is the perfect amount to never have to stop. I'm rolling against noone
---
Shouldn't the guild pay for that shit?
---
For BGs or world pvp?
---
If I am going to tank a dungeon I don't need anything from I'd better get paid 1 way or another. People are generally more willing to part with unwanted items then pay upfront. 
---
It's 1 of the few ways tanks and healers can farm some gold.
---
Really cool. But should move chat in left Black Box. And minimap in middel with targets target under.
---
&gt; But i guess if the maintank dies without anyone in the group getting aggro and the healer still being at 50% mana without there being a lot of damage i guess you can say its the healers fault right?
---
Not necessarily, some warriors will "tank" in leather gear, some will do insanely huge pulls and die in a global (some will do both).
---
This is really cool. You could charge people gold or cash to set this up for other classes etc.
---
Thanks for the answer :)   
---
Yeah, loot distribution is my main interest here - to avoid giving loot to people that won't / shouldn't use it the majority of the time. 
---
So my thoughts would be funnelling all T1 pieces to a single shaman to begin with, but making that shaman aware of the fact that he won't be getting any of the off-pieces (or T2) before the other shamans have them - and similarly, that other shamans won't be getting any T1 pieces before the 8/8 guy has it. 
---
Similarly, due to the stat distribution on T1, I was thinking it might make sense to have the one or two T1 shamans get prio on jewelry, cloaks, weps, and such, to make up for the lack of +heal on the set.   
---
I guess the optimal amount of 8T1 shamans in a raid depends on how many shamans you have in that raid, and the general distribution of healers, to have a generally healthy balance between strong raid healers and single target healers. But I'd guess that you'd rarely want more than 2 due to how strong chain heal is?
---
Both I guess? Mostly BGs
---
How do I keep him happy beside feeding him?
---
Which numbers have you been watching? The census addons were banned over a month ago, no?
---
From your tone I get the feeling you feel like I am having a go, I really am not and I apologise if it comes across that way mate.
---
Like I said I do not care if people reserve stuff or not, if I really want something that is reserved, I simply dont join a run, its no skin off my nose.
---
I am just saying in all the mmos I have played way back since FFXI I have always held the opinion that every role has value and worth if played well, and is a hinderance if played badly.  So I generally prefer to spend the extra time finding people I enjoy the company of rather than giving a shit about being efficient thats all.
---
Make a 49 twink and you get a mount x
---
Not the achievments but the statistics! I love to see that info
---
O.k fair counterargument and I can totally get behind what you are saying. I will still contest that his AoE farming potential is better than that of other classes. I watched him Solo'ing several parts of DM and thought there was no way other classes could replicate the same quality and tactics of his mage, but I will grant that the number our hours he has under his belt far outweighs that of the average player.
---
Automatic dismount!
---
I chuckled, thank you
---
Guy clears Shadowfang Keep x100 time to farm a 0.06% drop rate [Shadowfang](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1482)... just because he wants a short break from level 60 grind ?
---
Nah I dont think so.
---
I would absolutely love to make one, but it would probably be more of me telling people how to make these changes and exporting my weakauras. Because of monitor resolution, everybody would need to align the bars themselves, so it’s not really something I can just drop online for people to use on their set ups, as there are so many static variables.
---
Bloomoo is the best!
---
Can confirm. He's a guildie.
---
To be fair, he probably did that on accident.
---
You can always make the last 2 buttons be pagers between action bars 😅
---
New tavern theme from TBC. I think it's better sounding than the one we have in Classic.
---
I'm a shadow priest and I got lucky enough to get Archivist Cape of Shadow Wrath on my first strat live run (ridiculous I know), obviously it's not realistically attainable for the vast majority of people. Prior to that I was using Spritecaster's Cape as I definitely think it was better than Shroud of the Exile - I picked Fordring's Seal (the healing ring) from that quest as it was much more useful for offspec healing than the shroud was for shadow.
---
Take the wowhead bislists with a grain of salt, the one for shadow priests in particular seems wonky to me and while I use it for ideas it is by no means all correct.
---
As an example of the same thing you mentioned, the Felcloth Hood and Postmaster's Band are listed as the optional bis other than the Green Lens of SW - but the Crimson Felt Hat from Strat is better than the hood and A LOT better than the Postmaster's Band. The Crimson Felt Hat is by no means a niche item nobody knows about either.
---
Keep in mind these wowhead bislists are opinion articles written by specific players and some (like shadow priest, being a niche spec itself) might be hastily wrapped together in order to provide content on the site.
---
I don't think the caps are technical limitations anymore but rather arbitrary design limitations. Blizzard can probably easily merge two layers techniques but it would be a terrible experience.
---
Tame a boar.  Boars eat everything except eggs, and are a great all-purpose pet.  You need to feed any pet a ton of food right after you tame it (sometimes a couple stacks worth).  You ALWAYS want your pet to have the green happy face next to it's portrait frame.  If it ever goes to the red frownie face your pet is at risk to run away.  
---
As your pet levels higher, the type of food needed to keep it happy will get higher too.  For example, the cheapest food you buy at a general goods vendor will not do much for your pet at level 25.  After level 45 or so, you're going to need to start buying the good, more expensive stuff to keep your pet happy.
---
The issue with this site is it doesn’t have access to any API like Undermine Journal, so we don’t know what actually sold for what amount. It only shows the listing prices. One could go and fuck up the info of an item on a server by listing a boat load of one product at an absurd price.
---
Are you volunteering to be my first customer? ;D
---
Its a pretty strong OH for rogues. But tanks always first.
---
nt 'log in with blizzard'
---
Oh sorry, should be corrected to 1/0/0.
---
which one are you OP?
---
Yeah 27% there. [My gear.](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/rogue/undead/AjwRAFAjEE8CMwUgIFUBACAfBfCBQgw8KgI8M4NBt1hBhUG0TjkGOSwHOtaIM5o2QolHx04qijrXTiwLRTEMMyoNSrAONo2PNBw2OpBCrzZ3kUfYTkISSPg)
---
Allows for faster casting and less clicking. Normally, you use the ability and it gives you a targeting cursor that you then have to click again to activate the ability.
---
The @cursor part immediately casts the ability at the cursor location bypassing the targeting phase.
---
If anyone but the healer has aggro from anything but the focus target, he better doesn't expect me to go out of my way to help him. I will not let him die on purpose, but often I won't risk losing aggro on everything else as I chase a single mob either.
---
It's a FM UD thing :/
---
Or just buy it like I did for 5g.....the AH is saturated with twink items...it’s stupid cheap to make one rn.... and yes that’s what a lot of people do... like I said if you haven’t done it, you will not understand
---
Absolutely, done everything up to Raggi a few times in a pug
---
Tauren are really chill friendly people. Old ladies always play as tauren females
---
So edgy!
---
Then his coordinates would have been 42.00 69.00
---
I remember getting Classic at Target. While installing the 6? CD's I was reading the handguide and looking at the pictures. Man I was so hyped
---
Chat -&gt; Alerts
---
for horde killing an ally in a 3v1 situation is worth celebrating
---
I always imagine they type gz to each other in world chat afterwards
---
My thoughts exactly.  If it leads to a wipe twice though, that's a different story.
---
Res sickness scales starting at level 10, to eventually get to the 75% mark
---
Warcraft III Reforged is finally out
---
I dislike your opinion.
---
Having a raidlogger who does not contribute to a guild's atmosphere apart from killing bosses real quick to then take the new loot into his 7 day hiatus is actually hurtful. 
---
This isnt retail in which there is no content apart from mythic+ and mythic raiding. 
---
If the raidlogger wouldnt soak up gear that he only ever uses in raid content then this wouldnt be a problem.
---
However good guilds like to do more than logging in once a week mandatorily.
---
So, yes. Sharing gear among 39 who log in on a consistent basis is better than share loot with 40 but having to give loot to somebody who isnt online a lot.
---
ahh ok i skipped the private server thing otherwise id prolly not be playing classic right now. 
---
That pretty sad the whole thing.
---
Hahaha that is so good!!!
---
That's such a good way to teach your whole raid  to follow instructions and work together 😄🤣
---
And not automatic dismount when you *touch* water.
---
Also keep in mind that Dreamstate is not a very "casual" guild at all. 
---
Most guilds can't do 20 man MC's at this point, unless they are hardcore guilds, which I'd say over 90% of guilds are not. 
---
It's possible to do it, but most people don't have the time to farm flasks, consumables, clear DM and get buffs, go felwood and get songflower then back to SW for Onyxia buff. 
---
That's for only a dedicated few. Dreamstate is also a pretty old guild with many members having 5-10 years of pserver vanilla experience.
---
Not an issue. They clearly advertised in their message. If you want those things, don't reply to them.
---
Think of all that time wasted. You clearly enjoyed playing the game, as you got to the 40s, and must've spent a long time playing it. Then you thought hmm maybe it'd be good to get totally OP by being able to buy anything from the AH and spent your hard-earned cash on in-game gold. BIG MISTAKE, BUCKO. No doubt you have overwhelming regret now, but it's too late. I have a little bit of sympathy for you, because I'd hate to be banned from this amazing game, but my word do you deserve it.
---
What about it?
---
when people say something doesn't scale well, they usually mean with gear at 60.
---
Pets don't like being dismissed/not being out and fighting harder enemies seems to upset them faster than fighting easier enemies.
---
I feel like most of the time this can be avoided by simply saying "mind if I need? it's an upgrade to [currentweapon]"
---
If they still complain, fuck them. Odds are they prob won't complain but they'll be waiting for you to equip it to make sure you weren't ninja looting.

Orb goes for 100+ on my server. I wouldn't say people are not hyped for toys
---
Duly noted. Thanks for the information guys! It’s been very helpful.
---
*and another player who doesn't know how to capture screen*
---
oh wait...
---
hmm, i havent seen a single bot yet.
---
im not sure why tough.
---
maybe now bots are starting to appear since more people start leveling their twinks and those are more botted than mains or maybe devs figured out a good way to circumvent blizzards bot detection. or maybe its a regional thing.
---
what server do you play on?
---
So if I let him fight often he will be more happy ?
---
Happy cakeday.
---
It took me as a tank almost an hour to get an arena run going yesterday (no I didn’t turn anyone away). We are just hitting the point where all the try hards are already geared up and all the normies are still leveling.  
---
Also the number of runs that I get randomly asked to tank that already contain at least 2 tank capable classes who are only dps is growing by a very large number.  Pro tip to all the dps only warriors and druids: learn to tank. I will not tank for a cat Druid or an arms/fury warrior outside my own guild.  I was forced to tank because of the shortage even though I’ll be going fury to raid. Do your part!
---
Fuck that if the boe is worth 500g tho.
---
I don't get why people would care about such cheap boes though.
---
Just get another rogue to duo it with you. I got it after 8 duo runs. Buddy took 18. You can get them down to 5 minutes each. Reset instance, repeat.
---
Hey! Glad you like it, I’ve made different versions of this and I find the best balance of authenticity/functionality is to keep the chat above the viewport (like it was in WC3. Unfortunately I don’t think there are any addons that allow you to customize the dimensions of the minimap independent of each other, meaning I don’t think you can make an elongated MM to fit the black box. Thanks for the suggestions though!

Chunksss had it right.. the alure and mystery was so awesome. It felt like stepping into a new world. I used to love looking at maps of game worlds
---
Hopefully classic forever.
---
Not very often, because they fall back in line quickly once the kick hammer gets mentioned. Also most players are rather decent, therefore it does not happen too often that you have to mention it.
---
if a 500g world drop hits, everyone needs it. You can disagree, but you're wrong.
---
I can name dozens ways a class can take a loot that is meant for a different class and different armor type/weapon type but can still use it, but it would be waste of loot to that class, and it IS ninja because it shouldnt be used by anyone other than a caster. Deal with it!
---
Yeah but this is above the 75% mark...
---
In PVP you have limited time with your target so 2hands tend to win out.
---
this game is filled with greedy morons that need on every BOE just because they can sell it on the AH and try to justify it as well. Disgusting behavior from a bunch of self-centered assholes

Raiding and Organized PvP
---
#### About Us
---
We are a group of returning players. Armed with the knowledge of _we are adults with jobs and families,_ we aim to make the best of our 'limited' playtime by surrounding ourselves with like-minded allies. We want to create a place where being in a guild means something.
---
We have a strict **no bigotry** policy. We are too old and too busy to deal with racism and hate.
---
#### Goals
---
We want to clear raids at a relaxed pace with a fun group. Then turn around and take that gear and organization and put it to use cracking Alliance skulls. 
---
#### Schedule
---
Progression raids will be Wednesday/Thursday, starting around 9pm EST. Farm raids will take place on weekends. Drinking encouraged, but not mandatory.
---
Tuesday night Attunement runs will be hosted as needed at 9:30pm EST to get fresh players the attunements they need
---
#### Loot Distribution
---
Loot Council will be the main form of loot distribution for progression raiding. 
---
#### Looking For
---
*New Players!* - We know Classic is an opportunity for a lot of players who never experienced vanilla (or Warcraft at all!) to join the game. We happily accept you!
---
*Raiders!* - We are looking for members to fill out our raid team. We are recruiting all classes, with an emphasis on healers and dps!
---
[Get in discord for more information!](https://discord.gg/PwJpWAk)
---
Maybe, but then you should press greed. You know, the gold coins.
---
Yer there are random Raid pugs all the time on my server.
---
The picture shows it at 82% reduced.
---
I totally agree with you if it really was a solid upgrade. If it on the other hand was like 0.4 dps increase i can see why they got mad.
---
I mean you can't really compare those scenarios. Of course the top guilds will clear through Naxx quickly. They have done that numerous times before and they will do it again. They know their prefered  raid comp, they have their strats down.
---
None of that was the case back in 2006.
---
Also those speedruns were done using every (world) buff available, with a highly optimized group (stacking Warriors, Rogues and some Mages) in full Naxx gear. That is not your typical raid night environment.
---
I actually like all of that, having the control, setting the pace, etc. 
---
But the people, they literally have made it so I hate doing something would otherwise love.
---
So the price did not iterate over time even with a higher demand for raid / pvp flasks? That's very interesting.
---
Very cool!
---
I routinely have to tell my groups "Don't worry guys, I won't get mad if you pull agro, as long as you don't get mad having to deal with the outcome"
---
Imagine not having 9% hit, lul
---
Retail now have personal loot. It's completely different system, btw. And many people quit because of it. 
---
I didn't say it hasn't been changed, I said nobody has invented anything better. And it is one of the reasons people have asked for Classic. So please, make some research, you are very far away from reality.
---
Okay, see above me mentioning I might be talking out my ass - this certainly applies here. I'm sorry!
---
One thing is don’t feed them items one after the other. It should be like feed one, wait 10 seconds, feed another, wait, etc. 
---
There is a delay in between each one, if you just feed it repeatedly in a short period it will only count the first one
---
What if I need the 4g to buy a class appropriate weapon for myself?
---
thats a good one!
---
Plus if you actually know how to gear a character at this level the only thing they really got on you are enchants... back in the day during BC I could hold my own vs some twinks (29 pally full str and stam gear and corpsemaker) I had sooo much fun compete in game with the twinks, it was a challenge of sorts for myself
---
I would like to know aswell
---
Almost all BoE drama is about poor communication. Which is why I have a macro asking the group to vote on how to proceed with BoE's.
---
I guess it wasn't very clear by my post that I've been playing other classes. That's my fault :)
---
It's completely unrealistic to expert crafters to have the mats for every item they can make, like their bank is Amazon.
---
Don’t let it die.
---
I couldnt reliably kill it even with 1rog and 1 druid
---
I'm going to say badlands.
---
Just let the dps who pull threat constantly die. My only priority when tanking is keeping things off the healer.
---
If DPS want to ignore marks and smash all their cool downs at the start of the pull it’s their repair bill. 
---
I’ve never been raged at it, and they often notice their own mistakes and say sorry I attacker the wrong target etc.
---
My bad, it’s early :-(
---
Same here. I've had 40+ powders since forever.
---
Thanks Hugo
---
The world is never black and white. Obviously if you don't take 40, you also do not need to run with 20. But if you have 2 or 3 raidloggers that you would like to replace you can just go with 34 people and be just fine in MC and Onyxia.
---
Oh really? Gotta check this out because I have it. Thanks!
---
I tested it out. It is not. Thick hide is +10% of your bear form armor. You don’t get a multiplicative effect. But either way. +10% of 10k armor is still a big deal.
---
IDK my guild has cleared mc 5 times now and have like 1 boe per run. And one was cloudkeeper legplates not even tier. I think we're just unlucky but still the boes are eluding us
---
yea bad luck
---
meanwhile I got my dm trinket in the first tribute when I also got my dagger belt and ring
---
Thanks! I appreciate it.
---
Sold the first compendium for Quel Serrar on my server for 1500g as well. That weapon isn't even good for warriors ._.
---
Warsong are Arathi are too objective focused. Alterac is like world pvp with a full 40 vs 40 packed in a not so large map. Squirmishes all over the place, the back and forth can last quite a while. It's the only BG that feels like a true battleground.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Warsong Gulch is too cheesy. You quickly realise one team is more organised, has a better flag carrier, dedicated healers and you can't do much about it.
---
Arathi is okayish, can lead to some good action and squirmishes but damn, the agony you have to suffer when your team is able to defend 2 points but can't capture the 3rd is long and painful.
---
I had 200g at lvl 40 with the mount bought but that was at the start when skinning still made bank.
---
Why Demoralizing Shout is never mentioned in Druid Tank rotations? I thought that is a must and generates threat, especially when there are more than 2 mobs.
---
I've played Mage, Warlock, and Hunter to level 10 or so so far.
---
oh man, what a savage! lol.
---
By actually benefiting from the money blizz made me waste.
---
Well it’s easy when they got enablers like this person defending them right?
---
There is another feral and a priest looking for it in my guild. I’ve ran ubrs like 30+ times for it and got to the point where I was doing rituals before skinning it.
---
1k for a tier 1 belt lol? either a gold seller or someone with more money than sense.
---
happened to me yesterday, DE-Venoxis, ticket still pending...
---
Achievements led to having to link the achievement for invites which wasn't a very friendly phenomenon
---
Blackhands breadth over mark of tyranny?
---
But now it has and the advice to trade only 1 crafts worth at a time is very good advice.
---
I'm neither, was just questing along when guild chat got spicy all of a sudden.
---
Just get it into your head what he said - boes have the same value for everyone, boes have the same value for everyone, boes have the same value for everyone.
---
the default keyboard shortcuts
---
character creation screen can show you representative armor and iconic abilities
---
the quest panel
---
the overlay tutorial when you first play the game
---
In my guilds 5 MCs I think we've had 5 boe tier pieces 1 per run...
---
They’re both so fast it shouldn’t make much of a difference. If that’s the kicker for you then play whichever you enjoy most.
---
Uh not quite, paladins are great at both tank and raid healing, but it's quite different from how priests and druids heal. Paladins spam flash of light 99% of the time, which can spot heal random damage across the raid, and negate boss auto attacks on the tank, but you still need someone with bigger heals to respond to big spikes - unless you want to throw like 4 paladins on the tank that is. So a priest or druid precasting big heals is always useful.

Bonebiter is the next imminent upgrade for Alliance, it's obtained from the SM quest. Executioner's Cleaver is a level 43 BOE you can purchase off the AH if you can afford it. There are also 2 weapons from Archaedas in Uldaman which are perfect for Arms Warriors because of their weapon damage, despite not being axes. Failing any of those, you should be looking at BoE green items in the late-40s.
---
Of course, it's worth mentioning you should get Ravager from SM armoury and set up a weapon-swap macro to equip it when you are in an AoE pull.
---
As a tank, I feel hunters can deal with the agro they produce, either with FD, Pet or mail gear. I mark a skull, and before I've got 2 sunders up they do multishot. Like, in what world do they think that just as I'm getting solid agro on the main target, that I'm going to have enough threat on everything else that they can do that?  
---
So whatever I lose to them, I let them handle. I only ever watch the healer, and that's the only person I'll come to the rescue of, as they can't help generating AoE threat.
---
15g

Well we brought one rogue for truestrikes and 2 locks, 1 mage for Reed so....
---
I want that item for gold = greed 
---
I want that item because it’s better than what I have = need
---
You = dumb for not being able to grasp this
---
How is that a very specific case no one is discussing lmao it's testing the limit of his argument. 
---
Youre an idiot stop trying to call out fallacys you clearly dont understand to sound smart.
---
On private servers that event is faster, and you're in combat the entire time so it becomes an endurance battle where you can't drink between fights.
---
Much more interesting. On Classic it just tests your ability to stay away, which I guess is just a different type of endurance test.
---
I agree with your view on this! All the small nuisances are what make it epic and "real" to some extent!

Come join Rattlegore! From my experience it’s very balanced, I believe it’s 55-45 horde which I think is the best for a PvP server out there. The community is also very awesome and friendly and willing to help out when asked. I’ve been apart of a couple zone raids too and it’s a great time!
---
Great! That makes things much easier.

---
Epics you get plenty of. Legendaries, aside from TF after tanks? No.
---
Do you understand what need is? Need implies need. Needs include sleep and food. Greed and need on a 500g level on a video game are literally the same. BOPs are a different story. I know you'd like to try to counter the logic here by saying that "well in that case everyone should need on everything!" but thats only because you don't have a good argument.
---
Retail did a lot of things well but they were all ruined by xrealm and LFG functions. 
---
Also not a fan of the streamlined talents in retail.

It’s a horde tourney

Hmm I wish I could.. I don't have the debuff anymore this morning.. although I am in the same gear / level as last night and the addon is showing I have 1618 hp and 3187 Mana... one sec.
---
BoM?
---
Oh neat
---
As a feral this is really hard choice
---
U sure? Looks legit to me
---
No worries, just good to get the right info out :).
---
Thats why i have 4 days waiting time for my request. They are busy with more important things.
---
Yeah I had my HS in Nijel's Point for Mara farming and used this one a lot!
---
Nice reading comprehension, smootbrain.
---
It does eat a keybind.. shift + whatever is already bound to something else. So having a shift modifier still eats the exact same keybind, because I can't use it for something else.
---
Boo!
---
Just don't let him drop into unhappy. You know where his mood icon is? That should be green as often as possible. It turns yellow, time to feed him. If it turns red, you are doing something wrong.
---
Keep in mind that your pet has to stay out of combat for 20 seconds after being fed to get the full effect of the food. Don't spam food either, that just wastes it.
---
How are classes better in retail? They are literally the same class with different skins
---
And cmon dungeon drops better?  Don't lie to yourself you dont even look at dungeon drops in retail meanwhile in classic you are going into a specific dungeon to get a specific item
---
Ah I didn't know there was one in Ashenvale, neat!
---
DynamicCam situation set to zoom in depending on whether you're going into a cave, or an inn. So it zooms in, at which point you can either switch to wasd to avoid the headache or continue to use CTM if you're good enough. (Camera is freecam, so the arrowkeys do not turn your character.) When you leave the shop or the cave, it zooms back out!
---
k why did you reply that to me
---
Guarantee he doesn't
---
The armor increase from the other trinkets make them much, much better for damage mitigation.
---
Dodge is nice, but it's not enough to outweigh the massive armor increase.
---
False, you want about 5-6% with 2handers depending on if 300 or 305 weapon skill and you want 7-8% with 1handers. In PvP off-hand will miss regardless of how much hit you have.
---
I'd add that as soon as you have a geared fury warrior, you can send him to tank without the need to even respecc into prot.
---
We did several Stratholme runs and you can pretty much clear the entire place as long as you do it grp by grp.

Yeah they noticed I had my account since 2004. And wrote 2 lines about that.

Just got a message in game from a lvl 1 orc named Blizzard w an accent over the I in Durotar saying, "\[Blizzard Administrator\] General Manager: We are investigating unusual accounts. Please visit helpie battle.cn to verify otherwise  we will suspend your account. 3brWj" Im guessing this is just some weird scam  but yea.
---
Yes today.... I got mine early... I was smart! The first 2 weeks no one had gold so they would only sell for like 8-10 on the high end... there’s STILL tons of BiS items for twinks on the AH I have been slowly collecting items and plan on reselling or using them... just because you don’t like it/ don’t understand/ suck at finding cheap items, doesn’t mean we all do pal!  All I see here is a retail mentality m, you guys probably love heirlooms and hope they put them in classic
---
This cannot be playable.
---
I appreciate it, man!
---
You are over valuing gold and under valuing the time it takes to win loot from tribute runs.
---
This is just fucking wrong
---
It's greed because you are a greedy Mogo that wants gold not because you need the item
---
How is that even a discussion
---
i want that weakaura, please share it
---
That's pretty cool. Then you would only be limited by the render distance for your character, right?
---
Hey guys! I'm pretty new and have never really asked for any enchanting. I got Nightblade from a drop the other day and love it but I want to put some agility and strength on it considering im going to be replacing my WW Axe. How much does it usually cost for enchants?

Sysadmin here - turns out people like me enjoy eating, paying our bills, stuff like that. I’m always very grateful when things are offered for free, especially as there are more ways to make money than a straight fee to access... but the fact that people are surprised someone would like to be paid for their work is a little worrying to me. Especially given how readily gamers will fork over endless amounts of money to billion dollar companies for lootboxes/pets/other shinies.

I actually run and manage the poker events I had to make the heading short. We have just finished setting up the day 4 Day 2.
---
I took the photo before heading to the auction house obviously
---
You should try to put together a regular group and trade tanking A/A/G runs with tanking a dungeon that casters actually want to do. Maybe trade A/A/G runs for DM or Scholo or Strat.
---
More valuable to that party member for the last 10 minutes of the dungeon until he can reach an auction house and buy that boe he so desperately needs.
---
&gt; A DPS who keeps intentionally pulling after being asked not to?
---
&gt; A player who ninjas chests "because he saw them first"?
---
Leveling he gets a warning, at 60 he gets a boot.
---
&gt; A player who kills a mind controlled healer or tank, leading to a wipe?
---
No, unless he demonstrates that he did so intentionally.
---
&gt; A player who unintentionally keeps screwing up, pulling additional mob packs or triggering stuff he shouldn't?
---
I'd probably give a few warnings, concluding with something like 'stand 20 feet behind us and don't attack until x player does.'
---
&gt; An outright terrible or half-afk player who doesn't pull his weight?
---
Only if he's repeatedly AFK for portions of the dungeon or makes it impossible to complete due to his absence. Sometimes RL happens and you have to step away from the game.
---
&gt; A player who keeps talking bullshit in group chat?
---
&gt; A player who intentionally screws the group over, e.g. by massive pulls, because "LUL it's fun"?
---
Most "Loot Council" guilds never share loot. They give all the loot to the friends / officers who run the guild or the people they like best. If they don't know you, you'll never see a single drop. 
---
A lot of us have been through this in at least one guild and we know better than to believe that it will be different this time around.
---
Don't listen to him. Mark of Tyranny is BiS for bear druids. The \~900 armor is better than the 1% dodge.
---
I feel that this is a good part about being a new player tanking in classic (I have almost no experience with the game outside of classic, just wanted to get into it because I heard this version of the game is better and having a great time).
---
I've done enough research and watched enough videos to be informed on how to tank reliably, but I don't yet have the awareness to spot too many mistakes from my damage regarding threat etc. I guess ignorance truly is bliss lol.
---
Since the lower levels typically take a very short amount of time since mobs are pretty forgiving and quests can give several bars of xp you won’t see that many people doing anything in groups at that point.  The unfortunate reality is that the tutorial zone is not the most fun part of the game.  Just pick your favorite class and get out of the starter zones and you’ll be far happier.
---
With that said though, I totally get that feeling.  It’s hard to pick your “forever” class when you’re new.
---
Maybe it’s necessary to watch a couple videos to get an idea of where you want to go before you commit another several hours to what most people regard to be the worst part of the game.
---
Hello fellow Razorgore players.
---
**Mark of the Chosen,** i you're able to have 100% uptime on this, this is better than HotM. Which pretty much is only possible if you're tanking alot of mobs such as trash or boosting.
---
No current boss is immune to taunt, except Onyxia.
---
And why do you say they are best tanks?
---
This
---
In 13 years of wow I have never met anyone that disagrees with that
---
It's not for you to decide what should be there and what not. It was added with a reason. It worked well with BoE. You just don't understand those reasons and why it is so important, because you think about economics, not about a community. For you economics are more important than community. 
---
Even before Greed button was added people was deciding who needs item for equip and who needs it for gold. Greed button is just a convenient option. The main decision is made by the community itself. So even with one button good community don't NEED what they don't need to use.
---
&gt;This is why you have laid out criteria and priority for who deserves what.
---
Most loot councils operate in the shadows, never explain decisions, and coincidentally give ALL the loot to a small handful of players who may or may not deserve it - but definitely know the guild leader IRL.
---
&gt; Yeah but personal loot is recent isn't it (I think it was an option in Legion and mandatory in BFA?)
---
It was first introduced in Cataclysm, with patch 4.3.0 released in November 2011.
---
I hate when I pounce and the target is immune to stun... so then it doesn’t put the bleed affect on them.
---
maybe he wanted to save dkp
---
This was my opinion aswell. Then i had my first bug in classic that involved help from a GM. A quest reward simply was not rewarded. My bags were not full. I got no message only the XP showed up.
---
Their response was basically "sucks to be you" in nicer words. Then i had 2 more bugs / issues and got the same sucks to be you, we already got your money response.
---
Yes it is.
---
Any priests here who does tinkerer + princess farms? Im wondering if it could be a good source of income when i hit 60 and have to specc for raids
---
i love the vanilla wolf run animation, then they went and fucked it up in retail for the newer mounts around WoD
---
Imagine spreading such misinformation, its not less value than pservers, its even BETTER
---
Someone doesn't know their statistics it seems.
---
Yep, that is the main limiting factor. Nameplates obviously won't render from more than 20(?) yards away and character models from 60(?). Those can't be changed, and shouldn't be! (for pvp reasons)
---
I'm going to go an entirely different direction and say this is Blizz's fault. For fantasy RP reasons they want magic classes to use melee weapons...that is fine. Those weapons will NEVER be used in melee, however, so they shouldn't even have damage stats. If a sword, or mace, or dagger is just a stat stick, then that is what they should have made it. Giving those items actually decent melee damage stats is just begging for situations like this.
---
Yea, sounds like retail is for you lol, Nothing wrong with that, enjoy!
---
You get to be a pvp god and gank fools in the open world, the greatest gift of all!
---
If you're playing a druid. There's two wrong decision and exactly one right decision.
---
Exactly this.
---
You deserve it for taking pictures of your screen
---

On the contrary, it's quite fun :D
---
Does Hypnotic Blade *really*  have the same droprate as the staff from SM Lib? I ran the place at least 10 times, saw the staff drop literally every time, and the blade not even once.
---
Question about soul shards. Is it worth it to use a soul bag to carry them or should I just use a normal bag? How many shards do you tend to carry around with you? I try for 10ish.
---
People do act like gold is hard to get. I bought my epic mount last week and have 300g again now. I’m not trying to farm it, even a little... I just sell what I pick up on the AH, it adds up.
---
If you are actively farming gold you’ll be making thousands with ease.
---
I will personally start my questline to get bonebiter today. Being level 40 and not wanting to ask anyone to help me with whirlwind axe quest  I think I will skip it altogether. 
---
Much easier to tank in SM for bonebiter quest completion:) and some fun traveling is in front of me for that quest to now that I have my mount:)
---
That's quite some assumptions you are making, wtf are you on? Picked up a bunch of decent twink gear early on myself, bought my epic mount and got enough gold to buy stuff and cover consumables in healing spec at. You don't see me spouting the sort of attitude that your post oozes with, however. Wow. You sound more like a 12yo retail brat than a reasonable person old enough to buy a drink in a bar.
---
They are gonna be looking for a looooong timd
---
When I would pug remaining spots plate gear, bindings went to tanks to roll (albeit tanks weren't pug)
---
Probably yes! I just thought that Demoralizing Shout has the same threat gen as Battle Shout
---
The cheapest one with the most damage. Don't limit yourself to axes. There are good cheap swords on ah because everyone already specced for axes and only want the axe.
---
Interesting. My understanding is the 180 armor is more valuable than the dodge as that 180 will scale with bear form.
---
I agree but its also such a weird item to acquire and sell for gold.
---
So OP is a Nigerian prince?
---
I have 1438HP Naked. If I take my stamina of 108 (49 + 59) and reduce it by 82% (108 \* 0.18) = 19.44
---
If I consider 10HP per stam, I get 19.44 \* 10 = 194
---
If I add 194 + 1438 (Naked Base HP) = 1632.
---
It's not quite 1618 but it's very close. Comparatively doing this calculation with 75% would result in me having 1708 HP (further off).
---
This calculation could also be wrong, so I'm not sure!
---
My guild uses loot council and no one in the guild complains, but to achieve that is not effortless.
---
My guild has a massive spreadsheet for all class roles and will list high priority and low priority items and who got what, as well as attendence and item history, so if someone wonders why player b got an item over player c they can easily see why, such as player c has x more items already, or player c has lower attendence.
---
Basically make the loot council transparent so people can actually see why someone gets an item over someone else and dispel any doubt about unfair reasons.
---
My tip is that take your time. Don't try to push to 60. If game starts to be chore you end up quitting. If you feel like one day you don't want to gain single level and just go fishing instead then go ahead. Do what you want to, 60 will come eventually.
---
Although I tried WoW in the past for free, I started paying because of Classic.
---
I bounce between the two now but Classic is my main game.
---
lol
---
When I had the quest to kill ishamuhale I saw 3 people standing around the tree and when I placed the carcass at it and killed him they raged at me saying they’ve been waiting there for him LOL
---
More functional and better website than the current one.
---
You should honestly be getting 3-5 per run, so your luck is really shitty. Better delete guild and character and restart, I think you're cursed.
---
Thanks for the answer! So I should use it only for reducing dmg? Do you have any good threat monitoring addon?
---
thats not what im talking about, im talking about the portion of people who say that its "too powerful"
---
dang you're really in a dark place huh. good luck with your mental health brother.
---
Yeah, you're just unlucky. Try running maraudon 15+ times for the buckler to drop from tinkerer.
---
Sure thing buddy. Keep telling yourself that needing for gold isn’t the definition of greed. 
---
Not sure why you are taking it so personally, I would just call you a filthy ninja and move on.
---
I mean I haven’t done it, but think of it like this. I can farm herbs and make 200g, then pay to get my item. Solo, relaxing, on my time, guaranteed...
---
*Or* I can run it over and over again with countless failed runs, poor drops, lost rolls, and frustration. How many hours will that take? How much gold can you farm in the same time?
---
Personally I don’t have an interest as I want to play the game and get gear that way, but from a economic standpoint it’s actually not bad.
---
Yup, someone in my guild paid 300g for the 2h axe (forget the name) that was in the chest
---
He prob plays alliance hence the language barrier
---
Well, if your 15 years old experience and your current 40 level warrior experience makes you say " there is no alternative to warrior tanks" you might as well have played minecraft. 
---
As I stated bear tanks are great for all current content, and will be for 90% of content released.
---
It’s double the value to someone that does not spend the gold on it and can use it for effectiveness in healing and or combat. Maybe more than they depending on the item.
---
True, but 15k gold made more sense in Cata than it does two months into Classic.
---
I’m too drunk to taste this chicken. - Eleanor Roosevelt
---
Thank you for your great content to this sub.  Someone that can meme should put in shuddering to the jaina version and liking his own version.
---
You are a victim of your own words...I say “ I see a retail mentality and you prolly want heirlooms in the game”  which isn’t bratty or childish...people actually want that but it’s a retail thing. You in turn call me names lol...you guys are arguing your own point of view and that’s it! Like I said thinking is fun, if you don’t understand it because you have never done it than that’s fine but don’t come at me sideways for posting an explanation and than having to defend said explanation because you and the other dudes personal feelings on the situation
---
Let me return the question
---
How are classes in classic better most classes have a 1 spell rotations and while lvling shaman and hunter I'm 80% of the time just auto attacking not using any spells. And I'm not even mentioning the balance that is completely absent in classic.
---
only hunters and priests got special weps in classic like the bow/staff
---
thats just how it is
---
From what I understand, and I'm too afraid to confirm, you now get loot from bosses specifically designed for you. And also dont worry if its not your spec because your gear changes with you spec and you can change your spec with a button push.
---
Not attack power..only crit, marginally..
---
You don't want to go daggers if you don't have the *really* good ones.
---
At least in the OG days it wasn't allowed:
---
Here’s a copy of naming policy in 2006
---
Naming Policy
---
"What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."
---
--William Shakespeare
---
One of the first adventures you will embark upon within World of Warcraft will be that of choosing a character name. While your subsequent exploits should prove infinitely more exhilarating, great care should be given to name selection. The first impression other players have of you will be based on your name, so it's best to start off on the right foot.
---
While choosing the perfect name for your character, guild, or pet is generally left to your discretion, we ask that you refrain from using certain types of names. These types of names are detailed in the categories below. If a name is found that violates these policies we will change the name and take further action if the name is inappropriate. In addition, the GM staff will only change a name that has been found in violation of this policy; we are unable to change character names upon request.
---
Below are guidelines to help you determine whether or not the name you have chosen is appropriate for your character, guild, or pet. Hopefully, we encompass all manner of barred names; however there may be inappropriate names which do not fit into any of these categories. We reserve the right to evaluate each incident on a case by case basis, and in extreme cases, take action beyond what is detailed here.
---
Highly Inappropriate
---
Names which fall under the following categories are deemed to be highly inappropriate. Clarification on what constitutes each category can be found by clicking on the links below.
---
• Racial/Ethnic/National
---
• Extreme Sexuality/Violence
---
• Sexual Orientation
---
• Obscene/Vulgar
---
Though we have varying tolerance for repeated abuse of each category, any name that violates one of these categories will most likely:
---
Be forced to choose a new name next time the character is logged in
---
Be temporarily suspended from the game
---
Moderately Inappropriate
---
Names which fall under the following categories are deemed to be mildly inappropriate. Clarification on what constitutes each category can be found by clicking on the links below.
---
• Harassing or Defamatory
---
• Blizzard Employees
---
• Inappropriate
---
• Advertising
---
Be given a warning
---
Restricted
---
Names which fall under the following categories are restricted and will most likely not receive an account penalty on the first instance. Clarification on what constitutes each category can be found by clicking on the links below.
---
• Trademarks
---
• Pure Gibberish
---
• Contain "Leet" or "Dudespeak"
---
• Titles (Does not apply to Guild or Pet Names)
---
• Real World References
---
• Partial or Complete Sentences (Does not apply to Guild Names)
---
IMPORTANT
---
Repeatedly violating any area of the Terms of Use (ToU), including the areas detailed above, will often result in temporary suspension from the game.
---
This policy is not language-restrictive. Names that fall under this policy will always be subject to the repercussions listed, whether they are inappropriate in English or any other language.
---
Questionable names may not be changed immediately, but at a later date, pending further review. Blizzard reserves the right to change any names we deem inappropriate or that violate policy.
---
Players found to be in violation of the above policies may be assigned a randomly generated temporary name for their character, guild, or pet. An E-mail will be sent to the account's registered E-mail address with instructions on how to change his/her temporary name to one of their choice.
---
The bottom line is that we want World of Warcraft to be a fun and safe environment for all players. World of Warcraft is an MMORPG, and the key words are "Massively Multiplayer." In playing this game, you will encounter thousands of other players who share different experiences and come from vastly different backgrounds. While a certain name may not be offensive to you, consider the fact that that same name may have a completely different effect on someone else. We've done everything we can to make this a great game but now it's up to you, the players, to breathe life into the world. Choose wisely my friends.
---
Just for the fact that every single class feels unique and brings something unique
---
AV honestly gets worse with time. People just give up in it now
---
no. only one sting can be on a target at one time. very different.
---
my favorite is when they parry backstab
---
....
---
&gt; but now you can remove an item from AH even if it has a bid on. I freaking dispise this change.
---
But at least it costs some form of money. Tried to take an Arcane Crystal off the AH the other day, which already had a bid of around 33g. Would've cost me something around 1,67g (+ the deposit!) to cancel the auction. Didn't bother trying to test whether the cost of cancelling the auction was tied to the bid amount though
---
Since dps don't want to manage their threat, a lot of agi/crit dps gear goes to tanks. Cloaks, jewelry, trinkets, weapons, some mail items.
---
Since no dps wants to wait a little with their damage, tanks are forced to gear and spec offense to keep threat.
---
It's just the state of the game now (unfortunately).
---
Found the twink
---
You can't have multiple stings on 1 target but you can sting multiple targets
---
i have a cat and i just fish when im low on food for him. If im going thru a capital city ill just buy a stack of raw fish off AH for 20s and cook it. Have a bank alt mail some food so as you need it you just pull it out the mail
---
Retail has personal loot
---
This, but unironically.
---
Thats WC3
---
There's one in SW at the park.
---
I personally find it takes some of the enjoyment from using the AH from me. But then again, so does leafing through several pages of single-stacked items. Choices, choices.
---
What a bunch of phony lines of thought just to rationalize being greedy lol.
---
Im just gonna say it.
---
I like the model updates retail has made, to both mobs and player characters.
---
There’s no back and forth in AV any more though. People just spam to the end.
---
Or any job?
---
I praise Blizzard for their diverse approach for PVE content: LFR for casual players who aren't ready for farm raids and 7/7 schedule but still want to feel the epicness, extra mythic phase at last boss for hardcore raiders.
---
This actually happens.
---
&gt; People already charge enough for simple stuff, this stuff would be insanely expensive. Most players are poor as shit even after 2 expansions of them throwing gold at your face, they could never afford that stuff.
---
and that's a good thing! Not every player is meant to have anything. If they want anything they should put in the effort. Period. Noone needs to buy it from the AH - simply have a toon with said profession and enjoy.
---
Interacting in Feral forms! 
---
Click this quest item, back to humanoid form, bad guy spawns, into cat 0 energy (until furor). Large amount of mana used for nothing. . .
---
I would recommend you give both versions a try, starting with classic. 
---
A word of caution: classic does not pander to the player - you want something, be prepared to go much further than you might be accustomed to in order to succeed. Out of game resources, especially for a new player, become a mandatory read as the game does not hold your hand and relies on your initiative to figure it out. 
---
To give an example: in retail you can press 'M' and see at a glance where you can go to pick up quests, as well as where to solve them, towns are questing hubs, so full of quest givers and npcs which are useful for that area.
---
In classic you are told to "look for &lt;npc name&gt; in &lt;zone name&gt;. Sometimes there are additional instructions, sometimes you need to read what the quest giver actually says. Sometimes it takes a bit of independent thinking to figure out. You can always rely on wowhead.com as a database as well as guide repository if you get stuck. However I would encourage you to not be afraid to ask for help, you'd be surprised how many nerds are just dying to show off their knowledge of various wow facts and trivia.
---
Joining a guild is another almost mandatory task for classic, unless you build an extensive friend list.
---
But it doesnt cost anything on enchanting mats and other garbage, so ah is spammed with 1 copper dreamdust, to trick people without auctioneer or something similar to buy their higher priced stuff.
---
scumbag move and should be countered by old school vanilla style once bid can't remove your auction.
---
When i saw the ah prices for fadeleaf (early launch) i almost started to cry, but once i started pickpocketing i havent had the need for a single fadeleaf, even half my bank is filled with blinding powder now lol
---
You’re literally turning it into more of a grind with the occasional surprise of a ding...  at least with the xp bar you have a goal and know whether you can do a few quests or have to go grind mobs to finish out a level
---
Agree. I actually think I Will abandon the horse plan. My bf has horse mount, and it drives me nuts, so now Im kinda happy about My cat. 😊
---
ClassicThreatMeter is a good one.  If other people in your group have it, it shows you their threat level as well.
---
Rolling Alliance today, Anyone know how the populations are on Azuresong or Westfall?
---
Way back when, I had a Tauren Hunter who I have Echeyakee to as a pet. I renamed him Clyde. I may have to get Classic and relive that.
---
I've given up on it and have just gotten the Paladin Trinket from Dire Maul. Only 7 less spellpower but with added armor and fire res.
---
Depends on your play style. I like the soul bag and keep it full. That way I can use my moves without thinking i have to manage shards. Late game you will be giving out health stones to raids, porting people in and even before the fighting starts will burn through a lot of your shards. Overall the bag will give you more storage just for shards but if you have smaller bags can be a pain. Overall it depends on how you like to manage the shards themselves
---
Well in that case it’s really unlucky. According to wowhead it has a 44% chance of dropping therefore 56% chance of not dropping.    
---
0,44^0*0,56^10*(10C10) is around 0,3% of not dropping. That’s just so highly unlikely it’s crazy...
---
Makes even less sense.
---
A toxic comment from someone with the username, "fuckherthroat"
---
I am astounded.
---
I was was typing a reply to explain why you living on a cloud then I decided to not bother.
---
This is very surface level understanding of the game. Today's warriors tanking raid bosses while wearing Mail gear pieces. And wearing Crit and Hit gear. And you're saying 150 armor is massive increase.
---
I'll also add that some advanced warrior build don't even use a shield. Sacrificing +2500 armor for threat. And you saying 150 armor is BiS trinket.
---
I'll also point out that a dodge means you take ZERO damage from an attack. Staking Dodge items and reaching a 15% chance to dodge means you take ZERO damage from 15% of the bosses attacks. And you think a 150 armor is better (even with the bear form) a 0.01% physical damage reduction. From taking 7000 damage per auto to taking 6990 damage.
---
I'll also let you know that the more armor you have, the less benefit you get from it.
---
Maybe you're following 2006's guides. It's okey to not know how the game works, but don't spread wrong info.
---
I don't think that's the case. I have 4 pieces of T1 and 2 of T2 and I wouldn't pay anywhere close to that amount for a piece.
---
You mean phase 3? No battlegrounds until phase 3
---
Perfected? Boar lvl 5 loyalty instead of 6. Literally unplayable
---
Well, as you can tank everything in arm spec I would say no. But as warrior that want to tank are fairly rare I would agree that reserving first orb would be fair.
---
But as you can see reservation escalated quickly...
---
You can get gear within 5% of someone who plays the game 16 hours a day when playing less than 5 hours a week. It's fucking stupid.
---
I've seen alot of bracers drop, very few belts. From my experience the belt droprates are way lower and I have only seen them drop far into malten core
---
I was getting them constantly yesterday. I report them for spamming and move on.
---
Booo you! I'm not a caster, don't wanna sit around sipping on some damn water, wanna keep hunting!
---
In the beta when the streamers done tournaments it was for both sides. And back then there were a lot of griefings. Mostly from the alliance side, ruining matchups and causing a lot of time waste. I believe that this time they just chose the tournament to be one side only so no interruptions could happen.
---
I remember trying to do something like this with the WC3 art bar a couple of years ago. Was hard as shit, this looks great!
---
I had an issue figuring out what to do with the three small vertical boxes and the circle on the left side of the art bar, do you have a plan for them or just gonna leave it empty?
---
You can serpent sting every single target in a pull and pretend you are doing aoe damage. Except the damage sucks and it does not scale and it costs a shit ton of mana and every single elemental is immune to serpent sting so it does not work in Molten Core.
---
Was my sarcasm too subtle?
---
Probably only useful while levelling but I use the following:
---
    /cast [@targettarget,harm]Shoot;Shoot
---
If I have an enemy selected, it wands them. If I have my tank selected, it just wands whatever he has targeted. If you set the same up for Shadow Word: Pain it doesn't even change your target so you can stay locked on the tank's HP and still toss dots on whatever he's looking at.
---
It's not a perfect system of course - if you're not careful you'll wand the mob that the tank just taunted off you ~~and if you're trying to help out an opposite faction player who is struggling with a mob the macro will make you shoot the player that the mob is targeting. That misunderstanding got me killed~~
---
Played a pacifist druid for a while, only got to around level 20 but was good to make sure I had zero damage done by checking in the stats.
---
Anybody else's camera bug the fuck out if you run your character through that town? Mine like zooms inside each building as I pass over it.
---
I quit a PvP server due to ganking and gave my friend all my stuff. Hope he doesn't get banned lol... He's lvl 38 with 100g extra and tonnnnssss of materials. (I'm alt-o-holic) 
---
Just restarted on a PvE server. Waiting to go home today and see my accoutn banned lol...
---
Fight arenas too!!
---
LFG addon isn't a thing in classic WoW. Use /5 for groups.
---
I wish we had a rp server in germany, if i gonna do something like this i get called a scammer and get ignored
---
Census data is your best bet. It's outdated by about a month since Blizzard no longer allows addons to collect this data, but should still be somewhat relevant:
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
Where should I be questing? Level 31 horde hunter. Ive wrapped up everything I can in 1k needles and the shimmering flats. Everywhere that is 30-40 seems like most quests would be in the 33+ range. Any advice or should I just grind mobs for xp and gold for my mount?
---
multishot is like 25% of your dmg and volley is irrelevant. So thats at tops a 4% dmg increase in a run where more than 50% of your time is running. So he spent 10 hours farming just to make his run 2% faster? Regardless, it's hard for me to believe that there arent or werent any cheaper ones in the ah. SO it smells fishy, but then again why would a RMTer post shit like this.
---
Dude that's amazing. Every second was worth it, I'm so jealous. I'm afraid of giving you ideas and encouraging your madness, but you can get that RP immersion addon where conversations with NPCs are in the center of the screen with an animated portrait like in retail and the campaigns.
---
Are you telling me there are people out there seeing the content as something you have to be geared up for? Do you tell me you want to "minmax" something in that ancient game?
---
This game is over a decade old. Get some fresh air :)
---
Westfall Alliance is quite active with lots of dungeons of all levels in lfg.
---
On my original server we called that 3 dps lfg
---
Your thesis fails unless there is not a single one of said BoE up at the AH
---
90g now is worth more than 500g in a year.
---
That doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't you tell people how you did it? Are you afraid somebody will steal it? You should share your creations not hoard them. Also 20+ hours for creating something is like nothing. Add two zeros, then we talk again.
---
Also if you feed your pet, don't go into combat immediately after - it will stop the feeding process! 
---
You can see the amount of happiness it gets in the combat log - when the ticking stops, your pet isn't eating anymore!.
---
Hope this helps.
---
No thats stupid. The only difference between everyone pressing greed and everyone pressing need is that if you all press greed, the last person can press need and automatically wins.
---
Imagine dealing with him when he doesn’t get a raid drop
---
Yes come to mograin
---
perfect balance and great ppl everywhere
---
Yes you can. The top guilds cleared naxx nowhere near as fast. Even after the strategies were out, people still didn't clear it as fast back in 2006.
---
And world buffs? Were these world buffs somehow unavailable to those back in 2006? No, they were. Guilds in 2006 were nowhere near as competent are they are now. Naxx isn't hard. It was the hardest vanilla raid, but it was nothing compared to how tightly tuned encounters became in subsequent expansions.
---
Dramatic. Keep the circlejerking to a minimum please, I also want some uparrows.
---
Yeah screw that. This was like entry jobs that requires experience in real life.
---
 1/ Guys pls help i killed 57 raptors and Stolen Silver still won't drop.
---
You sound like an insufferable wanker
---
wait a second.... "WTS Blackstonering 30g or    
---
**Inventor's Focal Sword"**
---
Westfall it is, thank you!
---
No, Paladins are not the best tank healer.  
---
Check Blessing of Light - paladins will spam Flash of Light on tank, so they are good for quick topping up, but also need help from another healer.
---
Plus who else is going to really understand their joy.
---
Hey! that's not true!
---
Sometimes we need to use a mana gem, or potion, in order to cast more frostbolts!
---
that would be healbot  - sometimes buggs out for me but it is very useful once you fiddle around with it a bit.  
---
you can bind different ranks of different healspells on different mousebuttons and even more ranks and spells with shift/strg/alt modifiers. basically I can heal now with only one hand... if you know what I mean **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**
---
in Olympus but made no friends got to 60 as well but a big gratz dude. and ill probably quit  in a few days as i'll never find a group for dungeons but hey at least people say im the nicest guy in Olympus lol.
---
BFA has made it worse.
---
Incorrect
---
Source: I was a greasy teenager
---
Blacklist and move on. Vanilla servers used to care about reputation and ninjas would essentially be unable to find a group. This is how you weed out the shit people.
---
Half the time I do this as a rogue because I'm mitigating the damage that could have happened had I not got on the mob. Ubrs is a great example. If the tank doesn't mark the summoners I'm getting on them regardless of what his skull mark is. I can solo the mobs with zero help anyways and I prevent them from casting any spells or summoning another mob.
---
My life is great, I just like fucking with losers that deserve to be put in their place. You prob make ur girl pay for everything too? Prob bust in 30 sec, cause ur a greedy bitch.
---
That’s part of being in a guild.  You get happy and excited to see your guildies gearing up just as you are, it’ll also just help make clear times faster and smoother when more people are geared out lol
---
If you're solo farming Lashers, are you just jumping down into the courtyard and killing as many packs (whilst collecting herbs) as possible? 
---
Do you head towards the other bosses at all?
---
The drop rate is like 0.2%.
---
Start complaining once you hit the 500 kills mark.
---
Did you finish Hillsbrad? Starting with Desolace or Arathi sounds like a good idea. Or STV if you're feeling brave.
---
If a person says he needs the item and is BoE, just tell the person to equip/learn it on the spot. If he doesnt answer just all need.
---
Yes, I meant phase 3

---
Those 4 items will hit cap you no matter what race you are or weapon you use. They are all also drops, so no BS with Devilsaur mafias. 
---
Trueaim Gauntlets puts you on the 305+ weapon skill table and give 1% hit, so you only need 5%.
---
Truestrike Shoulders and Mask of the Unforgiven are both 2%.
---
Blackstone Ring is gained from solo farming Princess Theradras.
---
I literally never ask. I understand why some people do it because they're literally not sure if its an upgrade or not and are scared to roll need on an item better suited to someone else, but people who are sure about the upgrade should need it 100%.
---
Just got my Warlock to 31 and thinking about rerolling Rogue
---
I have a soul bag on myself and in my bank. I try to keep both full at all times.
---
When I head into a dungeon, I try to siphon soul the first few mobs so I have \~5 excess shards. That will get me through the dungeon usually.
---
Almost every high level quest mob is continuously camped by 5-20 60's because they drop something worth farming. It's fucking maddening trying to go from 55-60 on quests.
---
I want this.
---
PLS OP
---
Happened once to me at the end of BC a week or two before Wrath. Took 24 hours and I had my matts back.
---
Right? Some weapons vendor for 7-8 g, that’s worth more than a lot of boe greens.
---
I'm not sure if you realize this, but druids are not warriors. So what's important for the different classes will be different.
---
I'll gladly sell you your 1% dodge trinket so you can feel superior.
---
This behavior existed in vanilla, too.
---
hah you wish
---
Roll greed and eventually you get burned. BoE drops, tell everyone to roll need. Money saved by someone equipping it is equal to the money earned by someone selling it. There are exceptions but generally this is the best way to avoid sticky situations.
---
Hey, osrs player
---
Pretty close to finishing hillsbrad, probaly next time I have an hour or so. I checked in there and everything was orange or higher for me.
---
Pre 60 it's worth it whenever mana isn't a concern, but most of the time it will be.
---
I saw it drop twice in a row on arena runs
---
Then it would not be classic.
---
I’m pretty sure you can only have one sting active on one target at a time.
---
Very much this
---
Depends on materials for your server.
---
Just be aware you can only have 1 enchant on an item at a time.
---
WeakAura only helps you with seeing things better on your screen. Learning your "rotation" (like there is one in classic) is a different thing.
---
Just personal unluck I'm afraid. Considering the loot table and some stochastic rule of thumb, 10 runs and seeing it drop every time isn't impactful and doesn't have a high confidence of saying that something is off :/
---
Zugzugerberg is by far one of the best names I have seen in classic so far. Great job!
---
🦀🦀Jagex are powerless to stop me stealing their content 🦀🦀
---
Tbh it is lol...  not having any dungeon quests or travel to the next zone quests is purely him deleting or not picking up for this post.
---
Ungoro sends you to winterspring for 2 if not 3 chains so he clearly chose not to pick those up
---
Or he could be planning a 39 too.  I’m gonna be playing in 19s through 49s myself and my main at 60.  Each bracket has its own charm.
---
Nah, balance druids take spell crit.
---
Would you also be ok with a Mage rolling need on a ring with Str/Agi/Stam or Stam/AP just because it had more Stam than his previous ring at that level?
---
Oh right thanks, I didnt realise human racial was as strong as the gloves. Makes sense but still, surely there are a lot of non human warriors out there.. maybe? Lol I agree though, the sweatiness is real ay.
---
Heroic Leap, plz it's one of the only things I want added back in.
---
Why do people keep wanting to make Classic WoW  not Classic WoW?
---
Hey Gamers!
---
Want to pay $15 a month to play video gaem?
---
Want to pay $1 for top video gaem information?
---
You also said that I (or in retrospect you might have been using "you" in plural, but unclear from context) wouldn't understand what to buy or suck at cheap item (in this thread regarding twink items) AHing fired me up, followed by the retail comment. I'm not sure now whether that was specifically aimed at me or not, but the fact that it was in reply to my comment certainly points towards it, at least that's how it came across. 
---
Hence the "sideways attacks".
---
From what I've seen, they do two to three times more damage. It definitely counts.
---
Huh, I don't see that in my guilds MT. Kool dude. He dumped 300 runecloth on me last night so I could get tailoring 300 and my robe of the void crafted.
---
55 priest. 
---
My plan was to go holy and start grinding dungeons at 55 to gather preraid gear BUT there are way too many healers. I feel like I would have an easier time finding a group as DPS and I sincerely wish I rolled another class because there are way too many priests.
---
Anyone else have this issue on their server?
---
I guess I’m in the boat if ‘Classic +’ 
---
Appreciate not everyone does though
---
Alterac Mountains on Eastern Kingdoms. Potentially parts of Desolace?
---
Couldnt help but to picture you as the guy from 40 Year old virgin. Never take any chances in life bucko, looking back at your days you should be able to smell unseasoned boiled chicken.
---
Leatrix Plus
---
I was wondering myself how to get in the pit of refuse for the longest time in ST then i realized that one set of spiral stair went up and on the other end one went down.
---
Your math is flawed. The chances are not connected. Each run has its own individual same chance.
---
What makes you say that it's better than when on pservers? Just curious.
---
And warforged, dont forget about that shitshow of a reward system
---
I thought it was Stratholm, whatever
---
Atm I don't see a single soul lf low lvl dungeons
---
Was it?  I don't remember it being enforced in MoP or Cata because in LFR people were still rolling Need on items to trade later or give to who they felt deserved it more. Maybe it was still an option then and only made the only later.
---
Lol no its not go on any warrior discord get the math before talking on reddit.
---
I love this!
---
I didn't create much of this, I mostly customized other peoples' creations. Building something like this from the ground up would have easily taken 2000 hours, but I'm grateful that people smarter than I have laid the groundwork.   
---
That being said, I did detail the addons I used to create this interface in another comment in this thread, and anybody can feel free to ask me questions either on this post or in the DMs if they would like, but creating a guide would easily take another 20+ hours of mine that I didn't necessarily sign up for, if you catch my drift. I'm not trying to hide anything, though.
---
The joke is on you scammer I don't know how to click links in chat, they do not have a hyperlink.
---
Good. Fuck your faction :d
---
Mages can handle aggro just fine with their slows and roots. Seducing over Imp makes your group lose a big chunk of their health and less threat generation for your tank. Catering to the carebear tank who is okay to spend 2h in every piss easy dungeon is not beneficial.
---
Yeah, fuck me for being surprised as I haven't seen any pay to use game sites before.
---
&gt; But we literally turned in the SAME quest in the group and we got different xp
---
You didn't because this isn't how it works.  I wasn't aware of the 6 level thing but 6 levels below is usually grey so I guess that's why.  But 100% you get the same xp for anything red-&gt;yellow and I guess SOME greens may give you nerfed xp before it goes grey in some rare circumstances where 6 levels below you is not grey.
---
one question tho, I can't seem to find where warlock is...help?
---
"Change to group loot or I don't pull."
---
Showing guild name in the floating box that appears when you mouseover someone.  
---
In game calendar with dates of events (and being able to schedule stuff).  
---
See mob HP and item vendor price.  
---
Auto-dismount/stand.  
---
Hairdressers.  
---
Visual indicators on dots duration.  
---
Extra inventory (reagants tab, guild bank, keyring, mounts etc tabs)  
---
More graveyards. Walking across the map to rez takes ages, if you died inside a camp you're good for an hour of corpse running.  
---
Link quests in chat.  
---
Sound effects when you press space while mounted, instead of a silent animation.
---
Please tell me you’re using click to move too lol
---
I guess I’m in the boat of Classic+ rather than it eventually turning into retail. 
---
The trouble is, a game dies without updates. It’s just a fact, very very unfortunately.
---
so stupid, this is a certain ban.
---
Only Onyxia is immune to taunt
---
Just jump in a LBRS Group or kill some bat's in EPL
---
Dude, that's very neat ;) congrats and thanks for sharing your addons
---
There are addons for ingame notes, but non of them have location events afaik. If all else fails, use paper and put it on your desk.
---
Asmons dule tourney will have Rets
---
Aha thanks
---
What class ? A lot of classes benefit from grinding winter spring furlbogs.
---
You gotta just grind mobs in high level areas.
---
What does gear up mean? When does warrior become a monster? 2nd tier pre bis? Pre bis? Raid bis? Mix?
---
I bought like 3 fadeleaf at the time for the extra skill points. But it was only 50s for 3 or so.
---
I used one of booster copypastas that boosting sites use in retail with +15s and all that, never seen so many insults in a short period of time   
---
Best time of my life
---
Two of the greatest wow minds meet
---
Real ninja is like master looting stuff to yourself that costs hundreds of gold.  
---
If you need roll and equip it you are good.  
---
But just for PSA sake.  If this rolling on patterns and BOE's  important to you and you are going to call other people ninjas for rolling need (you know who you are) then set up clear rules at the beginning of the run that everyone will be rolling NEED on all BOE's and Patterns so everyone has RNG chance to win.
---
While you're there make sure to collect the blue pearls from the shells. They are for a quest but also go really well on the auction house.
---
Does my Troll hunter Bowmore count?
---
You don't say? Wow, if only there was a place I could have found that out before you insightful comment. 
---
And I've killed around 3k. So get the fuck outta here with that dumb shit.
---
The armor absolutely is better. In bear form it's \~900 or so armor.
---
u/MakeACube is talking down to everyone to try to fool you into believing he knows what he's talking about.
---
I quit before that came out.
---
This is such a surface level comment. Yes in terms of pure mitigation those are bis. You should absolutely have them for tanking and if you just want more mitigation those are go to.
---
Threat and utility are other issues entirely. For example DFT is an absolutely amazing trinket for bears. The hit/crit on top of a little dodge makes it a great option for threat. Bears struggle with +hit, something most bis lists concerned exclusively with mitigation fail to account for. You want +5-7% hit after MC.
---
Mark of the Chosen is a solid threat choice. If you move quickly it will almost always be up and is 50 ap, 1.25% crit/dodge, and 300ish hp
---
Items like Scale of the Mountain (and rag trink) can provide extra thorns effects for aoe pulls. Additionally the tobacco trinket, essence of erranikus  and others can also serve this purpose
---
Pvp trinket breaks fear
---
You can go on and on. Trinkets are a great way for druid to customize for specific situations, especially if focusing on max mitigation in other slots (Same reason you want a Devilsaur set for threat fights)
---
I do on reddit and pretty much nowhere else.
---
Since people have been listing Bear trinkets thought I should point out [Mark of the Chosen](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17774/mark-of-the-chosen) which is a decent item obtained from a quest in the lvl 40 range.
---
Are u shitting me? I have been going to Ashenvale all the time!? Where can I find this dann moonwell in Darnassus?
---
sometimes I wish I rolled a hunter because I love my voidie and I feel bad when he has to help me but doesn't want to
---
Defense is largely a bonus on solid pieces of gear, its not the alpha and omega of what makes a good tanking item.
---
Having a solid health pool and decent threat production is a good start i found - also, you can always supplement your health with consumables and a few enchants that are cheap and efficient at boosting your health.
---
Either way, early on in MC, if you are going with a new pack of raiders, healers may not react fast enough and cause you to die, that is just how it is sadly.
---
Oh I definitely agree, but it's one of those things your healer needs to be ready for and just pulling it out with no warning is dumb, especially if the tank is below 50% life.
---
If you have a healer in your neck that knows what to do you will be the unstoppable force of PvP!
---
I really don't know what the problem is as a warrior. You don't quest until you are lvl 60. You just say "Prot warrior looking for group". You will get invited ASAP and you do group content after group content and in NO TIME you will be lvl 60.
---
Then start questing, enjoy the money that comes from that source.
---
I had no idea the [Tauren stereotype](https://i.imgur.com/5i2bHcs.png) was a thing before I had this interaction.
---
Maybe it just identifies as an undead female but is genetically a pop tart
---
Same for me. Didn't get all my mount money but got 60g which is good enough. Was quite satisfied
---
The only reason I managed to get the Incendrites from the bloody fire elementals in Stonetalon Mountains is when some level ?? Ally would roam through the zone and kill all the horde players camping the spawns for Elemental Fire.
---
Here are some things for you to consider.
---
1)  Warlock is one of the classes it is more useful for since it gives you an extra "out" in addition to deathcoil.  With how powerful warlocks are already, it helps with one of their few weaknesses.
---
2)  Tidal charm carries in 1vs1 and is less useful in group vs group situations.  
---
Zerg vs Zerg stuff out in the world, not useful.
---
Groups fights at flags in AB, not as useful.
---
Solo defending flags in AB, useful.
---
Stunning flag carriers in WSG to setup a kill, useful.
---
3)  It is just overall less useful if you're alliance because....orcs.
---
------------
---
So is it worth it?  Yeah I think so.
---
I'm an alliance mage and I farmed it.  It wouldn't feel right playing classic for the next ~2 years without it.
---
We’re in phase 1. Relax.
---
I was counting a possibility of it not dropping in so many runs, which is mathematically correct. It’s the chance of the drop’s expected value function to be 10.
---
Yep, tank burnout is real. It is a thankless role that is often unfun, and players with a bad attitude only make it worse. 
---
At this point, I'd sooner take a bunch of friends and do leveling instances without a tank than keep leveling any of my tanks - that's how bad it is.
---
If you know fishin as well, I highly recommend Azshara. You can fish for Essences and pluck a lot of Dreamfoil. If you do this for a whole day, you end up with mats worth roughly 200g.
---
I don't know, I didn't do the math
---
I just look to guides ([[1]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?sle=true#) [[2]](http://wowclassicbis.com) [[3]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/edit#gid=2006067062)) and it's always these 2 trinkets
---
you’re on to something here..
---
nothing wrong with standing straight up
---
Uhm no? You get your deposit back if the items sells. Otherwise it goes to the auction. 
---
The cut always goes to the auction. 
---
If deposit is higher then the AH cut it is better to have a friend buy it out.
---
If you don't have time for dungeons, what are your plans for 60 anyway?
---
Anyway I recommend the yetis or the dudes north of them in Winterspring that award rep
---
Just need an undead called Brillgates.
---
Attention all druids:
---
Go with Mark of Tyranny.
---
That is all.
---
On my lock: A simple curse tracker that show who used what curse on the current target.
---
On my rogue: A combo point thingie that changes color and alpha depending on how many combo point you've got.
---
Also a swingtimer that changes color as it counts down to 0.
---
I think they have this feature in retail BFA
---
Most players on reddit* never see this mentality on my server.
---
Looks like you’re trying to setup the first level of WC3 human campaign in WoW.
---
MC drops leather pants and mail hands (?) with healing that shamans like (and compete on pants with druids) plus the mp5 healing 1h hammer. Domo ring is rather all healers. As there is relatively little shamans and shaman/healing offtier drops can be common you will have more shamans with offtier than with full tier actively used. If you have a shaman with tank healing assignment on Rag (and alike) then he/she could be funneled T1 ASAP but that still depends on raid performance (if you don't get submerge then it's ez).
---
First hard loot effect I saw was end of BWL/start of AQ40 where I got offtier hands from AQ and could not roll for some items in BWL as I could not use them without loosing 3T2 (so I just wasn't rolling and shaman officer know why perticullary I can't use those items). Prior to that it was usual loot council with some planning who gets which 3T2 pieces priority.
---
In AQ40 only 2 shamans were allowed to get T2.5 (all other tokens for DPS). I wasn't but instead I got prio on T3 under the condition I'll have all the turn-in mats ready before tier starts :)
---
Oh, and you can do a trash raid and farm trash hard so that everyone interested has wrist/belt.
---
Used to have a Shaman on retail called OprahWinfury 
---
Glad to see the trend is continuing.
---
The den at stonetalon peak will have plenty of elites around level ¿30? for you to grind.
---
Both the counterweight and sharpening stone buffs apply to shifted forms, or at least they did, it's been a while.
---
This is on purpose to weed out people who aint gonna fall for it.
---
At least this is the case with a lot of those nigerian scam email things.  They want to find people who don't notice the spelling mistakes and/or don't find it weird that the email from a government department or whatever is littered with bad grammar and bad spelling.
---
These people are far more likely to fall for the rest of the scam.
---
7th level!
---
Heroic level 60 Deadmines isn't going to make that dungeon any more fun than it was at 20, even if I get Cookie as a pet.
---
If there's going to be a classic+, the content needs to incorporate a lot of the changes made to the engine over 15 years. Most Classic dungeons...hell, almost all of them are tank-and-spank. That's not interesting at lvl and it won't be interesting as a heroic version either.
---
This guy macros.
---
You can tank in arms spec, but many warriors at 60 respec to prot for better tanking and especially if they are doing any raid tanking.
---
I've seen pretty reasonable reservation etiquette, Tanks usually get an orb reserved, and that's just supply and demand in action really.
---
Retail is shit for many many reasons.  Your missing my point but I respect your opinion
---
&gt; Just let the dps who pull threat constantly die.
---
That requires cooperation from the healer. If they take heroic measures to keep the dps alive, the tank has to take heroic measures to keep the healer alive.
---
Yep, I have a two part(soon to be 3 part) tanking macro that sets out all the rules before hand.
---
3 weeks here. 0 perditions, 1 brutality blade.
---
1k armor and 1% dodge is miles better than 2% dodge. MoT is bis mitigation for the entire game on druids
---
If youre alliance, that is
---
Maybe I'm wrong about Dragon Soul, but in MoP LFR or if you did a dungeon through the LFG tool you definitely had to deal with personal loot.
---
That's fair enough. 
---
When you're questing in a group or dungeoning you don't talk about anything fun? laugh about wiping, no discord?
---
It's a MMO, and you're not even trying to connect
---
Shadowfang from SFK is currently going for around 180-210g in AH. How high do you estimate it could go once phase 2/3 arrives and twink season begins?
---
The “everyone need” on BoEs is a stupid policy. I understand it’s protecting everyone but the whole point of greeding on it for gold is because there’s an inherit level of trust that needs to be there for a server community to thrive.  Ninjas get blacklisted and essentially are banned from a server. Not being able to find groups because they stole an item. It’s the one way a server community can police itself. Removing that simple trust test allows these shit players to continue on with no repercussions.
---
Wooooosh!
---
That’s an excellent point to be fair
---
Damn this is awsome
---
If you feed your pet, it gets a buff. Do NOT feed your pet again or enter combat until that buff wears off. Only then will you have successfully fed your pet.
---
Ah ok, for some reason I thought there were more. Thanks for clarifying!
---
Go back to Retail.
---
Not so fast.  My server is packed full.  I found a dark whelpling and thought the same.  Vanity pets aren't selling right now.  At least on my server.
---
Except if you're a mage and can grab 4-5 mobs at the same time. In a group you'd get 1 or 2 drops for that. Solo you'd get 5. Ya feel me?
---
It's not supposed to make sense, they're trying to get a specific type of very naive / gullible target.
---
There is literally a loot council addon for classic. It keeps a complete record of loot. The fuck you on about?
---
This guy solitary confinements
---
First time I went to do it there were like 5 people just standing around. I thought hu that’s weird but went ahead and summoned him anyways. As soon as he spawned someone tagged him and I didn’t get the kill. Had to run all the way back to crossroads to reaccept the quest.
---
It's pretty good for my dwarf.
---
I see some boe prices going up when people spend less time out in the world leveling and the 60s have their epic mounts out of the way. The herd is still largely 40-60.
---
Vs private server, maybe just more casuals?
---
Why do you want 7-8% hit when the cap is 5% and only defense rating on the enemy is a factor from that point on?
---
Spirit is only really worth it before lvl 30.
---
You're probably right about MOP, it's just been so long I don't remember lol. Dragon Soul definitely didn't have it though.
---
With friends, yes. With randoms that don't hold up their end? No.
---
Wouldn't that mean you could just buy gold for someone else and get them banned?
---
Feral does more or less exclusively yellow damage due to maul. Warriors want to get white hits as well.
---
And as you say, you shouldn't neglect all your other stats to reaching the desired hit rating. :)
---
I enjoy when people yell DING (level up) on gChat. It feels like a buddy accomplished something and that's always something to feel good about.
---
Ah okay I’ve never played retail
---
Active trinkets with long CDs are fine if you equip appropriately. Use them, then switch out next pull to a different one.
---
Scale of the Mountain has a 30 min CD, it's still super useful
---
i mean, most people do.
---
i sold 3 BL for 80g each 5 days ago, to highest bidder. Buy em
---
Thanks for being a douchebag.
---
I’ve never ever played retail. Thanks for the feedback
---
DONT BELIEVE HIM, HES TRYING TO FLUSH OUT THE MARKET 0\_\_\_0
---
Yeah sometimes its competitive but not always. Take the time to do the quests that give you bis items like the ring, off-hand, or mats for trufaith vestments. Meanwhile, scan for Lf1M healer. That way you’re not wasting time trying to find a group.
---
Exactly this. A purple boe should be seen as "whoever wins the roll will get 100g-200g on the AH". Whether or not you can use it or not is irrelevant, because someone could use that money to buy one of their own boes...and they deserve that because they were luckiest on the roll. Everyone in the dungeon should always agree to need on really high value items imo or someone will ninja, that's just the way it is (unless you know your group, or have things pre-arranged)
---
They dont need to be intuitive because groupleader or raid leader will say the kill order on marks beforehand
---
Definitely stay Shadow until the day you step foot into MC or ONY.  And to be totally honest I have healed MC and ONY as Shadow just because it was a last minute thing.  You can heal everything in the game right now as shadow because you are a pure healing class that happens to have damage talents not the other way around.  
---
I switch back to shadow after Thursday raid so I can solo farm and fill 2 roles in dungeons.
---
This but ankhs
---
saw him 8 times before he decided to drop the sash, or the ring at all.
---
Tanks certainly hold a lot of authority in this game.
---
I was tanking an instance one day and a hunter in my group insisted on DPSing mobs in whichever order he wanted. I asked him to please stick to our kill order. He was not happy that I was asking for his cooperation. After this, the hunter would then multi shot at the start of every pull causing me to have to scramble to pick up threat. A simple annoyance that, whatever, guy wants to be a jerk... however, right before the last boss he wants to insult me for being a bad tank. Not only did I get him kicked from the group but I have subsequently got him booted from 2 other groups since. 
---
TLDR: don’t be a jerk to your tank. They will hold a grudge and make you a sad panda.
---
This one is especially bad because the guy goes out of his way to attack camps of mobs. They don't aggro to him he literally runs up and attacks people who are super far away.
---
WHAT THE HECK I LOVE IT
---
Very much nonsense?
---
I clearly must spend some more time with this addon....   Some of the things mentioned here seem legit.
---
Seen one for sale for 5k on my server
---
Horde designated area is outside OG
---
What's the Alliance equivalent? Outside SW is dead, in IF I see nobosy dueling
---
I like to spend a good amount of my time at 60/70 just watching duels and dueling myself, but now playing Alliance after lifetime of Horde, I just don't see where thaf would be
---
I see no comments about healers... so your safe for now.
---
I'd say warriors, stance dancing and rage management make things more intensive
---
Was in there last night, looked into the hole, thought about jumping then said nah.
---
Depends on role as well, I did a full run of BRD as a 52 Holy Pally, and it went very smooth but we did have a 60 tank.
---
Not an issue at all.
---
It's not a bad set to have for PVP situations with a bit of mix and matching other pieces for hit/crit and such, beyond that for PVE welcome to being basically a full leather daddy.
---
So do BoPS if your logic only considering value in terms of gold.
---
bringing me back. would be fun for at least the first 25 levels to play like this.
---
Your top paragraph has nothing to do with this situation, though. This isn't about someone being willing to pay a ridiculous price, it's about someone not noticing the numbers are in the gold spot instead of the silver spot.
---
Hey, Psst... *Paladins get it free too.*
---
Very cool tradition.
---
Putting numbers on is so immersion breaking i'd think, to much rl and calling it intuitive, i dunno, but creative that is not.
---
The price is going down now that dire maul came out.  Warden staff is only good for feral tanks.  The Unyielding Maul in DM is nearly the same.
---
*mano de justicia reservada por cierto jajaja*
---
I seem to experience this thing where I can see the mobs back is facing me but it keeps telling me I must be behind the mob. Happens with CS mostly and KS occasionally, sometimes KS they just turnaround on the stun and face away from me for some reason.. So i have to do a little twirly dance around them to find where their back actually is. Super annoying, especially in tight spaces when I'm trying to clear towards something or there are a lot of patrols.
---
&gt;because you kill everyone without Twink Gear, without any effort
---
What a stupid f'n question. You can disagree with what others enjoy but you have to be trolling because it's not possible to be this dense.
---
Well, it happend to other people. You just didn't care much, now you understand.
---
Miss an ambush on a squirrel.... Once...
---
Everyone can use the gold. Buy it off the winner if you really want it.
---
Have you seen a single pregnant character ingame? I havn't.
---
Listed price or purchased price?
---
Let me move my Herod horde there please. I HATE being on the higher pop side -__-
---
I like that we need to use ingredients for some spells again but of course yesterday I ran out of it during questing and then spammed "vanish" only to read that fuckin text... Hi Bob.
---
ClassicThreatMeter for single target, but I prefer "Threat Plates (Classic)".  
---
It doesn't show deep values, just colors. But it's very good for AoE control. If mobs attack you - they are green, but as soon as they turn yellow, you need to act.
---
Also having numbers would also increase the amount of text displated and it might be confusing. When your raid leaders says pack on the thong, you know that you have to look for the bright green thong. How do you differenciate numbers from player, guild, pet, ennemies's name ?
---
There is no answer to your question.  It's worth whatever somebody will pay for it.  I'm not being flippant here, just post it on Ah for whatever you want for it and adjust the price as needed.
---
Similar but the ingame one just uses you hearthstone. This straight up always ports you to westfall.
---
I like to tank with a pocket healer because most of the time, I have found, a "bad" DPS is teachable &amp; doesn't slow me down. Groups form fast and things clear fast. I can set the pace and control the encounter.
---
As a DPS, it's a bit more being along for the ride &amp; luck of the draw pugging.
---
This is the most pathetic argument.
---
What exactly was freezing you in place supposed to do if he isn’t even going to break los or range you. He is literally just deciding not to damage you while he constantly repositions without hurting your damaged. God this mage is dumb
---
Hunters start off stronger than most classes at 60, then are nearing the bottom tier by nax.
---
Not a reference I expected to see here, but a welcome one.
---
When it comes to dungeons, I’m not waiting on threat. Worse case scenario, I pull threat, then I’ll tank it
---
Sounds like your specifically comparing an unorganized loot council to DKP.
---
Yeah that’s what I learnt unfortunately. Think anything less than 200 is not worth selling for?
---
Is there a trinket/item/spell that’s the equivalent of dwarf’s finding mineral/treasure racial?
---
Was watching a video of an undead rogue using it to find minerals.
---
Yes we did, retard.
---
Most DPS don't recognize that they are shit. That is part of the problem. If you are a tank or healer and don't have those DPS feel yourself blessed.
---
I am guessing it is because they were imagined for being used as more as just kill order.
---
Skull could be for dangerous mobs, X was for adds you can ignore, moon was for CC, and the other shapes could be given to you main Tank, melee DPS leader, and ranged leader, etc.
---
Also, back in the vanilla days, Blizzard wanted players to have agency and to discover things on their own.  Maybe the thought was 1-8 instead of our current target markers inhibit creativity?
---
Leatrix Plus has an "Enhance Quest Log" option under Interface as well that does the same.
---
When I began to play wow (as a child) I only killed mobs until lvl 55 due to I thought that it was faster than doing quests. The biggest grind that I've ever done 😂
---
So...did you manage to get more than 4g?
---
Miners get a spell to locate Ore Deposits nearby. Is that what you're talking about?
---
Is hit cap the same for PvP as it is in PvE? Having trouble finding clarification for this question.
---
Warrior for sure.
---
Back in the day, it was always right outside Ironforge in that snowy/gravel area.
---
Did not lookup the mats cause first looking to get the pattern first.
---
didnt know that
---
Green capes can also roll +21 shadow damage just like the archivist Cape. They just lack the mp5.
---
There are always some on the ah. Quite expensive, but you can also settle for +20 or +19.
---
We've vendored more then 8 sashes farming for savage glad chain.
---
You don't have to buy things to "win". I have close to 50 chars in retail. Some I did boost because I didn't want to do old content with them after having done it so many times.
---
Play it as you want to and don't worry if other people buy level boosts or not.  You'll get better enjoyment out of it.
---
Yes, you will go through the older content faster due to catchup mechanisms but you can still take your time and experience everything if you want to.
---
Overall it's a pretty decent story to play though from start to end (sure some of it's WTF?).
---
Your logic is allright, except the 150 armor gets a 350% boost from dire bearform, which makes it slightly better.
---
Razorgore EU?
---
Art, music and raiding got consistently better, for the most part, overtime.
---
From a systems standpoint...raid lockouts being tied to bosses directly, and not a raid instance itself, was in my opinion a huge QOL update. Entering into a failed MC run with your alt, at Baron, and getting locked for the remainder of the week is pretty sadpanda.
---
Also, was a big fan of the proc system for professions throughout TBC and WotLK.
---
More than one, I know.
---
"You are here because I am here. End of discussion."
---
Been forever since I actually had to pull that out, but it reaches an outcome - either they make it known they MUST be kicked, or they play on.
---
In my experiences, even a quiet party will take this opportunity to turn on the asshole and agree enthusiastically with you.
---
(atleast with prat) there is an option for "channel" or something under other.
---
My server, my people!  
---
Btw, you can just call it "Ashbringer", because there is only one server with that name if IIRC.
---
People don't say "Herod-US".
---
Tbh if you didn't spend on dumb stuff, grinded the right mobs and got semi lucky, 200g at mid level 40s I can believe. On my paly I was able to afford boots of avoidance at level 40, Stockades pauldrons at level 50 and Skullflame Shield at 54. That's like 600g.
---
Any idea how much Evocator’s Blade should go for?  I’ve heard 75-80g due to it being a great 19 twink weapon but am not sure if/when people would pay that much.
---
Charlie, shun the non-believer!
---
It’s PvE but the Pagle server is by far the most alliance populated server of all
---
Not Cathedral, tho.
---
I wouldn't be so quick with the "obviously" about going combat swords leveling. I am currently 46 and have been doing daggers/ambush. It is so much fun, and I still do very competitive dps in dungeon runs I've been in while providing standard rogue utility. 
---
As others have said though, until you get the 5/5 sword specialization, you mainly just want a slow hard hitting main hand and fast offhand. What they actually are doesn't matter all that much.
---
I really disagree. I think that this is what many people *think* being a leader is about. This idea that you have to keep everyone afraid and in line because if you don’t, they’re going to take advantage of you. Then you wonder why the group seems on edge and people start arguing and slinging mud at the tiniest of setbacks. 
---
We wiped? It was the warlock who body pulled! That wipe wasn’t on me! Kick them, not me! The healer barely healed! The healer is bad! Not me! 
---
This is the result of weak leadership. A good leader inspires others. 
---
The infamous onyxia raid leader wasn’t a strong leader. It was a manchild having a meltdown. And they still wiped. If I got into any guild where the guild leader talked about -50 DKP for mistakes, I’d be out of there right away. Same for a group where the leader said ‘I brought a warlock to summon your replacement.’ It just says that the run is going to be rocky and stressful. The leader is probably going to kick someone halfway through and the run has a 50% chance of just falling apart.
---
Made a mana bar that shows mana when in shapeshift.
---
Made icon of omen of clarity and thorns that pop up when I forget buffing myself.
---
Made glowing little tigerpaw when Tiger's fury is active.
---
Combo-point counter.
---
Nature's swiftness cooldown bar.
---
Reagent tracker to remind me to buy raiding reagents
---
Innervate icon shows when available. And when it is active on me
---
Probably more, those are the ones I live
---
Easier to fly to west fall than walk.
---
I think it would be cool and not harm "Classic."  Content exists no why not. I played when Caverns of Time came out and it was fun visiting "old" content.
---
Surprised its not a fury warrior looking for a tank.
---
I mean it doesn’t take a genius to know what it is ... or if you see that you need 80k exp to level it doesn’t take a genius to know how many quests that would be more or less
---
Pretty much nothing. Most of the flaws can be fixed/mitigated with addons. Game's perfect as it is.
---
Eh, we're up to like 8 warlocks so hardly.
---
That’s completely fair enough and, genuinely, I’m pleasured you enjoy it and have that attitude towards it :) that’s for sharing and I’ll think about giving it a try
---
TLDR: Cringe guild names are changed on RP servers.
---
Usually people call the "normal" version "retail", so you got classic and retail. Classic is more grindy and you have to work more for the rewards. Retail is more casual friendly and tries to make everything more comfortable. For example in in classic you don't get a mount before level40 and even then a lot of people can't afford it and get it at around 42-43 and until then you have to walk everywhere. So it depends on what you're looking for. If you don't mind a bit of work for what you get then go with classic.
---
I guess if you're newb
---
Honestly 2.2 is even on the high end but classic weapons being what they are we arent burdened with an over abundance of choices lol
---
I don't think I would consider a mount that speeds up your travel time immensely when you constantly are travelling in this game to be a status symbol. Maybe buying another races mount sure, but not something that greatly improved your QoL.
---
So did a million other people
---
I've got a general 'message' center in the center of the screen under my character.  It alerts me when I have low healther, mana, or my pet is low on health.  It also shows my crits (name of spell/ability and amount) and says "Finish Them" when I have 5 combo points and enough energy for a ferocious bite.  Also shows "Drain Their Soul" when on my Lock and targets health is below 10%.  
---
Also have come glowy buttons for certain things.  For example on my Lock if I don't have a healthstone my make/use healthstone macro button glows.  Same with soulstone if it isn't on cooldown.  
---
Also have a macro that sells my grays so I make it glow when I open a merchant window.  
---
My favorite even though it is kind of buggy at times because of the way blizzard handles secure functions is a glowy button next to my portrait that appears when a buff is about, or falls off that I can click to self cast that buff.  Only works out of combat.  It also has my tracking button if my track herbs/mining falls off.
---
You'll have to reserve it from the start of you want to do that then. If i start a run and the healer halfway through says they're reserving a 100g recipe ill just stop the run right there.
---
&gt; Sound effects when you press space while mounted, instead of a silent animation. 
---
My wolf does a growl when I press space bar. I think this is in classic currently, but maybe that's an addon I've installed?
---
OH sword gives a chance for the extra attack from sword spec. That being said if you get a fast dagger with higher dps than your current offhand sword you will be doing comparable dps. I used a dagger offhand till i got Dalrends at 60. You should be fine.
---
I feel like I’m doing something wrong.... Ive been leveling up my main for about 3 weeks, play 2-3 hours every week night and between 8-10 hours a day on the weekend and I only just dinged 45 last night. Is this focusing just on one character without switching focus? I have rolled a bunch of alts that I’ve leveled up to 20-21 before quitting them so maybe that’s why 😂
---
Ok, whatever dude.
---
Best of luck in your journey of life.
---
Hmm excellent example of why the way it is is far superior, never thought of that.
---
Uncertain for others sure, but It's like anything in an mmorpg, gotta learn the lingo, the way it works, every mmorpg has it's own culture, more less, so to speak.
---
There aren't a lot of good belts for hunters and the giantstalkers is really good.  Idk if it's 1k good though.
---
And still: A large portion hasn't raided or even hit 60 yet. If Blizzard wanted to, they could make every content available from the get go. But they don't want to, so they can recreate a feeling that is close to vanilla.
---
If people decide to rush the content (which isn't a bad thing to be clear), they should expect downtimes.
---
I know Goldshire can be that place on some servers. But, as you've noted, it's nowhere near as concrete as Horde's Orgrimmar dueling area. That's the same on every server.
---
In retail I did that for my battle pets... Winona Spider. Batrick Swayze. Kevin Bacon. And my personal favorite... A macaw named Fucaw.
---
Huh? That's just a look to blizz support...
---
so i tried this over the weekend, doesnt really work as i thought.. I cant use entangle inside anything, so that kinda fucks that up a little, and most things have ranged attacks by level 35 ish
---
Oh...right.
---
Throw in a /stopcasting in the macro too so you can immediately decurse even if already in the middle of another spell.
---
Sorry, I'm not familiar with the insult here, care to enlighten me, "I\_fap\_to\_zamasu".
---
I'm sure you weaboos have your own language by now
---
Aight, stopped reading after the reversal because it was such a waste of time, fair enough
---
where the hell is the timothy washington? he is the alliance tailoring trainer for +225. according to wowhead classic he is located in dustwallow, located in the two story building. but i cant find him there. is this information outdated?
---
Yeah, sure! There's still a few things that I wanted to work on before I can be totally proud of this, though.  
---
As of now, the Character name, EXP bar, and related datatexts are always for the player, I want to integrate weakaura datatexts that tell you how much that mage's rank 4 frostbolt does baseline (Tooltip damage)(detecting spell rank based on the target's level), and manually chronicling 'main' spells as weakauras for targets other than the player. (e.g. level 34 druid? target him and know his moonfire rank 6 does 81-98 damage and 164/12s.) (this would not account for players avoiding main spells, so if you play fire mage and opt out of frostbolt ranks, the frostbolt would still be displayed regardless of the player's actual rank.  
---
That's just a sneak peak! Will be working on uploading some short gameplay videos soon, but don't expect it to be final :D
---
Link is broken
---
In classic top end damage really doesn't matter that much because all weapons are normalized anyways so it depends on the secondary stats and DPS really. Maybe you all the staves you picked up just happen to have good dps and stats.
---
Warcraft 3! &lt;3

i like them the way they are.
---
On my lvl 60 I can solo dungeons and see how far I can go with better gear , going higher lvl dungeons.  
---
And with a lower lvl alt I can solo lower lvl dungeons.   It's a nice challenge
---
Yeah that's where I've been doing it, same time period (works great for me because I'm west coast playing on an east coast server so it's 9pm to 12pm for me)
---
Maybe I was just really unlucky though because even during the sweetspot window I'd just get like 1.5 stacks of nightfin, a stack of blackmouth, and countless shitty redgills.
---
I use it too, but didn't notice. Blindly pouring lw items to bank.
---
I feel like this is incredibly wholesome - you're a nice person
---
)
---
Not sure which is better, this or the rogue I saw in trade chat: "LF9M Ubrs Rend runs, Dal'Rends reserved."
---
load up retail and play the culling of stratholme like this
---
yeah you should set it up so it's halfway between you and the beast, concussive shot, start to tame, and they'll hit the trap at about the halfway point of the tame and still have room before you if the trap breaks.
---
Solo or group pvp? Solo it should still be spriest (ud/troll/dwarf) and warlock (orc/uuh gnome?), if you don't count pom-pyro mages.
---
Even things with loot will despawn after like 10 minutes usually.
---
That just opens the door to ninjaing.
---
Reddit karma has value and means something
---
Guild Bank
---
Better Itemization/Better incentive for a variety of roles to do dungeons (aka why you see people needing to bribe tanks to do dungeons so much in Classic)
---
Meme specs were viable
---
Instanced Quests (used sparingly this would be good. You ever try to turn in your Onyxia attunements to Emberstrife while another group is trying to fight Emberstrife for the UBRS key quest? Or have to wait 10 minutes after someone fights that Ogre in Dustwallow to do yours?)
---
Unfortunately, anyone with allied cast bars enabled will see exactly what recipe you're learning. So /u/Considered_Dissent's method isn't actually that fool proof.
---
Judging from the TipsOut duel tourney I would have to hand it to Warlocks (SL) and these are the top players around
---
Priests are clearly great but SL Warlocks are terrifying, just look at Snutz
---
And what addon gives the minimal that cool effect?
---
Never heard a peep from it.
---
100% this. I haven't played my tank much yet, But I remember back in Vanilla and TBC I had a few macros that I made to explain the ground rules when ever I started a dungeon as Tank.   
---
If someone tries to argue with you, just don't even acknowledge them and start the dungeon like normal. It's not worth the mental energy to try and argue with someone that will probably not change their mind anyways. Either they will silently abide by your rules or they will not. If they will not then give them one good solid warning before just leaving.
---
Fixed, my b!
---
I haven't tried but I think it should be possible.  Wago.io didn't have anything when I searched party castbar though.  Personally I use LunaUnitFrames and it has it built in so I haven't had a need for it.
---
Not much better than warpwood
---
I take an slightly opposite view of tanking: I'm taking a group of dogs for a walk.
---
They mostly know the way, and they usually listen, but their attention spans and priorities are way different than mine. I get joy from watching them get into all sorts of trouble, and helping them get back out of it.
---
Being a raid leader is too much work. I'm here to relax, and prevent the chaos from overwhelming the group.
---
At first, I thought he recreated a WoW scene with the wc3 map editor. This is just as cool.
---
Someone tried really hard to get a few seconds of internet glory.
---
Then they could also split 2 layers into 2 servers should there not be technical limitations. Offer free transfers between them for 1 week and be done with it in a matter of days. The reason they are not doing that hints at a more bare metal limitation than arbitrary design one. 
---
Back in the days of vanilla each server was their own hardware, just to make sure a hardware failure wouldn't take down several realms. We seen this safeguard in use several times over the years when a specific server has gone down.
---
If you make the grid one space higher (will require making the entire lower portion bigger) and then going for smaller buttons, you can probably fit most things in.
---
Don't think cast bars show for recipes? At least crafting items doesn't show because there's no combat log entry.
---
Warrior tank here. This is the correct answer.
---
To elaborate, while I am forming my group I don't explicitly say no DPS warriors or rogues, but when people ask for an invite, I do a quick /who query on them and if they are a warrior or rogue, and I know there will be competition for an item, I will prioritize other DPS classes above them.
---
Its nothing personal, and if you want an excuse you can just tell the person applying that you already have X and are looking for Y classes.
---
OP mentioned being horde - but yes, for Alliance this is something to watch for!
---
This! The freaking symbol of greed is even gold coins... doesn't matter if an item is 10g or 1000g worth; need over greed.
---
In my groups I declare lootrules as need over greed, mainspec over offspec. If you win it, you will have to equip it.  This is the most fair solution, not some BS that you'll have to buy it from the roll winner.
---
Its always a frustrating rogue that goes and pickpockets stuff in instances. LIke he has never been resisted before. Anyway, its possible to macro pickpocket onto openers, so you near always pickpocket at least one mob in each pull without ever risking a resist + face pull. Wish rogues would just do this instead of agrooing the entire grim guzzler on the group because they had no idea for some reason that pugger gets pissed after being pickpocketed.
---
Yellow (ability) hit cap is 6%, whereas white hit cap is 9%.
---
I don't think this is true, I have dropped hundreds of gold on progressing my main. But after I get my main geared, where does the gold go? I mean, there is already a mage streamer with 13k gold, if he hasn't already he could buy every BOE his mage needs and still sit at 10k, the only thing left is consumables and luxury items like pets, twink items, and some super rare BOEs.
---
Because I have to pass on the very little gear dropping in dungeons just to keep wearing my + Spell damage gear made by tailoring 20 level lower then me
---
There's a reason you see LFG filled with rogues and warriors "looking for some ranged dps for A/A/G!". After I got my HoJ (75th kill) I like to bring a rogue in group every time I go just to spread some joy.
---
\&gt; So far, I've seen it drop three times and, lost the roll each one of them which makes me reconsider that maybe I am not going about farming it in the most effective way. I've tried to say that the HoJ is reserved but, that means no whispers at all from dps. 
---
You simply aren't getting the 99% of tells from rogues and fury warriors that you were getting, but you didn't want them anyways right? Maybe there are a small percent of casters whose dignity prevents them from joining a reserve group.
---
I agree with needing boes to a point. If that boe is worth 900g then I'm needing on that for AH. At that point I don't care if it's an upgrade unless we are 60, it's a bis 60 piece and you are a guildie. Otherwise that shit is getting sold.
---
I'm guessing you're about 11 from that sentence. I'll wait for an actual response.
---
Saw it, outrolled by rogue.
---
That's the way!
---
He's there, as you get off of the flight path, head towards the centre of the town but make a left, it's a small house with an upstairs. He's in there.
---
Most anybody is not shit.
---
You have a huge amount of entitlement. And your words are full of resentment.
---
Are you really having fun in azeroth?
---
It is why most tanks are power trippers. They are the only ones enjoying the position.
---
 ~~Warcraft 4~~ 
---
World of Warcraft 2
---
Serves that warrior right. He prob had full leather gear he stole from that poor hunter.
---
I ask because there’s a big difference in threat output between gear sets that isn’t as dependent on spec. 
---
If you’re wearing stockade pauldrons, ornate admantium chest, etc — tons of +def gear (which is unnecessary for MC) that lacks str/agi/crit, your threat and dps will be shit, regardless of your spec. And mitigation doesn’t matter if you can’t hold threat over your dps.
---
Cheating vs taking chances... nice comparison
---
another one bites the dust!
---
All the people on my friends list are people who can craft specific items. I know the feel.
---
Do you know where the horde variant throws you?
---
&gt;If we all ninja no one is a ninja
---
I want the damn ring so bad!
---
I dont feel like its the same thing, while its technically the same result, meaning that you will get X-item, it gives of less signs of entitlement.
---
If I really want the spell power weapon/wand from Scholo, I will put together a group where I as a healer am the only caster, but I will never start a group saying that X-item is reserved. idk, but it seems less douchey.
---
Usually with a name like cutiestab or something equally cute and hateful
---
It was overturned and the they banned them AGAIN.
---
Most of them can be found by going to &lt;servername&gt;.classicdiscord.com
---
Ah, I misread your post at first. Absolutely agree.
---
The daily DPS dumb tank whine thread
---
Yeah that is heal bot but I was talking about the text at the top center lol
---
Thats the beuty of the game, you made it on level 30 and it's still relevant... this is one more thing the new game lacks, you get an upgrade literally every 10 minutes while leveling, here on classic if you get one you just feel better about it.
---
This scares me cause I often fish while watching Netflix and using the sound to click while not even looking at my monitor let alone chat logs
---
8/8 T1 is also bis for hunters for the entire game.
---
It was reversed and then they were banned AGAIN!
---
to clarify, do you mean the floating HP bars above the models? Those are called "nameplates".  
---
Alternatively, "Unit frames" contain the character portrait and hp/mp, target character portrait and hp/mp, party member portraits and hp/mp. My thin green healthbar at the bottom is attached to my Unit Frame, and there are several addons that change exclusively your unitframes.   
---
Otherwise, you can always right click and "unlock" your unit and target frames, and move them down as far as you want.
---
Depends, how much salt?
---
back in vanilla i played mage so never knew the pain that tanks had, i started tanking in TBC after some of the things were fixed for warriors, but i am tanking this time around and i have to say i think some of the issues that are arising now is that back in vanilla we had never had a time where we could just nuke without a thought on threat.
---
now days people are used to how it is in retail where tanks just need to charge and hit things and dps can nuke, when i played in vanilla i would always wand for a little bit before opening up once the tank had full threat on the mobs, this meant that i could nuke without fear and the tank wasn't running about chasing mobs.
---
the DPS i tend to get now when i am tanking see me target a mob and that's their cue to fire off a skill and i find my self racing projectiles to the mob and then running about getting aggro off them, which in meantime means the healer has got aggro from the mobs i hadn't had a chance to hit.
---
i enjoy tanking what i dont enjoy are as the OP put it "brain dead DPS"
---
Because to some of us, high level content is more fun than low level is.
---
we have at least 2 or 3 each run, mostly WL/mage/priest
---
True for the rotation part, very much wrong for the sustain part.
---
What is shadowforging? I haven't played BFA a all.
---
Of course the sword proc on offhand is nice, but if the dagger is way better you go for dagger.
---
When players respond to your LFG post, shift click their name in the chat window.  It will automatically do a /who on that character and tell you their class and level.  
---
Honestly the best answer to your question is not to reply to people you don't want in your group.  If they press you and ask you why you didn't invite, say that you are already full on warriors (which is true right?)  
---
I noticed, while leveling my hunter though the Scarlet Monastery range, that I was having a really hard time getting invited to groups - this was most likely because the tanks didn't want to compete with me for gear since I'd be rolling on mail.  I'd reply to posts for DPS for SM runs and wouldn't get replies.   I found that the only way I could get into the group is to tell them that I didn't want any of the drops, would just roll on any greens that I could equip (to use) and just wanted to do quests.
---
Related: Clearing an entire dungeon not getting the class quest item drop. Because you didn't talk to the mid-quest NPC back in town that advances you to the trigger quest for the drop.
---
Add-ons can't give you an actual DPS rotation and hard boss mechanics.
---
That's awesome man
---
I've only ever seen the dagger drop, so I've got the luck in the opposite direction.
---
BREAKING!!! DRAMA!!! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT!!!!!!!
---
I like it.
---
Well, almost 11...so yeah close so wow you're dumber than a 10 year old ha! You really owned yourself there nice one
---
South and Mid spawn at the southernmost square on their paths, and east spawns at the North square on its pat.
---
why not btw?
---
Alright and that's all well and good, but that's not what we were talking about.  
---
   
---
200g+ below level 40, everyone knows vendor trash and quest rewards start getting much larger after 40. Mid 40s having 200g is believable, especially as a paladin, but that's not sub 40 with 200g.
---
Awesome! I think all of us WC3 vets will get a real kick out of seeing your final product in action.
---
Honestly, I have 26 visible keys, and can hotkey as many as I want. I think it's going to work out of Pally McAutoattack
---
Hey Everyone, Please answer the questions honestly. Yes I know there is going to be those people that botch the survey, but I can remove those answers and will try to, to the best of my ability. After I've received a bit of participants I'll release the data for everyone to see.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
All the mages have 2 heads making them twice as smart as the regular ogres.
---
Why roll greed on anything than? Everything can vendored. I need that gold too.
---
I have a guy in my friends list who really wants the Shadowcraft Leggings from Strat UD. It gets annoying to keep hearing him whine about it not dropping over and over and over and over again. When he finally gets it, I'll sure as hell be glad for him, but only hearing negative things gets boring.
---
Most 45 epics will last you well till 60 when leveling outside dungeons. Not everybody spams dungeons during leveling. Most leveling epics don't even sell that high anyway. What about warden staff ? It's Feral tank BiS forever, do you need roll it over your feral druid to get money ? Freezing band - BiS for mage PvP, again do you take it over the mage in your group ? Alcor's sunrazor : Bis Fury off-hand, great tanking weapon, also great for dagger rogues, you would roll need as a healer ? There are many examples. I would understand the butthurt if the upgrade is only slight. But there are many cases where the upgrade isn't small. Having a general rule that everybody need on boe epics is bending to ninjas and preventing people to get BiS and insane upgrades when they drop in their runs by loosing it to people who will sell it.
---
There is LFG add-on? Didn't blizzard disable those ?
---
I'm standing in this exact building. there is a herbalism trainer aswell, a gnome called jannabink powerseam but no timothy. its the only two story building. I'm so confused.
---
I got like 40 on my Priest. That's pretty much every spell I got (except Smite and Holy Fire as I'm Shadow). Wouldnt be enough for me :)
---
???
---
I get it now! It was commonspeak google translated to orcish!
---
[Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9EKzvTo3g0&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Because people want to make level 19 rogue thinks so they can pop out and kill a level 10 with 1 green item.
---
Most PVP chads are incredibly smooth brained and think this makes them good at PVP.
---
These are the same people that go to level 20 zones to do “world PvP” when In reality it’s just ganking lowbies who are gathering their 7 bear assholes for their quest.
---
Feels bad man
---
All of this could be prevented with a quick. “Hey guys first time here “ at the beginning of the dungeon. The group  can ether go with it or fuck off simple as that
---
Because at a glance, colors and shapes are easier to identify than read a number. This allows for faster reaction times on call outs for on-the-fly actions. Like "someone Kick X" instead of "someone kick 1". Numbers are easily misinterpreted.
---
If you dig deeper in his post history you'll see he's a fortnite douche...  He's used to opening his wallet to try to get ahead.  Also, any comments outside of gaming are just obnoxious and get downvoted like crazy.
---
Not everyone who whispers you knows your whole life and who you are running dungeons with. Stealth runs are for a lot of people reasonably good way to farm something and whispering someone for it isn't rude
---
You said yourself it was a caster sword so obviously yeah YTA
---
never said it was an easy option, just an option if you are that desperate to get the rep
---
Flightpaths that aren't 10-15 min afks

Hab gut 1.5 Jahre bei Pi gespielt :)

---
Asmodis,Priester
---
Where did you go? Haha
---
A ret paladin can throw LoH or BoP on the right target and save an entire dungeon run or raid. Hybrid classes aren't about topping meters - it's about bringing the utility that makes everyone else operate smoothly.
---
If you're running a Shaman, Paladin, or Druid and you aspire to be #1 at all times: hey, with the right consumables and gear, you can do it...but you're probably not playing your class correctly.
---
The private server circlejerk mentality can die in a fire.
---
HOW DO I GET THIS
---
Proof?
---
With the Sword spec talents you have a 5% chance to get an extra swing.  Is the dagger more than 5% better than your other off hand option?  If so use it, if not don’t.
---
I get where you’re coming from but it’s probably not the way to do it. 
---
I agree that eventually they will need to add some more challenging content but I’m waiting to see how Naxx and AQ go before passing judgement on current difficulty.
---
Ah, I see this sub has circled back to week 1 memes. I look forward to seeing them all again.
---
Auctioneer
---
Whoops! Habit lol
---
First time I saw it and thank god, it's amazing.
---
I'm a dwarf and I feel the same about Undead and Orcs. Fuck those 2 races. I don't even hesitate anymore when I see an Undead. I might hesitate a bit for an Orc. Troll are bros and I'd do everything in my power to help those cuties. Tauren are okay
---
All of the above reasons are valid as far as i'm concerned.
---
Always ask yourself the question though, will the run be over quicker or slower if I kick this person.
---
If the answer is quicker, kick his ass.
---
Ah, the retail approach.
---
You've just got to attack experience yielding hostile entities and ensure that their HP reaches 0 before yours does.
---
My very first character back in the day was a troll hunter, so far the only character I've gotten to 60. Currently maining a dwarf hunter.
---
They are very fun and relaxing. PvE is easy mode and PvP can be very engaging and dynamic.
---
Twink items and professions make almost every lower level dungeon worth running for something. Everyone hates on Gnomer saying to only run it once for the quests, but it has an absolute wealth of twink and engineering items. Pretty much every 40+ dungeon is worth running for d/e mats and cloth. Once lower levels start to dry up wool/silk farming will be valuable.
---
Also one lesser and mostly RP realm note, lower level dungeons drop tons of transmog gear, certain green sets will be valuable for this alone even if their stats or d/e mats are useless.
---
Let me help. You're sexually attracted to her. Confusion erased!
---
You focus 1 2, you attack 3 which no longer needs to be disabled because 1 2 are dead.
---
Yeah I don’t have all day. Any dps worth his salt is going to be fighting for threat. If you can’t handle actually being required to tank you probably shouldn’t play one.
---
I read the article again, it is worded very poorly. 
---
"This decision was reversed by a representative from Blizzard, who confirmed that the name did not break their Terms of Service, but was then reinstated only 12 hours later."
---
The ban was reinstated 12 hours later, not the name.
---
... yes...?
---
The mans actually copy pasted the ToS lmaoo
---
I am leveling sub daggers (yes, I like the dagger/stealth play). I want to respec to streamline the points and I was wondering if I should go down the Combat or Assassination tree to pair with Subtlety.
---
If Elontusks isn't an Elemental Shaman I'll be very disappointed!
---
&gt; can’t fade me bra
---
Priest: That's where you're wrong, kiddo. (⌐■_■)
---
They open with cheap shot, since it (afaik) gives 2 combo points.
---
Haha that is amazing
---
Poooah da bin ich ja sogar auf nem Naxxbild ♡
---
Zumindest im Raidroster :D
---
This is crazy town to me. I'm in the "all need, everyone benefits equally" side of this discussion, and to me, your pint of view is the new one. I played since vanilla, and the entire time the loot etiquette has been to all-need on purple boe drops. Never heard of anyone just giving it to the person who it happens to be an upgrade for, unless it's like a guild run or something.
---
Its kinda crazy how different servers can spawn completely different looting etiquette. Like on my classic server, every respects the all-need method. Never heard a single complaint. Yet other people report their servers as being the exact opposite.
---
Not if you need to kill the unmarked first. The bottom line is that the markings are not always meant for kill order.
---
Regrowth, Bear, Enrage, pull, Demo Roar, Maul+Swipe main target, switch target, Maul, switch to main target, Maul, Taunt/Bash/Charge if necessary, Swipe, Swipe, Swipe
---
While doing this, round up the mobs as best as you can. 
---
You do this on every dungeon pack basically, lose the Swipe on bosses unless you have 50+ rage.
---
I'm leveling a spriest and never even knew about the Crimson Felt Hat. That's like blatantly better than what the BiS guides online say lol. Now I feel like I need to do some more digging for the other slots...
---
I used to transfer gold in mists to my horde or alliance by making a black market AH listings for things WAAAAAYYY above normal, then buy it on my other character. I'm amazed I didn't get banned after reading about how gold sellers did their thing.
---
I mean it also depends on the server. Less populated server = less availability on Tier BoEs on the AH so prices can be set higher since there is less competition.
---
You can either stay up for two days figuring it all out like I did, or you can hope I figure out how to share it! :p
---
You're my hero.
---
I actually just started using an xp tracker addon to see how long I need to level. That way I always know when to expect a level up and if it is possible in the current session.
---
It's just nice to have an expected time instead of guessing when it happens.
---
Set bonus
---
The worst part of it all, is that if next patch the code just breaks your addon completely wasting all your efforts.  It's why I stopped putting a ton of effort into my UI
---
Wait, there is a path? My mind has elevated :O
---
Best reserve yourself a healer then too. Damn.
---
If you can’t get your hands on the right gauntlets, there are some decent gloves out of DM west with agi str stam and dodge. I opted to use them over the falcon slaghides
---
Are we talking about duration or CD now?  
---
As soon as you use the skill, it goes on cooldown and is displayed as such.  
---
E.g. a skill has a 4min CD, it will start with 3min 59sec but show as four minutes. Which is okay because real CD is more like 4 min than 3min.  
---
Once it ticks below 3min x sec it will show as 3min.  
---
Depending on your addons and settings CDs &lt;1 min might be displayed in seconds.
---
Probably fine for a fury warrior too, all they need is a one button macro with cast sequences of bt, ww, ham and prob hs with a modifier to dump extra.
---
I use a normal bag and tend to only carry 2 or 3. Just feels like a waste of space otherwise. Obviously this will vary depending on what you're doing though.
---
Wetlands. I dont play with the english client and thought menethil is the place to go. And all descriptions said: left when coming from the ship in the 2 story building...jesus.
---
I like lfg
---
Is Donaldtusk taken?
---
Lvl Engi to 300, and stockpile Thorium Grenades
---
Plate with crit/agi stam str. You only need 5% hit in PvP so focus more on crit if you reach that. Buy tons of blackmouth oil for free action potions as long as they are cheap. Find buddies that want to heal you. Get a big 2h weapon.
---
You must be great a parties /s
---
Someone is still looking for that Aged Gorilla sinew....
---
Seen someone trying to sell it for 10k on my server.
---
My name was DonaldRump as a tauren but I got banned 3 times.
---
I think you need to combine it with [this](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicauradurations) addon.
---
I was lucky enough to make friends with a good tank whilst levelling and it makes life so much easier. Being a perma tank and healer combo let's you be as picky as you like. I love it.
---
It won’t, though. The API isn’t going to change unless something catastrophic happens, and even then isn’t there this whole debate about “no changes”? Sure a bus tracker might get confused if you load it out of date but UI addons are generally pretty safe.
---
Haha not too bad of a mistake, they are pretty similar places.
---
I don't see how any of this is news.
---
Seems like you got the sub, go try it. Maybe you will like it :)
---
I've brought sub 60s on runs that do less dps than me as a tank and we still finish the run with no issues. Just have to pull an extra group or two because of aggro range. Most content is face roll. I would take a retadin just as fast as a dps warrior. Min-maxing for 60 dungeons is rediculous.
---
That only become a problem at lvl60 if you don’t socialize , but loot shouldn’t be a problem at all if you run with a set group of people (aka a guild or friend list). Sure tank will prob get the loot first because that just priorities and commonsense in the serious raid progression but the dps will get it when it there turn.

 **\[A\] &lt;Vanilla&gt; - NA-Incendius** **PvP** **| Tues/Thurs - 8-11pm EST | Semi-hardcore/Semi-Casual**
---
**About us:** We are a very large and social guild looking for any and all new members! Our main focus is raiding with a strong side of PVP. We have around 400 players but it feels like a very tight-knit community. Everyone is willing to help out, regardless of what it may be. Our core raid group is being developed right now, so if you need a guaranteed raid spot with a fun and active guild (and you're level 55+) definitely consider joining our discord! We have members in the voice chat every day. We are aiming to start raids Tomorrow night - Tuesday, October 22, 2019.
---
**Our plans before October 22:** Currently, we have a solid group of level 60s who are pugging MC/Ony as we wait for more players to hit 60. We constantly have groups for Dire Maul/BRS/BRD/Scholo/Strat going pretty much 24/7. So that, along with recruiting and trying to help players get pre-raid BiS is what we have planned out before we get to raiding. Feel free to join up if you'd like to experience DM runs with us before you commit and we go bigger!
---
**Leadership:** Our guild leadership includes a wide variety of players. From Vanilla old-timers to modern retail leaders to private server veterans, we try to create a diverse environment within leadership to get as many viewpoints on guild subjects as possible. Our raid and class leads are extremely knowledgeable and have held leadership roles for years across all versions of the game.
---
**Raid Times:** Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm EST (Working on creating a second group for weekend players)
---
**Loot Rules:** For the first few runs, we will be using a Round Robin +1 /roll on all items besides MT items. Once our core group is fleshed out, we will move to a more distinct system (EPGP or DKP w/ Decay) after we no longer need to pug spots.
---
**What we expect from you:** Be respectful to your guildies! Other than that, be present when you sign up for raids and be online before the raid start time. Our guild is very tame and friendly, we hope you will be too.
---
**What you can expect from us:** You can expect a friendly and helpful environment which is focused on teamwork and enjoying the game. You can expect leadership that is vocal, transparent, and willing to help out their fellow members. Most importantly, you can expect to enjoy your time with us.
---
**Contact:** If you are interested, please join our discord: [https://discord.gg/jnPMg2d](https://discord.gg/jnPMg2d) or feel free to contact us in game or on (discord):

Our website is a WIP, but feel free to check it out anyways! [https://vanilla-guild.com/](https://vanilla-guild.com/)
---
Thanks for your consideration! Keep on grinding!
---
Oh hey thanks! I did roll on Herod as a human pally. Is it good balance of alliance? I'll DM you my name
---
My main is undead called “theydugmeup”
---
In order to enjoy classic I feel I gotta enjoy the basic gameplay loop. I love healing dungeons and I don't get a sinking feeling when someone else gets the items for I know that pretty much any given lvl 60 dungeon is worth going for gold with a good group - net gold gain, some better than others. 
---
It's always a good idea to aim for the better items and craftables but don't let it get you feeling down.
---
Yeah, everyone seems to whine how hard it is to find a tank, yet the reason it is so hard is the fact that tanking for pugs is often horrible experience for the tank.
---
I only tank for guildies now.
---
There might be some people who already prepare a 19 twink. But I'm sure you will get more after the first BG's were actually released.
---
Could you send out a memo to the tens of thousands of other mages out there, thanks!  
---
-every healer everywhere
---
Mend pet bonus. Lol.
---
*Live to win!*
---
That only works in the instances where you only  have one of each class
---
That action bar though, good till level 10.
---
If I'm in a dungeon run and skullflame drops, even though I "need" it, I do not expect anyone else to let me have it.   
---
Same goes for any expensive BoE, flask recipe drop, enchanting recipe drop, etc.  
---
As soon as the value gets to 100g+ I expect everyone to be needing.  
---
It's very benevolent of you to assume that everyone will agree to the need over greed rules, but can you actually say confidently that if an expensive BoE drops that your entire party would follow suit?
---
To add onto that, expensive BoE's have a value, everyone needs gold - why does X player get to have expensive BoE just because it \*happened\* to drop for him/her? Things like edgemasters/skullflame/cloudkeeper/myrms signet/freezing band etc aren't farmable items, they're random drops - and should be treated as items you farm gold to buy, not happen to stumble across and then expect the entire group you are running with to just allow you to have.
---
Do you have a choice if only certain builds are viable?
---
You have to use the trap. You don't have to use the Ogre suit, but in that case, kill the King, talk to the Captain to make him run away and then spawn the Tribute chest by talking to Mizzle.
---
Oh, you are absolutely not supposed to know that.  No way.  There are 9 classes with at least 2-3 specs/roles each, there's no way you should know it all.
---
I'm referring more to if someone declares "this is my BIS". 
---
Now...they might be wrong, but i've found the vast majority of people to be reasonable and only say that when it's really their BIS.
---
Are there no server transfers in classic?
---
What’s the minimum level for av?
---
They generate the most threat
---
Would love to try this out ! &lt;3
---
26 entirely visible keys, by the way!
---
For fucking him. Keep up.
---
It's actually more douchey. Instead of just reserving a piece that someone might be totally fine with giving up, you're excluding them entirely.
---
I love when he says that, and I just demonic sacrifice him for a health regen buff. Got what he wanted.
---
Onyxia wipe animation
---
Well i got response from GM that the items will be deleted from his acount and he will be punished... bu of course im not gonna get my things back..
---
Can I take auctioneer has profession next time?
---
it will increase right before BGs coming out.
---
This hits home. Last night I got into a group that was actively looking for a tank even though they already had a warrior who was 3 levels higher. So fine I’m the tank, I go to tank. Except the dps warrior just charges away, many time before I can. Wtf did you need me so badly for?
---
2 nights before that? The fucking priest insists on pulling the groups. I threaten to leave telling everyone to fuck if. I could have handled that better but I was sick of it.  Finally they let me attack first and establish agro. We finish the last  boss and before I can thank anyone I get kicked. 
---
I like to tank. It’s a challenge. But people sure don’t like to make it easy on us.
---
A pally healer in my guild respec'd to prot this weekend because we were so frustrated that none of the healers could run content because none of our warriors will slap on a shield.
---
I ended up healing several runs.  They were drunk as fuck (forgot RF a couple times, doing shots between pulls, etc) and the runs were still easier to heal than most simply because they were holding threat really well.
---
This was at 60 with at least one geared AoE DPS in the group.  Pallies are just fine at 60.
---
Take the flight, go write a novel and maybe you’ll land by the time you finish the book.
---
Some of those spawn points are incorrect.
---
Could you imagine that? 2 people rolling up and you and mocking you by moo’ing at you as they’re murdering you. Completely ignoring the fact that you’re a sentient creature capable of thought.
---
I did the same thing to 47 and i'm on a Paladin now...
---
MS equals the role you're acting in the party. So if you tank, you can't roll on DPS items. Don't make it harder than it is.  
---
If you're not high enough on your skill, bad luck, you can't use it right away so we can't prevent you from selling it. Gear is primarily bound to be used, secondarily to be sold.   
---
People can obviously game my strategy, but I screenshot these rules every single party and if someone actually ninja it, Blizzard will delete the item from them. Simple as pie.
---
Every time i make group where i advertise no caster dps, i am instantly getting mad whispers, how i am shit etc.. there is no win win usually.
---
I agree. I hope they add an option later.
---
Gratz dude! I got my quest last night, and I have 3/4. Unfortunately Un'goro is swamped with people who wants to help....
---
Don't Ele Shaman go OOM in like a a couple of casts?
---
Yeah i havent rolled for a single pre-bis item for either fury or prot, as the tank you have the power to build whatever group comp.
---
Anyone who cries about it can make their own group you owe them nothing.
---
Bruh... if you cant comprehend the fact that everyone hitting greed leaves you open to being ninja'd by the last person to roll, you're literally below 80 IQ. You know, a mouth breather. "BUT THE GOLD COINS HUR DUR" Lol it's a visual aid not the word of God you retard.
---
Good luck tying your shoes later.
---
It's not Phase 2. They just released DM early.
---
He also goes on about boe weps that he was probably planning on buying
---
Is arcanite reaper still the best preraid 2h weapons for arms warriors?
---
Leaving Kromcrush alive gives an extra item from a specific pool (Counterattack Lodestone, Redoubt Cloak, Rod of the Ogre Magi, Bracers of Ogre Power and possibly Treant's Bane), but only if you talk to him after killing the king but before spawning the chest.
---
&gt; get the group together which takes minimum 15 minutes, sometimes an hour or longer 
---
*laughs in tank*
---
Well yes if the lock is braindead and just spamming shadowbolt on cooldown without thinking about how much threat he is generating he will pull aggro when he gets like 2 nightfall procs which then crit, a good warlock will slow DPS when he sees that to not pull aggro.
---
If I was the guild leader, I would’ve given the guy in red a harsh talking to in guild chat then tell him to shape the fuck up don’t let it happen again or you’re out of the guild.
---
He may have just been using /target &lt;name&gt;
---
This. I get bored quickly with farming dungeons for bis. I instead got items close to it and now just level an alt or farm gold for raid consumables. I enjoy raiding the most, and even though I’m not decked out in my pre bis gear I am still very competitive in the raids for dps.
---
I was at 295 last night, got knocked back 3 times total. Made an intercept macro and was able to just not lose aggro for more than a second though so all good.
---
Details? Sorry if I’m being dumb. Is that an add on for classic?
---
2 paladins, 1 shaman. Do people that play these classes not like surveys?
---
Still nice with the 0.5 reduced casting time of the improvement.
---
Are you spec in restoration or do you run a hybrid template?
---
Healing touch does.
---
Stfu with your bullshit. Pretty much everything is generally Easy. But im not saying theres No challenging aspect in classic.
---
Umm no. Each tier set is bis, but each subsequent tier set replaces the other as bis. Giantstalker -&gt; Dragonstalker -&gt; etc.
---
loot council is the best system, but it only works in established guilds where everyone knows and trusts eachother.
---
I play with a highly excitable mage, he’s a good guy but a bit eager.  Gave him a good five back to back deaths, stood there and did not heal.  Issue corrected itself, he makes so many sheep I told him he should have rolled the name motherflocker.  Somehow I feel vanilla is a lot of negative reenforcement.  Saves groups falling apart due to lectures too.
---
So I named my character what I did back in Vanilla, and basically everyone else I see is some sort of pun or parody and now I feel like I missed out.
---
: (
---
Won’t top the DPS meters but our WF and other totems make it up and then some.
---
Someone making a group can say anything is reserved as long as they're upfront with it. They're in for a rude awakening if they don't get any takers, but there's nothing wrong with a group leader leading a group the way they want. Also, good luck forcing people to hand over any runecloth they looted, that'll be fun to watch.
---
BoEs from raid seem to have a really low drop chance in classic. We have done mc every week since week 3 and farmed trash week 2 and only seen 1 piece of giant stalker and 2 pieces of nightslayer from trash. There are no nightslayer pieces on my ah as of now and if a belt were to show up I could see it going for over 800 gold
---
wow rounds up the seconds, move along sir.
---
I thought Make Azeroth Great Again was a pretty great guild name. I don’t like when enough people report it and they just make you change it. It should go to review and have a system in place where it’s protected unless people open an actual ticket and can provide evidence of why it needs to be changed.
---
My in game chat doesn't support whispers anymore; i.e. whispers aren't sent or received. I tried reinstalling, didn't work. What might cause this?
---
Any specific 2h? Should I go for arcanite reaper? I also heard kang is good but it's kind of low level. I'm also a human so should I go for a big boy sword ?
---
Oooh ew. Hes a 30 year old with a 15 y/O mind. Stay clear of him aswell.
---
Go kill mobs that drop whatever you need - cloth for rep, Silver for your epic mount, anything near items you could gather for a profession, any essences you need for an some piece of leather gear/could auction for mount money), although the competition with your own faction or opposing on PvP could slow you down), etc
---
Having a resto Druid as our main party healer I always looked for ret pally because of rezzes
---
What do you mean by ‘got the sub’ sorry if I’m being stupid aha
---
yes it's a much better recount.
---
Just do both. Play on your druid while your friends are on, and pvp on your rouge when not.
---
How do you have a reddit account and have never seen RIP on peace before...you deserve the downvotes lol
---
Why some people play 100% passive in PVP realms? Bugs the shit out of me.
---
It was pretty hard fitting everything in a 4:3 resolution back then hehe.
---
I don't think I made a "clean" image of the UI... Might have the old PSD file still, I'll check later tonight.
---
the amount of hate americans have for their own country never cease to amaze me
---
(the half of american that lost in the elections, that is)
---
Anyone can help with a hybrid PvP/PvE rogue? Yea I know it's no ideal and so on, but I don't have good daggers (and I won't for a long while) but I do enjoy the world PvP while questing. Does this look any good? https://i.imgur.com/JKgqlrF.png Mostly considering between how many points into S&amp;D (instead of Initiative) and how to distribute between Elusiveness and Camouflage.
---
Full resto right now. Not much reason to hybrid until pvp
---
Yeah but the majority of a characters life isn't only raiding. You'll still do lbrs, ubrs, brd, dm to help other people. That's how the game is intended, also leveling is a huge chunk of the average players life.
---
Whatever you have to tell yourself
---
Go do the northern part of STV. Don't feel like you need to do it all, get the first quests done until you're beyond your level,  then come back when you're nearer 40 and do the next batch.
---
1 button macro for conjure food and water with drinking. Saves bar space.
---
Lots of people have their epic mounts already. It'd not that hard and doesn't take that long.
---
&gt;Also : warlocks who are treating healers as their own personnal mana bar, without bringing any drink/food/bandages get ONE downranked renew per pull.
---
What about those of us that bring food/drink?
---
A single dot rotation on one mob CoA, Corruption, Immolate=875(number goes up a little after AQ). Sometimes I don't bother with Immolate(370). A full line of dots on 4 mobs will take my 4200 mana down to 700(16%). An Immolate free rotation on the same mobs will be  2180(51%). Then shadow bolt is 370 a pop. 
---
Given how things work: the dots will never run their full course. Lots of wasted mana. But there isn't really much we can do about that. ("Guys, could you not kill the mobs for 18 seconds?") Meanwhile my life tap chews through 20%(!!!) of my 2900 hp. Since Life tap scales with SP, and the +15% shadow damage from sac'n my succubi. 
---
Just a little FYI from the lock world. I personally will resort to wanding if I'm sitting in the 60% HP range with no renew on me. Then Life tap at the end of battle before eating/drinking. If I'm kept closer to full, I can do a whole lot more DPS than wanding provides.
---
\* Electric Boogaloo
---
Sorry, as a caveat, I have never played retail, didn’t really appreciate that this was already a thing over there :)
---
not mine but how about you go give that guy a like then :D
---
Yeah... Can be damn expensive depending on the server.
---
You can certainly argue with reposts, though :D
---
&gt;Im basically the only healer in my entire group of friends, and I heal their dungeons all day, even if I rarely need anything from it
---
Oh come on, they need loot too
---
&gt;and they keep taking everything for OS, or for their "I might need that nature resist green for AQ some day"-specc
---
Wait wtf? No, nevermind, fuck these assholes. That is serious horse shit.
---
&gt;Then when I need some Strat UD runs for gear, there is no way in hell they'll help me out since they already gotten all gear from there.
---
Dude, friends or not, they need to stop being pricks. IMO I would tell them you will gladly heal their dungeon, but not until they do strat with you first. At least every one or two runs.
---
Its mostly because of the look and history arround the sword.. Never played melee in vanilla/tbc/classic so i have no idea how its compared to other weapons
---
How is it possible to have feathermoon at 32 but you haven't visited theramore?  I assume they set these up not expecting player to be in such a weird place.
---
Big dick warlock: Dark Pact your Imp 14 times while everyone else is drinking and force them to listen to the sound effect
---
It’s like 400g worth of materials. Cheaper but definitely not free
---
I used a laughably low number to put in context the mouthbreathers in this thread.
---
Awesome. Need to wallpaper engine version
---
I get what you're saying. Don't stress, enjoy the process. Be a good Buddhist. 
---
I'm not stressed, but at the same time I want to catch up with my friends :( 
---
Still though, this is a good lesson. I really think enjoying the process is a key factor in life happiness. I'm hitting the mid-40 level range though and it's gonna start feeling grindy, I reckon.
---
The soul bags are most useful for raiding when you'll need significantly more shards. Unless you plan on regularly carrying more than a dozen while leveling I would just use regular bags.
---
Ha, you not censure the pet name, now i'm going to yoink your account!
---
On the contrary, I had a slow sword in my off hand. The dagger, Sliverblade, has a 1.4 speed.
---
difficulty, or more like the fact we can push harder content, like actually understanding raid mechanics which actually force you to play around them instead of keyboard smash. m+ scaling with key lvl and weekly shuffle of affixes is cool idea too imo.
---
Dude I’m 100% with you on this, exact same issue.
---
I wouldn’t say I’m 100% passive, but usually I’m just trying to get something done on limited play time. Now if I start getting ganked I’ll seek out some allies and let them have it 😉
---
thank you, if a hybrid is topping meters every they are very well geared compared to everyone else or the rest of the party/raid are doing something wrong. my other half played balance druid in vanilla, sometimes she would top damage or be in the top 5 but more than the raw damage she brought it also meant that other people got buffed from her being there, moonkin aura as well as things like innervate and another res, and if played right very rarely would she oom, potions/dark runes helped a lot with this
---
You're looking at this with tunnel vision. 
---
There are scenarios where the tank, healer, or a "non-shit" spec cause problems. Hunters and mages who kite into another pack of mobs. Tanks who shout too close to another pack. Healers not maintaining LoS, which may not be their fault. Falling off cliffs (Gnomer, RFD). Not killing the runners in time. So forth, so on.
---
Shit happens in dungeons. When it does, a shit spec can clean that shit right up.
---
*This entire place must be ARTHAS!*
---
Simple as pie, lol. Sure. 
---
Tanks use dps items all the time. 
---
Except you're not taking into account the fact that a deleted item because it was "ninja'd" means nobody gets that item. 
---
BoP is primarily meant to be used. BoE gear is sellable, which makes the value of that item the SAME for everyone. How can you not understand that?
---
If a 0.01% expensive world item drops, anyone in that group can sell it and use that gold for something they NEED. If a BoP item drops the value of vendoring vs equipping is not the same. 
---
This is not a hard concept.
---
If that is the case (which it could be) blizz could probably look this transaction up and see if the buyer is a suspicious account.
---
Blizz seems to be going jard with the ban hammer lately
---
Hello Druid friend.
---
You are correct that druid itemization is really bad. This unfortunately will continue until AQ40 releases, where a ton of excellent feral gear is located. Blues are often your best choice until this point, with a few exceptions of items you simply may have to just wait for, such as the band of accuria and onyxia tooth pendant.
---
Sounds like your guild isn't willing to give you any gear, which is sometimes indicative of corrupt and/or not knowledgeable leadership. If you're clearing MC and ony every week you should be getting to the point where you will be getting passed gear soon. Druids often have to be patient to get gear outside of tier, hunters struggle with this as well.
---
They’re probably still being sent, you just can’t see them. Try right clicking the chat window and making sure the whisper text is enabled under settings
---
Seen loads of people doing this type of BS on purpose.
---
A lot of addons will sort by cheapest including BID price, if not set up correctly
---
So an item worth 1g may have a bid price of 1s but be listed with a 10g buyout. It will show towars the top of the list, since your addon says it's a good deal to BID on it (but not buyout).
---
Those not paying attention can easily miss this and click buyout instead of bid.
---
I personally have extreme AH usage (was gold capped back in the day, 214,000 or whatever) and was consistently quite rich - in WoTLK I had the most gold on my server - Yet I have still bought out a few overpriced/scammy posts such as this, despite knowing it exists. Those less accustomed to AH usage will fall prey to these scummy tactics.
---
Fucking oof man.
---
Someone needing on a BoE and equipping it isn't a ninja. Someone pressing need because its worth gold is a ninja.
---
I cannot remember the other addon I tried but I’ll download that tonight. It only seems to be that type of addon that effects it for some reason
---
Hell most groups I'm in don't declare the rules and that's what it always is. I've had BoE worth a solid 200-300 gold drop and a player ask if they could need the upgrade. We allow it and they equip it.
---
It's like 300 gold. Sure when you're starting out it's a lot. But that amount of gold doesn't REALLY matter to a lot of people. Most gear people want is BoP and the people who do want that amount of gold are off playing the AH or solo farming. Not running dungeons.
---
Priest can farm pretty well actually. Because you should be shadow. Literally no reason to be holy/disc in P1.
---
And unless its raid night there is little reason to be prot spec on a warrior.
---
This question is coming from someone who A) doesn't play a rogue and B) doesn't totally understand their kit.
---
Combat swords/daggers are definitely the end all for end game DPS.
---
But how has is Assassination? Just playing around with their talents, and there was a 33/13/5 build that looked interesting. Increased poison damage, increased chance to apply poisons, extra damage and crit chance on Backstab. Full Seal Date.
---
IIRC, their poisons don't damage mobs in AQ and other instances, so obviously that sucks, but from my limited perspective it sounds like a fun build.
---
So, does deep Assassination just not compete at all? How bad is it?
---
Your getting close to being able to make money as Alch.  Transmutes will never be your bread winner though as the CD wrecks that.  If it didn't though the economy for essences/Arcanine bars would be all piss though.
---
What you need to find and get while cheap are recipe things such as the Mongoose potion or Shadow Power etc.  What's the prices and snag low then sell the potions as they go high.  Usually as week drives on the herbs get cheaper and so do the potions, then consumption skyrockets for weekends and raid resets this driving the prices up.  This is when you sell them.
---
Be weary of the dumbass banker toons trying to manipulate the market while doing this also.  There's always a retard out there thinking he can inflate a farmable item, loses his ass on the venture on AH, but as a side product causes potions to appear higher value than they are.  These guys always lose money on the farmable items when they do it, but the dillusions of grandeur always overpower their common sense.  As a side effect a potion that may appear to be 3g is only 2g with a 1.9g mat cost in market trend.
---
Lots of money to be made in alch if your patient.  I spend about 15-20 minutes a day doing it and average about 80-120g a day if volume moves at best, about 20g a day during off times on misc items when the big stuff isn't moving.
---
In before some AH twat comes and tells a tall tail about he makes one trillion (evil pinky) gold on the AH every day doing this....
---
That's a beautiful story.  Thank you for sharing.
---
Because for right now there's no reason to do PvP and a lot of people are still leveling, so if you're running around killing grey players you're doing it for no other reason than to ruin someone else's day.
---
link please.
---
Interesting that donaldrump gets banned but I still see people running around like mydixforyou
---
Got the 3.8 sword from Strat Living the other day and as a Human that thing isn't all too bad. It has no stats and its proc sucks but oh man I did some decent damage in Diremaul.
---
I would recommend chaining some SM groups together.  You can get likely get some good really experience from Library / Cathedral runs if you find a competent group.  I found a really strong group and chained  a bunch of Cath runs and was able to gain a few levels in an evening.  A lot of people hang out in that SM hub so it's pretty easy to grab a group relatively quickly.  Also maybe look at RFK / Gnomeragan.
---
What counts as good alliance server?
---
Shamans, druids, priests, and pallies can all heal. Only wars, druids, and pallies can tank, at least the more difficult content. Druids are more popular late game healers than tanks. Tanks are just sparse for a variety of reasons including the limited classes as well as the expectations of the role.
---
its nonetheless pretty useless in dungeons unless you have to dump rage as warrior imo
---
I saw a post a while ago where it sort of broke down the Warrior (skills/weapons/talents) in one large image. I can't find it anywhere.
---
Anyone have the link to that image?
---
People roll horde for pvp racials. Men roll alliance for pve racials and still own them pvp.
---
:,(
---
Male Gnomes and Male Night Elves share the same stereotype to me - silent throughout dungeon, only communicates in short words/phrases. E.g, "Summ?", "Water", "Ress", "Here". Leaves without saying a word. Won't ninja, but will wait a few seconds before rolling on anything just to keep you on your toes
---
Eventually they'll add the world boss that drops the item as well. So sooner than later.
---
Obviously you should ding 60 still in your level 1 grays because no gear you get on the way to 60 is pre-bis and therefore is not worth equipping.
---
\\s
---
i've never wiped a group pickpocketing when it resists. you shouldn't be in a position that will pull a large enough pack to be a problem if vanish does bug out, and even if you do, it won't aggro onto your party unless they get closer than they should. and i have prep, anyway, so i can vanish twice if i really need to.
---
Tbh thats why ive been hating healing raids.  Some 5 mans are  hell, but if im doing a guild run its normally okay.  With a decent tank and dps that arent braindead its typically pretty easy, i can use heal for the most part because im *not* getting sniped, etc.
---
MC has just been a shitshow if im not on a tank.  Ironically our lead healer is a pally thats fucking raging about people sniping heals on the tanks, but refuses to set group priorities or anything so the raid healers dont have to worry about the same thing.
---
I can't blame them. As early as TBC, cross-spec classes became far less useful. By Wrath, the hybrid days were done. (Couldn't you dual-spec in Wrath anyways? I don't remember now). 
---
After 10+ years of conditioning, they just might not know.
---
It is always funny to me to see Warriors, Druids, and Paladins asking for tanks (or healers for the latter two) in low-level dungeon runs.
---
About the 30%, the tooltip always says 25% but i guess you mean that one has a 5% chance all the time anyway?
---
So poisons just aren't really a big portion of your damage in vanilla/classic?
---
Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but did they buff poisons in BC? I feel like Assassination rogues were amazing then. But maybe that was just because of Mutilate and Envenom?
---
I have already farmed and crafted my devilsaur set. I also have Rune of the Guard Captain as well as Wyrmhide Spaulders. So basically I just need 1% hit chance as long as I use bows, and I haven't even hit 60 yet. It still sounds weird to me to use even more hit chance on more items, instead of e.g. crit chance, just to use crossbows instead of bows. Are the high end crossbows really that much better, or why would I do that? Especially since I see Rhok'delar as a BiS weapon for Phase 1 with raid gear...
---
25+5 baseline
---
Here's what they need to do.
---
WoW Maker.
---
just give us the tools to design our own custom shit. bam, player housing. bam, every player's house can also have a dungeon underneath it that you can challenge your friends to complete.
---
I tanked LBRS last night as an arms warrior with sword and board and we got through it in about an hour and 20 minutes with no wipes. Healer and all dps except for 1 mage were 60. Mage was 58. Most of tanking in 5 mans in classic is knowing how to taunt effectively and knowing that you are not going to be able to have all mobs aggro’d to you. So you just start doing things like taunt one, disarm one, tab sunder spam, hamstring, demo shout, whatever you can to mitigate damage on pulls of 3 or more mobs. This can be fun but it is definitely exhausting because you will never have 100% threat all the time on more than 2 mobs.
---
I went full resto at 60, and went for the deep resto castor group build 0/5/46. 
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-shaman-pve-healing](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-shaman-pve-healing) 
---
As you said, I'll prob change once Phase 3 is out and we get PvP. 
---
But Healing way is great, 100% chance to inc the next healing wave by 6%. It last 15 secs, so you can even spam a few low level HWs to keep it ticking on the tank.
---
Plus everyone’s base 5% resist
---
I put the first 10 points into Spirit Tap and Wand Spec and then started down the Holy tree, targeting Searing Light and Spiritual Guidance. Then picked Spiritual Healing and put the rest of the points in Disc. Ended up with 14/32/5.
---
As long as you keep your wand up to date and prioritize spirit, this build is crazy efficient for solo grinding and questing. You're not the fastest killer out there but you rarely need to drink. Plus you can heal anything with this spec, including phase 1 raids.
---
Honestly, in my opinion, most people who are adamant about priests absolutely needing to respec shadow at 40 are just stuck in the 2005 mindset and have not ever tried this out.
---
If you want to focus on PvP and melt faces, than that's another story.
---
Best name i meet on my server was Benafflock
---
Time to reroll horde my friend
---
World of (Warcraft 3) episode 2
---
25% from racial. 5% base.
---
Why is it greedy if they are fine with others needing on BoE epics that were an upgrade for them as well? This way you avoid people ninjaing items or needing without equipping them
---
What do i know, i dont play warrior haha
---
I blame the shaman
---
I'm guessing you have purchased gold multiple times and have ignored at least one warning.
---
 [I was once caught, and only warned.](https://i.imgur.com/L8AQpqd.jpg)
---
Auctionator kind of ruined enchanting for that reason.  Everyone can see disenchant value easily now which is convenient as all hell, but also takes away any edge of tracking stuff yourself.  
---
I remember being able to make a bunch of gold back in og WoW by taking advantage of discrepancies between gear and mat values, but it's not worth it now.
---
And if it wasn’t satire, I’d agree with you. If it was a bunch of alt right or far left people getting together and spreading a political view or message, then I’d get it.
---
Nearly positive it is not possible, though I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone try, either.
---
You don't get either shamans or paladins depending on faction, so that's 3:3. Sure druids are more common as healers in raids, but for dungeons they're better off tanking because a healer with no rez is kinda risky.
---
What kind of world pvp do you plan on doing?
---
Depends on what your goals are.
---
Or we could be adults and be honest about what the word "greed" actually means and not try to rationalize our greed as "need".
---
Dude that is freaking awesome
---
I mean, unless he doesnt get caught.
---
Berserkering is the best threat gen racial if you have thunderfury.
---
Oh wow, Hunter's actually have good Tier Sets?!
---
Healadin or Warrior Tank are in the highest demand usually.
---
I think priests are really cool because they allow you to heal in PvE and Shadow Priest in PvP.
---
Going rate is 1K on my server. It will be a while before I get my pair.
---
If you want more threat you hit cap and pop MCP. Mark isn’t just BiS, it’s BiS by a country mile. BHB isn’t THAT much better than say rune of the guard captain, hoj, or counterattack lodestone
---
He talented it to 3.5 while it was on CD and thought it was clever that it kept the old CD (assuming) but as ppl pointed out it rounds up the numbers so the joke was ruined.
---
&gt;They blame the tank or healer when they die.
---
I play a lock. In this situation I say kick them.
---
That’s fake news. 
---
We don’t live in mudhuts!
---
Also I find that horde racials are more pvp oriented than the alliance one’s.
---
Besides High Warlord sounds better than Grand Marshal :)
---
You could actually go back a level in Everquest if you died just after leveling up. It was brutal.
---
20-25 hours of Mara farming.
---
Too bad you aren't on Rattlegore. My guild &lt;Zug Life&gt; would like to be to have you!
---
If you like killing mobs: try Hearthglenn. Lots of single/duo pulls and mobs deal less damage than in Tyr's Hand. If that is still too rough for your gear, try SM solo.
---
&gt;You guys realize it's a "This is offtopic/unrelated" button
---
Thats why I downvoted you
---
I used to frost nova and sheep peeps all day when they had low health - my way of healing them and ccing their mob for em.
---
Very few people ever understood what i was doing but i got a /thanks once and thats all ill ever need
---
Didn't know that was a mechanic, regardless though, with 3 people he stopped using MS all together, along with doing much less damage.
---
Most guilds won't let a hunter run 8pc t2 unfortunately so while it's technically better you can't use it 😭
---
*these* **PRETZELS** are making *ME* thirsty
---
Had the sash drop twice.  First time our awful warrior accidentally needed it, and the second time our level 50 priest that we were running through said he wasn't going to need it, and then of course he did when it dropped and won the roll.  I'm determined to get that shit when I get home from work today.  It's personal now.
---
Honestly, I'm glad to know I'm not alone. as a holy paladin, I thought mining would be the best way to get my epic mount, as i knew i want gonna be able to farm mobs for gold and that the Arcanite Bars was going to be the most expensive bit. but i have achieved a grand total of Zero Arcane crystals so far. 2 blue sapphires and fuck all else.
---
Or blizzard could stick with their current neutral stance and not try to determine the political leanings of a guild, or the sexual orientation of another.
---
Saves time, and Blizzard does not have to choose sides.
---
Everyone need on BoE's   is the one golden rule i go by when in group with randoms. In guild groups we need before greed as it was intended. 
---
BoE's dropping is RNG, we all contribute to it,i need it to equip it, you need it to fund buying the BoE from AH that you need and you equip that. All in all this clears up  any and all drama .
---
Druid... the least played class in Classic, great example.
---
Not enough frostbolt!!!
---
You are on the wrong side of the water my friend, literally :D Hop on the left ship and try again.
---
I’m mage so my trinket choices suck balls
---
I've been using recount since launch and I've never had an issue with it causing me to d/c. You sure it's not some other add-on you're using?
---
Um shadowbolt has no cooldown.
---
Kill elites inside dungeons, they give double experience.
---
Shift click the name of who whispers. It shows you their class. Then just don't invite. And about the "coming across like a jerk" you bother to put the group together so you make the rules. Anyone who has a problem can go make their own with their rules. If they are too lazy for that but still complain-learn2play
---
Stating what nobody seem to state..  
---
For Classic you also only need a subscription.  
---
You don't need to buy the retail version of the game.
---
Anyone have any good sources for min max information for priests? I've got handle on the basics (5 second rule, downranking), but was hoping for a place with much deeper info than the random guides
---
I'm ranking in phase 2/3, and I frequently pvp at all the various gold spots for dominance. Don't get me wrong I like pvp, but low lvl pvp is meh and it can cut off your leveling with griefing.
---
vip friend
---
Lbrs is definitely too high for a 52
---
Gold sellers.  You list a shit item on the AH for an obscene amount for the gold you just purchased.  They come and buy it and receive your money from the gold selling website.
---
70% uptime when hit once per second on average.  
---
90% uptime when hit twice per second on average.  
---
If you get hit 4 or 5 time per second the average uptime is very close to 100%.
---
Prices have tanked on my server for herbs and living essence. This is basically down to a 40ish per hour for me barring getting lucky on a book or epic. Maybe your servers herb prices have stayed high?
---
Good advice. Amazes me that people can still fall for this stuff in 2019 when there is usually some form of 2 way verification
---
Personally I only rolled a PVP server because all my friends did. I'm not against World PVP, but I hate that 99% of the time it's not even a remotely fair fight. It takes no skill to kill someone who's already fighting a mob, or to 3v1 someone, or to kill someone 10 or more levels below.
---
Yes and shows their Guild rank as well. Works opposite faction as well. Tiny tooltip i believe. You can also mouse over and see who they are targetting
---
Hey /u/XtremeOwnage are you playing Classic?? We rolled Alliance on Westfall if you want to join us.
---
Nope, there's a distinct difference between bops and boes, in that the value of bops can differ from player to player.  This is unlike boes which have the same value to every player.
---
*insert woman yelling at cat meme*
---
Where are you from? People in Britain say it. Only ever heard sassy girls say it though.
---
Google "get you wikionary" its the first or second result.
---
Why not just bring a Pala healer that can also LoH and BoP?
---
Since I am not a rogue I need to be an engineer or blacksmith to open the door, right? If I am neither of those I cannot possibly complete a solo tribute run, correct? Just curious, never tried it before, but I'd like to when I ding 60. 
---
But I could kill one boss and get the chest with just 2 items, right?
---
Bubble bastards
---
In my guild a rogue named "Sethroguen" was the best name I have ever seen until now :D
---
Possibly stupid to ask this but what's possible is: do you kill the last boss? Some groups I've seen kill the mage boss because they don't know he counts as well. You should keep that one alive and only kill the king.
---
Where do i find that? I dont have a threat option, only ressources, heal or damage and then different variations. Cant find anything in the options or as a separate addon and googling turns up nothing other than that it should be included but not where to actually find or activate it...
---
There's a dude in my guild that, for some reason, is doing a mob only grind. I pray for his mental health.
---
"average people" go fuck yourself and your holier-than-thou bullshit personality.
---
Agreed.
---
Your friend can't see the forest for the trees. So many good pieces of gear, so many upgrades...but he won't be able to enjoy the dopamine until he gets a specific piece that some excel wizard decided was best.
---
...but hey, if that's the game he wants to play, that's his prerogative!
---
Yeah new abilities making poisons a big part of your dps. Hell in vanilla there are tactics where you use shadow oil instead of posions because it's better, although a lot more expensive.
---
You shouldn't get banned for anything that can be done via a macro or addon. It's not hard to clear AFK status with addon actions, but that doesn't really do anything and eventually the game will disconnect you anyway.
---
that's a rare epic drop right? might be harder getting that than just farming a reaper.
---
Lol, you pulled the "I just don't care anymore" but here you are replying. You basically said the same exact words I said to you, because it was the right thing to say and you cannot come up with anything original to say on your own. Then you talk about how editing my comment makes me a kid, then you edit your comment! Hilarious. Notice how I never personally attacked you in any way, but you are quick to call me names and make fun of my life and my hobbies. I think we both know who is the more happy person here.
---
Shift click their name and just dont invite instead of putting that in lfg. Also you gotta realize, hoes just mad cause they hoes. Actual good players dont bother whispering the leader of a grp they know they have 0 chance of getting into
---
Reposter zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
"Name one small detail that retail got right"  
---
    
---
Proceeds to list huge, gamechanging changes.  
---
Lol.
---
Bro gold farmers probably make up at least %10 of WoW subs so they have to turn a blind eye to this and other sketch practices they know is going on or else they’ll lose %10 profits.
---
this true? they dont fight back?
---
Mudhuts are OP for pvp
---
if your horde.....go open the crab pots off desolace coast (shadowprey village). there is a repeatable quest there for 5x shellfish for 55silver per turn in. Spending an hour grinding on the mobs and opening the crab pots can get you easily 15-20g an hour here. Mobs are all 33-35 level so easy to kill at level 38 and you get good xp still.  
---
Can get busy, so early morning / late at night works well.
---
With how fast fights are crit and int are actually good, T1 5 set 2 T2 is generally bis. Individually the tier gear isn't as good as most alternatives but the 3 set is very good (it's like what, 8% extra output with how we heal MC?).
---
Special mentions, exalted herald gloves, whipvine chord, the DM pants from hunter n bear boss, forgot it's name but it's basically T2.
---
Basically the tier belt is one of the better tier pieces so you take the non tier in other slots until you get the 5 pieces.
---
Their group is some combination of: Warlock, Shadow Priest, Feral Druid, Elemental Shaman, MS warrior. My bet would be Warlock, SPriest, MS Warrior.
---
Can I ask you why? I tried lock many times before but somehow the fun just seems to fade away.
---
Nothing compared to being eaten by an undead
---
What game have you played where the standard etiquette is to share profit between group? Doesn’t that rely on a lot of trust if you’re in a random group?
---
Mara also has segments.
---
Orange, Purple, and Princess.
---
Orange and Purple have separate entrances, while Princess can be done after Purple or with an item from a quest.
---
It's almost as if it is a divisive issue, without any absolute consensus.
---
Because best progression guilds usually play on PvP realms.
---
I feel this on a personal level.
---
I've got a 43 rogue, 26 warrior, 27 warlock, 21 druid, 20 mage, and more. 
---
Just can't make up my mind.
---
What's the answer as a warrior ? 
---
Same ?
---
Check to see if you have sync on
---
Those locks are retards, let them die, laugh at them nothing really help. Dont generalize all locks.
---
I can’t comment on paladin since i nvr played alliance. I love enhancement shamans. Maybe it’s not the case at end game but in zf, ulda, sm cath, i have enhancement shaman in my group top meters all the time, and they can interrupt spell cast, put down totems, rez, etc, love them. I’m a warrior tank, to me best dungeon group is mage (cc, aoe, water), combat rogue (amazing dps, cc),  enhancement shaman, and priest healer...i had this group in a sm cath run, things just melt
---
Yeah, that and the relative rarity of the drop. I’ve been doing MC for 6 weeks and this belt has only dropped once.
---
Sounds like our MT yes...
---
Nah, just a blue
---
I live in Zug myself...
---
I just put on block chat group invite in the standard interface setting.
---
furor is a talent in the first tier of resto, at 5 points, it grants energy/rage when you change into cat/bear. if you make a macro that is just
---
`/cast Cat Form`
---
then when you use it in cat form, you re-shift into a cat. It seems useless at first since you will just lose all energy, but with furor, you shift to 40 energy, regardless of what it was before. This lets you unload all your energy, shift to get 40 energy, and unload again. Try to shift just before the energy regen tick to get 60 energy per shift. This method is known as powershifting, and its only as good as your mana holds out.
---
Wolfshead helm is a leather helm that has a similar effect to furor.
---
In the center of stv there are the Jungle thunderers which are 38-39. The grays drop often and the gph was nice, I used this spot at 39 to get the rest of my mount $
---
What should I have said instead? "The majority of people?", "Most people in the world?". Fucking tell me or stop complaining. I am really trying here and all I get is shit from "average people like you". You only hear what you want to hear. You think the whole world is against you and you automatically hate everybody else that is more successful, wise, rich, famous or whatever than you.
---
This is a place where people try to help each other and in case you are new here: many people are not native speakers and you will need some creativity when reading and interpreting their messages.
---
Feel free to pm me your paypal email address, so I can forward my next donation to you along with some screenshots of people who understand what I am saying.
---
I don’t think you can can have opposing faction toons on the same server in current  Vanilla.
---
LMFAO. I was just thinking that
---
Right click the carcass. Gamers today are weak, they don't try shit, they just expected it to be handed to them.
---
Yeah I don't understand that. There used to be like 8 of them for that server, I think most of them are dead now, besides those three.
---
It's sad to see, but in this case you could just announce "LFM 2 dps" and then cherry pick from those who answer the call.
---
Yes, my first hit on google was TipTac, seems to fufill that need.
---
no, we just type /cast conjure mana biscuit
---
Yetis in Winterspring are nice, with skinning. Close to town, feel like medium/low hp and the cave has a huge respawn area of them. 
---
I'd consider getting timbermaw rep while grinding too, two birds with one stone, but might find those areas contested.
---
What kills me is that he was lf a healer, but wanted to reserve Truefaith. Like bruh, that's why you can't find a healer.
---
You could download Dejamark addon for marking targets. Its alot easier- I press F and icons will show up around my cursor. 
---
I’d recommend that you know where to go, no matter what lvl you are— after 2 or 3 runs you should be fine. 
---
You can let every1 know that ur new, and you’ll be surprised. Many ppl I played with are pretty chill. 
---
Low lvl dungeons tend to be more straightforward- higher lvl dungeons have shortcuts/route that you need to take.
---
its pretty godlike for hemo because of its speed. but thats about it
---
I've been raiding for years, been in many guilds, tried all sorts of loot systems. You wanna know how many times I've seen a non-corrupt loot council? Once. One time. In every other instance, they were favouring people in their clique or just taking gear "because i deserve it".
---
DKP makes the most sense to me. I'd even prefer open rolls over loot council. I won't join a loot council guild on classic the same I stopped doing it on retail when master loot was still a thing.
---
I havent hit end game current lvl 44, im a tank. I love enhancement shaman with ravager. They top meters all the time in dungeons like zf, uldaman, sm, etc
---
Just delete your hearthstone and you get teleported to westfall if using the unstuck feature.
---
I got my caster sash on run 45 -\_\_-
---
Finding you zen and having a specific mentality makes this game much more enjoyable.  Reading the quests and treating them as something fun you get to do rather than as part of the grind is important.  Then when you are high enough level to do a new instance it's like a little treat. I like to think "Oh now I can run this a few times and enjoy clearing it with different group comps and meet some new people."  Then you grind out a few levels doing the instance and you can go into your next zone a little more geared and a little higher level and cruise through the quests, which in turn makes it an easier and a more enjoyable experience. 
---
Getting ganked sucks, running out of quests sucks, but as long as you are enjoying playing your class you can usually find something productive to do.
---
It's gnome or gnothing
---
Yeah, this one has more members so is probably the "official" one for now.
---
You're forgetting the 5/8 set bonus.
---
30-45M~ a year for a decade+ long established IP vs 70M+ in 3 months of a new, less popular mobile MMO game.
---
Subscriptions don't make blizzard money any more, why do you think they so heavily monetize and merchandise retail and their other IP? People would lose their shit if a cash shop was ever added to Classic so they can't ramp up the monetization and the classic player base is going to dwindle (not to mention it's linked directly with retail).
---
You don't know how much time and resources they spent on developing the BFA client to support Classic; the salaries of the devs, support staff, marketing, servers, etc.
---
Classic is a success and they might have made profit; but we won't know for sure without hard numbers (which are obfuscated by retail sub count). At the end of the day I doubt the shareholders or powers that be will care for Classic because they only care about growth and Classic has no growth.
---
Classic is and will always be a PR move and nothing more to activsion.
---
As a new tank your first goal is to learn to mark quickly and let people know you're new to it. 
---
Start off by as you said, hotting yourself for aggro, charge (if talented) enrage, maul skull, swipe swipe. Keep focus on skull until you feel comfy then move to X. 
---
If you're SUPER anxious about it, use CV as much as you can and take it a little slow, but not snail pace. 
---
Download Threat Panels too. It replaces the name plates on mobs with plates that get bigger as you get threat. It really helps
---
It had agility and strength. So I've been valuing them at the same, so I thought that since agility + strength was higher it might be better
---
If you need on boe item, people expect you to equip them, so no selling for lots of gold anymore.
---
And yes, that’s what rolling greed means, you want gold instead of the item. If you feel bad about winning something valuable, you can always spread your fortune a bid, in fact most lucky guys I‘ve met in the past have done so.
---
Do Alliance-heavy PvP servers even exist?
---
Oh nice that one is more active, added!
---
because for some people "doin well" doesnt mean goin one optimized way but playing whatever they enjoy as long as they achieve their goals
---
I'd rather play with a subpar dps who's having fun and sharing it with the party then your regular stickass veteran who "actually knows how to play" and is silent at best, condescending at worse during the whole run
---
To every people who wanna nitpick on party composition, describe what you're looking for exactly beforehand or bring your personnal crew

---
Blacksmithing makes you almost no gold unless you get to 300 and have hard to get recipes.  I'm leveling it because I want an arc reaper with the inscription &lt;Made by G09G&gt; but for the most part it just isnt worth it.  275-300 costs like ~450 thorium bars, which alone makes it not worth it.
---
did he use pot in a duel?
---
You are missing the point. You can still do all the content very well without min maxing. The whole game right now is - stand where people tell you and do atleast more dps than the tank and you will down everything in no time.
---
If that isnt happening- it isnt becuase a couple dps are "memes" - saying that in the first place is a meme.
---
No, other players can't take it.
---
Oh oops I mixed up the boss with Isha awak lol, I did this one actually hahaha
---
It gets you just as far as everyone else, just takes a little more time. 
---
I don’t know why everyone feels the need to rush.
---
Coward! :D
---
What happens if those gankers turn on you next because (insert random reason here)? Then you'd wish you fought with them to make it an even battle.
---
Yeah. Exclamation mark in front means you don't cancel the previous one before casting the new one.
---
I play druid and some dude got annoyed when I joined an SM group, he wanted a faster clear and didnt think I could do the DPS (normally I just tank but the group had one). I told him I'm the failsafe, might cost us 5 more minutes but wiping would take a whole lot longer. People are so impatient rn
---
Cry’s in warrior
---
I tanked ZF as a level 43 Druid with mostly AH bought gear around level 37.
---
I took the role seeing the same *LF Tank ZF* for a while but I asked what level is acceptable since it has been a while since I was in ZF and honestly did not know.  The healer was a 43 shaman.  Mobs were tough to begin with and we wiped on the first boss twice.  It was soul crushing.  I almost was going to say I would not be mad if they found another tank.  It was hard keeping aggro since I was missing hits and growl would resist more often as well.
---
Luckily the party was great, I popped some buffs from potions and the apple buff from the buckets at the inns and we made it by better thinking through a plan and executing.  The rest of the dungeon was easy but boy did I feel bad about my tanking.  I dinged 44 at the very end and it got a little easier.  I was appreciated for them putting up with the those two initial and only wipes.
---
that surprised me as well...how the fuck can they own eu-blizzard. That's almost like the official site. Why doesn't Blizzard own most of these variants?
---
Or maybe the base game without any addons should be enjoyable and we don't force people to use addons to make use of an important part of the game? 
---
For a single player, your answer is correct. From the developer perspective, if an addon feature has such massive impact on the experience of people not using the addon, then maybe either the functions of the addon need to be part of the base game or these API functionalities need to be disabled.
---
Notice Rogues are "And more." I see you blizzard, I see you.
---
Of course he's a mage.
---
A month is way far from being a good source to base a server choice on
---
Searing gorge, shit ton of quests there
---
Why is the first question's maximum 25+ hours? Do any of you even PLAY?
---
Wut?
---
I also just started tanking on my Druid alt!
---
I find that with rejuv and thorns up, using your demoralizing shout ability for each pack and tab targeting mauls I haven’t had an issue with threat. 
---
If I lose aggro on a mob I just grab it with a growl, mail it once or twice and it’s mine.
---
Currently I’m only level 19 but I’ve ran Rfc a few times without issue.
---
Deathbringer MH by a mile.
---
I actually rolled an Undead Rogue last week since my main is almost 40 and I didn't have an alt yet.  He's still sitting at lvl 4, but he'll be getting more play time very soon.
---
Bliz flags accounts that send a lot of money like that. Sending a consistent amount of money from the same IP to different tunes on the same IP? Not suspicious. 
---
Sending and receiving a fuck load of money and sending it to a bunch of tunes while also buying AH crap way over priced? Probably a gold seller.
---
I just want to level. I want to grind or quest and don’t give a shit.  I’ll try to be nice with alliance.  But you attack me I gank your ass every time I see you and if you and your buddies buddies multi kill me Ill corpse camp you give the opportunity which tends to happen because you us sally pissed off the zone.
---
I cant say much to druid tanking itself (I'm a warrior) but I will say that telling your group you are new to this will do much more help than harm. People will be less likely to rage at you for messing up and will most likely give you pointers and teach you along the way. Good luck!
---
I'd rather noone have it that you taking it from me to sell.
---
Transmog in the current wow expansion is a system in which the players can override the look of their gear with other looks, you can do this to essentially let your gear match up to look better.
---
In classic the transmog system doesn't exist but I am using it in the context for essentially another set of gear you could use to not have mismatched gear so you look better, usually used in cities where the lack of stats don't really mean anything.
---
Transmog gear is any gear that anyone might enjoy the look of, but it might not have any real stats that you could use it in combat or otherwise.
---
Many dungeons have unique looking sets or gear that comes specifically from them. Also greens in certain level ranges might share set names and can be used as a matching set usually sharing colors and are designed to match. There isn't some specific way they appear differently but everyone has their tastes in looks.
---
&gt; Rogues will be rogues, but at least they aren’t thieves.
---
Sounds like you have a rough life
---
I feral tanked the whole way to 60 and just started tanking 10mans. 
---
The most likely reason you think tanks know where to go is because they are running each dungeon multiple times. The last time I did these dungeons was back in vanilla so the first few runs I never knew where to go. Don’t be afraid to ask, groups will get a lot more annoyed if you are tanking the wrong direction opposed to asking. 
---
It sounds like you’ve got the rotation down. Pre-hot
---
Demo roar
---
Maul
---
In classic swipe only hits 3 targets and for pretty low damage so it should only be used as a rage dump. Almost all of your threat comes from maul. Druids struggle with aoe tanking so if you’re losing aggro on 3+ pulls don’t feel disheartened, it’s just not what we were made for.
---
If you want an amazing reference to go to for all things feral tanking check out Skarm on YouTube.
---
The anti-dagger meta is too strong. imo it's just not a fun playstyle outside of pvp, and ehh, you don't need corehound gloves for pvp.
---

Epic rap battle of azeroth?
---
You know... I never thought of that either. Good lord I'm losing it!
---
There's a fucked up i in it, look at the dot 
---
I agree though they autoban things like "Ipooped" then let a few similar variations of blizzard stay?
---
They are on low end for healing in classic, but still great. Every raid takes resto druids with different specs aswell. Play what you want to play. Resto druid is great, dont let you tell otherwise. You will get spots.
---
Spam arena + angerforge runs for your chest and hoj. If you don't, you'll need to spam them at 60 anyway.
---
Was this within the last 2 weeks or so? Lost rigger cove was full of horde and every time an alliance player tried to peacefully quest there we got instantly ganged up on, so I started posting in general chat that we should just all group up and clear the horde out so we can do our quest and leave. That's exactly what we did, we rolled through and purged the Horde filth and did our quests then split up and abandoned the area again haha.
---
I've gone there to AoE grind a few times and I do the same thing every time, get a group together and clear the area then AoE grind for a while until the horde take it back
---
I've only done like 5 dungeons. Only criticized one tank so far. Only NEEDED to criticize one.
---
Look, 2h ww tanking is okay. Just let me get my mana. Don't both do ww tanking and leave me oom and pull 2 rooms away with me at 40% mana
---
Please share what map related addons you use.
---
Well there's no better resource as we no longer have any server population data.
---
I have auctionator and have been scanning but not long enough to get any data on these items.
---
Don’t stress mate, that bloke seems like an absolute flog.
---
you and everyone else. Just wait until 2 months after BGs.... then people will pay $$ and stock will be way down.
---
DPS race has been around since Vanilla... well... okie it was retail at the time... but still.
---
Whoa dude are you okay?
---
Nah, just join and ask for a summon then decline the summon and leave the group
---
While I agree, and have no problems taking spriests/ret palas/feral dps, the issue that usually arises is they also want to compete with the tank or healer (or both) on drops. Even when it's obviously their offspec. Or the tank wants to pick up plate dps gear on the side. 
---
None of it is 'fair', but the reason a lot of people skip hybrids is the loot issue rather than not understanding that hybrids bring plenty of utility to make up for dpa
---
It’s still early. It’s in more demand right now.
---
As a hunter I'm used to joining wary groups.  I usually break the ice with "Hey, all.  Before you ask, growl is off and the pet stays on passive."  Typical tank response has been "Cool.  I don't fight pets for aggro."  It's never been a problem.  
---
Now I *will* use growl unprompted if something is chewing on the healer, but that's about it.
---
I'm a firm believer that aggro is everyone's responsibility.
---
Ehhh prolly same guy but had a name change  [https://i.imgur.com/OAfBCju.png](https://i.imgur.com/OAfBCju.png)
---
at which level did you start with it? tried with level 36 on my rogue to do that but seemed too low?
---
If you think ally stealthies aren't going to ruin the torny you haven't seen the alliance trolls yet
---
You want to be with in about 3 levels of the last boss or you won't be able to hold aggro during the fight from all your missed atks.
---
Marking really dose help things run smoother if the dps follows the kill order.
---
Here are some resources i've been using and ive been posting them for other people.
---
[Classic WoW Tanking and Threat Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOGCaOhCZvo) this is a good start to understand threat.
---
[So you want to Tank in Classic WoW? How to DOMINATE as a Tank in Vanilla.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04cVuaOsEjo) this talks about skills and and tips.
---
[Skarm Tank](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ/featured) has some good gearing tips and more strategies on tanking as druid, warrior or a paladin.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/scarlet-monastery-classic-dungeon](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/scarlet-monastery-classic-dungeon) This is a mega guide that links to info about every dungeon and tells you the mobs to look out for and what the bosses do.
---
It's a little more work but you could just be honest. As a warrior myself, if I can chill as dps and not have to tank I prolly won't roll on whatever item you are looking for it you let me know before we start.
---
We're not in P2, we just got Dire Maul. PvP system and other P2 changes are still unavailable.
---
That said, thanks for the info!
---
&gt; Also you can comfortably keep aggro on multiple mobs. 
---
You really can't with any decent dps. Warrior AoE threat is garbage.
---
my face has bondage straps going over it, which is visible even with a helmet.
---
I like this. Can this be a new classic meme template?
---
you can't even on a pve server?
---
Loading paladin hoping it would be what it was lmao
---
Nahh pun names are freaking lame.
---
Give it to Mikey, the fury warrior, he'll wear anything
---
nice!
---
Dude 💯 I go out of my way all the time to acknowledge decent, sensible mages. Not excluding other classes but good mages are such a boon.
---
Lmfao why do people who get banned post like jezz i just got banned they said i bought gold and i obvs did so let me show the world what a loser i am.
---
That's why they only ban the sellers or the player if it catches any sort of attention, but that rarely happens.
---
That would instantly solve the issue, brilliant idea.
---
Alas, am warrior. Also wanted to combine with Gladiator farm.
---
How do you think that? Maybe in squeaking out every possible ounce of dps, but that is more on knowing your rotations. The only other thing you do as dps is play around fight mechanics, which everyone has to do. Healing you have to be on your toes.
---
Probably not worth it. If your opponent has less than 100 resistances (which is usually the case even with T1 gear), you will only see a small decrease in damage taken.
---
However, if your target is in the 100-150 resitances range already, you will need at least 1% additional hit chance to guarantee your spells landing.
---
The only thing holy has that ret does not is possibly kings (which is in prot tree) and shorter cd bop/loh. All pallies get them and if you need it more than 5min/60 min there are other problems.
---
If the person sees the money and contacts a GM immediately no, it's when they take it and start spending it on shit that it's a problem and can get you banned. No different than real world currency, you check your bank account and suddenly have 50k more than you should and report it immediately? You're golden. Spend it? You're fucked
---
People don't read quest text. They run to the dot on the map and start killing things until the quest completes.
---
Personally, I think they should be punished for this occasionally.
---
Read your quest text. Every time. Every word. The game's story is told through the quests and the quest text plays a large part in that.
---
I tried that for like 4 levels then lost my mind. Stopped AOE grinding and hit quests.
---
Skin it!!
---
Love my boar. Good utility and tanky. Had him since level 30 and I have even used him in raids. Best part is that he eats ANYTHING (even mage food - LPT). I never spend money to feed him.
---
I definitely get not putting a certain healer on certain groups explicitly, but it baffles me that they wont even do priorities.  At this point its just playing whack-a-mole across 7 parties trying to hit someone that isnt already getting a heal.
---
Its the same thing with dispels and its getting really fucking annoying.
---
I am trying to figure out if I should go Goblin or Gnomish Engi on my lock. When 60 and pvp comes out, this is where most of my time will be spend. What are the biggest pro's and cons in this situation?
---
I've gone full resto since i hit 60 but man... my WF procs in dungeons were nuts, questing? Didn't get shit.
---
Now DPS beg me for that meaty WF totem though.
---
Honestly though, even when i was leveling totems were just nuts.
---
Rez, Buffs, Offhealing, Dispelling, Freedom, Lay on Hands, are prio to me as a ret in any group. The auto attacking is meh, but SoComm procs are a lot of fun. If a ret pal is playing like a mana warrior and ignoring utility, then bad pally is bad.
---
Blizzard told me that naming your character after 'real life personalities' was against the rules -.- so now I'm beefysmalls
---
My realm isn’t even on there.
---
He enjoys pvp like most rogues do.  Was he's the luffa for duels againts rogues
---
Chill out, I referred to it as green to differentiate it from the others and forgot the name.  Also Mark of the chosen is green, and proc can have 100% up time so I'll flex those rules while getting hit.
---
Won't happen in raid.  But if you're talking feral and telling me you don't want the BWL trinket alongside an AP (of which you mentioned one) trinket then you're not power shifting enough to be competitive.  Druids basically have to farm gnomer for a crappy 2 handed mace, wear a lvl 40 helmet with like 3 spirit and BHB is the hill you're dying on over crit? There are far more serious implications to the gear you're building.
---
If everyone agrees then sure, that's totally different. But you're still as a group screwing over the person(s) who actually want to equip the item because you are all greedy and want gold.
---
With that amount of exp per hour, he is doing 4 mages 1priest strategy. Every mage pulls twice with ice block. If executed right, you don't need healer at all. So 52 in that case is really enough. Also he blocked you, so he don't bother you again in future.
---
People pulling aggro doesn't trigger me anymore. People who don't drink when they leave combat on the other hand...
---
and some of the best healing in the game
---
??????
---
I really do get it. I’ve been tanking for my entire leveling experience lol.
---
honestly a hunter rolling on rend MH would make me delete wow...
---
In classic you also have a second best, therefore you dont *need* the very best. Can't afford Truefaith Vestment? Get hold of Robes of the Exalted. 
---
Can't cough up the 1200g for Lionheart (it was this expensive four weeks ago), get yourself Mask of the Unforgiven. 
---
If you can't afford something start farming or settle for a slightly worse alternative. Nobody holds a gun to your head and tells you to acquire this ultra rare item.
---
It really ruins the experience for me on the economy side. I haven't played much on the new expansions, but back in BC it took me a while until I got used to the AH, and started pricing things appropriately. Made quite a few mistakes along the way losing out on a bunch of Gold, but it was fun when you hit it big. Now, AH is just another Vendor with a fee, sad.
---
typically it is courteous to make sure you aren't knowingly shafting someone for whom it is a huge/BiS upgrade if it is just a small upgrade for you or you don't mind not having it that much
---
Seriously. Without that trinket the grind will be *even slower*.
---
Yeah. I've had rogues apologize for multiple crits. And there is a point where even single-target a tank is just helpless against the RNG. But by-and-large threat is a mechanic that people should learn.    
---
If the DPS takes aggro during a pull due to a critstreak. Shit happens. Sometimes even with feign-death/fade/vanish/etc you're not gonna dump shit in time.    
---
     
---
My post was about the idiots that start full on DPS before the tank has established even a first hit let alone initial threat. Those get to die.
---
"LF Healer and 2 Ranged/Caster DPS for 'x'"
---
And DPS Warrior exclusion seems to be the norm whether it is overtly stated in your message or by purposeful exclusion before party invites.
---
That's not even the best gold spot in shimmering flats...
---
Dont roll need on a BoE, people need that gold for mounts and training.
---
My friend did this to me. Yes you are the asshole.
---
As a warrior tank, I typically try to bring Cloth, Leather, and Hunter/Shaman DPS. 
---
That way if something drops, there is typically someone who can use it, and no one is really in competition (except maybe Cloth DPS and Healer) with loot.
---
Yeah the defensive support class needs someone to support, the offensive support class can still smash people without someone else to support.
---
I’m pretty geared, but as far as I’m concerned tank makes the rules (short of trying to reserve all of the goddamn orbs in which case go fuck yourself), so if you don like how fast DPS is engaging, say “hold off a few seconds for threat please” and conversely, I’ve had tanks upset DPS was waiting to long in which case you can say “come on guys...hit it like you mean....now hit it very hard...and very fast”. If you want a target dead hit it with a skull. If someone is hitting the wrong target, “guys, skull first, then X just like your IQ was normal” if you want something CCd, assign a marker, do not say “kill wizards first” my exp tanking tells me that either takes too long or requires too many brain cells so use markers
---
Anyone going sideways gets a warning TO THE GROUP CHAT so everyone can see why some is getting kicked or pissing you off.
---
If something goes well on a pull, say “great job “.  If not, something like, “hey guys we need to make sure we are focusing the assassins in the pack first”
---
Again - I want the tank comfortable and I sometimes can’t do that without feedback, most of the time I can. Just depends on the group and the instance
---
Kappa
---
Kinda hard when our group was 2 rogues and 1 shammy for DPS :P
---
Well, there is no other class, that can pull this off. Of course it's a mage.
---
I saw someone spamming for a low lvl dungeon (I can't remember which, honestly) and responded with my 22 mage. He replied *that's 24-30, sorry mate*. No, Atlasloot shows it as 22-30 and the first blue BOP drop is lvl 18. Drives me crazy.
---
Comparing an MMORPG that instinctually promotes community play to a single player game. Good one. With that said, you're free to do what you want in your groups
---
I havent tanked a classic dungeon since 2007, so I explicitely tell them at the start: hey look I can't remember shit in here, just tell me if I'm heading the wrong way. I've yet to find a group who complains.
---
Transmuting arcanite bars is 5-10g for you right there. Not alot but really easy cash.
---
Leadership, in this case, should be in heavy quotations.
---
I can't tell if genius or cringe.
---
Wow, this is really good! Seriously💥
---
You can say, "full on melee, looking for caster or aoe DPS"
---
Its a less dickish way to say it.
---
You could also just let the guy know that you're in the instance for X item and see if hes cool with it.
---
Are you me? That's exactly what I do.
---
It's only ninjaing if it is against agreed upon loot rules. It's just the simplest way of guaranteeing that nobody can get screwed
---
When you’re leveling as a tank your best way to keep aggro is with a 2H so you don’t need to be being hit to generate rage.
---
Alliance be so hurt by a simple F U. Oof
---
IDK I never played private servers but we still get all the loot and have never used the suit or trap.
---
Sorry full on insert class friend sorry.
---
Swipe doesn't eat an auto attack while maul does.  You make it sound like swipe shouldn't be used and you should just maul each target but that's not true you should definitely be swiping if you have 3+ targets.
---
I actually found out that I can play as badly as I want and if I'm the tank, no one cares. Seriously. I always try my best but even so, I feel my own deficiencies. And yet, nothing but gratitude. I love being the meat!!
---
That's actually the name of my bank alt making crazy money :D
---
I think UC is underrated. TB doesn't have a zep, UC has the bank, fp, ah and mailbox close to each other. And it's on the same continent as BRM, the primary raid destination for the first few phases.
---
It definitely has been around from the jump. It's just different/more frequent now for everyone to try to minmax. I get it in raids but a lot of dudes don't realize how much more stressful they make 5 mans by trying to flex their epeen
---
Dreamweave circlet wins by a mile. Spell damage and Spirit is all you care about while leveling and starting into late game content. Dreamweave Circlet has more of both.
---
Thank goodness they're not mutually exclusive.  Play how you want people! I'm just reminding you of two things:
---
Blizzard fucked up druid itemization. Bad.
---
Mark of tyranny and smoking heart of the mountain are it.  You need to off tank? You'll never be as good as you could have been.
---
Huge,  HUGE difference in money making ability in "mid-40's" and "Below 40." That's why most players take 40-45 levels to get their first 100g, but often get to 100g again within a few levels after.
---
Are you actually hating on someone for trying to play the game as well as they can over looking like the class fantasy? 
---
Nobody has a monopoly on the 'right' way to play, and while there are plenty of issues with bis lists being misunderstood, they're a very solid starting place for people who enjoy maximising their capability on the character they play.
---
Can elvui hide the chat tabs? If not prat could replace that part.
---
Had a ZF group with a tank farming that shit and his 2 warrior friends, and the healer was another shammy. Holy fuck. Me and the other shaman discussed who would get what totem so me and the other 2 dps had *everything* They both had whirlwind axe to boot. It was crazy.
---
And now i've got a perma spot in raid because totems/nutty chain heals.
---
Yes, it is good right now. Once you have tank healers set in stone it becomes less important if you are just spamming chain heal.
---
Focus your gear stats on agility and stamina. Agility increases your armor and dodge chance. Also increases your critical strike chance which will help you hold aggro. 
---
You don’t need to know the dungeons well. I usually ask someone for directions if I don’t know it. It’s best if you pull, not someone else. Until you get feral frarie Fire, just moonfire, cast rejuvenation on yourself and jump into bear form. Demo roar creates a little bit of threat but Maul and of course your main taunts growl ( Or whatever it’s called) will be your main ways of holding threat. Use your rage for maul. 
---
Druid tanks aren’t great at holding aggro on multiple mobs. So it’s best to mark each group of mobs with skull, X, moon, etc. because then your group will focus dps on one target at a time and you can just keep mauling them and growl if you need to. If you lose aggro on a group of 3-4 mobs then good luck getting it back at low levels. That’s why it’s best if YOU pull the mobs and single target the skull and x.
---
I hope you rolled Tauren because they have a great Ace up the sleeve called Warstomp. I created a macro for emergency healing while in bear form or any form: 
---
/cancel form
---
/cast Warstomp
---
/cast Regrowth
---
I found that Thorium Grenades are ridiculously expensive. I will definately settle for iron grenades.
---
Yep, as a shadow priest I eat warriors as breakfast (or any other class, except druids).
---
How long do you think I need? Maybe this whole flame war is just a misunderstanding.
---
Let me get a maul in, at least. If I crit that first maul I usually have the mob locked on me for the whole fight without issues.
---
And let me move the mob group to a safer place if needed. Most wipes happen when a new group aggros mid fight, due to a runner or patrol.
---
It's about minimising risk. The DPS won't be much lower.
---
OP, since you asked about etiquette, you can follow this method but it’s advised that you respond to people when they whisper you. I’ve always felt that it’s rude when people say LF1M Dps and when I whisper them they don’t respond. Sure, they probably already have a hunter, but it’s common courtesy to tell people.
---
Feral Druids - Is it a dps loss to refresh Rake on a target before the dot has finished ticking? I'm just leveling so it doesn't particularly matter but I've been curious. Thanks
---
All the feral tanks in the progression minded raiding guilds will want one. All six of them.
---
I bought mine for 150g FWIW
---
Unless I'm misunderstanding something about the combat log/cast bar addons, then yes it should.
---
It's way fucking better than trash blade dude. It's way better than Rends.
---
You’re going to suck 1v1 regardless so I say yes
---
Nah, I was about to re-up my sub, until blizzard started pulling all of the shit with the honk-kong protestors. I was just stalking you from r/nocwatch
---
with prat you can make them hide until mouse over ... helps clean up things a bit ... awesome job tho, v impressed :)
---
Only go for  Archivist cape  when you get all you're pre raid bis and run Strat live for gold(orbs) its the same thing with the skul wand. Go for bone creeper and get skul later on.
---
until you run into a purgespamdelete elesham with a warrior friend
---
Said like a true SJW
---
Yeah. Tank pulls, and get first hit. 
---
If yall don't like it, I'm sure spamming LFM Tank for an hour will be faster. /s
---
Yeah it’s not horrible, just wild that raid gear isn’t dropping optimal stat set ups.
---
In that situation, what is the reason I am accompanying this fine group of random individuals on their perilous journey into a dungeon?
---
&gt;I used to transfer gold *in mists*
---
This is truly something. I do not know why I watched it for 11 minutes and then proceeded to watch 3 more episodes, but it's mesmerisingly entertaining.
---
It reminds me of Weregonnalose.
---
Smh the people who are commenting not worth it probably don’t even have their epic mount yet.
---
What was your class?
---
I'll check it out, thanks!
---
Not supposed to be available until phase 4
---
It's not necessarily bad. I just really dislike it. Half the zone is underground so getting around is more difficult than other zones. Also, there's these dudes called "slave miners" or something like that and, like other mobs, when you get them to low health they run to get help. Well these guys full on SPRINT off and pull 3 more
---
Really the zone is fine. I just curse it cause I had many troubles there haha
---
The witch doctor's cane in ZF.
---
Anybody recommend a good 31/0/20 build for leveling?
---
Certain demons in there have super high resist and don't enslave well.   Stick to Betrayers, Shadowstalkers, and Hellcallers.
---
If you're refering to the gold/hr rate then I can tell you this there's no sub lvl 40 farm that could get you more than 5-7g/hr. That said, the jaguar grind is still probably one of the best that you can do to level up.
---
If you're goal is to look for a 15-20g/hr grind at lvl 38 I can confidently tell you that it doesn't exist unless you're EXTREMELY lucky which if you are then stop playing classic and buy the powerball.
---
Dumbass can’t even screenshot and I’m suppose to fear you?
---
Hey, thanks man! I really appreciate it!
---
What’s up with this all of the sudden? I play a 57 war in incendious and last night got 2 random whispers asking to tank LBRS runs farming staying the 115k exp hour deal.
---
Really .... So from 50+  if they do that they die. With most engages let the tank get rage or wipe. If the tank has rage u van go ham. 
---
But just saying they have to burst, when tank  has no rage and battle rage is on cd because a pack goes down in 30sec. Leaving the tank with out means to keep aggro after 20 sec. 
---
I find it funny that the same ppl who cry mb are saying tanks can't pace themselves.
---
Thanks all! Some great advice, I feel a bit stalled right now, but I will get it done!
---
lmao fr, now no need to worry about gold again!
---
Questie + Baganon addons really helps prevent you from falling into that issues. Quest lets you know how many you need and baganon tells you where they are.
---
Even with it checked you still receive the message to say that someone has invited you and that it was blocked!
---
Is the viewpoint just zoomed out normally?
---
Bad warrior is bad.. and ignorant
---
There really isn't much of that happening right now though, and we're a long way off from pvp rewards, so you'll be fighting people with blues and purples in your greens and BoE blues.
---
Without fear ward you and your allies will know fear too
---
What're the Spanish realm names? I got the list off [here](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-eu) and at the time Spanish realms weren't listed. I see there is now one, though. I'll look into that.

As a hunter with a new weapon i just spam wing clip, instant cast melee strike between auto attacks. took 5 minutes to go from zero to 100. had to stop to drink a few times cause wing clip will eat your mana. If your not a hunter you could do the same using a similar talent
---
Dude, i'm an altoholic too.
---
Made and deleted like 15 toons. Kept 6 of them, all lvl 18-46.
---
Why reroll on PVE?
---
So you intentionally skipped the Theramore FP just for karma?  😂🤣
---
Tier 1 is hot garbage for druid. Looks nice though.
---
As for raiding...why complain about guilds raiding days if you can't make it? Bite the bullet and find a guild with a raid schedule that fits or don't raid. It's a simple albeit not ideal decision.
---
Druid tank gear is all over the place. We're not optimized that we'll considering warden staff/mark of tyranny are bis for the entirety of classic or the fact you'll be farming MCP's constantly for that single target threat.
---
If you have any other questions, hit me up.

The true secret to holding aggro.
---
There’s a MattDemon on Heartseeker
---
I played with a nagawolfwood alliance Druid back in 05/06.  Doesn’t seem like a very popular name so I was asking OP.
---
Anything can be used to argue.
---
It isn't about having an ironclad argument, it's about establishing a social contract. 
---
The reality is that most of these issues are all easily resolved by talking about it before the run. 
---
Big-ticket, low % drop items *should* be talked about before the run starts. If there is a Hunter in your group and you're going into UBRS, you should know if they intend to roll on Rend swords. If there is a dps warrior, you should know if they intend to roll on Draconic Deflector. 
---
Epic BOEs create major drama because there is a huge incentive to ninja them, and they are worth the same to every single person in the group. Establishing at the very start of the run that epic boes are all-need is a simple, dramaless solution. 
---
Keeping it simple is best for PUGs. There should never be any question as to who is allowed to roll on a given item. If an item drops and someone in the group needs to ask what the rules are, the group leader has failed and there is a very high chance of drama ensuing. 
---
If you want to run with your own unique loot-distrubution system, that's fine. But you need to be able to explain it to pugs in ten seconds and get them on board. 
---
'Need = Equip for Soulbound items and greens/blues, Need on epic boes' is very simple, very straightforward, there's no room for interpretation, and at worst you'll get a 10g item ninja'd. That's why I like it.
---
As a Druid, I'll join groups as DPS, and I usually make it abundantly clear that I'm a bit of a floater. I constantly switch forms to fit whatever the moment needs, and most of the time it saves our group from a wipe.
---
It blows my mind when I have a mage criticizing my role in the group after I spent the past thirty minutes tossing innervate and other buffs, dispells, and heals around like they're candy.
---
Damn just as good lmao
---
Hey man!! I really appreciate it. Thank you :D

Kek, I barely do WPVP. My main focus is finding Premades 10V10 Twink games for my guild like I've done in the Past on P Servers.

Just to give you a rough idea about the kind of gear/spec you want for MC. My first raid with my guild I didnt know I was going to be MAIN TANK until I had got inside the raid. I had dinged 60 the previous day and had a sword and shield plus some random other mostly all plate gear. I was leveling as arms/fury 31/20/0 and that was the spec I was using during the raid. We downed 4 or 5 bosses that night and I had to repair at least once from dying so many times. Let me tell you though. That was some of the most fun I've ever had raiding. I learned a couple valuable things that night. Charging as Main tank in MC is a big no no and always facepull/bow pull. Also tank gear doesnt matter as long as you have people healing you lol.

Why rank 1 Multi?
---
Needs a Dismount / Levitate one listed imo.

Language evolves. Meme was created to have a specific narrow definition. The way the word was used changed and evolved as a meme. That's like saying heredity has nothing to do with genetics because the original narrow definition had nothing to do with it.
---
I'm off the #NoChanges train because of this min/max mentality. 
---
You know that episode of Black Mirror with the social media points and everyone acts fake to be included in stuff? That's how I feel on my 60 warrior getting BiS gear to be inspected on top of Org bank to join raids. The end of that episode is me leveling my balance druid and loving it. 
---
I don't expect to be taken seriously by the time I reach 60 on this chicken alt, so I might just cancel my sub and play on a BC/WoTLK pserver.
---
I'm up to 26 runs and yet to see Gorosh spawn. The percentage for that has got to be absurdly low.
---
I don't click the player frame either.. kinda ruins the point of a mouseover macro.
---
&gt;What should I have said instead?
---
Pretty much anything else you absolute fucking walnut
---
i’m not a horde player but if i was i’d be pissing myself right now
---
Maybe to you 1k isn't worth finishing your Tier set, but to the buyer in OPs picture it was. I would rather farm for 2 days to make enough gold to finish my T1 set over waiting a week for MC reset and pray that the last piece I need would drop &amp; win against other people. Spending 1k is a no-brainer in that situation.
---
If you're the tank and the group leader, just build the group you want. 
---
Don't want anyone competing on plate? Dont invite any warriors.
---
Don't want anyone competing on swords/daggers/2hers as offspec rolls? Don't inv any rogues/hunters/shaman/paladins.
---
It's not rude or offensive to build the group a certain way. Either specify what you are LF in the /world message, or ignore/reply that 'sorry, you're full on melee' to classes you don't desire. 
---
Nobody gets mad they didn't get into a group that wasn't looking for their class/role.
---
Yeah, a lot of caster prebis includes items like this. It's just important that whoever prepares the list includes the caveat of - hey, this is technically the best but not reasonably attainable. I know for frost mages we have at least 3 items on our prebis list. The [Drakestone of Frozen Wrath](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10796/drakestone) immediately comes to mind. Even if that orb drops in ST, Wowhead lists a 3.3% chance for the FW enchant. That is not a reasonable item to farm.
---
Agreed
---
Both are good.  Gnomish gets some toys that are pretty useful like shrink ray, death ray, and cloaking device.  Goblin gets sapper charges.  
---
If you're super serious about pvp, go Gnomish, make all the BoP items, drop engineering, re-level it and switch to Goblin.  Now you have the Gnomish items with the Goblin consumables.

---
+3 Scope is the best you can Attach at 19.due to Item Level
---
How do you just ignore the fact that the item in question has a value that can be traded, not for its vendor cost like a BoP but an actual market value...  and in turn the gold earned can be used for an equal upgrade to any class? That is where the disagreement occurs. People on my side can see past the first step and understand that, but people on your side can’t or don’t want to. If edgemaster’s drops which I need, I’d expect everyone to want a fair shot at it and I sure as hell wouldn’t complain. In some cases that one upgrade to me, could be worth 3 to a newer player if they win and sell the item.
---
What exactly is worth 1k gold? Could you name off the other upgrades he can buy with gold on the AH? Gold is pretty easy to get for certain classes, like a hunter, and there really isn't many uses for it.
---
Yeah I have done about 12 or so and no spawns. Its rough out here
---
29 is literally RNG Bracket dude.
---
Literally got my HoJ yesterday and posted it in guild chat, bc that one felt like a victory.  The grind for that is very real and my heart started racing when I finally saw it drop.  It felt like it was almost a rumor or sick joke so when you see it and win the roll it's a rush and you feel like you have to share it.
---
Guild grumpy cat
---
That's stupid.
---
Mograine man... I switched to this realm as well and MAN i'm having such a great time there as an alliance player. It's really balanced!
---
Yeah,  with scanners like that you usually just have to dedicate a time to have it do a full run at least once a week. 
---
I'm the meantime,  you could advertise the item for sale on your servers discord or subreddit.

yes, if agreed upon that's fine. But I would never agree to that. So now I get screwed because I either get booted, or people need on a BoE I will actually use. where's the fairness in that?
---
You can’t do Arena runs unless you are 52. You will pull the entire right side walking up those stairs if you are less than that. Even at 52 you are walking a thin line.
---
So you're trading a mouseclick for a button click.
---
Definitely lionheart
---
ahhh makes sense haha
---
You just need to give the same tired reponse that I always see here
---
"blah blah blah 1/10 the dps of an actual dps is good, because I have 10 years to do the instance. Plus if you have a druid healer and it is the 4th wednesday of the month, the extra rez and healing is good, blah blah if you dont want a shit class in your group you are a zoomer, because I want to play a boring autoattack class and say i rolled it for 'fun' blah blah blah anyone who doesnt want to carry people is an asshole"
---
I enjoyed your condescending response after he clarified what he said. Well done.
---
So I hit 60 around a week and a half ago, and been gearing up pre bis in the meantime, yesterday I was finally able to craft Lionheart and also have devilsaur set and still don't have epic mount, but I'm pretty happy where i'm at. Now that this gear is complete I can farm gold for my epic mount easily.
---
Thank you.
---
Int gives a small amount of crit
---
That’s happened to me. I just wanted to run and get the quests done. They had a healer already otherwise I’d have done that. It’s annoying
---
Playing alliance on classic after maining horde for a decade. I am a dwarf
---
Depending on your main hand, Flurry Axe is better, but whether it's 250+g better is debatable. Chances are you can get a better upgrade in another slot for that money, but if you've got gold to spare and are geared to the ears already, then why not?
---
Hey this is exactly why I want to *leave* Stalagg.
---
Thanks for transferring off as horde though. One less mud-hut denizen parked outside of every. single. portal.
---
All trinkets are in short supply. And it is relevant because it's going to happen. If you can't think ahead enough to realize that then I know why'd you'd not want the tank trinket as well.
---
Honestly you REALLY need to find like minded people. I successfully tanked everything up until maraudon and sunken temple as a damn shaman. 
---
It just comes down to your groups willing to work with you and being understanding of your classes abilities and limitations. 
---
I would be tanking more but it has gotten to the point where pug groups think it is BS that a shaman wants to need roll on trinkets and rings that give defense or stamina, but fury warriors totally can roll for them... 
---
Even when those warriors are never going to tank a dungeon. 
---
I absolutely intend to tank. Give me my tank gear. Please. (But also like trying not to get kicked and end up on blacklists... Lol)
---
Seen 4 draconian reflectors
---
Yet to get one
---
3 went to fury warriors.
---
You’re really asking if anyone has 200g.. 
---
There’s people with 13k gold.
---
A strong NO to Shroud of the Exiles since it has 0 of a SPrs's most valuable stat -SP/Shadow Dam.
---
Alternate can be a quested item from Hinterlands (for Horde) Deep Woodlands Cloak if you don't want to go with the statless green 'of Shadow Wrath' or farm for the very rare Archivist.
---
It's not even close, Warlock by a mile.
---
Multiple dots with differing uptimes means you have an engaging rotation. Fearing lets you juggle multiple mobs and drain life/life tap/siphon life means you have a lot of sustain.
---
I stack 200+ frost and shadow resists as a pally in pvp vs casters and I think the only way to bypass that is spell penetration not spell hit in pvp
---
Someone correct me if I’m wrong
---
Brilliant
---
But you didn’t answer mine, because you stopped reading mid sentence.
---
Is that done through the default UI interface?
---
I know I will never tank on my Druid.
---
If you are so indecisive then sure go for the tanking trinket but I would rather have a great pvp / farming trinket for the next year.
---
Another pally here.
---
Are you speccced for this?  Or can you do it as holy?
---
45-60 is a big slog. In my experience people who are going to quit do so 42-45 as they realise how far they have to go... it’s pretty common to hear 45 referred to as about halfway to 60.
---
I don’t recommend stressing over getting to 60 from there... it’ll burn you out. If you want, get a levelling guide and follow it, that way you know you’re spending your time as efficiently as possible while hopefully enjoying yourself.
---
Oh and take advantage of your friends high levels... get a bunch of elite quests ready to go and have them come know them all out for you. Same with instances, get them to come smash through all the quests etc.
---
What?
---
Shadow Weaving, applies 3% increased shadow damage from any source, stacks 5 times. If your wand is shadow damage, yes it will increase the damage of the wand. Any other players will also gain a % shadow damage increase with their spells and wands

---
Wait, are Runecloth bags valuable? My ex-guildie sent me 4 of them when I was lvl 10 or so... No GM whisper yet lol
---
I wouldn't mention you're new at tanking, but it's okay to mention you don't know the dungeon that well and that you will be taking your time.  If you want to save time on marking, just mark Skull and tell mage that his job is to sheep the unmarked or to just let it be a 2nd priority that you just have to hold aggro on.  I bind Skull to middle mouse button, and that works pretty well.
---
&gt;SM Armory run the other day advertise as: LF3m tank and heals ... I joined the group it was 2 warriors and a shaman. 
---
Yeah, I get this all the time. This is why I usually try to form a group with myself with tank. I've joined groups that take 20+ minutes just to find a tank, but if I just elect to tank myself I can get a group going and into the instance in less than that.
---
I get it, though. I've been tanking dungeons pretty routinely since I hit 25 and it is definitely getting pretty tiring. As the tank I'm expected to basically lead every run. At this point I just want to sit back, pop a movie on, and smash a single key.
---
This is why everyone should need BOEs, whether it’s an upgrade or not. The people comparing this to “if you need, need” no that’s for boss drops not random BOEs. There’s always too much of a risk that other people are gonna randomly need it so everyone should just need. This subreddit is the only place people bitch about people needing BOEs, it’s always been need in game for me since I started playing in actual Vanilla.
---
Do you finish each run in 12 minutes? I've found that I have to pull two packs at once on every other pull. When I do that I can do 5 runs an hour. I used to get 50g/h when the herb prices were higher. 40g/h is where I'm at now.
---
I have farmed 600g in total just from lashers now so I'm pretty sure my g/h isn't high due to variance. I'm pretty confident in saying that this is the best farm for priests currently.
---
Dude I love having druids. Sometimes, they do more dmg than mages in my groups. I mean sure, mages got the food and water, but the buffs and debuffs and perfectly timed brez when the party wipes is amazing.
---
Got extremely lucky with a Freezing Band drop - should I sell now for epic mount money or hold on and hope the price goes up as the new phases come out?

[Penny Arcade GIFT](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19)

How is that possible?!? 
---
And where your character name , guild name to compare?!?
---
I guess you are right. An honest "thank you"!
---
Every time I do ST I ask the question just because I know someone is stupid enough to try and jump down that hole.
---
For tanking you're balancing threat and mitigation and not wearing plate on some pieces is perfectly normal. That chest is really good, all you lose is a bit of armor lol. (note that agi gives dodge) I thought the wonky itemization was a thing people liked about classic.
---
But yeah, blindly following bis lists is dumb, I mean the wowhead one tells you to get the rank 14 weapons..
---
They're a great resource if you don't want to do all the min-max calculations yourself (do i want 1% hit or 10 str 5 agi or whatever) and they give you something to target.
---
There's only so many times I'd run a dungeon before I'd go "okay, which items do I actually want from here?"
---
I've read this multiple times and may do this on my mage once I'm done leveling. Question though, what's the cost? I know that's relative to ah prices but can you pull this off in like a day if you have mining and just heavily grind the nodes and such at 60?
---
I always see rogues having a harder time getting groups than fury warriors
---
at least the rogues in my i group like to say so
---
I've dumped a ton (well over 100g) into BS, and I'm still a long way from 300. I earned a few gold making counterweights and inlaid mithril cylinders before everyone else got the patterns, and occasionally get a few silver in tips for attaching a shield spike or spurs.
---
Honestly, every guild needs a high level blacksmith to make certain items, but the blacksmith gets very little benefit for himself in the process.
---
Same people putting down Drakestone of Shadow Wrath, I feel like it's to fuck over newbies who haven't played the game before and stick them into an insane depressing item grind.
---
Same, my druid is low level but the only two times I’ve healed were when I just said screw it and only advertised as healing. Tanking is alright, but I really love healing.
---
Maybe not popular opinion but try finishing high level quest locations (if you haven't done all), instead of xp you'll get more gold per completion. Also you can run dangeons and make money as a normal group. These "I make x amount of gold per hour" shouldn't bother you, you don't have to be this super efficient.
---
Same to you; thank you. That's why I asked for opinions I guess. \^\^
---
Nobody flexed on you. He said spending that much on respecs is fucked.
---
This post is trash.
---
Another thing I want to add to this is how Different the story telling in FFXIV and Classic are, and i see this in a lot of new mmos. Everyone starts out as the "Chosen one" where you have some super special power that's not really ever explained that somehow just makes you better then everyone, except it doesnt because In reality your playing a game with thousands of other people who are supposed to be "special" I dont play an mmo to instantly feel powerful and special. 
---
I feel like most people who play mmos want a game where they have to actually grow their character and figure out where to go and what to do and not just be forced down a linear path where everyone ends up the same in the end.
---
You have a very limited toolkit so most of it comes down to experience and awareness. Knowing the dungeons isn't necessary but you will naturally start to become more efficient as you learn them. 
---
Think people in this thread generally put too much stock in pre hotting, marking every target, trying to keep aggro on every mob, etc. I'll pre hot on some serious pulls and bosses but generally I'm trying to keep the rage more than anything else. 
---
Tanking big big groups of mobs in this game is basically impossible and even counterproductive at times unless you want a 30 minute dungeon to take over an hour. Do not be the tank that bitches at DPS to let you get a maul or two into 6 targets. It's a waste of time. 
---
You need to identify what the critical mobs are in each pull and keep aggro on those. You need to let your dps go big and trust them to deal with mobs that they can lock down and cleave down. Knowing these things and being able to instruct a group to execute this comes with experience. Maintain awareness of your healer, but generally you do not want to be letting elites get loose so you can taunt a parrot off a rogue. 
---
I'll give a couple of examples from late game. In LBRS the orc packs before the spiders I literally don't even attempt to tank the caster kill target. If there are multiple casters I'll keep the off target just long enough for the first to die, then I ignore it. I focus my energy on keeping the melee mobs with MS under control. 
---
UD strat on the big skeleton pulls I always find a way to LoS and get them all clumped up, then I focus exclusively on the elite cadavers and let the dps just cleave or aoe the nonelites. If I have the rage for the odd swipe, fine, but mauling cadavers is priority. 
---
Rush faerie fire feral...you should get it at 30. Saves you so much rage and keeps the dungeon moving.
---
Monitor your healer and try to keep the mobs coming based on their mana. I'm obviously not going to do a major pull while my healer is drinking but if I can snag a patrol or single pull that we can stun and lock down, I'm keeping the train moving.
---
If you think getting Slash is bad, wait till you have to get Trinket Read...

Mages should be Mana Ruby, or Ice Block.

---
damage done is based on speed and dps. weapon type has nothing to do with it.
---
Pretty similar to every other class, 
---
1) Google:  wow classic &lt;INSERT CLASS&gt; &lt;INSERT SPEC&gt;
---
2) Check through the plethora of guides on builds, BiS list, macros, rotation, stat weights, etc 
---
3) Develop a general understanding of your spec by spending more than 5 minutes reading
---
4) Awe your raid mates by performing above the bare competencies of your role in raid
---
5) Collect loot

If you're drunk and/or stoned they may look the same. I think people should be allowed to play while under the influence and not be at risk of being scammed, or worse.
---
As a bear tank..
---
I start off with my disclaimers first. When I was very low level it was something like.
---
"I'm still learning to tank as a bear. if you see me doing something stupid please say something so I'll know not to do it again".
---
People usually don't say anything, but sometimes they will chastise the over eager dps on your behalf, or they will point out things you could do better.  ("If my mana is half or more and I"m sitting go ahead and pull")
---
When I went to a dungeon I haven't been do in a very long time.
---
"I haven't been here in over a decade, please say something if I'm about to do something stupid".
---
Normally people would rather go with a tank that's (re-)learning the instance than to keep waiting for a new tank.
---
**As far as marking targets,** 
---
I keep Skull (kill first) and Moon (Sheep/Crowd control) on my hotbar/hotkey on fast hotkeys.   99% of the time skull is the only mark I need. and I just update it as we go along, and really before raiding raids that's really all you need to do.
---
I mean...sure. If you:
---
Don't want a class that can make the healer completely immune to the mobs that just broke off ya
---
Want overall less group/raid dps
---
Want overall less mana-efficient healers/casters
---
Want 10% less in all stats
---
Want to take 55 more damage on Boss Fights
---
Want to be rooted/slowed
---
Want to deal with trash respawn after a wipe
---
Want DPS to 'hold back' because of threat
---
Want less armor
---
Want less resistances
---
Want your casters to suffer more often from 'pushback'
---
Want to 'go down' because healer couldn't get you instantly back to 100% health
---
Don't want mana/health back on nearly every single hit
---
Don't want hard stuns that defy RNG
---
Want mobs "fleeing" when taken below \~20% health
---
Don't want a class that can swap to emergency tank if MT dies
---
((My guess is many Rets clip SoC's chance to proc by judging and failing to refresh SoC seal before the next weapon swing.))
---
Fury Prot or Fury warrior who occasionally tanks?
---
Fury Prot you are basically juggling gear between threat and survival gear while spamming Bloodthirst and sunder while tanking, or Bloodthirst and Whirlwind while DPSing.  You’re stuck in one stance most of the time due to lack of tactical mastery.  
---
Plain old fury will actually function closer to traditional Prot since you can still stance dance for that sweet thunder clap AoE threat and Berserker Rage for that extra rage generation, the downside being you miss out on that extra 15% threat from the Prot tree.
---
Like stated before the issue is at what amount of gold you draw the line, nobody is going to need on your 15g boe.
---
Everything else was kinda 100% full when I started... I did not start immediately.
---
Yep, I will call it a day. Thanks!

People complaining about classic xp grind.

Meanwhile, as an original Everquest veteran, the leveling process feels so quick to me.

If the priest in the party is a tailor and needs a BoE pattern, he should *buy it from the auction house*.
---
Everyone wins when there’s free trade, but if you have trade restrictions (have to use/equip the tradable stuff that drops) then the whole server is less efficient.
---

Why is the person who wants to equip it not greedy. It's the same thing.

I’d bet it becomes very second nature for him. Especially if you are doing something else like watching TV or playing Hearthstone. Kill, vendor, learn skills and chill. 
---
Still sounds miserable compared to questing
---
Not sure if trolling, but I'll take the bait in that case.
---
Having a hybrid be responsible for that utility alleviates the healer from doing that, allowing him to focus more on keeping the group alive through healing. Not to mention the GCDs your healer is not freed up to heal and not BoP that idiot who aoe aggroed. Now the healer can heal the tank again while your paladin DPS can spend a GCD for that BoP.
---
Umm 🤔 repeatable quest any kind of timer on it?!? If it the troll town I think I been there. Is this quest for troll reputation too?
---
Na, I understand the folks. They had a raid going on and stuff. We still had fun together. All good with em.

---
Yeah, if I'm just left to DPS I can top the charts pretty easily, especially if I powershift until I'm OOM. I had never played one in any form of Retail and have been pleasantly surprised by their brilliant utility in Classic. I thought I'd be relegated to healing but I really spend a lot of time doing a little bit of everything pretty effectively.
---
I'm not sure exactly what you mean, did you want to specify?
---
Typically in a pug, yes - how do YOU  know they won't just sell or already have the recipe - hell somepeople will roll need saying they have a profession they don't have.
---
Nobody ever knows their future with that much certainty.
---
&gt; If you are so indecisive then sure go for the tanking trinket but I would rather have a great pvp / farming trinket for the next year.
---
Eh.  You might be overselling those by calling them 'great'.  They're really not that awesome, especially if you want to do pvp you're going to have a hard time justifying you not getting reflectors from engineering.  For farming I'd rather have trinkets which provide sustain.
---
I personally don't think either are that good.  But you do you.
---
Could I get some of those caster DPS please? Because every time I build a group, my chat is full of Rogues and DPS warriors.
---
Oh I never roll on my offspec items if I'm not on the roll at the moment. Unless no one rolls on it, then I ask if I can have it. A lot of hybrids I encountered usually asked if they can have certain items or what not.

You can trade or ask nicely for the BoE from the winner. Generally if it's a lower value item, and the group is going well, the item will most likely be traded over.
---
Exactly! I'm glad they found me first before I was in a group with them
---
It's the BiS hunter belt until phase 3. They rarely drop and if they do you usually have to roll against 3-5 other hunters. I've never even seen one on my realms AH. Would you rather hope to get it after months of MC or would you spend 10 hours in Dire Maul and just buy it?

You know what they say about common knowledge.

I am currently playing an undead mage on Skeram, but want to switch servers/class because of the ridiculous amount of mages nowadays as well as the terrible horde to alliance ratio on Skeram (85% horde). I want to find an even ratio server and potentially play an Alliance hunter. I’ve heard Sulfuras is pretty even. My mage is level 51, should I say fuck it and keep playing him or switch? (I’ve played mage since cataclysm, hunter in vanilla/bc/wotlk).
---
Eh, i came into classic with the intent of healing anyways, but i get it.
---
Come to think of it though i don't really think my guiild/the pugs we've been bringing really has any DPS shamans... its all rogues and warriors/mages with a couple of locks sprinkled in.
---
I still love ENH but its just not really worthwhile to me to keep bag slots/keep respeccing when i can still get by. God damn as slow as ENH was for me it was fun though.
---
dumb people gonna dumb
---
Gotcha. I’m mostly fully geared with my bis for a Prot I’m assuming as an off tank mainly stuff with more agi/hit % and less defense.
---
Some tanks end up like that because of the power trip
---
We ran with 2 Druid’s, one to tank and one to heal, then 2 rogues (probs fine with 1 I’m only freshly dinged). We tried with 3 rogues and one Druid healer and yeah each rogue would eventually get one shot.
---
I’m not an engineer so don’t have access to those.  Nothing is better for farming as resto right now than briarwood and the 2% spell crit trinket and for the foreseeable future.  
---
Doing more damage makes farming faster swapping in a + healing or mp5 trinket doesn’t make any sense.
---
Been thinking of doing this, what kind of gear do you need to 2-man Anger?
---
We are talking classic here. Every class is a lazy class. Mages=frostbolt warlock=dot/wand priest=same as warlock etc... Pally is self buff judgment self buff auto until judgment is up and repeat. Its not that much different
---
Got my sash today after 80-90 runs in total
---
Clearly these are the only two types of players. Only people with terrible specs that contribute almost nothing to the party’s success can be fun people. It’s not like it’s more likely to be the exact opposite, where the guy who picks a selfish spec that contributes nothing of worth is more likely not to give a shit about the rest of the party, nosir, such individuals are the true heroes of Azeroth.
---
Extended out that'll be like Needing on all Runecloth if you set the loot threshold to common.
---
Needing on any consumable mats is questionable if you don't tell people up front. Should I be Needing on all green drops to DE because I need mats to Enchant my weapon?
---
Just to add to this correct answer: what shift-clicking does is just run a /who "playername". You can also use this functionality to find players of which you only remember part of their name, look up guilds, players of a certain level, class or in a certain zone. For few results it prints in the chat, for more hits (up to 50 are displayed) it opens a window.
---
I do consider the vendor value of a bop the same for every player.  The difference is that bops aren't tradeable and the vendor value rarely represents the value of the item to someone who can use it, unlike boes of which the value is the same to every player.
---
Hey I play alliance on Ashbringer! 
---
I think that if you want to look at what is needed, then look no further than your main.
---
Horde/alliance, it doesn't matter. We all need tanks most, healer second, and dps last. 
---
Of the dps classes however, there seem to be overflowing with mages, warrior and rogues. Not that many hunters as far as I can tell.
---
So if you want to level something everyone needs, prot Warrior is the way to go!
---
Happen to me also. I tried to explain why I'd like to have proper lvl people doing "insert dangeon name" because I've tried, I have bad experience with under levels. But they insist that this dangeon is so simple, he done it already. Yes it's not impossible especially when you got carried but why would I want to do that.
---
Thanks. That does make it very more convenient for me.
---
Thanks for the Info.
---
This is why Paladin Tanks should be a bigger thing. Join up, get to the first boss. Ask them to reconsider. No? Cool. Pull...bubble...bye bye
---
Boe blue drops. Everyone rolls need.  Afterwords, some guy goes hey, can I have that?  I’d equip it.  Whoever wins decides if they want to do that.  The end.
---
Alternate reality:
---
Boe blue drops.  Let’s say 4 of you are friends. 3 of you roll greed because you “can’t equip it”.  Your friend rolls need because he can use it. The last guy rolls need to sell and he doesn’t follow your loot beliefs because this item sells for 400g which would buy him 3 pieces of pre raid bis gear at least compared to one.  He happens to win and you all cry ninja.  Instead of having 4 chances to win you had just the one.
---
Dance animations Soon^tm^^sinceWoTLK
---
The issue is that, first of all, you didn’t really read OP’s posts. He never said he wouldn’t share the mods, and then he posted a list. The second problem is that you’re downplaying his accomplishment by saying 20 hours isn’t a long time. The third problem is that your tone is extremely condescending: “average people”, “people don’t understand”, “I couldn’t stop the urge to laugh at how OP marvels...” and this obnoxious “I failed again :(“ bullshit. You sound absolutely insufferable.
---
Glas to hear that. Will Do.
---
Uldaman Mobs start at level 35, Final boss is level 47.
---
(rare spawn mini boss outside is 38, first boss inside is 41, last boss inside is 47)
---
My friend and I farmed it.
---
Took him 162 runs to see the chest. We saw Gorosh 11 times.
---
I hope your luck is better
---
1000 gold in 2 days... Like 48 hours? That seems like a lot of gold in 2 days unless you get lucky BoE drops.
---
I mean it’s pretty obvious your only option left is to grind mobs for the last 60% which is going to be insanely boring. But with your stipulations is the only thing to do.
---
"÷ zs
---
Thanks for the tip and I totally get this approach, but the problem is that I only have a couple of hours tops per day to dedicate to WoW. I want to maximize the efficiency during these playhours to make the road to my epic mount faster. Either way, I’m not gonna get there fast, but dungeon farming in that context and finishing quests is quite bad gold per hour. I hope you understand my point.
---
LOL, I largely didn't do quests while leveling, for a reason...and it wasn't so that I could do them at 60 and get extra gold.
---
I plan to be running dungeons anyways.  I just did a full strat run yesterday.  4'ish hours.  Made, maybe 30 gold.  Gold farming by doing dungeons, is not my idea of farming gold.
---
That's the opposite of polite. Unless you specifically asked for armor type/class X and they are clearly not what you're looking for, respond to people. Nothing is worse than silence.
---
This is a good one. Finish all the quests in zones you haven’t completed. Currently lvl 59 I’m personally saving EPL, most of Winterspring, and Silithid for this purpose. Been grinding dungeons mostly since 55-56. Other than that I would recommend herbalism and either skinning or mining and farm those. I was fortunate enough to find a Destiny in LBRS so that boosted my bank significantly. I also dropped herbalism for LW but blew 100gold lvling it. Currently making devilsaur gloves and legs (buying devilsaur skins) but have probably made 200 gold in profit from sales. Idk if I would recommend that vs herbalism tho as that seemed pretty lucrative before I dropped it.
---
Well, I misspoke.  At the stage in the game where a 2% spell crit trinket matters, both I listed are better.  But yes Reed and Royal Seal are both better.  Royal Seal + Mindtap is also a good choice.
---
Looks like Azuresong needs to get organized. Does anyone know of one that exists for Azuresong atm?
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"
---
This is how I did it
---
Water young trees regularly, especially those on semidwarfing or dwarfing rootstocks, to ensure that the root system becomes well established.
---
Renew mulch periodically, but pull it away from the tree in the fall so mice don’t nest over the winter and eat the bark.
---
When you think the grind stops at 60....
---
My baby playing with my phone what he thinks of ur druid problems.
---
Same here on my 2014! Lowest settings ftw
---
&gt;but should I focus just on a weapon’s individual DPS or on my overall DPS on my character sheet?
---
Are you a warrior or rogue?  For a warrior is matters less, but for a rogue you should typically focus on a MH with the highest damage and an OH that increases the MH dmg the most.  Obviously this isn't an absolute rule, but given relative similarities in items, a slower higher dmg MH will out perform a higher DPS fast MH.
---
&gt;With how fast fights are crit and int are actually good
---
Sorry but crit is certainly not good for healers that aren't pallies. It's a huge stat budget stat and healers only get 50% crit bonus. +1% crit = +0.5% healing or less... and only for heals that can actually crit. Not to mention the unpredictable nature of crits, the nature of overhealing being 100% wasted, and HoTs/shields gaining no benefit at all.
---
What does that even mean? The RNG bracket? 29 / 39 is best bracket by far. Also where’s ur Lynx for DPS set
---
Hopefully my guild will be nice and let me gear up when the time comes! :D
---
We're all talking in anecdote here but the amount of LF Tank UBRS, LBRS, etc I see in chat is way, way more than for anything else and regularly you can see the same people posting lf tank for 30m-1hr before finally filling the spot.
---
I think that’s a terrible idea and if you want that as an option you should try out retail.
---
I’m talking about actual hours grinded, there are many grinds there take people hundreds of hours.
---
And I’d love to see 1-2 minute chambers of Xeric clears, my Ironman t bow hunt would be much faster if I knew that insane secret.
---
Oh! So I need to wait for Cata Classic lol. Fantastico :D
---
Easy, you refuse to tank dungeons as a warrior and nobody wants to be your friend.
---
Once in Scholo I had the tank say to me 'stop slacking, top up all the dps before every pull'. I had to point out that the reason I wasn't was that he was chain-pulling while I was drinking (which is fine, I can keep drinking until I need to heal, but I'm also not going to waste that regen time if you want a fast run like that), and maybe the dps should stop slacking and actually eat/bandage once in a while. What blew my mind was that all 5 of us were UD and I was the only person I ever saw use Cannibalize -- including the warlock.
---
It might be missing for some mounts, because my nelf mount doesn't growl. I see the animation, but no sound.
---
Some people - myself included - really don't give two fucks about the lore and just enjoy hanging out with the gang on disc at raidtime, and preferably performing as well as possible. 
---
The only big problem with bis lists are that depending on where you are in working towards prebis and t1 bis, and moving between them, you'll often want the 2nd or 3rd "best"  item as it brings certain stats you want (especially in relation to hit). It's about your set as a whole, not each slot.
---
You hate prot or you hate tanking? You can easily tank your way to 60 even being Fury
---
Spend any time on this sub and you will see people are doing it right now. Everyone has their backseat dev license. It is insane to signup to classicwow and then start having discussions on what needs to be changed, but here we are.
---
Examples I have seen so far include, the coming PvP system, hour long mail between characters, faction imbalance on PvP realms, devilsaur leather farming fixes, meeting stone summoning, warlock summoning from inside instance, the leveling experience (how you change zones a lot and then come back). I am sure there are more, but you get the point. 
---
Everyone is oh so suuuUUUuuuper reasonable with their suggestions. After all they juUUst make sense right? How can Blizzard just not see how the game would be better if only we made these minor little changes to a 15 year old game where the whole point was to play the game like it was back then.
---
Edit:
---
[Here we go, found one right in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dka3rx/after_playing_classic_for_a_month_i_left/f4feo8z/)
---
One of my issues is I have mining and not Herbalism.
---
Grinding is more efficient at that point though.
---
And just ignore messages from the ones you don’t want
---
Right, but I don't really consider that "low-level" IMO.
---
Since farming with damage gear means lots of barkskin hurricane, I'd take burst of knowledge over 2% spell crit any day.  Mp5 trinkets are also good.. less downtime.
---
Engineering is the best profession in the game.  I'd suggest you take it unless you have a rare pattern you're making money from.
---
I just think Ret paladins need to be honest about their usefulness. Rock Holy until PvP is released then switch back to ref and wreck some bitches.
---
So much this.
---
A buff to the tank's aggro generation is generally a bigger raid DPS buff than a buff to one DPS's DPS.
---
It's not the best stat no, but when you are a flash heal budget pally in the current content it actually breaks down to a high value stat.
---
Later it won't be valued no, but right now? Yeah int and crit are good.
---
There is a reason ogre king crown is the best preraid helm right now given it has zero +heal.
---
I somehow doubted the majority of people would contact a GM about it.
---
That's beautiful.
---
It definitely is relevant. The off-hand attacks significantly slower than the main-hand. So my new 1.4 speed dagger is not only a massive damage boost, but it also makes my poisons apply at an astronomically higher rate. I'm sub, so poison application is super important. Not just for instant poison for DPS, but also crippling poison for PvP. (sub is primarily a PvP spec)
---
To reiterate, the dagger wasn't super valuable. (which I predicted before I even rolled need)
---
I dunno, Sony looked pretty good as a tauren
---
I second this. 
---
And to add the only real Benefit you will get going disc is more efficient healing for the dungeons on your way to 60.
---
ah. I thought you said you helped someone with stalvan quest which is like lvl 35ish.
---
Warriors are great...
---
Oprah windfury, cmon blizz
---
Rolling past a high level human, night elf, human or dwarf on the road; most of the time they ignore me or are super chill.
---
  Rolling past a high level gnome mage on the road: Frost nova, frostbolt, polymorph, frost bolt frost bolt, dead.
---
  Rolling past a high level gnome lock on the road: dot, dot, dot, dot, die a few seconds later.
---
wow is pretty much a mistress, like you think about it more often, its new/exciting, it does things your gf wont, it doesnt nag you for neglecting duties, but in the end its appeal will fade, and youll be happy you have your GF :)
---
This is why I always say "Needing because it's an upgrade, I'll equip it as soon as rolls finish if I win."
---
Ah okay, funny.
---
Shout out to my fellow level 11-20 main whoever you are!
---
Totally understand. I skip most of quest locations because I'm more into dangeon runs (not a retail kid, I did same thing back in vanilla). I'm a mage, made it to 60 last week, bought epic mount yesterday. I did aoe grind but only for couple of hours. Most of my income from dangeon runs.
---
The casuals are hitting 60.
---
Great story mate, made me log in just to comment it. Look at the bright side, you can start over with all the knowledge you've gained... or not.
---
&gt; Considering how many people seem to play WoW with one eye on their tv or phone, it's no surprise they balk at having to give the game their full attention
---
Like for real, HWHAT? I know people joke about this, but I cannot fathom splitting my attention like that. I can listen to a podcast MAYBE if I'm just farming, but I can't even do that properly in dungeons - ya boi's gotta DPS good, not catch up on Seinfeld
---
Awesome, thank you so much for the info!
---
I loved playing warrior alt, for 1 reason. 
---
I could tank when I hit 60 to get all my DPS gear.
---
Something that takes a million years in pugs otherwise unless stupid lucky.
---
But yes, tanking in pugs is horrible. But I stopped giving a fuck really, I am there to get my gear then I am out of there. As long as a healer don't die from healing aggro I could not care less if a dps dies :D
---
But you could buy that piece on the auction house for gold. So needing on the piece is actually just saving you money. Smells like greed to me *shrug*
---
&gt;Thick hide is +10% of your bear form armor.
---
That is multiplicative lol
---
If it wasnt, it would be 10% of your non bear form armor
---
The Shaman order hall mount is the closest you can get
---
Feralas/Tanaris
---
The tank was supposedly not very vocal, I didn't mean to mislead about that. I just didn't want to specify any of the members, as it's about the situation itself and not the toxicity of any specific members.
---
Did they pass or greed lol
---
These people literally do not see the person playing the character. They see the meme spec and go red lmao. Imagine waiting 20 minutes for a proper tank/healer when you could be 20 minutes into the run with a less beefy tank or a shadow priest healer
---
yeah, I suppose that is another way of looking at it. you're right.
---

This exactly! If it has bonus armour you take that item!
---
Yes you can make a positive out of every negative
---
"This game has no content which is great so I can play other games that aren't fking dogshit"
---
Same, especially as a healer honestly. I’m half asleep the entire dungeon barely needing to do anything and then OH SHIT EVERY MOB IN THE WHOLE WORLD IS HERE RIGHT NOW happens and it can be pretty thrilling, especially when you pull it off and everyone is like “wow nice heals.”
---
don’t do it
---
&gt;they just dont give a fuck at all 
---
/confusion in Warlock
---
If I want to run a dungeon. I want to run it now. I bring 30 shards to MC because I will start summoning before the raid group is full.
---
Ah right good point. I did all of mara and got the one drop I wanted in one run so I forgot about the scepter/princess runs.
---
Getting all the way to exalted and beyond w/Booty Bay and the Hyacinth Macaw never dropped....
---
Sneaky shamans will take that ravager mon.
---
Honestly I don't even think its Mages. It's 'dps warriors' who reserve everything, will never put on a shield instead of shouting for a tank for hours, and they dont even perform well.
---
"Are you me?" I used to hate this but i totally feel your statement. My buddies have been 60 for like 3 weeks had have pre-raid BiS. I just hit 44 almost 45 last night and i feel like i am so so so far behind. 
---
In fact, one of them just hit 40 on their 2nd dude. Now i feel REALLY far behind.
---
My favorite I’ve seen so far is a warlock named Harrydotter
---
Warlock question: is it worth taking Improved CoEx while leveling? I took the skill because I'm on a PvP server. I know 10% slow isn't a whole lot but it's something, not sure if it's worth pumping more into or just focusing on better leveling talents. I don't see a ton of fights and I'm kinda of a wimp about engaging.
---
Otherwise I'd be looking to move into Imp CoA or the Demonology tree (stamina/HS talents). Currently 41.5.
---
I have no issue with pets tanking. A BM hunter pet is more than capapble of tanking one of the pack. I see them as a form of CC. As long as the hunter is happy watching their health, and doing mend as necessary (assuming the healer isn't healing them) then I'm totally cool with that.  
---
A hunter pet is NOT going to out agro me on a boss (if it does then I'm plain bad). BM pets have a lot of health and mitigation, and since I'm still doing levelling content, then there's really nothing challenging that a hunter pet can seriously fuck up.  
---
I just wont field any complaints from the party. Which is unliekly to happen, as any hunter who is oblivious to what their pet is doing is probably not one to complain much anyway.
---
At this point you're just being an ass and i'm done arguing with you when you're so clearly in the wrong and can't accept it
---
I wrote this at like 4am my time, good catch
---
ahhhh, makes sense
---
104 lockpicking at 60 so not me
---
I don’t think so...  only was able to sell Gut Ripper (purple dagger) for 32 gold even.
---
The couple of blues I have gotten have all gone for less than 10 gold and usually less than 5.
---
Holy shit the accuracy
---
Last night I made a summoning group at the entrance to DM north me and my 2nd lock helper made 50-60g between us in tips in about a half hour. He had his alt parked in SM and he went there to advertise and tell people to message me for a summon. When I got a message he would switch back to his main to help the summon. We usually could find a third and even a fourth who just wanted to help for a bit.  We put everyone in a dungeon group. And at times we had nine people even. There were times when i has four summon requests at once and it got hectic. I had a chat text I pasted about ‘welcome to my summoning service and that tips are appreciated but not required’ when I summoned someone and usually got a 1g tip per person, but a few tipped 5g. A few tipped 50s and only guy tipped nothing. He sometimes got tips too and we would both keep track separately and square up when it slowed down. It would be better to do with a constant set of three people but you wouldn’t get as much money. Mages could make a killing offering free water in SM by the way or in front of dungeons in a similar way.
---
Cost me like 100g to get to ~250, which is as much as you need for most of this stuff if I'm not missing anything. Thorium is when it gets expensive.
---
A lot of intricacies come into play with hybrid gameplay, and it creates a pretty high skill ceiling, one I truly enjoy thriving in. 
---
I don’t aspire to be top dps, but being clutch in high tense situations has its major pluses.
---
If mid 30s feels like "too much of a grind" you're likely not going to be playing past your 40s.
---
I didn't have Stalven, but did have a quest for the Feral's surrounding his shack.  I was already there, so I wasn't going to say no when someone asked for a hand killing him.
---
Typical alliance scum playing the victim
---
You hit the nail on the head with female Tauren.
---
It's really interesting how our perceptions of things can be warped without realizing it isn't it?
---
Fuck that, if hurricane dropped while I was levelling my hunter and everyone else needed I would've been pissed.
---
Fiery war axe dropped on one of my ulda runs and we all greeded so the warrior could have it. He equipped it and everyone was happy for him.
---
I was watching that guys stream the other day.  He got ganked and was being teabagged and one of them figured out the characters to /y that translate to "n o h a i r".  I'm sure hes wiping away the tears at night with all the dollar bills lol.
---
I don't know why people are so surprised by this.  Transferring to lower pop servers has never been a good idea or worked out.  For all people hate about queue times, it's even worse then you get on and there is next to nothing to do.  The only time transfers like this has any success is when it is an entire guild who can move as a unit large enough to sustain themselves.  Even then the long term outlook isn't good as those guilds usually can't being sustained by the lower pop server.
---
There is a reason people have been paying to transfer to mega servers since the day they opened paid server transfers.  If there is anything people should learn about transfers it's that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE PAYS TO GO TO A SHITTIER SERVER.  Why would you do it for free?  You are only going to pay to go back to your old one later.
---
That's the one thank you also the mindtap talisman is pretty good for a pre raid it's just shard of the scale but two-thirds. Assuming someone is building a regen set
---
Storing pets. I liked the catalogue not to see all available but just for the ones I have. Like how the keyring will work in the next classic update
---
Nice, level 8 though because you spend more time coding then leveling :D
---
You should never do a dungeon at the minimum level because you’ll likely be dead weight by the end of it. You should wait until you’re closer to the upper end of the level range for a dungeon before you do it.
---
My guilds druids and rogues are running duo and 3man tribute runs and selling the agi+hit ring from chest to someone outside. Im not 100% sure how they do it or the route but it should be consistant once you learn it.
---
Edit: Even if the ring doesnt drop its still good gold per hour due to the major potions and just vendoring/disenchanting the loot depending on the value of DE mats.
---
Honestly, I think Arms with Annihilator is the best bet for the time being, but that depends on if the composition of your raid.
---
Hey if some dedicated UI programmers want to help me make this into a consolidated addon... I’d love to help in any way I can.

Does the sync function also save all your settings?
---
For example, if I spend an hour setting up my UI, will it mirror on my laptop?
---
What about auctioneer price data?
---
It's not only about dps, you're filling up a debuff slot with a useless mortal strike. In 20 mans it's less of an issue ofc.

As a warrior, what should I prioritize on a weapon? Which is weighted more: the weapon speed, weapon damage range, its stats (like str or agi), or the DPS listed on the weapon? I have Dejacharacterstats so usually I just look at what my mainhand damage would be and base it off that, but idk if thats a good way of doing things. Thank you for any insight on this!
---
Time goes by so quickly.  You probably got busy.  It’s been over a month.  I’m still LOVING everything about it and play regularly.  Take care!
---
Why do you even say things when you don't know what you are talking about?
---
Best advice I can give is at 51 roll fury/prot or D prot and start making groups, get the quests for scholo, mc attune, ony attune, etc started. You'll make tons of friends and collect more gear than you know what to do with either off spec or tank. Then at 60 live free as a face rolling pvp machine or basically the highest demand character in the game. Also tanking dungeons over and over can be quite lucritive.
---
If you're willing to accept that epic mounts aren't something anyone actually needs, you surely must realize that gear upgrades aren't actually "needed" either. There is no content in this game that requires the best of the best gear, just like there is no content in this game that requires the best mount speed. Having better gear (or a better mount) just makes things go by faster
---
You don't need to bring them, but saying they need to Tank is a piss poor attitude. If you wanna tank then do it, if you wanna DPS then do that I'd rather have a shitty tank with someone who wants to tank, then a decent tank with someone who doesn't wanna tank. I can teach someone who wants to learn, but you can't with someone forced into a position.
---
Play how you want to play I guess, but to me it’s way more sad than it is something to feel accomplished about lol
---
Lionheart.
---
You won't wear another helm afterwards.
---
Seriously! It was 2 days away, dude said, “it’s bis for hunter for a long time” everyone called him on his bs and he got kicked
---
To be fair, rogues don't really need green stats on their weapons while leveling. They just need raw DPS. It probably was a meaningful upgrade for him, and I'm guessing he only read the DPS/weapon type.
---
I was in a run where a mage needed healing pants from the healer because he only saw "spell" and not "Healing spells" though lol. It happens.
---
The max level is 25! I’m not too far away!
---
I’d say stick with your friends, but that’s just me ;) the edge lord could be your side bitch when nobody’s on.
---
Because they are universal abstract symbols, yet clearly distinct and recognizable. They can mean anything you want them to, it's more flexible that way.
---
Nevertheless, for disabling enemies most people use something that resembles the color of the effect, e. g. the chains that shackle undead are yellow, sheeps are white, fear's icon and effect have some purple in it, the ice from freezing trap is blue, etc.
---
Any dagger rogues that didnt have &amp; passed, really didnt understand how good this item is.
---
Why even have a word then?
---
The word itself is used to describe something specific 
---
For example joke is to arm, what meme is to elbow.
---
You wouldnt call your bicep your elbow but you could refer to your elbow as "i hit my arm"
---
Also the definition of meme is not narrow..

Get literally any bag addon and it will highlight your quest items so you can keep them together easier.

Appreciate the nice words! :)

Can anyone explain how the agi-&gt;AP conversion actually works for hunters? Every guide says each agi point is worth about 2.5 AP unbuffed, and 2.8AP fully buffed, but how do they get the extra 0.5/0.8AP? Are they effectively converting that from the %crit you get from agi, or kings buff, or from talents (most guides do not take the % agi in survival until much later gear).

I leveled up engineering to 200 and want to pick up Gnomish Engineering to make the fun gadgets before I drop/re-level for Goblin Eng. [WoWHead says that the quest for Gnomish Eng is from Roxxik in Orgrimmar](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=29477/gnomish-engineering), but he has no quests at all for me.  I don't see any pre-requisites listed other than having 200 Eng, and I'm exactly 200/225. Any idea what I'm missing here? When I talk to Roxxik, he only has a "Train Me" prompt.

Buy the Nightfin Soup Recipe from Gikkix in Steamwheedle Port (Tanaris)

It's 1 raw nightfin snapper and 1 refreshing spring water to make and the food gives 10 Mp5 for the well fed buff.

You sure? Did you check all languages?

ElvUI does this.

I mean missing ones in the central area which might be impacting the flight (heck if I know which one is actually needed though).

At some point after making this post I read into this as well, and was pretty surprised to see guides suggesting you stop getting hit after 6% if you are at 305 weapon skill.
---
I have access to 9% from gear now without the devilsaur set, so guess I’ll be skipping that for now!
---
That's why you join a guild that uses loot council
---
I growl everything that turns to someone else. That's fine. I'm talking about essentially charging in as if they were the tank. Do some AOE shit, getting such a headstart of threat that even if I growl, why would it matter? There's still 3 other mobs hitting this "Details-in-chat-spamming" guy. I can only growl once every 10 seconds.  
---
Mages doing this are the worst, because they really can't survive 10 seconds of getting hit, and it's harder grabbing the mobs with them kiting them. Rogues can maybe survive 10 seconds, but they never aggro more than one anyway, and they usually want to lose aggro so they can hit in the back. Warriors go with "I can take a few hits", but we then need to wait for him to eat, or the healer have to spend mana on him.  
---
And if you're a warrior and want to go that fast, why didn't you step up to tank? Could've saved the group 30 minutes right at the start there.
---
I wrote in chat, "lf tank for scholo." A rogue messages me "60 rogue."
---
As i reply to him sorry looking for a tank, my message doesnt send because he had ignored me for his own mistake instantly.
---
Exactly, a ret paladin can deal with being oom.
---
He messaged me too last night. I think you were actually ignored because he was level 52 as well.
---
I dont know why but I love that look on the pink guys face.
---
A very similar setup was seen in Diablo II as a tribute to this scene, as well.
---
So you think warriors are stacking spirit and playing as trolls to get some passive HP regen going?  It isn’t happening.  Trolls are the least played race as warrior and it isn’t close.

It's wild to me that nobody said anything about your awesome save. I always bring that up. ALWAYS. "Good job, team!" "You killed it on that pull, \[name\]!" Maybe it's the hallmark of a good group leader, though, to give people both positive and negative feedback. I'm a supervisor at my IRL job and I refuse to only give people negative feedback. Helping people see their strengths can be just as useful, too, and honestly? When it's in person, you get to see their face light up at being recognized, and that's pretty nice. Everyone makes mistakes and most of the time we know when we do it (or find out about it later); it's just as good to get equal feedback on the good things we do, too, because those aren't things that get brought up often.
---
And sure, I do this mostly in a real life setting, but I try to bring it into dungeon groups, too. If anyone goes above and beyond, they deserve to know about it. A tank grabs up threat well when a dps accidentally pulls? PRAISE. The healer comes in clutch and we pull through like champions? PRAISE. Dps go all out in helping mop up a bad pull by CCing, pulling off healer, off-tanking, off-healing? PRAISE. It's not hard and it makes people feel good. It also encourages them to bring their best to their group interactions!
---
Usually succi is the best choice in wPvP. A CC that is usable even when you are stunned/polyd/etc. In bgs a lot would go for the puppy for dispels.
---
If you know you're going to fight a warrior or a rogue - then maybe VW is a better choice. But if you're not sure what's coming for you, the demon lady is far more versatile.

I hit 54 on quests from ungoro and hinterlands and then I immediately went to BRD to try and get done the 12 or something quests there. BRD runs basically to 56/57 and then LBRS quests to 58 and then it’s just spam all dungeons for BiS. No point waiting to get BiS by doing quests  if you can get into dungeons at 58.
---
I got one of those when I was doing the escort quest for Deadmines.  Dude kept following me asking me to share the quest and told me off when I didn't answer him fast enough.  I finally said I was doing the last of a chain that he'd already have if he had started it and he promptly ignored me.  Fuck me, right?
---
I'm in the same boat so I'll answer -
---
Basically epic mounts are pointless except as a status symbol. If you aren't actually running around the world constantly the speed bonus does nothing. And the bonus is extremely overrated to begin with. If you want to go to BRS you'll show up all of like 10 seconds after someone on an epic mount, big deal. If anyone else in your group has a normal mount you'll  be waiting on them anyway. 
---
Those of us who are already raid geared mostly just sit around in cities anyway or play alts, so it's even more a waste of gold because we aren't ever mounted at all. 
---
Honestly, just mount up next to a person with an epic mount and go to the same location at the same time as them and it's pretty plain to see in my opinion. The terribly slow speed at which they gain distance and pull away from you is not worth 900g at all. 
---
I will say, they are neat status symbols and look much better than normal mounts, and that might be worth 900g depending on what you're after in the game. But a lot of people think they save soOoOOOOoOO much time and it's just not true unless you're constantly doing open world quests running around plaguelands and such.
---
Not sure if you are using these, as you mentioned using the LFG addon; type into chat:
---
 /join lookingforgroup
---
 /join lfg
---
Those will put you into two additional channels (like trade, city, area channels) which are specific to forming groups. People advertise what they're looking for and what they've got. 
---
The key to all of these is that if you're using an addon, you'll only be talking with people using that same addon. Same with any one channel. So I recommend joining several channels, and advertising from a main city rather than Kargath, as some people form groups in city chat too.

Nah I’m not Gatekeeping anything since I said I don’t call anyone out in chat and just throw out a gz. I’m not allowed to have my own preferences as to what I believe is achievement worthy and what isn’t and not be an asshole about it? That’s now considered hate keeping?
---
Yeah, he had me until he said "tanking isn't fun." Hard disagree there.
---
I'm not doing this shit so I can get free invites to UD Strat (have everything I need and hate the fucking place and pugs anyway), I'm doing this because it's the most fun role in WoW to me. I guess I'm just lucky in that regard.
---
Yeah OP I'm the same as you. I came to Heartseeker early from Stalagg as horde. I came because I hated the queue and I wanted a server with a good balanced ratio of horde to alliance. At the time, HS was about 60% alliance to 40% horde, albeit low pop. Well after the last round of transfers the numbers swelled to us being high pop only no horde came. Only alliance. It's hell here. I've kept track of numbers manually on two accounts ever since they broke the census and it really is 80% to 20% right now at its best. For 55-60 its around 83% to 17%. As horde you can't quest in many zones at all. You will never make it to BRD without dying many times. What kills me too is seeing the high level alliance ganking lowbie horde. It's like, do you guys want this realm to die? Because if horde can't make it to 60 then that's going to happen. They already are rerolling elsewhere, and when transfers come its just going to kill the server dead because only alliance will come to it and the remaining horde will flee.
---
That said I'm enjoying the people ive met on this server. I've made new friends in my guild and it's been pretty enjoyable doing stuff with them so it isn't all bad news.
---
Also, if you're horde the windfury buff is much stronger on sword rogue with slice and dice up.
---
IIRC he was 33 last I checked. He could be 40 by now, if not close.

I once had a troll player tell me unironically that language was given to humans by aliens in the form of ancient sumerian.

Maybe it’s because under 40 there’s not a lot of big gets for sub rogues but I never need it makes me feel weird idk why I understand it’s in the game for a reason if you need something need it but I don’t know just have a hard time

It's arguably worse now than it ever was back then regarding certain stats and items. I had a terrible staff on my Mage and had the dagger with spirit/stam drop in RFK. I had the OH from the SFK quest in my bank and the dagger was a massive upgrade. I rolled need and won. The Priest who rolled need as well though his upgrade would've been minimal compared to mine couldn't believe it. Didn't think I used spirit at all. Just trashed me like a spoiled kid the rest of the run.
---
I had the same thing happen regarding the neck that drops in RFD where there were 3 Mages, myself included, and a Priest healer and we all 4 needed on it. One of the mages won, and the Priest went crazy telling us we were idiots and that most Priests would leave etc etc.
---
Unfortunately, there is a rather large amount, at least right now, of brand new players who may have played for a very short period of time during a given expansion or simply have never played at all, and they seem to be mostly children who haven't a clue how the game works. At least back then, everyone was relatively young and no one knew what they were doing. Now we have much younger kids because of how much more accessible a good computer and internet connection is mixing with a bunch of adults who have been playing for 15 years. The two don't mix, but the kids will leave in droves assuming they haven't already started too.
---
&gt;Too many people forget this is a team game.
---
That's the truth - I feel guilty lately too because I'm usually very aware of the tanks aggro but my spec - I just can't help it. I was going through SM last night and, I'm a sub rogue so my ambush does like 900dmg buffed with 80% crit - so it happens all the time, that amount of burst dmg I'm always pulling threat from the tank on that one mob. 
---
I try to keep as close to the tank as possible so the mob isn't far away from the rest of the huddle but, I feel like there's nothing I can do about it. 
---
If I was in your group - how would you feel about it?
---
All I can say is try it. But you’ll notice more people grouping and talking. You can find guilds who are more your speed. Check it out.
---
Sounds like a good deal, where do you find sellers? Just hanging out in dire maul general chat?

If you want all engineering gimmicks, I believe you need to train up to 300 as Gnomish, craft all the Gnomish only items, then unlearn and retrain to 300 as Goblin.

I healed lbrs as a level 50 Paladin. It's really not that bad, only thing is you need to make sure your group pulls mobs accordingly because you can't skip as much as them. We even did the ogre head on a pike boss with no deaths!

&gt;then I see him typing in trade chat "WTS Pristine Hide of the Beast" in trade chat the next 3 days without accepting the CoD so he could resell it for a higher price, so I couldn't even try to sell it.

Take a look at which herbs are selling well on your server. On mine Mountain Silversage and Gromsblood are both 50-70s each (10-14g a stack). As a druid you can just run routes in EPL, Silithis, Winterspring (if Icecap sells, doesnt on mine tho). I do this on my mage and have made a few hundred gold, with very minimal effort as I have other farms I've been focusing on.

---
No it is not 60/40. I don't know where on earth you got that. I've literally been on two accounts for the last three weeks keeping a tab. It's closer to 75% to 25% at it best if you count low levels below 30. When you get to 55+ it's about 83% alliance to 17% horde.

I wish you luck man. I'm glad you're remaining positive.

I was ranting about this in guild chat the other day.

Without a tank and a healer you are not a group. 
---
If you are not a group, you cannot be "looking for more" you are "looking for a group"
---
**Appropriate LFXM/LFG:**
---
1. LF1M: DPS, Healer, Tank
---
2. LF2M: 2DPS, DPS + Heals, DPS + Tank
---
3. LF3M: 3DPS
---
4. LFG: 1DPS, 1Tank, 1Heals
---
5. LFG: 2DPS, Tank+DPS, Heals+DPS
---
6. LFG: 3DPS
---
**Inappropriate LFXM/LFG:**
---
1. LF3M: Tank, Healer, and 1DPS - ***NOOOOO!*** You are **not** an existing group, looking for more!  You are two dps clowns looking for a group to join!
---
2. LF4M: Tank, Healer, and 2DPS - I don't think anyone is dumb enough to do this.  Obviously you're just 1 person...I think you know that.
---
So, as a rule:
---
1. Group of 4 - Always "LFM"
---
2. Group of 3 - Only "LFM" if you already have either a tank or a healer, otherwise you're LFG
---
3. Group of 2 - Only "LFM" if you are a tank and a healer.
---
4. Group of 1 - Always "LFG"
---
It's not actually Blizzard, there's a circumflex on the i. But I get your point, the name filter should probably take into account diacritics in this case.

Btw, I don't like when people name their characters Légóläs or similar because it makes them harder to type out if the characters aren't part of your keyboard layout.

No, people will definitely need on on your 15g BoE because of that attitude and there being no universally agreed upon threshold.

I mean op is getting shit for a boe upgrad he genuinely needed.

People are fucking stupid and selfish.
---
We were both pretty geared and still had some close calls, but over time we got better and would have the really clean attempts finish with me still having 80% hp. If you grab some cheap health pots it'll make your life much easier. 
---
You also make a decent amount of gold during this as you're going to average 3g-ish per kill (split 2 ways though) and it's really quick to do. Especially since I still have enchanting and DEd the lower blues

---
I've been just manually searching on two accounts myself since Census got broken. It's not anywhere close to 60/40 though like the guy you replied to says.
---
It depends on the role you are fulfilling. Hard hitting, slow weapons are important for arms warriors dealing damage. Fast weapons with high DPS are good for tanks for the rage generation. Fury warriors (I think) want a slow main hand and fast off-hand, but maybe another fury warrior could chime in.

You have to level eng to 300, pick whichever you want first, learn everything &amp; then drop eng. Then level again to get the other.

I mean I have Codex installed so I can figure out the best way to do quests easily enough. But yeah, I work full time, got a family, other stuff to do, all that. I play a bit in evenings and weekend mornings and that's about it.

As a troll hunter lv42 I was refused from an Uldaman group by a 43 mage 'Need 1 DPS Ulda no summs', to which i said 'i'll go, hearth is in kargath' his given reason being 'your are too low, sry'. He didnt spend the 30 seconds it would have taken to know I have a very strong bow w/ +5 scope, Broken Tooth, or that i am building directly into a dps spec, no points wasted in soloing talents, and i have a fun fascination w/ getting my explosive trap in; in other words, i can almost guarantee i would have brough more output than this elitist and likely the rest of his group too, but he preferred to sit in LFG for the next half hour b/c somehow my level / class is a liability to him. 
---
Even when its not about carrying a less functional dps, there are people out there who will refuse you for no good reason at all.
---
I’ll turn around to my roommate (who is playing right behind me) and be like:
---
“Is it a dick move to roll on this item as a hunter?”
---
And he’s like “I mean yeah but how bad do you want it?”
---
He likes to see me piss off the people on my server lmfaoo....
---
&gt;Druid tanks aren’t great at holding aggro on multiple mobs.
---
Wut? Druids are far better than Warriors at tanking multiple things. Paladins can be better but lack taunt and drink after every pull.
---
Apparently the method gold sellers use now is to just have the Gold Buyer list a trash item in the AH for an exorbitant price, then the Gold Seller purchases it. So buying gold for someone else to get them banned won't do anything

Saturday and Sunday all day on Thunderfury.

hey thanks man im gonna do that
---
I'm assuming Albion Online because that's exactly how we did things. In AO you are basically forced into a community thinking. It's all of you(your guild and alliance) against the world. 
---
Doing dungeons or ganking groups, all loot is registered - profit is calculated and then the total is split by members present. Whoever was party leader goes on and either sells or use the gear himself
---
as a fellow undead rogue player, I find that this time around, more of us embody wild raccoons. Definitely true of me. Curious, dangerous, getting into places we absolutely shouldn't be, equal parts playful and psycopathic, practically on a coin flip. Running into us as alliance could be the best or the worst thing that's happened to you all day.
---
Oh sorry, forgot to specify. I am currently arms, and plan to raid as 2H Fury in the beginning. So my question is for big 2hers.
---
Yo
---
That’s not true lol. I am a mitigation Druid for 10/10 MC guild (server first) and have 0 issues holding threat off of rogues with perditions blade and mages with staff of dominance.  
---
If you’re the tank with the initial Agro, you’re going to hold threat than the other tanks almost all of the time. 
---
Druids are neck and neck with warriors. It depends on the fight. But just like EVERY fight in the game, let the tank get 5 seconds of Agro then you can start dpsing. You usually won’t catch the tank unless he gets stunned or misses hits.
---
Yeah blame pserver players for figuring out over the years what best for each class. What did you expect coming back to a 15 year old game when a lot of people kept playing? Everyone still be as ignorant as they were 15 years ago?
---
1 main tank that’s why I thought it was odd when they told me I should respec knowing molten core prolly needs 3 deeps Prot build tanks (normally) an onyxia incase shit went south with main.
---
Oh man, a group I joined took on Archaedas while we were all appreciably underleveled for the fight. It took four attempts but we got him down by the seat of our pants, namely because our Feral tank was a beast of a Druid player.
---
One of the most fun experiences I’ve had thus far in Classic, though. We knew we were underleveled but wanted it so bad lol.
---
I would second the elementals in badlands, there are two spots one north and one south if one spot is taken.
---
Sounds fair.  A lesser wand and lesser heal &gt; *
---
We did but only a minority of players really followed them. I played since release and remember it all about as well as someone can remember details from 15 years ago. I remember people needing to wait for sunders before DPSing. Mages were not doing 1.5k DPS on trash pulls in Strat Live. The game is different: 5+ years of playing 1.12 on private servers taught people a lot. Even those who didn’t touch a private server benefit from all the knowledge accrued and the developed meta. It would actually be ridiculous if after all this time we didn’t get better and faster.
---
And what about Rag was harder in Vanilla 1.12? He still hits tanks like a truck if they don’t have max FR. he still has the same HP. He still has the same abilities. The same submerge timer. We just 1 phase it now because the average raider is doing 400DPS 2 months after release. How else can you explain it?

I'll still say that's probably the sign of a bad healer, or at least an inexperienced one.
---
If you pull aggro in one of my groups, that's on you. I'll throw out a rejuv on you, maybe a Nature's Swiftness+Healing touch if I'm feeling frisky, but you'll have to manage your threat and let the tank re-establish aggro. Keeping the tank up is my first priority, keeping myself up is second, and keeping bad dps who don't understand aggro mechanics up is third.

Warrior is the most gear dependant, skilled based and dependant (of others, mainly healers) class in the game.
---
But Warrior is also arguably the best class in the game, you are the only real raid tank, one of the best DPS's in the game and arms is one of the most vital PVP specs in the game.

Edit: I didn't roll a warrior because I had no IRL friends to play with and didn't want to do the 1-60 alone, you have almost done the hard part. Trust me, warrior is SO fun once you learn how to PVP and are in groups together. I will be rolling warrior as my first alt, for sure!
---
So I swapped to that build around the same level. A few things that worked well for me:  
---
5/5 convection and concussion, 3/3 elemental warding and call of flame, 1/1 elemental focus, 5/5 call of thunder and lightning mastery, 1/1 storm reach and 1/1 elemental fury and elemental mastery
---
In resto then go 5/5 tidal focus and totemic focus, totemic mastery, 3/3 natures guidance and after that it’s not super important but get 5/5 tidal mastery
---
• get a 5 second rule addon.  
---
• burst a mob initially with searing totem down, several LBs, frost shock to slow them down and then melee the rest of their life down with rockbiter weapon.  
---
• get a lot of water from mates as you will drink every 4-5 mobs most likely
---
• wear cloth or leather if needed to get int.  
---
• spirit is not desirable as it doesn’t help regenerate mana during combat. Mp5 does, but is not super common.
---
Yea, it becomes useless. Like not having anything in that slot.
---
You should train Dire Bear Form, it's much better.
---
This boomer vs. zoomer shit is getting fucking tiring.
---
Just be clear at the start if you are going to need on stuff you don't need so I drop right away and find another group to heal.
---
Druid gear is free loot basically for alot of guilds.

Yeah I reported then screenshot it

If he doesn’t understand why it is a problem he is probably doing you a favor in the long run.
---
The 3 people on Incendius who had it as of last week were price fixing. I got the mats not realizing it was a rare enchant and the guy that responded when I asked in Trade said he'd get in trouble for charging less than 40g+mats. After buying Robe of Winter Night and +4stats mats I was too broke to pay his "tip" so he got nothing, which makes no sense to me.
---
Yeah, I think you might enjoy it. Leveling is a slow process in classic (I'm sitting at 45 now, and taking a couple of evenings per level lately, but "an evening" for me is maybe 2-3 hours). It's a much more social game than retail is, though.
---
When doing quests, the pattern typically looks like this: Set out alone, get to quest area, meet people doing the same quest and group with them. Potentially do more quests with these people, if they're nice.
---
For dungeons, you talk in the lfg chats, using an emergent language of lingo and abbreviations that an outsider will be unable to parse. Don't worry, you will learn quickly. Once you have a group, definitely talk to them! All the best runs are when you actually talk to the group.
---
What's with the sudden resurgence of ninjas trying to make these posts to justify being terrible people?
---
Yes I agree. In dungeons i only wipe on trash mobs never on bosses
---
Edit: it’s mostly because people don’t really keep an eye on the packs you skipped and booty pull them
---
No rep. Yes it’s repeatable. Grab 300 shellfish from the traps off the coast and spend 30 min spamming complete quest on that guy for 55s per 5 shellfish.
---
How do you get a warrior to the end without dieing? Or is the instance green when chest is spawned?
---
I'm a little lost for why this dude got upset? Simply because you didn't agree right away or...?
---
Only if you want to see the content.  Depends on your class too...  I still have the shoulders on at 39

Let's say you have an xbox and I have a playstation. We're out for a walk one day and we find a garage sale. The person is just cleaning up and says "Hey anybody want this old copy of Halo 2 for free?" and we both say "I want it!" simultaneously. The guy flips a coin, and says I win it. If I say "Sweet im gonna sell this" and you want to play it. You like Halo, and you already have means to play the game. Who is greedy and who "needs" it? Sure I "need" money, but I would say it's clear that I'm being greedy taking that item that I can't even use just because it has universal value.
---
I am honored. But I think my post was removed by the moderators for being a "low quality meme", so that sucks.
---
I think he's trying to imply it's not OP's picture and he got it from somewhere else
---
Who even cares lol
---
How do you report them?  You can't click on their name.
---
You are correct! But damn it would make life easier :-p
---
Oh damn!
---
I thought this was WoW in Warcraft 3.. Not the other way around! Took me a moment to realise :p
---
I know, it's just that it's my first time plaiyng WoW so it's a shame I didn't get to see it.
---
I have an auto-dismount addon which does exactly what you’d expect, dismounts when you press anything basically (spells, flight paths etc). So just pressing levitate does that for me already :)
---
I thought that for a long time. Like "pssst, whisper."
---
Can’t believe I’m the only shaman who has filled this out so far but hey, zug zug baby
---
Raid team stability through reliable attendance is a very important factor for success. Not only do they make that critical for getting loot, but by allowing people mass tons of DKP via a history of attendance you supply them with "golden handcuffs" that keep them bound to the guild -- it's hard to walk away from a mountain of DKP without sticking around for "just a few more weeks" for the chance to spend it.
---
The system also removes almost all drama from loot allocation by making it completely mechanical. There are no in-the-moment decisions involved beyond deciding to take a piece or not. Handling loot will go very quick so the raid doesn't lose momentum.
---
The people who will complain the most about that system are people who know they can't attend reliably but want to earn loot at the same pace as people who are attending reliably, and newcomers. You can always give newcomers a "signing bonus" of DKP to solve their complaint; unreliable loot whores can fuck right off though.

Get Zygor guide, enjoy leveling

Play Red read redemption 2 and classic.

Good times

Me: Finally, a weekend at home without plans.
---
Me: Kevin.
---
You rolled a rogue, and maxed out your character progression for then current patch, and ARENT out there slaying every enemy faction member you see...
---
Why did you even roll rogue?
---
Wayyy better options. The class trinket is better. Second Wind is better. Briarthorn is better. Spell crit isn't bad, but it's not something you need unless you're specifically going for a regrowth build, and that's not really good until you get the tier set that supports it.
---

---
Just hit 60 and I wondered if players used threat meter in ony/MC?
---
Also as a melee dps, should i get fire resistance gear for MC and if so what amount show I aim for?
---
These threads always turn out great
---
Yes. Yes. No.
---
not everyone cares about efficiency.
---
Sorry, on mobile so this may come out a bit sloppy.

Some quick questions about dungeon healing as an Enhancement Shaman. Last night I had a pretty terrible time running WC as a Shaman healer (Lv 18). I specifically joined the group intending to be a healer since I enjoy healing in dungeons, but am specced as enhance for leveling purposes as I hear it can be done and have really encountered no problems doing it until last night. 
---
Long story short my group had a rather condescending Druid that irritated me the entire run. The overall group was sloppy to begin with since aggro was bouncing everywhere with people in the group arguing over loot as well as a bit of a faster pace than I’m comfortable with, but the Druid in particular made me a bit discouraged doing shaman healing in dungeons. 
---
After the first pull where we aggroed probably 3 different raptor mobs and some patrols (we barely survived due to general sloppiness) the Druid went “okay who’s healing?” So I naturally reply “me.” He just laughs and goes “nice joke” then orders me to switch to DPS and he’ll take over healing from there. I continued the rest of the run pretty much silent since I just wanted to finish the dungeon and not add to the frustration and turmoil of the group, but I still continued to try to dish in some heals here and there to mitigate the pressure as well as get some practice. 
---
My healing rotation would just basically be dumping stone skin totem or strength totem spamming rank 3 healing wave on our tank whenever he reached around 50% HP until he was at about 70% in order to conserve my mana. However there were times some “oh shit” clutch healing was necessary and that’s when the Druid would step in and dump in a fat heal to stabilize more. I have an INT set specifically for dungeon healing, but overall i did feel rather weak as a healer. I was just wondering if there’s a specific rotation or method to dungeon healing as a shaman because that honestly was really annoying and it made me tempted to just roll my priest for an easier when dealing with dungeon healing. 
---
I do get that no one can outheal stupidity or stubborn/fast pulls, but the fact that the condescending Druid was able to seem to pull more of an impact than me while healing left me wondering whether I’m actually healing correctly and how much of this is my fault. I do enjoy the flavor of the shaman overall, but if healing dungeons is going to feel this “inferior” i would rather just go with a simpler Priest. Any help or feedback would be appreciated though!
---
That will be our future.
---
Memes: Classic
---
What about for spelladins?
---
I’m just playing devils advocate here
---
I'm level 59 and I'm still salty about the god damned Ret pally that stole my whitemain's chapue because he heals "sometimes".
---
what?!"
---
The dude before Rag, my bad.
---
Still, you gotta get deep into MC **and** do the 4 bosses without so much as someone farting in their general direction, or yours.
---
Note that Bear tanks make excellent off tanks for adds during raids, and in fact are pretty solid main tanks in raids for bosses that don't have some special enrage or power hitting mechanic that requires a constant shield block. There's this myth that Bear tanks are completely non-viable in the endgame, which is simply not true and has been number crunched by many people already.
---
Plus once the add is dead, the druid can switch to cat mode to dps, while still providing valuable raid support in the form of Faerie Fire, Innervate, and combat res if a core healer or main tank drops.
---
Seems odd that i can pick a flower as a cat, but cant pick up an owlkin feather.
---
Almost every single one of these points can be achieved with a regular holy pally.
---
Ret pallies also can't be an emergency tank for shit, that would require them to be able to tank the mob.
---
Thanks for the laughs, I'm really curious how you managed to convince yourself a ret pally somehow brings more group/raid DPS by being worst dps than just about every other class.
---
Can you post it somewhere?
---
I’d like to have it in a second client folder for healing.
---
Thanks in advance 🧟‍♂️
---
I can only sell chestloot.
---
Barb blade is from boss
---
I say sell it - it cost you nothing to get it and the value for what you can get for it now is more important (because you have a specifically valuable thing to spend the money on). I found some Edgemaster's Handguards during leveling and sold them for less than they were being listed for (by about 10 percent). 
---
The guy who bought them was using them to MT his raid (they let you hit like you're level 61.5 with weapon skill) and I was able to make up what I needed to get my epic. I could have perhaps held them to sell to a twink when bgs come out, but by then what would I even need the gold for. I use my epic mount every day, totally worth it - win win for everyone involved.
---

---
I joined one of those guilds that gets spammed in chat just so I don't get whispers.
---
Wait, it's actually in World of Warcraft and not a Warcraft 3 mod you made haha You got me here.
---
Running a Warlock, I'll see might just give it a go to visit the place, is it very long?
---
I'm a rogue and somebody in dungeon group thought I was a fury warrior. I was like " Warriors wish they were me."
---
Most mobs lose aggro and there are tricks for those who dont
---
Yeah and that is literally only because of the leveling grind.
---
On a mechanics level? Yeah every raid will be faceroll.
---
I think the fastest or most effective route is to just wait until youre the right level
---
Yeah daggers played really differently in bc and wotlk, and poisons became an important part of your dps and rotation rather than an afterthought. In classic, combat just has too much stuff fir sf to compete til you have lots of gear.
---
Just want to make sure you aren't horde on Fairbanks. Wouldn't want to group with an idiot of your caliber
---
Around 30min
---
I just assume anyone as ignorant as that is a MoP baby and never played Vanilla when it was live
---
Sure would hate to have to spend over 1k for epic mount huh...oh wait.
---
You can two man farm the Drakestone with a mage and warlock, skip to dragon bosses and reset. You get instanced capped easily.
---
I only hear 'I must pee.' Surely that's not what he says, but still...
---
Run it dude! Experience it. Find some low levels to help through it
---
Yeah... No. When I post LFM xx in world lfg channel, I can get 10 or more whispers from people. I'm not replying to every single person that I didn't invite. Ain't nobody got time for that!
---
Look into SilverDragon and RareAware. Need both. Need to use the macro it wants you to make. It isn't perfectly automatic.
---
Closest thing to NPCScan as it gets.
---
Body pulls in general lead to more wipes than anything else in my experience.
---
I disagree about eye of the beast.  0/30/21 Druid is going to get a lot of mileage because they're using Healing Touch as a lot.
---
I’m currently dual swords, If this drops and no one bothers with it should I switch to daggers right away?
---
I played 3 toons to max level in vanilla. 2 alliance and a horde dude. This isn't new I just have far less time than before
---
doesn't it restore the target's mana? if the pally healer LoHs the tank, that doesn't leave the healer with any mana.
---
I said everytime I log onto my alt, which was never alluded to once per day and If you are logging onto your AH / Bankalt once a day theres one problem right there. Also thats literally just from herb not counting any BoE blues or anything else I do on AH. I was able to afford my epic mount as soon as I turned 60 and I haven't done a single AoE grind for gold.
---
Oh I did take the servey. Then it bugged and (without showing me the results) said "you have already taken the survey". Guess I have to clean up my cache to see it...
---
You ignore the possibility that the item isn't on the ah. 
---
IMO it's a matter of ettiquite not of logic. Also if everyone is going to greed, why have need before greed at all?
---
Edit: I'm not saying either convention is better.
---
amazing for non-human fury warriors
---
Interesting , always wanted one of these as I’m a grindy guy. I’ll try it out!
---
If I wasn’t poor as dirt I’d give you platinum for that shit
---
Raid content is so easy in current tier that the part that take the most time is walking to the raid. As for dps, it is threat capped by the tank.
---
Nah what I do is to wait first and check whether they can upgrade. If so they take it but must equip it. If they don’t, they get kicked.
---
That's why when tanking, and taking shortcuts I wait for the entire group to pass through. There is ALWAYS going to be that guy that asspulls a pack.
---
It would be useful, especially in Ony.
---
Downranking requires +healing gear to be effective. But with a lot of it, it makes lower level heals VERY mana efficient, beyond the concerns of the 5s mana regen rule. But this is all very endgame stuff as no one takes +healing gear while leveling, typically favoring regular stats like Int and Spirit as they apply to all spell types and generally make leveling easier.
---
Stitches and his million meter aggro radius is enough for you guys to deal with over there lol.
---
Pretty sure I will, I always mean to go to undercity but started doing quests in desolace and I'm stuck there questing :-)
---
Even info from late-Vanilla era Thottbot comments are innacurate to our version of WoW, seeing as they had 20x as much time in-game to build up their wealth.
---
I’m in the camp that everyone should greed boe epics due to their increased value over other drops, but this argument is kind of weak.
---
I just hit one day played at 60 yesterday and I can’t afford some of the larger prices of the AH. There are some BOEs that if I win the greed roll I would equip, but to say I don’t need the item because I haven’t purchased it already is not a logical look.
---
You’ll never settle this argument because people are firmly in two camps. Either it’s a ninja to need it from someone else that would equip it or it isn’t.
---
You’ll never change everyone’s mind but luckily there’s enough people in both camps that both groups of players should be able to play the game the way they want. Just state loot rules before the run and if someone disagrees they can go get a group with rules that match their expectations.
---
this is how you get nothing but 1 warrior, 1 priest, 3 mage groups. fuck off, thanks.
---
It's classic, no one would recognize bad performance anyway
---
Even if you're healing in raids?
---
Ah ok I'll run it then, maybe tonight.
---
I like the trolls on the east side of Arathi Highlands. I don't know what the GPH is, but I think this is the best silk farming spot that I know of. Since silk cloth is still crashed, I make heavy silk bandages and vendor them for 80 silver a stack.   
---
Also I play Alliance on a PvP server, so sometimes the horde will not let me solo grind this spot, usually if it's like past 6 PM and they are all riled-up looking to gank people.
---
I was doing the quest in the cave in Kurzen's compound in STV the other day where you have to get an item from a chest about halfway in. I cleared the mobs around the chest and got the quest item. Just as I'm about to leave I get a random group invite and I decline. I then whisper the guy to say no thanks I'm leaving. He replies "c'mon at least clear to the chest" I reply " It's clear, I just got it" his response? " You're a fucking asshole" my response "and you're a scrub" then I hit ignore
---
Conversely. Let's say we split a lottery ticket and the grand prize happens to be a house. 
---
Our ticket wins, you own a house already, I don't, does it make sense for me to get the house? Shouldn't we sell it and split the profit? 
---
That copy of Halo 2 has minimal value, just like random boe that don't cost much. 
---
That skullflame shield is 500g, which is literally 15~ hours of gold farming. That's a lot of value.
---
I always say it's faster to clear a couple packs of mobs then it is to die and run back when somebody booty pulls them.
---
There is a way to be a true human druid. You can eat the poisoned fruit thing in EPL as a druid and turn into a human scarlet crusade druid.
---
I’ve done it in burning crusade. I think I remember just putting a grey up for 1000g.
---
we also did it at 42, took a few attempts to find the right combination of when to burn what cool down.
---
But entire group was super proud of that victory.
---
Thanks. I've actually been leveling up my Shaman more than my Priest as of late. In the end, it came down to me enjoying meleeing more than wanding, lol.
---
This is why I don’t COD anything to anyone besides my friends. If someone wants to personally buy something from me, we’re meeting in a major city and trading.
---
really? The one time I went there I guess no one did it. Me as A shadow who was healing that shit had alot to do in that fight to keep everyone alive...
---
It's up to you if you think it's worth postponing leveling to see the content. You could do that, or you could do it on an alt at some point in the future.
---
Or dual wield axes as fury prot orc and never have a threat issue...
---
I would probably want to avoid paladins as a horde unless I'm in a group. We have so many cds/auras to prolong the fight and you never know if we're carrying full reckoning stacks. At full reckoning with a good 2h weapon, any cloth wearer is pretty much one shot. Combined with improved blessing of freedom and cleanse, you're hoping we don't get within range of our stun/swing. Melee classes usually rely on critical strikes and stuns which just stack more reckoning at which point we can bubble out of a stun, heal, and deal a massive blow for most, if not all of your health. It just seems like it would be more trouble than its worth especially without honor in the game yet.
---
The funny thing is that they're (we're) legit for DPS during the leveling process. It's only end-game content where they get out-classed on damage. This gets amplified with raid gear.
---
I was running SM the other day as DPS in a solid guild group and I was right at the top, trading places often with the tank (warrior with 6 levels on me, tanking 2h arms spec) and a hunter of equal level. I could tell from watching the meters that the hunter was fighting hard to top me. He told me at the end that he was really surprised we were neck and neck the whole time.
---
You should always use a threat meter,  yes. There's no excuse not to.
---
I just leveled 1-10 with a friend because it's pretty awful otherwise.
---
I was at 330ish and never got kicked. Feels good man.
---
It should come up in the chat window. I just right click on the name and a menu comes up where you will see report player. Maybe it's a chat setting that's why I see it, yours may be set up different if you can't do that.
---
Yeah, it feels like a PvE server at this point. The sad part is that I still don’t regret the move. Being on the smaller side of an overwhelming imbalance just makes the game not fun to do anything in the open world. At least now I can do things without at least 3 corpse runs. 
---
Merging horde and ally dominant servers together could be a solution, but then there would be so many total people that it’s probably not plausible without layering forever.
---
Oh. Thought this was an mmo not an rpg. Weird flex, but okay.
---
really its designed to be a resto talent, since you swap into it for DPS and out of it to heal. Letting you keep damage up while switching forms. The players doing what they do though made it an exploitable thing for feral DPS or hybrid PvP specs.
---
It got immortalized in retail since thats what tigers fury does now post BC.
---
I had to layer swap to fix it. It was broken on one layer, but not the other. It’s also WPL.
---
Planetcraft 2.
---
Live free, in the NC. For the *Horde*.
---
Just like a mage needs more than just frostbolt, it's a joke buddy. In reality a warriors raid UI could have 4-5 macros with modifiers to include all their utility.
---
oh my god its beautiful........
---
Give Andi on kurrinax a chance! Best pally NA!
---
Do you play on a pvp server? Cuz being able to outrun a gank mob comes in pretty handy. Also, chasing down ppl who only have their 60% mounts is super fun. 100?% is so worth it
---
For 1/3rd of your auto damage.
---
Passing the special hit cap is absolutely beneficial for mh swings even if hs cancelling.
---
Tell us more about how bringing a ret paladin will slow your group down by half while also not admitting that your group is terrible to begin with.
---
And you’re not 13 anymore learning how to play MMOs.
---
Huh??
---
As a tank, I refuse to join groups with "reserved" loot, even if it's just caster gear or something.
---
We are all participating, we all get a chance at the rewards.
---
Showing me that an npc can repair instead of having to click and go into their dialogue.
---
This is really useful to know! Thanks a bunch!!!
---
Your loot rules are not the default. If rules are not set before the dungeon there are no rules.
---
If youre able to acquire a heartseeker &amp; bonescraper then Id say that you absolutely could yes.
---
&gt;runned
---
Screwing someone out of a legit upgrade that dropped because you're selfish is fuckery.
---
Not working for me currently - when I click download it just leads to a blank screen.
---
You can't be serious
---
&gt; but to say I don’t need the item because I haven’t purchased it already is not a logical look.
---
Why not? You have the same access to wealth as everyone else playing the game. You have put value on things in a way that leads you to not having enough gold to buy an item. That’s your choice. If you truly needed something you would have made it a priority.
---
Hell, you’ll even see warriors with them. Crescent Staff from WC quests has like 20dps, while many similar level weapons are in the mid teens.
---
I don't think there was anyone doing speedruns during retail Naxx so I don't know what you were comparing the ones done on private servers too. But that is totally besides my point.
---
Naxx was a pretty big increase in difficulty compared to anything Blizz had done before, especially on the later bosses. That's why I'm saying it was difficult for the time it was released. And no offense but your guild clearing the easier bosses, maybe during the TBC pre patch even is no indication on how difficult the raid was.
---
By todays standards, of course it's not hard compared to what came after, most importantly Mythic encounters. But you can't just judge a raid's difficulty in retrospect, the same as you shouldn't judge it through nostalgia goggles.
---
Going back to the Sprinter example I gave earlier: Running 100m in less than 10 seconds was mind blowing in the 1970's, doing so today is expected and if you want to accomplish something, 9.8x times are needed. Times change and context is important.
---
Prot pallies are the highest dps tank by far so long as you are pulling multiple adds. Ret aura, cons, sanct, holy shield is a ton of dmg if you are getting attacked. I leveled as prot and tanked a bit at 60 before going ret and regularly out dpsd warrs, rogues, and mages on pulls. That isnt a ret thing thats a prot pally thing.  
---
Ret suffers from mana issues (same as prot) and is very crit dependent. But I still pull 200+ dps single target on most fights as a ret against non-ud single targets. That tends to be close to similarly geared mages, warrs and rogues. Where ret falls off is on longer fights where their mana limits their dps.
---
How are you getting that info?  I'm interested to see what the ratio is on my server.
---
He isnt argueing against the everyone need ruleset, he just doesnt want to be a part of it.
---
&gt; Poisons work like weapon enchants, right?
---
No, you can have a weapon enchant and poisons on a weapon.
---
Think of poisons more as coating your weapon (or sharpening it like the +weapon dmg from Sharpening stones)
---
&gt;How long do poisons last?
---
30minutes or until stacks are used up (can be way before 30minutes)
---
&gt;Should I always have poisons on my weapons?
---
In pve: if you want that extra dmg sure, Instant poison if mobs dont live a long time, deadly poison if they do.
---
In pvp: Always, you get great tools from some poisons to help in pvp like crippling poison or mindnumbing poison.
---
&gt; Are poison vendors in most cities?
---
im not 100% sure but theres one in every city next to rogue trainer so not that difficult to find.
---
&gt;I mostly run dungeons, because I like grouping with my guild and other players. Are there specific poisons I would benefit from more than others? I’m on a PvE server.
---
Like my previous answer, Instant poison are for applying quicker dmg, while deadly poison needs to stack up before doing its most dmg.
---
If you ever raid though always use Instant poison as it doesnt take up a debuff slot on the boss.
---
&gt;Also is it easy to level up, similar to enchanting or lockpicking, where you can just apply it over and over again to get better at it and unlock better poisons? How much is it expected to cost me to max out at level 33?
---
Very easy, you litterally are provided with all the mats from the poison vendor to make and level up poisons. Just purchase and make poisons to level up.
---
at 33 the cost is still very low like maybe 10 silver to make 50 stacks.
---
Bonus info about poisons:
---
Their dmg count as magic dmg (nature) so you cant improve their dmg unless from talents.
---
(This is why hardcore raid guilds make rogues use Shadow Oil as this can be improved in dmg from shadowpriets/warlocks in the raid)
---
Horde rogues usually dont put a poison on their mainhand weapon. This is because windfury totem works the same as poisons in how its applied and if you got a poison on your weapon the windfury proc cant apply.
---
I did a lot of that as we’ll with a little crawfish mixed in. I’m trying to hash out what my best bet is for epic mount grinding- wether it be satyrs/furbolgs (added runecloth/pots/firewater/eko), Devilsaurs or even something more pedestrian like just grinding SM (since I do want the tabard as well)
---
If you only look at charts, sure. I’d rather have a Holy Paladin than a Druid or a Proest for a healer when I tank on my Druid for Kings and Salv rather than stacking buffs/Stam but at the end of the day It frankly doesn’t matter.
---
Same with DPS, I’d rather have a DPS bringing more than a bit of AP as a buff.
---
After you kill the king, you go back and talk to the guard first before you get the tribute chest.
---
&gt; As a tankadin Scholo is my bane.
---
Strat and Scholo are MADE for paladin tanking.
---
I had something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/GPcmW8A.jpg) back in Cata, but it was a very similar UI I used back in TBC, mostly some addons changing so I had to get creative
---
You made a Human Warrior and named him Mitchel?
---
Such creativity...

Here you go:

    /script SetCVar("cameraDistanceMax",30)
---
Not if I say MS = role you fulfill in the group. Anyway I've also seen cases where items did get deleted where no ML was the case.
---
Yup, same, it's all coming back to me but little things like kill order or making a wrong turn in ulda.  People have been very supportive.
---
I'm half and half about this. I certainly agree it's riskier. But the vast majority of issues I've had when we skip mobs is because one person in the dungeon is either vastly underleveled and getting carried, or more realistically some dumb ass priest or hunter doesn't understand aggro ranges and just walks backward straight into a group.
---
Wands aren't spells
---
Oh right. *That.*
---
Also have no trouble tanking zf 2h arms. Although certain bosses i do pull out the old sword n board. Mara same thing but on stone giants/princess i use 1h sheild. I plan on respecing at 52 to prot cuz im guessing itl make brd and onward easier.
---
I just remember how awful it was. But back then I wasn't good at the game so maybe things have changed for me. I don't have a problem with challenge but I just wanted suggestions.
---
&gt;Someone might not have enough gold to buy an item they need.
---
&gt;Then they don’t need it. They prioritized spending on something else, something they valued more. They are demonstrating they don’t need the item, they want it.
---
It's ok guys, just stop being poor!
---
This is a bad argument because something may have value greater than what the person has acquired to this point.  If someone wants something that is 1k gold, they need to have the 1k the instant they can use it or they are being lazy?  What if getting to 60 and then farming is better than farming the gold then getting to 60.  This is terrible logic and nonsense.
---
&gt;If a player truly needs a BoE item they would have already bought it from the AH. If they choose not to buy the item it is a clear demonstration they value gold more than the item (the WoW definition of greed). If they have bought the item they don’t need a second as (almost) all items are unique equipped.
---
As mentioned above, they may not have had the ability to make the money yet.  This also assumes the item is available to be purchased.  If the item is not for sale, then someone has little ability to buy it.
---
&gt;This logic holds for BoP items. Since there is only one source of acquiring these items (you have to kill a boss) it’s reasonable that a person would need that item. And since the gold value of BoP items is severely restricted the value to a player to equip the item is much higher than the vendor (or shard) cost.
---
Using your logic shouldn't people who take BoP items still reimburse the others in the party?  Relative value is irrelevant.  Some pug getting Dal'Rend main hand means nothing to me, shouldn't I get reimburse the weapon's value to him or at least my percentage of the sell price of the sword?
---
Exactly. Mix in some pvp. Learn classes strengths at different levels. Experiment against other players. Good times
---
Yep, my Shaman is rocking the Crescent Staff for the next 8 levels until Corpsemaker.
---
I have Thrash for MH was thinking about OH weapon
---
How are you going to afford two gut rippers and a mount at 40?
---
They were out door raid bosses that were highly sought after. So they never stayed up for long and the respawn times were rather long. Chances of randomly running across one is incredibly low.
---
Can't confirm it for classic but I had always heard in vanilla taking a pet with a Mana bar (e.g. caster) gave them worse stats. 
---
It seems like it's not working that way, based off this article https://www.wowhead.com/news=294853/hunter-caster-pets-glitch-seems-to-be-fixed-in-classic-wow
---
But they also haven't fully tested it.
---
Easy, if a younger person is arguing with you, they're a zoomer, if an older person is arguing with you, they're a boomer.

Arcanite Is a faster CD too

If it's a pug group. Everyone needs on high value BoEs. If it's a guild group. The people who can equip it and use it, will only roll need.
---
First thing first, always prepare for a session.  Make sure your character has plenty of ammo, consumables, food, water, everything.  Yes, it costs money, but you're going to make all that back and then some because your time is going to be so much more efficient.
---
Another thing is, have a plan.  If you don't have a lot of game knowledge, it's worth downloading an add-on like Guidelime (and a guide to go with it) to lead you through your questing.  It tells you exactly what to do and when, and keeps you on track.
---
Third thing, and this is a big one... Realize that there is a massive quest scarcity gap starting around level 30.  Have a plan for how you're going to get from 30-40.  It might be grinding mobs, it might be spamming dungeons, but you need to have a plan for those levels because that is where most people get their characters and then stop because they're so frustrated by the lack of quests and their characters start to "feel" bad, even though this gap is by design.  Adjust your mentality, know it's coming, and have a plan for it.  A lot of people choose to dungeon grind out these levels in SM and RFK, so if you're planning to do that, make sure you're doing things to make this as efficient as possible.  Keep plenty of supplies in your bags, set your hearthstone in a place that helps you get to a dungeon, and use your friends list to fill groups quickly.
---
It's not greedy though? It's literally stopping someone from ninjaing the item. If you don't like it don't group with randoms I have 15 years on this game, BoE that are worth a good amount are Need. You don't have to need but you're screwing yourself.
---
Funny stuff
---
Operating Ommokk's head during the fight causes a lot of damage to his minions. Someone should be assigned to use it as soon as it becomes available (about a 30 second cooldown).
---
other warriors on the quest can loot it if they fail theirs... we had a warrior in our group fail it and he looted it from the other warriors blade... needeless to say one of the warriors was kinda pissed
---
I noticed the main healing specs seem really stupid.. Its been a long time since I played retail, but I dont remember if my talents were spread out so far..
---
Like, they want me to put 22 points in to balance JUST to get an ability that if it procs, reduces my next cast time by .5 seconds? is that really worth 22 points? I think I would rather put all my points in to resto.. seems more logical
---
You want me to pass on your 1k gold BiS and I’m not in your guild I’m saying pay me 200g and I’ll pass. Don’t see why you would deserve an asset of 1k gold while I walk away with nothing. Love the feeling of “I passed on that epic item that could’ve gotten me my epic mount or my own BiS off AH...”
---
If you can use an item, you press Need.
---
If you can't use it and just want to sell it, you press Greed.
---
There, now you have your "common sense loot system" all implemented and ready to go. And it even has some shiny buttons directly on the interface to go with it!
---
And I'm not the one depriving someone from an item that they can actually use because of simple greed and then starting a discussion on reddit to try and get validation for that behavior. So yes, I'm a decent person and someone who does that kind of isn't.
---
Ircc correctly you want to stack agil for wand damage.
---
Twink 19 priests with a big wand and agil own
---
A few points:
---
Skul’s wand is actually super easy to get as a Priest. Just walk into the UD entrance and Mind Vision over to his spawn points, and keep resetting the instance until he shows up. Then find a group.
---
With DM out, Felcloth Gloves&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Atal’ai Gloves. The Incendius bracers (and the virtually identical Unforgiven bracers) are also exactly the same as the green Elegant Bracers of Shadow Wrath except they have 2 more armor and some magic resist.
---
Man, this game is a social experience. Playing with your friends should be a high priority. Why not make an alliance rogue? I understand totally the desire to swap classes, especially since cat form has given you a taste of what rogue is like. I’d say your best bet is to make a human rogue and drink some Noggenfogger. If the reason you wanted undead was specifically for the PvP racial, then I’d look into gnome with escape artist.
---
&gt; herbalism (160)
---
As a druid, you have one of the easiest farms for herbs.  When it comes to competition, you will generally win out, on both pvp and pve servers.
---
Take two stacks, of you run out, buy other 2
---
The kinds of players I 100% avoid.
---
Sounds like kind of dude that'd kick you at the last boss in a dungeon to invite their guildmate. 
---
I just pull the entire instance on people like that though :D
---
Except they wont.
---
The monthly subscription lets you play Classic or Retail version. 
---
But to play retail, you also need to buy the game download. 
---
For classic you only need the monthly sub.

I’m actually playing a hardcore mode variant, crossbow proficiency,no melee weapons just fists I’m level 8 atm but things should get smoother at 10 when I can equip a fist weapon! :) and get a pet! It’s tough but just keep it going with weapons it’s much easier.
---
Oh hey, it's Runescape! :p
---
Not entirely true. You want 3 tanks in MC. Ony is a sub 30 man fight and requires 2 usually. One for ony and one for whelps. I am always included as a main off tank for our molten core runs. As many fights require 3 tanks. Especially golemag, shazz, and Majordomo.
---
They fall off hard once people start gearing out at 60.
---
Even in purely pvp terms, riposte is not reliable enough to be worth losing malice and 3 points in sword spec, especially since your job in group pvp is killing clothies. It also seems a shame to skip lethality with ar, as it majes your barrage of sses quite a bit better with decent gear. To me, a pvp oriented combat build would be 15/31/5, and if youre not raiding you can cut weapon expertise for imp kick. You could also go pve hemo with 8/21/22 instead though, which will stunlock better than this and be ok in 5 mans.
---
There was a command, that has been removed from the game. 
---
Something like /setmaxcamdistancefactorblahblah10 
---
Now you can do it in your settings, and that’s the best they offer.
---
I'd wait till 60 and run it with another person. Honestly ever dungeon is pretty underwhelming.
---
Good luck getting 2 axes, and keep upgrading those throughout the game. Thats the toughest part about that setup, but with 2 axes you're golden.  Regardless how you look if you are min/maxing, troll is best prot warrior, dps is orc up until naxx then troll takes over.
---
I had some rando ask me to COD him a high value item and I was suspicious AF.  Wasn't sure how long the COD timer was so I passed- glad I did now bc I sold on the AH within those 3 days :-D
---
Sounds like the one place you want to actually use crippling poison in pve content lol.
---
Think of wands like a 1hand sword. 
---
The 1hand sword does physical dmg.
---
The wand also does physical dmg but just another type: Shadow, nature, arcane etc.
---
So to answer your question, no your debuff only increases spell dmg.
---
do you understand the difference between a fact and a rhetorical question? see that's a rhetorical question in itself. Better get your logics straight before trying to argue on the internet or you'll get nowhere
---
we went from "druids are OKish in easy 5 man leveling dungeons" to "DRUIDS ARE MT IN EVERY HIGH END RAIDING" if an argument is false, why not make it even way more outrageous to completely blow the case??
---
&gt; A lot of people enjoy min-maxing and seeing high dmg numbers
---
Your numbers will never be as high as they are without a Paladin in the group.
---
So when the item drops it saves you alot of money and you're one lucky SOB. 
---
The greed is real in this community, it seems no one can be happy for another person anymore that the 0,01% situation takes place where he or she won't need to spend hundreds of gold and get it for free.... Toxic people everywhere, it's called an MMORPG for a reason, for those people it could easily be a massive singleplayer offline rpg.
---

---
What's the call with Foror's? I'm a rogue, so obv don't need it, but can I still roll need for it to pass it to my guild's MT?
---
It might not be. For example, heartseeker is now top 5 most populated servers with a massive faction imbalance.
---
_laughs in shaman_
---
I personally run 11/9/31 for rage and stance dance in 5 man's and love it. Fury prot make anything outside of dungeons possible so it depends how else you are spending you time. My war is a tank monkey, can't do anything in open world but is a boss sitting in org or in instances. Fury prot is totally viable up to raids but you will lose your stance dance and for me that was unacceptable.
---
You rolled horde, now you have to live with horde.
---
I use Recount and never had an issue with it. There must be a clash with something else. :)
---
You are a tank, you dictate the runs and who goes to it - so yes ideally you are bringing in caster DPS so you have less comp for HoJ - just the fact you even seen and lost it 3 times is insane. DM being out doesn't help.
---
Maybe lower the level range you are looking for people, but remove Golemlord from the run, since that adds another 10 mins to the run. Just focus on bringing in 'Caster DPS' instead of just saying HoJ reserved.
---
Sigh, I believe that it could be real. This is what the game is like now.
---
Those seem like big red flags and I would highly recommend finding a different guild.
---
Mis-read and thought you were complaining about skinning mobs.  Was ready to lead the leather workers’ revolt.  Disregard...
---
And yet you think people would spend money to get them banned? Okay.
---
Player looking for a Druid only guild. Like I want to see if we can raid MC with only druids. Anyone doing this?
---
I removed all enchants because I noticed showing crusader made my ap about 1200 instead of 800. My point is sure this is a fine rough estimate but I wouldn't claim it's actually a factual representation of how good the two specs are. I will play with it some more tonight and do some paper math to check it
---
I sure do. I don’t scour reddit daily, doesn’t mean I can’t throw in my opinion.
---
Don't be like me, I have PLENTY of time to play but I suffered altitis and at the lvl 30 mark on my mage I was like "Do I really see myself playing this at 60?" NOPE.
---
Now im a lvl 33 Warrior and find it more enjoyable. But im so far behind
---
I've been charging gold for tanking dungeons I'm not actively looking for myself. When I'm not doing anything, I advertise my tanking as a service for people who doesn't want to look for ages.
---
Max price I've got atm is 30g for a full brd. Otherwise it's 15~25g depending on dungeon. 
---
Most people accept the service as a good thing &amp; even add me for future tanking. But some people go about their way to make me seem like a bad guy. 
---
Imagine being a prot warrior. You hit like a wet noodle. You can't do anything worthwhile to farm. Thorium veins are camped 24/7.
---
It's rare, but sometimes you have to tell people you've played since vanilla &amp; done some pretty hardcore stuff along the way. High m+ keys(before I stopped playing bfa) is sometimes a thing people respect.
---
You don't know me, but you've already made up your mind on this issue. Maybe you should try to understand the argument before dismissing it.
---
To be clear: When a BoE has dropped in the past I have followed the groups lead. If people need and I plan to use it, I need. If everyone greeds, I do as well, then offer to buy it from the winner, because I think that's the most fair. I think your system of need before greed isn't as fair, and can be abused. Maybe you're not the best to group with?
---
Combat swords is all about the white dmg and its ability to apply it much better than the two other talent trees.
---
Sinister strike and hemo are basically just combo builders but it might be cuz hemo does a faster job of being spammed than SS and the +dmg contribution. 
---
Check your dmg logs, normal attacks should be much higher on a combat sword spec.
---
For sub spec with daggers, just put the hardest hitting dagger in mainhand for biggest ambush hits.
---
For levelling i suggest you find a mob that can self heal and use some low lvl daggers to level up faster.
---
&gt; Despite how irrational you choose to be about it, the majority of groups operate this way.
---
Lol, no they don’t. Imagine utilizing the default loot system which differentiated need and greed and then needing on something to sell and believing youre in the right. Mental gymnastics that would impress even the Russian judge.
---
Always mark at least one target. Focus this target first. 
---
Use demo roar to gain initial aggro on a group. 
---
Land a couple of mauls on Skull target then start mauling others. 
---
Save swipe for when you have excess rage.
---
 Taunt things that get away from you.
---
Pick up other tanking talents as you go (Charge)
---
You’re welcome
---
this sorta reminds me of the margin trading scam in EVE Online :)
---
Yea i'm not sure what other people are doing, I know 1 friend really waned 300 armor smithing so that's where most of his gold went, the rest i got no idea 
---
i made 400g or so just doing quests at 60. and then benefited from a cpl BOEs
---
By my own admittance, I’ve followed the loot rules of every group I’ve run with for valuable blue and epic boes. Nobody has any issue with this.
---
Like I said, you’re flawed loot system puts you in the minority. People not following your stupid rules doesn’t make them a ninja.
---
I go early in the morning and at lunch during work. I’m on EST time server. Usually nobody there in the morning and at lunch during the workday. I usually log off for the night in Azshara now that I’m 60 with no XP bar :D
---
Sure, I mean, again you're just saying you give preferential treatment to people you know, and are more selfish with people you don't know. But it's clearly how the game was intended to be played to need on things you can use, and greed on things you want for the value they hold to everyone.
---
Fair enough. Good luck on your endeavours!
---
How do you know?
---
Tanks can't really win.  Often times, tanks get abuse for clearing a safe path and the DPS will scream 'lol wot u pullin them for noob tank?!?'
---
Completely agree with OP though.  Not clearing a path (as a tank should do) is definitely the fastest way to wipe.
---
As a dps shaman (Ele) I prefer to top myself off when needed, to relieve pressure on the healer. I also maintain some mana pool in case I need to jump in and assist in healing or if the healer happens to go down. I'm always watching their mana bar, as everyone should be, and group damage. There are other ways I try to help the healer. With multiple enemies, stoneskin can mitigate quite a bit; a rank 1 earth shock mouseover macro can prevent a lot of bad things, just keep an eye on the casters and know what they will use that should be stopped such as banish, curses, heals etc. Also, for those who can, have a macro to equip a shield if you get agro from something and take it to the tank.
---
Because these situations are never "rolling against the entire group".
---
It's always "wait until almost everyone rolls greed and then roll need against the people that can actually use it".
---
do you have a video of getting them to the tribute loot? or can you pm me a miniguide or something please? :)
---
He wanted to race to 60. He achieved his goal.
---
Playing the game isnt the game for him. Grinding to 60 then deleting your character is playing the game for him.
---
Weird dude but different strokes fordifferent folks
---
I have been dying for my wife and kids to spend a weekend at my in-laws.
---
Shamans are always top of horde healing meters due to chain heal so stick with it and you will have an easier time finding a raid spot than the  druid.   Retry healing WC at level 20-22 and see if you get better results.  You should get some more spells for your arsenal that will make a difference.  Remember there is no reason to downrank until you get to 60 and have +healing gear so just use your top rank heals and match to the situation.  
---
The only variable to the no downranking rule is if you are close to OOM and only have enough to cast a rank 1 or 2 spell.  In that case a down ranked spell is better than nothing.
---
I been farming the belt for 3-4 weeks straight. Saw the belt drop 6 times from then till the day i got it, which was on friday. RNG is a total bitch when you got parties filled with casters and healing priests rolling on the belt.
---
Of course, and I’m not advocating for the titan forge system or the pray you get a gem slot system. Raid gear with the “wrong” main stats is just odd.
---
I never ninja anything but if a BoE drops with extraordinary value and someone says they "need" that item, that's tough to swallow.  I need money as much or more than you need to equip that item.
---
Well.. if im ONLY healing and nothing else, Idont really care about killing shit too much. so i dont even bother with killing bonus talents. I only took that insect swarm to get improved healing or whatever it leads in too.. Like, I get that saving that .5 seconds is nice for healing.. but I dont think its worth 22 points
---
Yes, most groups do. You just don’t know it because you probably barely play the game and only quest.
---
Do you show everyone your vagina?
---
it was probably their best roll in days too :(
---
If the item is 5 g on the AH, they could have bought it for 5 G on the AH. It would have exactly 5 g of value and no more not matter how they obtained it.  
---
Moreover, since this player hasn't bothered to spend 5 g on the item yet, its probably not actually worth 5 g to them. Its just  a small boost they get, when its actually worth 5 g to everyone else.
---
Busting out 10k damage while hitting the frost bolt keybind. Insane player
---
Are you going to pass on a BoE worth 1k gold for someone else? rofl how selfish can you be?
---
24hrs later and I've only watched it a cool 33 times
---
So worth it!
---
I did a full BRD as a prot pally at 52 with a full group of people around 53-56. But hey let's mock people. HAHAHAJA WHAT A DUMB WARRIOR UPVOTES PLOX
---
doesnt matter for the 8pc 
---
getting 8/8 to feel good when you have too much gold? maybe, but the 8pc and stats are not worth anywhere near 1k gold to someone who is invested in normal raid progression more than farming gold
---
Main tank should get gear first.  Then offtank.  Both tanks should really be considered main tanks.  Calling one an off tank is kind of dumb.  They're both essential and should share the best gear.  Dumb to have just one tank not have to compete for gear...
---
If you don't like it, join a different guild. Seriously. Vote with your wallet, so to speak.
---
Not just melee, I generally avoid 5-man reserve runs out of principle even if it's not an item for me.
---
Its even worse when they are allowed to bid on offspec stuff over people that need it for main spec.
---
You can press r then tab to cycle through all recent whisper targets
---
People who make this argument are just stupid.   
---
Sorry bud.
---
It should take you like 2 hours to get to level 10
---
Okay.
---
So you only wanted to need the item to save gold.
---
How is that different from other people needing the item because of gold?
---
This is my excuse whenever my kid asks me to do something when I'm actually just playing WoW. LULW
---
Languages evolve. Dawkins would agree, being an evolutionist and all.
---
I have way more wipes due to ass-pulls. If someone body pulls while hugging the wall and pulls and extra pat that is one thing, but the majority of my wipes are due to peoples lack of spacial awareness.
---
The post can still be found on my profile.
---
Which is fine, this "logical argument" is asinine
---
Dude loves eating shadows.
---
How do you get your health bars to stay there? Mine reset when I log out
---
1,000 is way too much, even if youre 7/8
---
unless you play 15 hrs a day everyday and have 10k+ gold like Frost and just want to burn your money for fun, the increase is stats is not worth that much and very few ppl would pay that
---
Yeah you can definitely get into Classic right now. There's a bunch of people leveling. You can take a few months to get to 60 and you'll barely be behind. Gear from MC is not that great in the grand scheme of things. 
---
Take your time while leveling, do some professions, run dungeons where you can get gear upgrades, figure out how to play your class. You're gonna have a good time. There's no real rush to get to 60.
---
Healings different. Your allies cant dodge, block, or parry your heals. Go try to attack something with weapon attacks and compare the hit chance to your healing an ally.
---
Some people do.
---
But /who is your best friend
---
/who 44-49
---
Whisper 1 priest and 3 dps and wait.
---
2 join. 
---
Now I say LF2M ZF GTG.
---
Get a whisper and add.
---
/who again and whisper whatever it is we need.
---
I get into groups very easily. Half because I'm a druid. Have because of /who.
---
Side note. You can even go /who priest 44-49 to make your search more specific.
---
Great effort man. Looks stunning.
---
How did you make the border!?
---
This is probobly going to be the only sensible post here. Play with people who shares the same goals as you. When the group is formed, say "BoE is free roll for all" or "BoE is upgrade over gold" if you dont like the loot rules find a different group. Dont wait until a BoE drops then pick the rule that is the most convenient for whoever leads the group.
---
There is no gear in there for you I would move on and come back to revisit it on an alt or do a boe farm run solo at 60 there are lots of twink weapons in there that people will pay good money for.
---
Clearly you know the intentions of the devs.

Hey guys im suffering a problem.

Im a lvl 33 for horde and im wondering where i need to quest and im getting multi answers, for example...
---
Quest Arathi, Quest STV, Quest Alterac, or grind through SM.

What do you guys recommend?
---
So, I began having the classic-itch again and want to play something goofy on an RP-PvP realm in EU. Thats why I'm rolling a critchicken but I'm not sure on a few things.
---
I don't mind having slower leveling as balance vs feral, but how much am I kneecapping myself leveling as balance? I could prolly heal in dungeons most of the time. And is there a RP-PvP server on EU with balanced factions?
---
TYVM in advance.
---
Well the faction imbalance thing is more of an anecdote. However, when those stats were released heartseeker was not yet a transfer realm. Since then there has been two rounds of transfers and the server has had a massive population boom.
---
BoPs *do* have the same value to every player.
---
/pat
---
As it should be. Man up and tank and gear your OS on the side
---
Any pet/race suggestions? I'm open to orc, troll, and night elf. I have a 25 human rogue and a 16 human paladin.
---
Just start telling them you don't need anything from the dungeons.
---
I’ve been farming essence of water via the fishing method. Using levitate gets you to the various nodes. I average about two essence per hour even with someone else farming. On my server that’s 40-50g / hour. I also get some other fish in the down time. I’ll do a loop and then fish for 5-10 min then repeat.  Best time is during non-peak hours.
---
I really hope you sent him a message to update him that you got it done and wish him well in finding that tank. Lmao.
---
All valuable BoE's should be needed by everyone. This seems pretty common in groups with all 60's, it's only the lvl 35 boomers who don't understand it.
---
Actually, that's exactly how ItemRack works. So yes you can. Still wouldn't do it for SnD though, there's plenty of times you should use SnD over anything else, even when it's already up.
---
Yep. Once I was LFM for a group quest that was an elite quest, it had a pre quest that wasn't elite with the same name. I specified which part it was a bunch of times in /1 then I forgot to do it once and one guy joined, we were at the place of the elite quest (which was on a different part from the map of part 1), killed the elite mob (which was another type of mob from part 1 - dragons instead ogres), and THEN the guy gets angry that we were doing the wrong part and left. I /w and say "I'm very sorry that it was unclear which part it was, my bad" and get hit with an /ignore
---
Like ok.
---
It's usually the people who want to skip everything, so as a tank I follow the group vote, and then the hunter will back up for no reason during combat and body pull the pack we skipped, or their pet will chase a runner that would've died before reaching the pack it's running to but the pet body pulls
---
right click your portraits and lock them
---
Mostly for twinks looking for BIS
---
How is finding a raid group as Shadow? I'm not exactly enamored by the rotation but being overly competitive I do like looking at the DPS meters, whereas healing meters are relatively meaningless.
---
Most groups still only take one SPriest for Shadow Weaving?
---
I usually will say something like "Ok, I have not run this dungeon in like 14 years, and I get lost in my own back yard, so gonna need someone to help point the way."
---
I bet your dungeon groups are fun.  
---
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
---
Welcome to the third tier of even more casual players who have hit 55+ and are now also trying to farm their list of items with even LESS time than the people who hit 60 weeks ago.
---
Not that casual is bad, but some people have RL commitments that come up at a moment's notice (coincidentally sometimes after the boss they need a drop from.)
---
50g+ depending on item. Venoxis alliance side
---
Its called honor/rep in wow
---
 I made an addon doing something similar. [https://github.com/coolmodi/SpellCalc](https://github.com/coolmodi/SpellCalc)  
---
For now it only works fine for priest because that's what I play. Resist calculation for dots is wrong though, but healing spells all work fine.
---
Thanks man, that was a great writeup!
---
Really appreciate the advice :)
---
Do you have any evidence that Quickstrike is better than Tarnished Elven, or are you just making it up because you wanted to steal BiS from warriors?
---
Totem buffs.
---
I'd direct you and OP to shadowpanther.net
---
Look at this HARSE
---
Is this on incendius? Bc Im a Priest on there, and there is a mage, same first letter of character name, hitting me up daily. Used to be for ZF, then BRD. Always boasting how much per hour. Exhausting..
---
You’re the same guy who told a BRD group that HoJ is bad for DPS warriors.
---
It’s just true kid. If you think that what I am saying is wrong then any guild that does loot differently has a much higher chance of loot leaving the guild and good players leaving that guild. See the issue is you don’t understand how to read. You think I’m telling people to give all of the loot to a select few people. If you understood how to read you would see that I’m saying that there are layers of likelihood people take loot out of the guild and that should be a huge factor to determine where gear goes. 
---
I don’t need ridiculous hefty arguments that you’re asking for. My comments have more up upvotes than yours because apparently more people on here can read unlike you. It is a fact without any argument possible that a GM and officer and core raider are less likely to leave a guild than a new raider or a trial. Does that mean those people get nothing? No. That’s just something to take heavily into account. 
---
You’re entire tank comment is entirely ridiculous like the rest of your comment. 
---
I have a demeaning attitude because you’re unable to read while still trying to argue with me. It’s clear you are exactly like the butt hurt crybaby hunter I described in my original comment. It’s very clear that you think you and anyone who just shows up for a raid is equally deserving of gear. Thats just plain laughable. Meanwhile, you’re so angry and such a little child you’re going through other comments of mine to angrily respond....grow up kid and go learn how to read. Have a good time in your shit guilds crying over loot kid.
---
Orange and black bill.. long slender neck.
---
That’s hilarious
---
In my experience its this
---
Orc Hunter: You absolutely nailed the description
---
Troll: Lets be honest, they're a bunch of stoners and we love them for it
---
Tauren: Usually are absolute bros and are really chill
---
Gnome: who tf decided to play a gnome
---
Dwarf: Really chill and friendly but absolutely RUTHLESS if you mess with HIM or his friends.
---
Undead: Usually the tryhards and really quick lvlers in my experience. Highest levels on the server and its the first couple days of classics release? Its a undead rogue and undead mage.
---
Human: YOu have so many races to choose from and chose human...
---
I was planning to do 15g, which I think is more than reasonable for 30 seconds of someone's time. I feel like someone spamming trade to craft something for a fixed price (that doesn't include a BOP item that the crafter has to farm) is just losing money.
---
Bump
---
As a warrior tank, never recruit another warrior in a dungeon if you need something in it :)
---
Alsoon strat eca just take all the orbs :)
---
Still a bit stiff!
---
What I've learned from this thread:
---
Nobody plays female dwarves but me (I have multiple of them including my main)
---
Playing as a Gnome Warrior is split between horde KOSing me and alliance wishing they could. Thank goodness for being on a PvE realm XD
---
You mean lucky everyone, because everyone gets a chance at saving gold.
---
Oh.. then i'm seriously confused why you would even mention an addon that swaps gear, in response to a question about macro'ing several **combat** abilities together,   When said addon won't swap gear in combat.
---
**edit** to add the rest of the quote.
---
&gt;As events are enabled, a separate process watches for **those events and equips (and unequips if chosen)** as they happen.  
---
&gt;If you want to create or edit an event, there are four types of events:  
---
&gt;Buff: These events equip gear as you gain buffs. ie, Evocation, Drinking and being on a mount.  
---
&gt;Stance: These events equip gear when you change stances or forms. ie, Battle Stance, Moonkin Form, Shadowform  
---
&gt;Zone: These events equip gear when you're in one of a list of zones. ie, the PVP event includes all arena and BG maps.  
---
&gt;Script: For those with lua knowledge, you can create your own event based on a game event. A couple examples are in the default events.
---
I've had my pet dismissed and got it blamed for pulling mobs when the tank just did a shitty body pull. When a mob is running away and the pet is the only one after him I get blamed, but if I call the pet back and that running mob gets all his buddies to run back then it's, "whoops guys we gotta slow that mob and kill it before it runs!".
---
People love blaming the pet though all the time.
---
Maul and white hits do a load of threat, and pre HoTing can be very effective for getting on the threat table of everything. Pulling with Moonfire on a mob you won't be immediately focusing also helps to hold the initial aggro. 
---
I have no issues whatsoever building a ton of threat on many mobs by simply rotating white hits and Mauls between them. Even when every DPS is sporadically nuking a different thing. 
---
Your main bottleneck as a druid tank in large pulls will be lack of mitigation. But you should be able to handle large pulls in most 5 mans anyway, especially at lower levels where you scale absurdly well compared to warriors (higher base health and mitigation, don't need a ton of gear, free plate upgrade at 40) 
---
For all intents and purposes you won't be limited as a druid tank until you start raiding. And at that point you're still viable, you just have to know the limitations.
---
Or you’re just clueless, one of those two.
---
Used it a handful of times for pugs.
---
Agree with this so much.
---
Prepare to spend some quality time in RFK/SM/RFD/ZF. Not only do these three instances have very good weapons for most classes, they are both fairly mob congested leading to very good xp/time spent.
---
I tried to grind a level or two questing, then do the same in the level appropriate dungeon. It may have taken a little extra time than the optimal strategy, but it kept me a few levels ahead of the quests I was working on (i.e. level 40 killing level 35-37 mobs for quests). This made the entire process low stress (could comfortably chain pull, and handle the accidental 2 mobs at once). (For the record, it took me 9 days and 6 hours to hit 60, no where near record pace or anyone going fast, but I was super happy with the route I took, the friends I made, and the experience.
---
Do what works / seems fun.
---
There is no rush to burn out while getting to 60. There will still be people running MC/ONY/BWL when you get there. 
---
Enjoy the ride.
---
Does the addon find info from a database or only from my own findings?
---
happened to me on a p-server with Freezing Band.  Even worse was that this server took a full 30 DAYS to return the C.O.D. 
---
sucked.
---
I actually like that there's a limit to progression.
---
In my eyes, the game has always been split into 3 stages.
---
* Levelling (1 to 60, which is actually the phase many players prefer as it is a non-stop progression, with new abilities and gear every few levels.)
---
* Gearing-up and Raiding (Which are virtually the same thing. You first gear up so you'll be better in raids, which you'll also farm for even better gear.)
---
* Endgame PvP/PvE/Reputation (When you're all geared up and focus on getting the most you possibly can out of your character, be it through ranking up in PvP, by running PvE content as fast and/or with as few people as possible or by getting Exalted with every possible faction.)
---
Either bot or buy if you have a decent income.  There is no reason not to.  If I can buy 20 hours of someone elses work for 3hours of mine, why would I not do that?
---
Will confirm ill probably be a dwarf if i rolled alliance.
---
Yes, discussing first is the main thing. But I disagree with everything else you said. A drop is luck of the draw. If a BoE staff drops, I'm not mad it's not a dagger and I don't think "wow! I might get that for gold." I'm happy that one of the casters is gonna get a staff upgrade. that's all there is to it
---
Need is designed for people that will use it. The Greed button, which is a little gold coin, is for people that want to sell the item
---
If it's previously agreed upon for everyone to roll Need then that's fine, but if it isn't discussed and you roll Need because of gold, and a Priest that wanted to use the staff doesn't get it. Then you are a ninja and a dick
---
This is what I experienced while leveling
---
Is there a quest plugin for Atlasloot? Or any other addon that lists all dungeon quests?
---
I do the same but my principles are being tested after 133 hoj runs
---
Gotta go fast!
---
4/5 of my Tribute PUG runs this weekend had people doing the parkour thing to skip the first 3 packs. It's seven mobs, takes 3 minutes to clear, but instead most folks just wanted to exploit.
---
The mobs can aggro you but can't path to you, and eventually reset. That's a damn exploit, people. Don't do it.
---
&gt;Need if you want to equip the item, greed if you want the gold value. The winner of the need roll pays the winner of the greed roll the gold value of the item. If you’re not willing to pay it’s value, you truly don’t need it.
---
If the Need winner rolls higher than the Greed winner, he doesn't have to pay anything as he won the overall roll.
---
apart from this, I don't think that this adjustment would solve much, it makes it extra complicated.  All need (on expensive boe's) is simple the superior system
---
That isn’t ironic. Learn the definition of irony
---
I rolled in a chest where one guy got a 99, then me and another guy both got 100's.
---
So both of the 100's rerolled, and the other guy got a 100 AGAIN.
---
I jokingly, but also sort of not jokingly, said "wtf hax".
---
I tried some BFA and really liked the straight posture male orcs and trolls.
---
Star wars text theme lol
---
10/10 + 1/1 as shadow. 
---
Stat priority should depend on your play style. I knew I wasn't going to be top DPS, so stacking a ton of shadow damage at the cost of stats (int specifically) never made sense to me. I instead prioritized t1 helm over felcloth hood for example so that I had the mana pool to dispel more in the many fights that required it and mind flay more in the fights that didn't. Mana problems were very real for me, so I found gear that helped me solve the problems I experienced.
---
Try something like:
---
/cast [reset=10] Slice and Dice; Expose Armor
---
Supposedly that should reset the macro after 10 seconds, so you will only use Slice and Dice if you haven't used it in the last 10 seconds.
---
Notably BS -&gt; GM in AB
---
With itemrack you can bind a button to equip cape and display cape, then switch back and turn off cape display
---
Look, if you dont state the loot rules prior to entering the dungeon, dont be surprised when people get mad that they lost their piece of gear that they desperately need, to someone who will just AH the item. 
---
Here is the real issue: people are getting mad over different loot philosophies
---
Solution: state the loot rules prior to starting the dungeon. 
---
Case closed! Let's all pack up and go home, argument over.
---
i spent 14 hours inside BRD this weekend, :(
---
Horrible analogy because that’s literally not how it works, the company sets the prices and is run by them, the WoW economy is constantly shifting and is run by everyone not a sole company. The WoW economy is more like a flea market. Not a fast food joint.
---
Will confirm as someone who likes trolls, ACCURATE
---
Because the addon uses functionality of checking for buffs, meaning it is possible. However it may only be able to check for when you gain/lose buffs, which would still fit OP's needs, but may require more complex coding.
---
What do you think is an entirely objective system to distribute loot.
---
rolls??? do loot council w a guild man
---
How many hours of farming is it gonna take him to earn back that 1000g though? It just seems like a huge waste of time.
---
Again, you're severely overestimating the skill level of the general population and you probably live in a bubble of competent people who know fights and use advanced techniques like bringing consumables to raids. But it's impossible to prove either way so no point arguing. I think you're going to be surprised if they ever release Naxx completion stats though.
---
All of the top parsers on warcraft logs are using between 6 and 8 hit. they only have extra hit cause of things like onslaught girdle where their best pieces just happen to have hit.
---
You are wrong. HS canceling isnt that hard.
---
Hit past cap was honestly overrated before the hs cancelling thing. Its only really for crit cap.
---
i just took the quiz and still didn't understand what was being asked.
---
played less what?
---
I'm so damn confused myself about this
---
I just cant deal with the 2 guards near Slipknip, the ones you gotta shatter and conc
---
how do you deal with those? :p
---
How do you feel about people who got it on their first kill?
---
I really like that there is no system like that in classic...I raided hardcore on retail for a long time and with every new expansion comming out I feel you have to sacrifice more time to be on top. Eventually I quit because I got stressed out.
---
The market for these types of items isn't really developed yet because there are no battle grounds. Once those are added in those items are going to be in a higher demand because of twink characters.
---
Should I Reckoning as paladin? [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8BPATSVpRg&amp;t=20m49s) says it is very good, however, the guide was made before classic released. The comments say that reckoning doesnt work like the video says. Is it still good / should I use it?
---
Posting it here hoping someone can answer :D
---
Ah, this explains it.
---
I had something happen a few weeks back like described.  Thought it was odd, and just ignored the whisper.  Like 5 minutes later my item sold anyway, to a different person. 
---
It wasn't even like there were others listed, and mine was for sure not underpriced.  Definitely not my first rodeo :P
---
both rend swords or heartseeker / bonescraper?
---
So just confirming, SND is still worth throwing up *without* Rank 2’s attack speed increase and improved SND talents?
---
Then why are all the top parses not using hit past cap?
---
First of all, you need to down rank more, like rank 4 heals. They have a set mana cost so the more you down rank, the more effective your healing power is. If you have a total of +300 healing it will add that 300 to rank 8 and the same 300 to rank 4, or even rank 1 if you want. Another reason for this is to save on overhealing. If you ever overheal, you're just throwing away mana, so by using rank 4 heals instead you reduce the size of the heal which reduces the likelihood of ever overhealing, therefore saving you mana. The goal when using healing power gear is to use the lowest rank heals possible without ever overhealing and never stop casting. You will only use your powerful heals if the tank gets hit very hard by a single attack and you need to reset him to full hp. Once you get +600 healing power and are using rank 3 heals you will feel the effectiveness of healing power.
---
You could in the 1.12 vanilla client. Not anymore in the 1.13 modern client.
---
Lmao I remember this guy.
---
You should ve woooorkiiing, yeeeaaah
---
I just don't CoD expensive items. If you want to hold 5 stacks of runecloth for 3 days go for it.
---
OP was a spectator in this situation. But prove you’re exactly like red. /spit
---
Its tough, because human is best for pve since it effectively means you need 6% hit versus 9% on gear for lvl 63 bosses, but human is sub optimal for pvp.
---
Should return after 3 days.
---
Okay now that is some stupid ass logic. In that case no one should ever need on, nor equip Edgemasters.
---
Don't even try to get 24% hit, that's insane.  Hit kind of just comes with the territory.  If you are raiding, just kind of accept that you will probably have about 8-10% hit.  I wouldn't try to get more, but if I have it, it's not the worst thing.  Off the top of my head I know the NS gloves/Shoulders have hit and then so does Striker's Mark/Quick Strike Ring and Band of Accuria(2%).  Those alone would be +6% hit after talents.  The Ony head neck also has one, so I wouldn't worry about getting it.
---
It's easier to just treat hit like it's there, but don't really focus on it.  As long as you at least have 6, just kind of go with whatever you get.  If you really want to push the absolute edge of dps, I do remember there being elaborate spreadsheets you can plug items/stats into and determine what is the theoretical best.  Classic doesn't really have that narrow of margins though.
---
I'd just say don't worry about dropping hit until you look at you are sitting at something like 12%+.  At that point you are probably a bit high, but it could also be because you have the best items available to you at the time.  Don't go out of your way to stack hit as long as you are at ability hit cap of 6%.
---
Are you a girl??
---
That's why everybody needs those items.   To quote a wise man in this thread:
---
&gt;All valuable BoE's should be needed by everyone. This seems pretty common in groups with all 60's, it's only the lvl 35 boomers who don't understand it.
---
A combination of happy and envious.
---
it's an absolutely fantastic name, and actually suits a lot of the things imps say haha
---
Leslie Tiller was FUCKING murdered!
---
&gt; You sound ridiculous. I'm not saying you have to attend their wedding, or even know their real name.
---
Cool, I do this stuff because their value to me is their friendship not them running instances with me.  Go outside and get real friends
---
ALWAYS open with the auto-shoot ability, not Serpent Sting or Arcane shot... There’s something weird that happens with the GCD when you open with an ability... 
---
The rotation should be Hunter’s Mark-Auto-Sting-Auto-Arcane-Auto/melee until dead or something along those lines...
---
For me I'd avoid him due to his giant aggro range.
---
Not much help for you, but others that are not max level. While leveling, I spam ran Mara princess and BRD runs. You get the exp that you need to level and a much better chance of having pre-bis items at 60. It's no guarantee, but it's better than spam running it at 60. 
---
Not trying to rub it in, But I had Blackstone Ring and HOJ well before lvl 60 by doing that.
---
wow is filled with bads, more at 11
---
This is part of the scourge invasion event which is like phase 6 or 7 IIRC
---
&gt; If someone wants something that is 1k gold, they need to have the 1k the instant they can use it or they are being lazy?
---
Nope, but when they do acquire that 1k gold that item will be there waiting for them. Why should they be given it today?
---
&gt;Using your logic shouldn't people who take BoP items still reimburse the others in the party? Relative value is irrelevant. 
---
Yes, I agree that would be a more consistent system. I think it's largely unneeded, however, because there are just so many BoP drops. Over time it levels out and the expected gain is equal for all players. i.e. today I get 5g worth of items, tomorrow you do. This isn't true of BoE items. Someone could play their entire life and not win a BoE worth &gt;100g. Under these extreme circumstances the regular etiquette breaks down.
---
Right. Yesterday, one of our tanks put a UBRS group together because he wanted the shield, at first, he didn't want other Warriors in the group, but we ended up with 3 Warriors, when it was determined that the others had no interest in said shield.
---
I have a 36 paladin and a 17 priest.
---
The anti paladin meta is strong on my server. I found myself getting a spot in a group as a "lets fill the last slot with whatever". I planned on going from ret to prot in my 40's and changed at 34. Started getting groups more often and things got better, however now I find myself healing now more than tanking due to meta opinions.
---
My priest is the opposite, I got into a VC group at 16 and was easily able to heal it and it was a blast. A low level priest with a greater magic wand is an insane amount of DPS at low levels, but wanding feels just like paladin white dmg fighting.
---
I plan on PVP'ing with both and come from decades of Everquest experience so have always leaned towards being PVP focused over PVE since EQ lacked on the PVP side compared to WoW.
---
Hopefully my experiences with the two classes give you a little input on your decision
---
Here is your bar of soap.....
---
There's only one RP-PVP server in EU I think. Luckily for you it is balanced and very busy. Zandalar tribe.
---
I think that's just your perspective. It could very well just be a result depending on what server you're on. I don't think it's necessarily "reddit feeding on outrage" though. I firsthand actually see it in lfg chat all the time, so it's not *that* blown out of proportion. I am however on Stalagg, which is a high pop server, so it's higher likelihood to see that due to more people where I am.
---
I’m worried about this, I don’t think I would have enough time to keep a guild organized, I have raid lead before but and don’t mind that at all just hate the logistics of actually catering to a guild.
---
Healers will hate you if you're DW tanking with crap gear.
---
You are on a different server and faction than myself but it's good to know a range, I have one ring already considering replacing my Blackstone ring with another elven
---
Hw...what? Do you not pickpocket junkboxes enough?
---
That's why they are not included; would be OP.
---
Imagine. Being so bad. And so mad. That you go through to argue with my other comments. Grow the hell up and get some friends kid.
---
Your healers will hate you and you will probably wipe a lot.
---
These don’t sound like friends...
---
Let’s play a game to see who’s handling this correctly.
---
You’re in a full pug, a epic BOE drops. It’s an extremely rare, valuable twink item, but for anyone who plans to continue leveling it would be replaced in 5 levels or less. It sells for 5000g on the AH, or the guy in your group who is going to replace it, hit 60 and then ultimately quit could use it for a couple of levels.
---
Does everyone pass to him, or do you all roll need?
---
You don’t have to read every word lmao. Quest text follows a general pattern. You can skip to the important bits.
---
There is none. There are ways to minimize subjectiveness but rid of it entirely.
---
showmemyheal
---
and me as an eve online veteran im used to xp accumilating while i sleep :&lt;
---
It is, because the belt is garbage now that DM is out.
---
Start a big fight Friday morning, say you need some time alone to cool off. Flowers Sunday night.
---
After a few weeks of that you can really relax because she will move in with them.
---
if you look in the top right corner of your wowhead link, under the heading "Quick Facts" you will notice the text "Added in content phase 6"
---
Is that the opening of naxx?
---
Yeah I play the game, and at a completely higher caliber than you, so fuck off.
---
How is it "asinine"?
---
Item has set value.
---
Player judges value too high.
---
Player judges gold more valuable than item.
---
Item drops.
---
Player has already judged the gold more valuable than the item.
---
In Wow etiquette when you judge the gold more valuable than the item you greed.
---
Where does the logic fall apart?
---
All you would be doing is making the healer have to drink more so more downtime.  I also wouldn't be surprised if people saw you without a shield for pulls and just randomly boot you.  
---
What would the benefit be?  Slightly more dps?  Is it worth the added stress on the healer?
---
You can't put buff/debuff logic into a macro.
---
You can cancel aura to make sure a buff isn't active but can't verify one is active.
---
You can do a castsequence to cast one then the other, however the problem here is that if one fails to land, or expires then it will do the other one anyway.
---
If you know what duration you normally cast Slice and Dice for. you can use that as a reset condition. e.g. If you like a 2 point (12 second) slice and dice, then you can reset if you change target or 12 seconds have passed.
---
/castsequence \[reset=12,target\] Slice and Dice, Expose Armor
---
My wife spent a month with our kids visiting her parents thousands of miles away this summer.  They returned on September 1st.....   So much opportunity wasted!
---
You can use both of those abilities, it's not one or the other or anything. Personally if I don't see someone using sunder and they are prot, I don't have high hopes
---
Leveling a feral druid. Level 25, currently using a dwarven staff of power (+18 AP). What should I be looking for in terms of upgrades for weapons as I level?
---
Yes. SnD is your best combo move. Most of rogues damage comes from auto attack (and to a lesser extent poisons). So like the other guy said, you need to keep it up at all time even if it may seem boring. 
---
The only case you don't do that, is if you have leftover combo points on a very low hp mob and you know there will be downtime before the next mob
---
Hahahahaha No you don’t. I’m in a top 15 guild in the world. Rag finished in 10 days. Delete your account
---
I'm currently an Orc 2H fury warrior who got lucky enough to win a roll on the Obsidian Edge Blade from an MC raid. It is my understanding that the 8 additional skill points in swords lowers my hit cap but I'm having a hard time understanding how much hit I actually need now. Do I need 5% or 6% hit cap from my other gear? Most resources just talk about the benefit in increments of 5 but I'm sure that the 3 additional skill points help me out. Thanks!
---
What an absolutely cringey thing to say lol
---
At this point im pretty sure most of us just have no desire to sit around getting camped for an hour instead of questing, or dont want to take an extra 10 mins to get to a dungeon because theres people camping the entrance.  
---
It has nothing to do with skill level.  It has everything to do with maximizing the amount of time you can play.  For people with jobs/families thats pretty important.
---
strategic gamers ARE known for their ability in  logical thinking....  Maybe those of us who come from games like starcraft and hearthstone are the logical ones , and those that come from first person shooters are the needy ones?   That would be an interesting poll. 
---
'What loot system do you prefer'  
---
and
---
'what games did you play before WoW..'
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think there's actually no good enchant for a feral right now.  Like absolute minmax would be +healing for prehot lol
---
Deadwalker for the shadow damage. Considered pre-raid bis
---
Ooooh, he hustled you if he pulled boss before clearing lol.
---
Why MOP baby? People who didn’t play vanilla or tbc  had a very different experience. I would say anyone who started wotlk onwards. 
---
For me the game changed too much after TBC for the worst. Wotlk ruined the game with looking for group dungeon finders and destroyed sense of raid progression.
---
Cata revamped the 1-60 experience and MOP got rid of talents.
---
I always thought SnD was not worth it until Rank 2.  If someone wants to correct me, I'm all ears.
---
I think that the joke is that a rogue would have that un pickable lock on theirs knowing what rogues can do.
---
looking at your xp bar barely move isnt a carrot on a stick. a carrot on a stick is something you can look forward to in the future
---
Tell it to all the people throwing hundreds of gold away on consumables every week to make their MC runs a little faster.
---
Grats on being creepy
---
People have this idea that the BiS lists are not only gospel, but somehow required.  The variance in class dps in classic is insanely larger than in retail.  To this extent some classes will never be as good as others simply by design.
---
The other issue is that these BiS lists, assuming they are actually right which many of them aren't, are something like get this .3% drop for a 1.2dps increase! or buy an Alcor's razor as an OH dagger.  No, you don't NEED that shit.  If you happened to come across a felstriker or Ironfoe, cool and have fun.  If you didn't get it, don't burn yourself out farming rend and Emp or something which is not game breaking.
---
The other side is some people probably get frustrated running the dungeon 30 times and not getting what they want.  I've done angerforge maybe 25-30 times and not even seen a HoJ.  It was the only I was actually focusing on simply because there aren't any other melee dps trinkets for an alliance rogue.  DM solved that by at least giving me the book trinket or counterattack lodestone.  Yes HoJ is better than the lodestone, but at least I have a second trinket now  I'm not going to burn 20-30 hours into angerforge runs for like 5 dps whatever it is.  If I get it I get it, if I don't then I know I have other options.
---
Yeah, i'd pick it up and start rolling on good daggers. If you raid in guild, use the gloves to pressure your guild into giving you mainspec priority on daggers.
---
Yep, there are a few low level bosses added to dungeons with that event.  She’s one of them.
---
As a holy priest, my experience (early on at least) is go DPS gear.  I seem to have a lot more trouble with tanks losing threat than tanks taking too much damage.  But obviously depends on your healer.
---
You’re in bad guilds and have no idea wtf you’re talking about. You’re clearly one of those terrible hunters crying of Band if Acuria. If you think I’m being selfish that’s pretty rich since you think brand new people to a guild deserve loot over people who have setup the guild and likely been there from the start. I have told you fucking 3 times now I don’t use loot council and here you are still accusing me of keeping gear for my buddies. You are so dense it’s hilarious. You can’t read and it’s hilarious. 
---
And there it is again. You are literally asking me a question about the loot council you think I run. I told you we don’t do loot council in my guild and I was explaining the system to others. But you cannot read so you keep asking the same dumbass question. You also act like each piece of gear drops once likely because you’re a child with no sense time. 
---
You’re asking me a simple question that I cannot answer because I don’t do loot council. I asked you a simple question on what loot system you prefer. It’s actually insane to me that I’ve said I don’t use loot council so many times and you keep assuming I am. Like you literally cannot read lol. 
---
If you want to continue this conversation please make sure you read my comment or ask someone to read it for you.
---
I done 30 about 30 runs and saw it drop once..
---
I have done about 30ubrs and never seen true strike shoulders drop and they're about 11% drop chance.
---
Unfortunately just part of the game
---
Specifically the side rooms in SM library. Seriously, just clear them. The next part of the dungeon requires you to LoS casters. Why would you leave mobs right behind you while you're trying to LoS with very little room in front of you?
---
Is +13 shadow damage better than +14 to damage and healing spells? And if so, how?
---
Love this mantra. I like “ slow is smooth, smooth is fast”
---
Not a bad I might head to SM instead.
---
Yeah, I'm 57 enh and wearing a few BiS and can feel my dps slipping. But I have tools that can make up for my lack of dps. Or at least that's what I tell myself.
---
Lol i saw it 5 min ago on instagram. That reposters are fast.
---
Probably because theyre religiously following bis?
---
Back in vanilla our highest dps fury warriors all had 10-12% crit and edges or human. The guys who stopped at 5-6% and stacked crit were spiky but rarely maintained the same dps. I can say v high hit gives you access to incredibly smooth, reliable rage gen.
---
Edit: worth noting I don't think hitting those hit numbers is possible in the current phase without some questionable sacrifices, but the fact remains passing the special hit cap does a lot for dw fury.
---
ZF
---
Top dps for classes if equally geared is warrior.
---
One of the best pvp classes, but not solo you will always need a healer, but you can easily 2v5 with just a warrior and a priest.
---
I've been getting more of these lately. I always put them on ignore and report for spamming. very annoying though.
---
Thank you! That exactly what I needed to know! I don't know exactly how it happened but I'm at 11% hit without trying to focus hard on it and I'm starting to need to make decisions like should I wear the DM +Hit ring or the Painweaver +Crit ring.
---
I agree. The logic seems to show that no one ever should need on BoE items (or everyone should). If they want to equip them they should buy them (from the person who won the roll).
---
She's beautiful.
---
9% for 300 skill, 6% for 305.
---
Fire Shock, Frost Shock to slow, Searing Totem.... a very long process
---
Except the honor ranking system, which throws all that out the window and endorses the most unhealthy amount of gameplay I’ve ever seen in any game I’ve played.
---
For healers, you can choose any class that can heal, so Paly, Druid, Shaman, Priest. I really like paladins. Can easily top charts in Raids spamming a single spell
---
Actually no, be use we can’t take into account how long it will take someone to replace it and if it’s an Improvement how does that translate to %time saved leveling and % money earned due to the upgrade. Time = money. So we would need to compare that it’s use is saving/gaining (x) amount of gold more or less then market value?
---
no that would be terrible and ruin the whole idea behind boe items.
---
everybody would be forced to roll need and nobody could ever buy a BOE on the ah because there wouldn't be any to sell.
---
I mean...the belt from dire maul also gives +5 daggers.  So this is good but it's not like a game breaker.
---
Bet this man is a joy at parties.
---
I ran ZF about 6 times already and I’m already bored to tears of it. Do people actually find it fun to run it over and over and over and over and over again
---
HOJ has 5% and there are people on here have done more than 150 runs
---
Undead? False. Undead are fucking tryhards, and occassionaly really chill.
---
I find pickpocketing to be the most boring possible activity in WoW
---
Stack stam/int/agi
---
With a large enough sample there will be sequences of runs that are individually highly unlikely.  Sometimes we are on the shit end of it.
---
I think you mean "Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast" :P
---
Ya same thing here, except the whole discord/rl friend thing.
---
I think mythic dungeons in retail had an impact on this.  Everyone thinks you have to speed run and blast through the dungeon in the least possible time.  Is it really worth eeking out an extra couple gold per hour if you get slammed with a huge repair bill when you're done?  Not to mention the extra time walking back to your corpse.  Dying is WAY more annoying than making sure you don't wipe.
---
Lol, ok dude. You know it's possible to be friendly with people in a video game while still maintaining a real life social life right? Like most people who originally played this game are married with children now, with plenty of social obligations.
---
Flaming band of the owl is pretty good right l?
---
He’s actually assistant to the general manager don’t let him lie like that
---
This is literally the opposite of how Blizzard intended the system to work.
---
It was never an issue when I played back in Classic, why the hell are these posts so rampant now?
---
if u dont get a response, its a no. move on
---
Yeah, you are only being brought because of MotW, innovation and battle rezz so accept your lot in life and play up to the stereotype.
---
Sure, sure. Same complaint all the time in M+ dungeons in retail. But look, the simple reality is that overall, it saves a lot of time. When someone messes it up, it's a learning experience to not mess it up next time. If the mess up  is a result of a butt pull  and generally being unaware, that cannot  happen at any time. It does not mean that  skipping mobs is bad, it means that the person needs to get  better.
---
When someone  walks into or gets feared into whelps on Onyxia, it's not the whelps' fault, it's that person's fault for positioning poorly.
---
I remember my friend and I went to a mall.  I bought harvest moon 64, he bought everquest (a bit older than me).  I remember both of us pulling out the brochures and reading cool things we saw to eachother.  We had such a good time, and then we got home and realized that my buddy's computer had too small an HD (500mb) to install EQ on it.  His step dad had to go buy a 2GB drive to allow us to play.
---
I've bought and sold gold a bunch of times through the years and not once have I seen anyone use this method.
---
Locks have no threat reduction talents/abilities in classic. Until they get full tier 2 armor. Also, because a lot of their damage is coming from dots, they can't simply stop their DPS once they're at the aggro threshold.
---
Not saying they shouldn't be pulling aggro, I play a lock and threat management is definitely something you still have to pay attention to, just saying they don't have any actual tools to help in that regard while many other DPS classes do.
---
nice try, troll  rogue.....
---
No its fine how it is &lt;3
---
It's only since classic that people do need for epic or expensive BoEs? Just because your server didn't do that in 2004-5 doesn't mean that wasn't a thing back in the day. My server did for sure, so don't try to say it's a modern/classic thing.
---
And, to put it in perspective, a good group leader that's not a ninja will let everyone know how BoE epics will be handled before anyone even loads into the instance. This doesn't just come out of left field, everyone knows what they're getting into. If they don't like it they can leave before investing any time, but nobody ever really does.
---
Had this happen in Scholo. We skip a mob that i’ve seen skipped every time with a full group of 60’s. I even point out the pack to the priest who’s a bit close. Not more than minute later he back peddles into it and we wipe. He then flips out about how much time we’re actually wasting skipping trash.
---
Hunter....which is kind of like cheating because we can take on mobs we really have no business taking on solo... but most other classes can also solo elite mobs close to their level (preferably a couple of levels below you). As long as the mobs are still green to you (which is, I believe, up to 9 levels below you) you should still get xp for them, and you have much better odds in the loot lottery of getting random greens or better.
---
what tourney and where??
---
In a Randy Marsh voice: "Fuck yooooooouuu"
---
Check out rule #2, pal.
---
Eh, there have been several times when this would bite me in the ass because I was close to dinging a level with good skill upgrades and could done it if I would have grinded like 15 mobs.    
---
I do feel like the 30s are the worst levels in the game though. 1-30 flew by, but 31-42 really dragged me down.  Maybe because you spend so much time competing for limited numbers of mobs with annoying drop rates for high numbers of quest items in STV?  Doing a bunch of SM kept me sane, since it's actually a fun dungeon.  42-50 so far has been pleasant, and hasn't felt like a grind.  Probably because the quests in Feralas, Tanaris, and Hinterlands feel like they flow a bit more than the grinding slog of questing in STV.
---
Try it for a bit, but maybe ask around about what other guilds are doing for loot. 
---
There is more to being in a guild than what epics are dropping and who they go to.
---
The members within the guild may be a fun bunch of people, but also could be a bunch of elitist pricks. Pick your battles, but know you have value.
---
Same, I started on private realms way back in TBC era when almost everything was broken and the realms were offline as much as on.  Over the years I cannot even remember the name of half the realms I have played on.  The community in classic is VERY different to my private realms experiences.
---
The best you can do is just get the +15 Agility for now.
---
Those atal ai gloves actually dont exist, the only damage they can roll is +fire
---
It's not just bad players, though. Nobody is perfect all the time, and sometimes when morale drops because one person goofs, other people lose focus and patience and start making mistakes, too. 
---
Some skips are definitely worth it, but others are just tempting fate.
---
Came here to say this.
---
So to counter the shit talking you drop specific details explaining that, yes, this person has no life outside of this game?
---
I would be an orc becasue armor looks so good on them but i chose tauren because i just love being a big beefy cow charging at you will full speed.
---
Yeah, not a fan personally of how picky some groups have been in progressing through ZF
---
(lots of parkour)
---
Blabla. I just greed if I don’t need an item. I might lose unexpected profit? How do I care.
---
Void up!
---
Statistically speaking, even at 50 runs there is a 7% chance it will not have dropped.  By 150 it is also highly unlikely but not impossible.
---
It also makes it so they can be used by warriors/feral druids/shaman/rets if the rogues dont want them, while not being optimal..
---
Also on 2H?
---
Wow classic is the most toxic community
---
In Classic PvE gear does surpass any PvP gear eventually so those BiS lists are ok to follow imo.
---
Thanks, man. Impressive numbers.
---
No,  it's dungeon loot and you need the item.
---
That doesn't matter when you stuck in unavoidable game mechanic, becauase you have no chance against it. As I saw in some dungeon the mobs random CC-ing the players.
---
With 500 people in a guild maybe 100 online, do the math. That's a msg every 3 mins. No one cares you hit lvl 32.
---
If you have Omen of Clarity, a clutch auto attack when you're OOM might bail you out of a bad situation.
---
I was in a group where two guys tied highest roll so they reroll and tie again. 3rd roll and they are 1 number apart from eachother.
---
elaborate?
---
Yes you can?
---
Honestly, it's significantly more efficient to do it this way than to use a guildie or friend. Everyone in LFG is looking for something. If someone else wants the thing you want, than they can join a different group or start their own.
---
I don't have time to grind a dungeon for 4 hours HOPING that it's my turn to get lucky. You could easily lose the roll indefinitely as the person who got it leaves and then has their spot filled by someone else that needs what you need.
---
If you don't like it, then don't join the group.
---
Don't have a guide for you but, here are two overlooked tips.
---
1) Don't fall for the BIS bullshit, +healing is great but so is spirit/mp5 and having a bit of stamina.
---
2) Biggest thing most people don't understand is the importance of pre-cast/cancelling heals, a ton of people fail at this right now and overheal/oom themselves every fight.
---
this varies by class, a mage for example will prio crit over int and stam.   Mana pool dont need to be huge, if you get hit you dead anyway so 300 extra health means nothing as you basically have no armor.  Stacking stam is wasting stat allocation as a single crit can make or break a fight for a mage.  
---
Generally speaking you are correct, but its far more class specific than that.  Priests for example wont bother with crit at all and will stack more stam/int or even +healing.
---
Always loved the name Benafflock
---
I think they could have pulled that off better. I dont think the undercity looks like anything that was used by lordaeron but repurposed as a city. I looked it up and apparently it's supposed to be royal catacombs? I would have never guessed that
---
What do the books do? I'm new here
---
Ive played private servers before so I have a general route. Theres tons of guides too out there that have routes to follow, but if its your first time through I would just enjoy the mystery aspect.
---
I just did it and it still told me there was only 1 shaman? I also answered shaman.
---
Stuff like that makes all the difference in wow, in life, relationships, organizations, dating apps, jobs...anything.
---
I get that a minority of wow players might not be...let's say "gregarious," but if you want more ret paladins to have their LoH at the ready, don't say "Wow I didn't think we'd finish this with a paladin" after they save your rear end.
---
I like how the first 3 sentences all describe the same thing but written differently. This post could be 2 sentences long and we’d understand the message.
---
As someone who heals that's a big HEEEELLLLLLLLLLLL NOOOOOOOOO from me lol
---
Ok you said that if you need a BOE you should have already bought it, well shouldn’t the others in the group have already bought there’s if they need it?
---
Ret paly.
---
Got it at 48 first run
---
I agree. The post was my (failing) attempt to explain why this is the best way to do.
---
some classes earlier than others, some not until AQ/Naxx.
---
e.g. - mages dont need mp5 or spirit or a ton of int in PvP, yet PvE gear is loaded with it. They do need a lot of stam though, which PvE gear seems to avoid giving you.
---
My personal theory is that it's because you're basically forced into doing STV a ton during those levels and about 80% of STV quests involve getting 8-20 very uncommon/rare drops from contested mobs for what are mostly garbage quest rewards. It just gets really freaking old hanging in that same zone off and on for a significant part of your 32-40 experience.
---
There is way more than 15% priests, priests are probably over 30% of the world pop.. almost half of them being shadow.
---
Already quested through, just not that much in shimmering flats
---
Nope, that explains it! I still need the 6% and not 5% based off the examples they gave. People with 307 or 312 still needed 6% because of the way the formula works.
---
If I wasn't in the level range I would consider that.  But since I am leveling in dungeons and not quite ready for ST there are worse things that could happen.
---
&gt; If a player truly needs a BoE item they would have already bought it from the AH
---
Maybe that item in question isn't being sold on the AH right now. Or maybe it is, but the amount people are wanting for it is absurd. You cannot justify denying someone an upgrade over your own greed. 
---
When it comes to bigger ticket items like BoE epics, then you might want to take the amount of money it could net you into account. But BoE blues? No. If it's an upgrade, it should be treated as such. 
---
To avoid this type of buffoonery, these things should be discussed before you set out. You were right about one thing: This topic is very divisive. But it doesn't need to be. Just look past your own greed for two seconds and let upgrades be upgrades.
---
Yes, and if Blizzard does do anything off the normal path I hope this is one of the first things they look into.
---
World of RuneCraft WarScape
---
Nice rebuttal. It's given me a lot to think about.
---
alirght thanks for the advice
---
I Beg to differ.
---
A elemental shaman in all cloth, no stamina and no shield is a free kill.  That is the gear these half baked pve pre-bis lists build for as it assumed you will take no damage and just spam a single spell in a vacuum.  For a lot of classes or hybrids a pre-bis pve list of genuinely terrible.  Another good example for bad ideas to bring to pvp is trustrike shoulders.  Additional hit% is basically useless, and it has zero stamina and is only leather.  Often when I see a hunter or warriors with these equipped its a free kill.
---
Think people are using the term ninja to loosely now. You need this item. You are allowed to roll. Everyone is selfish and they want to be the only person who benefits from the run. Everyone’s time is equal no one is better than anyone else
---
omg, please first read the arguments presented before you humiliate yourself by blabbing nonsense
---
Instead of calling it The Horde, just call it Horde
---
&gt;it has everything to do with maximizing the amount of time you can play. For people with jobs/families thats pretty important.
---
"sry guys g2g wife aggro"
---
"brb 10 min kid's crying"
---
I view the pve servers as containment servers. Better that you casual dadgamers are all there together.
---
Why are "reg" lvl19s in BGs though...?
---
We just have one member log on an alt, who resets the entrance while the rest of group is offline.
---
Then log back on and re-invite original member,  Everyone is now at the entrance drop down, with no repair bill.
---
Takes 40-60 seconds if you communicate over discord.
---
Sure, I mean.... all gearing is "subjective" based on what you're gearing for. For example a tank has threat vs mitigation vs resist sets and changes pieces out based on what is needed for the boss or situation. But there are still BiS lists out there for that.
---
Just like PvE there are items for PvP that are near irreplaceable. Which is why I find it odd that there are no lists(yet?). For example for warriors or paladins their BiS PvP gloves would be Stronghold Gauntlets, with the optional/budget option being Death Grips. This type of info is what makes the BiS lists nice, it gives you the "best" item for each slot, and usually an alternative that is not so great.
---
Hit past cap does still have value. Its just very, very low.
---
Later on, you will have more hit because you need to push crit cap further mainly.
---
This has nothing to do with following a stupid bis list. Right now, there are bis lists saying to wear mask of unforgiven over eye of rend, which is incorrect.  Most bis lists actually have too much hit.
---
The top parsers arent blindly following bis list. They look at the mechanics and realise they dont need extra hit when they can have crit and ap instead. Again, your warriors werent cancelling heroics in 2005.
---
You need to take a step back and look at the mechanics, not me. Instead of just doing what you vaguely remember from 2005 just because.
---
We have 1500 dps parses with 6% hit warriors. Figure it out man.
---
Why wouldn't everybody roll greed to keep it a BoE?
---
I just use my raid spec. 
---
The advantage of subtlety is the faster movespeed in stealth and prep letting you have another vanish.
---
I find that the movespeed doesn't slow you down too much because the mobs are so densely packed anyways and if I have to pop vanish then I try to burn some of the time waiting for CD by killing the non-elite tinkerers that pat solo, killing the fireguards, vendoring and then killing Plugger or opening junkboxes.
---
Even when they resist a pickpocket and I don't have vanish I can often make it out of the instance if I just pop sprint and evasion. Also helps to bring the nifty stopwatch trinket as an extra sprint.
---
Onyxia
---
on release day I stood on the same spawn for a lvl 3 tiger in mulgore for an hour to complete the starter quest. I feel you bro
---
if they won't give their OT priority over DPS warriors you should probably find  anew guild
---
I’m making my shaman resto for MC/Ony  guild runs. What’s a build that’ll keep ya resto but have some dps/survivability for open world content/farming?
---
Youre totally right. Somebody speedrunning would have half my time and I did have a lot of rested exp because I cant play much due to school. I think a lot of newer guys just have 10-14 days played on average because its their first time through the classic leveling.
---
Yes because tanks can totally manage a clear of something quickly and efficiently with no DPS right? 
---
What even is this elitist mentality? It's WoW. You're not special for playing tank.
---
Recipe is 1g50s. You need a lot of money to buy all these recipes when no one has money to buy them off the AH from you
---
If no loot rules are discussed prior you can assume that everyone is going to roll on whatever they want. You did nothing wrong.
---
This was essentially what the Achievements were. Gave cool titles and aesthetic items but didn't impact the actual game play. I wish they would add that in sooner.
---
The funny part is they would do the exact same thing if the roles were reversed. I'm choosing to have an easy, fast, and carefree run. Not a 5 hour brd run where the group falls apart after multiple wipes and repairs from accidental aggro pulls.
---
Nah, he was cool about it. He was just new. There was even a pretty dicey pull early in the dungeon where he died and I tried to trade him 5g, but he wouldn't take it.
---
Yeah that's the other way.  Either way there is no repair bill as non equipped gear doesn't lose durability with death.
---
I should add, since the vast majority are pug runs we aren't on discord to coordinate that.
---
In general, the BiS PvP gear is going to be PvP gear, which wont be available until phase 2/3
---
I might come say hi! And totally not get the shit beat out of me, I'm sure.
---
No, besides I tanked with that cloak most of the time over "tank cloaks" anyway. Still use it occasionally even though I have Dragon's Blood Cape because it's the best threat option I have and cloaks have poor defensive value anyway.
---
Pretty much. They both look like Louisiana 😂
---
Reword to say: "from the launch date, has your game play increased, decreased, or stayed the same?"
---
FWIW level 52 seems like the perfect level for a holy priest to do LBRS and it can indeed be insane xp/h. At 52-54 LBRS xp beats BRD xp hands down there is no contest.
---
If your pet can eat meat, buy from a vendor. I usually go down one rank of meat for my pet. For example, if I’m say level 37 and I eat lvl 35 food, I will buy lvl 25 meat from the vendor for my pet. Usually keeps him well fed. Also increased loyalty decreases the amount you have to feed your pet
---
Playing a role in a pug doesn't mean it's your role overall. If you are going to use and it's an upgrade you need, it's that simple. You did nothing wrong. Getting DPS gear is a tank privilege, as long as you're not a dick about it.
---
Basically be focused and deliberate in your actions instead of rushing.  Avoid rushing and panic, this is taught to military combat MOSs also.
---
For casters I would not recommend their Dungeon 1 set. It has next to no spellpower and magisters/devout lacks stamina.  Even for hybrids, elements and wildheart is also quite bad, as it is just a random mash of stats making it quite awful for elemental, resto and enhance.
---
There are much better one-off dungeon blues with tons of stamina, and often spellpower that is in a 1:1 comparison leagues better.
---
Depends on the PR. Before anything else I'll add a complete DB for all spells of all classes so I don't have to rely on tooltips. Talent behavior is so stupidly inconsistent that figuring out what spells need what talent/buff applied takes more time than everything else, which is why I stopped adding more, also I had to play the game for once :)  
---
After that I need to fix how effect modifiers work, because not only will I need separate dmg and heal ones then, they also need to be multiplicative from what I could test.  
---
Once that's done I can just add everything without having to ask people what their talents do to tooltips.
---
I’m an undead and my name is Deadperson.

Is there a good place to level a ranged weapon?

just got a crossbow at 60 and would like to constantly shoot an enemy which wouldnt be able to get to me.
---
edit:Did abit more googling, mobs by the dark portal 'Servant of Razelikh' don't die unless you have qst. Are working out pretty well. (Pet is tanking)
---
Lol 31 people took time to click that. Proves my point. Glad you guys have a place to whine about grey text.
---
because that opens the door for ninjas , like you already spoke about  briefly in OP...   4 roll greed, the 5th who sees that thinks, "hey I can actually use that thing, although I would never pay 200g for it, I can press this little N button and have it for free.."    thnx bye suckers!
---
The best you got is RNG favored me? are you fucking kidding me? 
---
There’s no way in hell you’d pass me Sash of Mercy if it dropped and someone ninja needed and we all need and you win. I’ll believe it when I see it.
---
I see, well, i dont know... I guess you could just say fuck it for that ring and get 2 of the same DM tribute one, not sure how much of a dps loss over the one from Mara would be, just thinking about your sanity here.
---
Hmmm this survey is bugged then. It also showed 1 for me from the screenshot I took.

---
As a general rule, don't downrank healing spells until you have enough +healing gear to make it worthwhile (in other words, probably not before 60), or you're fishing for procs. For comparison:
---
Healing Wave (Rank 3): 1.86 Health per Mana - 59.8 Health per Second
---
Healing Wave (Rank 4): 1.95 Health per Mana - 101 Health per Second
---
So by down-ranking to Rank 3 you're actually spending more mana overall, and healing slower, which leads to more time out of the 5-second rule.
---
That druid was a douche. Good luck in your next run!

It's because of the poor literacy rates among shamans.

See, I know retail isn't very popular in this sub, but one thing they did right was letting you go between FPs without needing ALL connecting points.
---
Ah yeah, keep farming until you're not of level for it then consider paying
---
So you think that because you play tank and more people play DPS that you should be allowed to reserve something because you were "noble" enough to allow everyone else to use your tanking services, but the DPS shouldn't because... There's a lot of them?
---
Can you not solo it? I’ve seen a YouTube video of a mage soloing it so assume any ranges could.

If you are a fisher, you can fish up mithril bound trunks on the coast of tanaris. I have a couple friends that leveled their fishing doing that and netting a good chunk of change.

---
No, not in 5 man pugs. If your class can use it, then you should be able to roll on it. Locking fury warriors from being able to need on things they need for raid gear because they chose to tank is bullshit.
---
This is why people can't find tanks. Because a fury warrior is afraid to throw on a sword on board because people will get mad if they roll on a non tank item.

A chance of containing a class book for a class trinket hand in (these can be sold on AH), and very occasionally an epic book called Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying that starts a quest for Warriors or Paladins to do something during the Onyxia fight for the Main Hand tanking sword Quel'Serrar

Of the 100 or so dungeons I've run at 60 I'd say the loot rules were only outlined a dozen or so times. Of those I'd say 10 were about which items were reserved. A couple times the leader said to need on all BoE epics. Once, when one dropped the rules hadn't been established. The leader said "all need," so we did. 
---
I'm not convinced the norm is need before greed for epic BoEs.
---
Yea this is my only character other than bank alts. Ive leveled in the classic world before as a rogue so I know where to go and what to do for the most part. If its your first time through, especially without a guide I would say 10-14 days would be average time played to get to 60.

I grinded for my mount in Swamp of Sorrows. Being 38 you’ll want to stick to the whelps to start, but you could also farm the larger Dragonkin once you gain a level or two. The reason I recommend this farm is for two reasons: Swamp of Sorrows normally stays pretty quiet, and Dragonkin mobs allow you to double dip. Not only do they drop money every time (like humanoids), but you’re also able to skin them. The occasional trash/green drop also helps. Good luck!

Go to Dustwallow Marsh and farm the raptors up north, vendor everything (unless it is worth it on the AH) and skin everything. (**Edit**: You could go to the Swamp of Sorrows and farm dragon whelps for vendor trash, dragonscales and maybe a whelpling or 2!)
---
You should have no problem making 22g in that time. When you hit 40 be sure to only train the spells/abililties that you *need* as an arms warrior- don't train everything right away if you want that mount asap!

The alternative is to train all the spells then grind for a bit to get the mount money but I wou

I tried this a couple of weeks back and people were too damn nice to actually take the bait
---
We weren't canceling heroics, but we did parse logs and knew full well the value of weapskill. The only unknown was the extra 1% miss being flat.
---
Cancelling heroics only influences your offhand. That's 1/3rd of your auto damage.
---
Passing yellow hit cap is far from wasted stats. It's more damage and more rage, on top of helping minimize bad luck streakiness. With a good chunk of the best endgame fury gear having both hit and crit, it's frankly stupid to religiously maintain yellow cap.
---
I have a sneaking suspicion most BiS lists won't include absolutely OP items that look meh to your average player, like fetish of the sand reaver.
---
What he's saying is he doesn't want to join groups where everyone is needing all BoE drops. That's all.
---
So by definition, he means "needing on stuff you cannot equip/use." Which makes sense. The term you're looking for is "greed." If you are aiming to make money off an item, the button you press is "Greed." If you intend to use an item, because it upgrades your equipment or augments your playstyle, the button you press is "Need."

I wouldnt say Wotlk ruined the game. It had some of the best written and designed raids and lore imo. It hurt that feeling of community of trying to talk to people and get groups together I will admit, but that didnt harm the overall game.

My friend ran UBRS for a belt with a 25% drop chance. Had to run the instance almost 50 times for it. If 10,000 people ran that instance 50 times, 9,997 would’ve gotten the belt.

Thank you for the advice but ive already checked my monitor settings to make sure that Freesync is running

To be clear... it's flat DKP bidding, not an EP/GP ratio?

Just like it only takes that one tank who thinks he knows the fastest way through a dungeon but skips mobs who then aggro the healer, or thinks he can manage a pull but wipes the group because he overestimated, or thinks he knows correct target priority and causes multiple people in the group to die for no reason, or charges a pack before Mana users have time to drink.
---
Same thing goes for healers who are late on heals because they're too busy spamming overheals on the tank.

Stick to prison for pure xp. But getting a shot at BiS loot is fun so adding arena and angerforge serves that purpose for many.

I wouldn't pay too much attention to him. He's riding that #WarlockMasterClass train.
---
Yes and no. The classic addons might have allowed you to sort by price in a better way but they didn't make it easier to buy 1 item stacks. Especially with the automation of TSM it has become very easy to still buy en mass. With the classic Auctionator and so on you might've been able to see what the cheapest 1 item stacks are but if you needed 200 of those you'd still have to have clicked &gt;200 times if it was one stacks. Way easier to buy bigger stack in that case. The features to handle those 1 item stacks might've been available but not so upfront as they are in TSM.
---
The problem is that the default UI doesn't allow you to easily skip those 1 item stacks. So if you need those 200 items you either click through dozens of pages (and the WoW UI is very slow in that case) or you just give up. The difference with the AH is that for infrequent users the overhead of an addon like TSM is just way too much while also inhibiting their ability to use that feature at all in a meaningful way. That's not the case with other features of WoW. Image if fights no longer had chat announcement and particular visuals and Blizzard instead relied on everyone having DBM.
---
LOL.  
---
So, I know your just a dumb rogue, but fury warriors have a resource called rage. When we do damage, we get rage. When we get an extra attack, we get RAGE. We not only get damage from the attack, but damage from our subsequent abilities we use with that rage. We also have a 100% uptime attack speed buff called flurry, just like you have slice and dice. We also don't need more than 9% hit because heroic strike canceling makes our off hand never miss. So rune of the guard captain is better for a rogue and useless on a fury.   
---
HoJ for us is easily better than it is for a rogue, just because of the rage alone. Silly rogues that don't know how other classes work.
---
People want to use the spec they choose in raid.
---
Alliance: Go big or go Gnome.
---
Not entirely. But I can agree to disagree.
---
Your best resource is almost always going to be your class's discord. I know the classic shaman discord has some lists / rankings of pvp gear per phase.
---
I actually thought it was goldshire remade in wc3
---
&gt;Literally any dps that pulls aggro can manage it themselves in someway.
---
They rarely seem to bother though and it stresses the healer too much. The vast majority of healers before 60 are DPS spec who just can't cope with multiple targets taking damage. I tanked BRD on my druid yesterday and the druid healer had less mana than me in my tanking gear (3500 compared to my 4000). He oomed constantly.
---
No, shadow weaving is also "increase shadow damage" same as shadowform
---
I think STV probably does play a large part in it for sure, especially on a pvp server. You can love PvP every day of the week, but when you just want to make some progress and get ganked into oblivion, I think most people enjoy the game less at that point. I noticed far less horde were willing to attack me when I got past that bracket, almost as if people are so traumatized by STV that they're more passive in later levels.
---
Weapons are just stat-sticks for feral druids. Don't worry about the weapon speed or damage. The only thing they give you is the stats attached to the weapon. So at this point you would just do a direct comparison to the +18 AP and choose whatever is better!
---
I understand both sides, but on the chance that the guy with the professions genuinely wants the recipe badly to use...It's not that fair to him if everybody were to need. Sure, you can avoid ninja and the guy can possibly still get the recipe from the guy who won...but then what if it's someone who's being greedy and will only sell it when the guy with the profession was gonna use to learn it? The guy with the profession will just get fucked over.
---
Questionable leadership to only gear out 1 tank. Also highly unfair if he's getting gear for free and still accruing DKP to bid on other items on top. Most guilds will prioritize at least 2 tanks with a 3rd as second priority.
---
I also wanted to be a guild MT and ended up in an OT role, but it's probably about as good as I can expect without trying to make my own guild. It's very uncommon for a guild to form up without a MT already established so unless you are part of the founding group it's unlikely you'll get such a role (at least not initially).
---
its all the same equation, there's no wrong way around.  what i was saying is the actual weapon type has no effect on the calculation.
---
Unless the mob is ranged, once it sees there is no path to reach you it will just forever evade.
---
nah many 8 min arena/anger runs or 15 min arena/anger/golum runs
---
One of the biggest things i like about classic wow is the fact that you can actually finish things. In retail theres unending gear progression through titanforging and tertiary stats. Theres the unending grind that is the neck AP(?). Theres rewards for continuing to gain rep past exalted. You never really “check things off a list” and feel like you’re done with that grind. Some people may like always progressing with no end in sight, but i’m not one of those people.
---
How could you be the ninja? There was no discussion about drops before you joined based on what you said, and you BOTH need rolled.
---
I just checked the vanilla friends website and no one was there...  Didn't see anything in the forum's for it.  Thanks!
---
As a healer this is a nightmare. I can't heal 4 tanks. It's especially annoying when they complain about healing afterwards.   
---
Reminder, if the tank dies it's the healers fault, if the healer dies it's the tanks fault, if the dps dies it's their own fault.

It's about as much of an exploit as solo tribute runs.

---
I haven't found a single item from honor that is better than things that drop in raids so I really don't see the point of PvP.
---
I don't even remember the Group and Raid finder in WotLK. Shows how much I actually remember.
---
That would only be the case if they were a monopoly, but since they have competition it isn’t the case. Lol
---
That code to me...it means "We have literally nothing".
---
I don't think either of those are good main hands for fury warriors. Both of those are almost exclusively for tanks because their top-end damage is so low. 
---
Both of those weapons ARE BiS options for prot warriors though. Obviously Quell'serar is better, but the Claw is a very good alternative that's much easier to get.

But prison clear/ arena to us has meant we clear the first main room, no skip, do arena, then head towards interrogator, but we do that whole loop, not the hallway with the rooms, clear both sides of the back entrance, then do the boss, and then finish the loop and reset, so it’s probably not a full prison clear, because there is the loop by arena, but I’ve found that depending on the group, it’s just faster to reset at that point and we’ve crossed the 10-15 min point so we don’t need to worry about the lockout 
---
If the team is doing well, we can do the loop for hound master, but we’ve also wiped a few times because those groups are also bigger and sometimes the runaways pull them
---
&gt; That’s fair, but if it drops why shouldn’t the player who can equip it get it? Everyone acts like other people are gonna use that gold to &gt;buy there BIS BOE when in reality they are probably gonna buy there epic mount or level a profession or use it to play the AH for more money.
---
and that is fine.  You should see these items as little Jackpot goldboxes.  they are BOEs, so by definition not farmable. It's not like this Boss drops that BOE...  no these are just bonuses that can drop anywhere (within limits, sometimes extreme narrow limits)
---
If you win one, lucky you, no you can decide what to do, equip it? or sell it.
---
One common mistake is that people think that if they equip it they don;t lose the 500g the item is worth.   (But I won it for free!!! in stratholme it cost me 0 gold)  NO equipping it cost you 500g as you destroyed the 500g value..   
---
If I have 500g I can buy the item and then I have 0 gold and the item. ButI can also no equip the item and resell it for 500g.  So I still have 500g.   until I equip it.   
---
The lucky winner is in the exact same situation as the person who bought the item but has not equipped it yet.
---
The only exception here I would say are (some) Flask recipes and stuff like Warlock / Mage Tailoring Patterns, because those ARE farmable, as they always drop from the same mobs.   This means a warlock going for robe of the Void can say, hey I want this robe, I am a  tailor, let me have it,  when they are at Darkmaster Gandling.
---
"guys my pet just died wtf, what, no why would I have dismissed it?"
---
Yeah this has pretty much been my thought. You have all these people using pieces that give them little to no defensive stats. Glass cannon dps and heals are all well and good in PvE when you're not getting focused..... but PvP is a different story.
---
What if its Warden Staff and they havent gotten the 500g for it yet to buy?
---
Thank you for having this discussion with me. I appreciate you taking the time to clearly make your points. You are correct.
---
See! It is possible to have a civilized chat on the internet!
---
Yeah I guess being on a pvp server it becomes a necessity imo.
---
Not an exploit
---
It's barely better than t0 chest. It looks nice and is purple. But it really does not deserve the color looking at its stats.
---
That’s not what happened though , i am DPS spec and rolled on DPS gear. You being resto and needing on boomkin gear is a different scenario. If I was a DPS rolling on tank gear your comparison would be accurate
---
I shaman healed Wailing Caverns at level 19, and my main problem was being out of mana after nearly every fight. After posting my experience here, I was told level 20 is a turning point for shaman healing. I was healer in WC again at level 21, and yes, having Lesser Healing Wave and the Healing Stream Totem made the run so much easier -- like night and day difference. So I would say your level (18) was the biggest problem for you.
---
Now, if I was giving advice to an upcoming shaman healer, I'd say after Ragefire Chasm, don't even try to dungeon heal until you hit level 20 and at least get Lesser Healing Wave.

Maybe realize that Onyxia resets every 5 days so that you can do it more than one time per character? Did you really do the Onyxia attunement just to kill it once and never again? Get over it. You aren't going to win everything every time, and I honestly don't know how you got this idea in the first place.
---
Ogar!
---
u/ignus-pugnator is correct, but as an alternative you could roll an alt that is better at farming and use them for supplemental income for your priest. Consider rolling a warlock, mage, or hunter that can just destroy things 10x faster than your priest and your income should shoot up pretty fast.

this is a dank meme, i hope it survives moderation
---
I think you meant to type out druid no big deal though.
---
I'm dying
---
Several reasons:
---
1. Getting items is better than not getting them, and shorter runs means you get more boss items.
---
2. You are unlikely to ever full clear large dungeons like BRD without replacing at least one person, so skipping stuff lets you get further before finding replacements.
---
3. At some point, XP becomes much less valuable than getting the right items.
---
Being farmed in phase 2 is what will make kids quit...and I can't wait.
---
Well there are a couple options of what you can do.
---
You don't want to make a guild tax, but there is always asking if people want to help out.  Some might, but others won't.  Usually this builds resentment among though who help and those who don't.
---
If you are a raiding guild it wasn't uncommon for players who "donated" to be rewarded with shit like DKP.  Once again, players might feel like it becomes necessary to farm for the guild.
---
The guild can sell off stuff which comes from raids like the MC crafting mats or BoEs no one needs/wants.
---
This was already posted today
---
Tanks can advertise Strat live runs with 1 (well, more if they want) Orbs reserved as a way to get some gold - farming gold is notoriously horrible in Prot spec. Due to the lack of tanks it's not too uncommon, and I think 1 orb is pretty fair.
---
I do it with a rogue and resto druid, not sure how a feral would work
---
Buddy of mine did this years ago with the ogre suits. He would put one up on the AH for 50 gold and then log out and log in with another toon and offer 100 gold. As soon as someone bought his off the AH (someone always did), he'd log out. Did this for months as he had tons of ogre suits from his time working on the original Insane title.
---
Yeah you're impossible to reason with. You keep acting as if a tank is some charity case. In the rare occasion we have a tank leave a grp and the DPS steps up to tank, he ABSOLUTELY gets DPS gear. Someone queueing as tank gets tank gear, idgaf what u say. Otherwise, DPS should be able to roll on Tank and healing gear, and that's not fair in the slightest.
---
 Just as u say "He's tanking for you", well guess what? The healer is healing for you. Maybe its a druid healer that wants tank gear. Can he roll since he's going out of his comfort zone to heal? Yeah, doesn't make sense does it?
---
Also - the beginning of my conversation wasn't that tanks don't roll on DPS gear, otherwise we wouldn't have tanks. It's when the tanks expect the DPS to *not* roll on DPS gear.
---
Nobody knows what spec you are the expectation is you're rolling on the loot for the role youre filling....like I said.  If you're not rolling on the loot foe the role youre filling you should talk about it before the dungeon or you're gonna piss people off.  What's so hard about this?
---
I went and blew my horn at the tree once, and someone else stole it from me. I had to go back and get the horn all over again.

Chromatic carapace doesn’t benefit my raid DPS

Yes, but it's incredibly rare still.
---
Hey it's the daily "I'm a bad tank" thread
---
Y’all are pathetic. “I understand there’s a default loot setup but that doesn’t benefit me enough so let me change it.” I’ve played this game probably longer then you’ve been alive. Granted that might only be a handful of years for you two chuckleheads. You ever consider that you don’t do more guild runs because no one wants to run anything with you again?
---
I think it can only be abused by people who don't follow the system. It works great if people use it the way it was intended. You're always going to get that one guy who presses the need button "on accident" and, oops! Suddenly he is "inconveniently disconnected."
---
As mentioned before, bigger ticket items like BoE epics need special consideration. It's the only time where I can fall in line with an "everyone need" situation, to avoid the aforementioned instance.
---
This is a great thought experiment and perfectly covers my argument. I hope some of them answer, but I suspect they wont.

If your guild is fine with you not having mana tide totem (i.e., if you are assigned to a melee group), you should be able to heal that content fine as an elemental shaman 30/0/21.

I'm interested!  Comment so I can come back later!

Personally worst part of lives is spiders. But that path you skip is no cake walk but it’s only 3-5 pulls depending on lvl.
---
I explained why it literally wouldn't work. Are you simple?
---
you're not lost, this guy is just a moron. there's no way anyone should bother taking a 52 to LBRS because the aggro range is insane compared to how the dungeon is typically pulled. he just wants to get carried to 60 and get stacked in gear on the way
---
Nice,  I had to use the sticky glue + freezing trap to tame him at 23.    First attempt with only freezing trap = died, then a panic run back hoping no one else took him before I could do the glue/trap combo.

I’m a Troll Hunter on Kromcrush. Had a Warrior tank “accidentally” need on my tier 0 boots in Strath undead. He said “oh sorry, didn’t see they were mail”. Total bullshit. I bet he saw the high agility boots and rolled need. He could easily get some better strength boots. I was annoyed. And then later he won the roll for key to the city over me.
---
Even if it was an accident, how can you not take 2 seconds to look at what the loot is before choosing need.
---
I mean, then you're playing with bad people.
---
It definitely does happen, sometimes you get a group that has no spatial awareness, is trying to carry their friend who is 3 levels lower than they should be for this dungeon, or doesn't read party chat at all and only looks at their Discord. However, this doesn't mean the skips are bad, or even hard, it just means those players are bad. I also wouldn't suggest that only skips waste time in those groups, because those kinds of players do all sorts of other dumb shit that causes wipes, like pulling aggro off tanks, bodypulling before a tank can pull, messing up the one mechanic that a boss has because they can't read WoWhead beforehand, failing to cc properly, etc. 
---
More anecdotally, I've noticed these bad players are also usually the ones that want to rush through a dungeon as quickly as possible, so be prepared to get a bunch of shit for not doing skips by them.

okay thanks for that

Fully agree with this. Players are bad, and the tank is responsible for not anticipating how bad his group is.

Case in point: I frequently tank runs with a priest who is an amazingly good healer. He often brings along an IRL friend (mage) who is hilariously bad. We don't expect him to be able to do anything other than press random keys (ie. no sheep, counterspell, etc.) and set up pulls accordingly. Runs go surprisingly smoothly as a result.
---
Might be best just to join someone who is farming some mobs in the open world.
---
There are a lot of people who are farming essences all around the world.... EPL and Silithus especially. Could just join up with one of them and tell them you aren't interested in the essences, just the skill-up.  Might be the easiest.
---
I’m a tank and I’d expect everyone to need on that and I can buy it myself if I lose. Also, don’t bs you don’t lose gold every dungeon. I don’t think I’ve ran one dungeon and lost gold after vendoring and repairing, from lv1-60. You can make a farm alt like I am working on, you don’t NEED that item immediately there’s plenty of time to get it, or farm the gold to buy it.
---
Yeah, unfortunately I’ll most likely be replacing the mask and MH sword soon which are the coolest items imo
---
&gt; hey I can actually use that thing, although I would never pay 200g for it
---
THAT'S MY ARGUMENT! That's exactly what we have now. Need before greed leads to people hitting the "little N button" on items they wouldn't normally buy. I don't know where you stand on the need before greed argument, but thank you for making my point better than I did.
---
void walker is so bad in this classic patch, its actually kind of sad
---
There's a site called sixtyupgrades, their warlock build says 1crit = 12.7 spell power, and 1hit = 19 spell power
---
damn, awesome, thanks.
---
When I'm killing princess I see it constantly and it's super annoying because I can only hold one and nobody buys carries anymore
---
It's a 50/50 fine.
---
Next time tell the people that you're fury and just tanking for them right now, you will roll on fury gear. That way everything is clarified and everyone knows what's going on and if they want you or not.
---
It’s not https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#
---
Yet another one! Good stuff
---
It's funny because mages that pull aggro are one of the best classes at dealing with it, but in all these threads the tanks complain about mages. Hmm
---
I tanked BRD at 52 on my warrior, even specced as fury prot it was very hard to hold aggro once the mobs and bosses switched to 55/56
---
Quests for both alliance and horde at pier in feralas, to zap the giants and kill water elementals.
---
dude i want that
---
OMGOFOFOGOAOGOOAOOGOO
---
Opens chest and gets 1 green.
---
It's also the second best elf simulator after p99
---
20% salt brine for 30 minutes.
---
Damn. GOOD JOB, SIR!
---
I know warlocks can solo it. But it would take longer and be more annoying. If you go with a warlock/mage duo, you're not competing on the same drakestone roll and its faster.
---
From my experience, everything is easy to find except tanks.
---
But that penalized those classes unduly, better to reserve, and let them decide.
---
I thought this was a destiny 2 reference, to Brakilon when you jump down that “well” right before the boss fight.
---
hahahahahahahaha 
---
lol, that was a good old fashioned belly laugh
---
'played longer than you....'
---
that is hilarious...  
---
I would post my total /played time in vanilla (2005-2006 and 2013-2018 pservers and now 2019 in classic)  , but I am a bit ashamed of it to be honest so I won't.    Still TY for bringing some well needed humor in this topic.
---
You dont need fetish with a fury tank's threat. That's just more old school stuff from old metas. Maybe to save an ignite that gets out of hand.
---
Again, I never said to religiously maintain hit cap through the phases. i literally said the opposite, twice. Can you read please?
---
But you dont need more than yellow cap in prebis.
---
You do actually want more hit in this phase if your hitting crit cap with world buffs. Thats the only reason. Since you havent  mentioned it yet I can tell you aint got a clue what crit cap is.
---
You keep talking about spiky rage. Me and other furies in guild have infinite rage with world buffs. Dont even have to cancel HS on bosses just queued the whole time. You dont need hit for the few white main hand swings you make when you actually cancel. Its way less than 2/3 of white damage.
---
Bro if you wanna announce everyone need on BoEs at the start of the instance power to you, just don’t expect me to stick around and tank so you can go AH my foror’s. Default loot rules are need before greed and if you’re gonna change that and not say anything you’re ninjaing.
---
What is ur tactic so speedrun DMW?
---
Are Desolace and Swamp of Sorrows good questing for horde? (Not back to back. Tried Desolace but it’s seems pretty spread out).
---
Not if you just wanna know how many people are playing a paladin. No need to complicate it.
---
Lol whichever way you want to interpret it. Point being it applies after bear form instead of before
---
First time WoW?
---
There are many factors that led to the bad rep for the hunter class
---
I don't think anyone has suggested that your way is the default except you.
---
You are going to need to explain why yours is the default better then greed is the picture of a coin.
---
I treat that ramp like an escalator and the direction it goes is up.
---
Gotta be a fluke, I still get random messages asking if I want to heal runs.  Never happens as a dps.
---
You cracked the code!
---
I bet! I know literally 8 rogues who got it on the first 5 runs, they’ve been trying to help me farm with stealth runs, but after 10 or 15 runs I feel bad for them and say fuck it lol. Whoever comes with me makes major $$$ because I don’t roll on the blues that drop, I’ve seen that fucking axe over 100+ times!
---
I’ve lost a roll on it twice to hunters . I feel demoralized going into the arena
---
Big ol CHONK human wearing a dwarf mask. Nice
---
As I get closer to lvl 60 ( I’m at 52 )
---
I can definitely feel the... “hey you should be a healer now” 
---
Pressure
---
I mean the spec I’m aiming for is 32/8/11
---
And while I will be maining a healer I still aspire to DPS in dungeons. 
---
Honestly I usually get a lot of praise for it
---
Having improved blessing of wisdom and keeping judgement of wisdom on my target allows my mana users to benefit from insane amounts of mana regeneration.
---
I managed to hunt down MP5 rings/necklace which allows me to keeps Up with my seal of command and consecration. Allowing me to output some decent dps and spot heal
---
When necessary Or whip out my shield and offank.
---
Hell I’ll even divine shield/blessing of sacrifice the tank to soak large amounts of damage 
---
Is it optimal dps... nope.
---
Paladins are team players I just prefer to wield a two hander and bash an enemies face while doing it.
---
Some do. Is competing with others to kill the umpteenth mob for the chance to drop the coyote part you need for a quest any different? Maybe / Maybe not.
---
I got lucky and had a guild group to grind it with. The people I was lucky enough to play with made it a blast. We did the same with BRD and it significantly lessened the "grind" feeling.
---
I also healed the majority of dungeons that I ran which added some variance, but your mileage may vary. I could see it getting pretty boring just hitting frost bolt / shadow bolt / sinister strike / serpent sting / mortal strike, etc.
---
I noticed the same thing
---
Makes sense, it just slows you down alot
---
This is what every guide I've read has said.
---
Misread yours. My B
---
Doesn't work at all. Get Icon on mini map, it's in a session and no window pops up.
---
Late game Fury and tank warriors should not be competing for gear. Fury wars will be competing with hunter and rogue. Unless they decide to roll off spec, in which case I'd boot
---
Ha, Lib I imagine. That's where my BoE dagger dropped. The Hypnotic Blade dropped twice in a row, I was kicked just before the last boss on the second run, and my mage friend whom was still in the group lost the roll both times. I feel that man.
---
he beats up on me and I'm (nearly) full prebis prot warrior
---
the upside is I never have to kite at least
---
It can happen with lots of half-pug groups. Way easier to get a Guild tank/healer and pug dps than it is the other way around.
---
How much it cost?
---
In retail, you can cast a spell while mounted (or interact with something) and it will auto-dismount you and you will begin performing that action.   In Classic, even with Leatrix, auto-dismounting still triggers an internal GCD before you can perform the action.
---
Right? Just the gentle push in the right direction is so nice.
---
Back in the day I used Gatherer and would get node location updates from guildies also using it.  I couldn't find Gatherer itself but found GatherMate2 and assumed it would do the same but doesn't seem to.  Am I overlooking how to turn that on or does it not do it?  Is there a better addon alternative for this purpose?
---
Sorry, but you have it backwards. I'm not debating or arguing with you I'm telling you how it is.
---
If no loot rules are stated and an epic BoE drops I'm going to need on it if anyone else needs. And no one is getting reported or punished because that is the intended mechanic.
---
If I do that and you boot me or something to prevent me from getting the drop because of 'your loot rules' you invented in your head you will be reported and banned.
---
Heed the advice or don't you're the one who will face the consequences. Sadly you don't seem to know the basics of loot mechanics.
---
Yup, doesn’t work anymore. If someone is able to get this to work, please let me know.
---
Yeah, got mindthrust bracers on my second run. It seems like you can do 3-4 runs an hour and get 3-4 gold a run before blues (d/e to save space because the ride from ironforge is long) but I was mostly running it to unwind, not sure about max efficiency travel time and such if you actually wanted to make serious gold farming comparisons.
---
Because he needed it for his MS. He tanked for the run with his OS. He has every right to roll for his MS.
---
That said, OP doesn't make it clear if the rest of the group knew, when he was invited, that his spec was Fury, since all he says is *"a rogue message me and asked me if I would come tank"*, although the later bit *"No I’m actually a fury warrior"* does imply he never let it be known before he won that roll...
---
Still, when I want an item bad, I inspect others who might roll on it and/or ask them about their intentions.
---
But I can look at the 1500 dps parses on warcraft logs and see them using 6 hit. Nothing subjective there.
---
I tried that. It only shows an aura bar when the timer is short like renew. Things like fortitude don’t show up anymore
---
Imagine meme elitism.
---
I find the biggest cause of wipes is from people panicking and/or not knowing their class.
---
An extra pack pulled doesn't always mean a wipe. But if it makes the players panic then it's almost a guarantee. And if people know their class they can save a pretty sticky situation.
---
It also really helps to be on voice chat and not play with randoms.
---
I have the claw currently AND I have the book for quel'serrar. I'm currently using the claw as my MH in a fury setup because it's the best I currently have. The other alternative would be mirah's song which has about 8 less dps and no flurry proc. I am trying to get dal'rend's sacred charge but this is what I have to work with currently.
---
Have fun looking for a tank for 5 mans if you don’t let damage warrior tanks roll on damage gear.
---
I work full time, 40 hours a week. I own my house, have 1 cat and sometimes hang with my family on the weekends but those are my priorities/responsibilities. Do I burn out on games? yes. 
---
On WoW? meh, some days I get frustrated and get off a little early, but I'm motivated by the fact that i'm getting beat in MC by another mage in DPS. There's always something to do in WoW, from grinding gold for gear/raid mats to helping friends get geared and leveled or just dicking off (which i don't do too often in WoW). Hell even checking the auction house for decent deals/ making gold.
---
I have 3-4 good friends that play, i'm always talking to people in discord so i'm never alone for all that time either. Lots of people pop in and out to say hey. Seems to be a common misconception among people older than me ( I'm 27) that i'm just sitting in my loft alone playing video games all week lol.
---
Some days I hop on Overwatch or Apex when my I feel burnt out and play some of that which is a nice change of pace, I'm pretty decent at FPS games.
---
/s... you forgot this
---
I didn't like desolace myself for the same reason you just gave.  It's too big and spread out.  Felt like I was running around the whole place.  Swamp of Sorrows was really nice though.
---
Only do this if you actually want to play one of those classes as an alt. It’s almost never worth it to level and gear an alt purely for gold farming (in the amount of time it takes you to level/gear the alt, your main would have farmed the gold already).
---
I think i do but don't
---
Lmao in my current post arrangement your post is right under a post asking that very question xD
---
I think amplify curse only works on curse of weakness and curse of agony.
---
I actually got flamed for advertising for a tank as a warrior last night. We were waiting for awhile, but all questing individually and fine with the wait.
---
I just kinda wanted to chill out and whack shit without thinking. I already have a job, I just want to play how I want to play. 
---
This wasn't a low level dungeon, but it reminded me of it.
---
Nope
---
He’s paying blizzard twice as much
---
&gt; I think Druids are the undisputed kings of fishing, honestly. It's nice, steady income that you can do easily and because of aquatic form you can find and get to good fishing spots faster
---
I main druid and I'm lost. Aquatic Form is basically walking speed (100%)... if you're water walking aren't you faster mounted or Travel Form? Nodes are next to the shore, so it's not like you have to swim out into the middle of the ocean to find them.
---
You’re mostly just yelling in the wind lol
---
All chest have a chance to drop stuff of their appropriate levels, that includes Grey's to even legendaries in the newer xpacs. I used to farm world items like chests and whatnot and have gotten just about everything!
---
why would it be the dude pays for multiple accounts
---
He’s one of the only white Lions in the game. He’s actually a worse pet than many other cats, because he has a 2.0 attack speed.
---
I've run it 8 times. 1st run it drops but an enhancement shaman guildy won the roll, next 7 times the eye drops but has a very similar drop rate. FML, I'll try more but dam it's so annoying
---
They both work.. yours just has 600k more subs 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
ML was still an option. It wasn't until Legion, I believe, that all group runs (including pre-made) were Personal Loot only. LFR was the only mandatory Personal Loot.
---
If she can’t decide, pick 3 choices for her to choose from to start. Sometimes with so many choices and specs can be hard at first. Picking from the 8 different classes can be hard too at first. 
---
Prob first step is picking what the character looks like first is probably the most important thing. Lol
---
No one is going to do a long as fuck scholo run for the stylus if they have a microscopic chance of winning it
---
Nope, the subjective part was "HS cancelling isn't hard". Those top parses are likely from good players who probably aren't having an issue with HS cancelling.
---
I got spirit tap first, then wand spec all the way down to the divine spirit buff.. then went back into shadow for shadow mastery, then down into holy..  I never respecc'd once and I hit 60.  Early on (like teens and 20s) I would mind blast -&gt; SW:P -&gt; Wand to death..  at the end in the 50s I would Holy Fire -&gt; SWP -&gt; 2x mind flay -&gt; Wand to death.. I would never have to drink and could chain kill things..  only needing to drink if I ended up pulling more than 2 mobs (due to pats, runners, etc) or if the mob was immune to my wand damage and needed more shadow / holy damage.
---
I also healed all my dungeon runs.  I enjoyed it and it worked for me.   Always kept shield up too for the push back on mindflay.  It may not be the most optimal, highest damage, or what not. But it fit my play style. 
---
Here is the spec I had by 60: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0512301305001-03205-55022001005](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0512301305001-03205-55022001005)
---
Problem is demon ambushers see through stealth, as do ghosts, making getting *to* these spawns somewhat difficult.
---
What’s this song lol
---
The staff on runescape that teleported you to the pyramids
---
Just a note:
---
Renew is 100% spell coeffcient.
---
So in dungeons its great!
---
In raids its just as you said, you will get overheal a lot from other healers if you are using renew, wasting mana.
---
Raids = downrank with healing power and mp5 gear, working with a group of healers to spread heals out
---
Dungeons = big heals, HoT while you spirit regen
---
All stats has their own value. An item with 100 agi is obviously gonna be better than 1% hit.
---
But before hitcap for hunters hit carries a huge value, a decent bit above 1% crit. You need to get either 6% or 9% depending on your weapon skill. If you are able to get +5 weapon skill you go for 6%, if none then 9%. Anything above those is wasted.
---
fOr The SpirIT of ClaSSIc
---
This comes into play as people out gear content.  Not going to see it much at this point, but as higher raid content comes out it would be more common.
---
What is the point of gold if you’re not gonna spend it lmao the people in this thread are cracking me up, omg such a waste of in game currency buying an in game item that makes your in game play better, he could’ve used that gold to...! To...! Just THINK about all the gold he couldve used on...
---
I'm a rogue and this exact thing happened to me. The cape dropped and only myself and tank rolled. The tank won and just went "XD". It's only natural to be a bit salty, but how you handle it makes the difference. 
---
I just messaged him"That hurts, gz." and that was that. I'm not jumping to group with that guy again, but not gonna get all angry about it. At the end of the day this is just a game. If a game is making you that angry, maybe you need to take a break for a while.
---
You win some and you lose some. I ended up getting a cape and a skullforge reaver (sry not sry tank)on another run.
---
This was me when people asked did I enjoy my scheduled time off on the week of August 26th. Only with letting them know the much higher numbers :).
---
I farmed for an hour all 50 + undead mobs no luck.
---
Near one of the tomes, there’s a fallen pillar on the ground.
---
60 resto shaman here: Pretty much yes to both points. Whenever in a sleep/charm/fear encounter drop tremor and yeah LHW is a huge mana drain and essentially acts as an oh shit button if you dont have NS.
---
Edit: More often than not the only times ill need to use LHW is when a mage is AoEing and drawing threat and i need quick fat heals on him.
---
As a hunter edging in on 60 myself, you're aiming for 9% hit cap.  If you're a troll/dwarf using a bow/gum, respectively then your racial bonus gives you a 3% hit chance at baseline.  So you're aiming for 6% hit from your gear or the sure-footed talent that adds 3% to hit.  Anything higher than 9% hit is wasted.  There are tons of builds online that give you possible combinations of BiS
---
yes but you don't lose threat right?
---
 RemindMe! 1 Day
---
Why do you aggressively ignore the bit about communication?  Since you're so anti communication I'm gonna stop talking to you now. Bye
---
Was thinking the same
---
I doubt that is going to happen. I more frequently see people post threads complaining that there are already too many low quality memes on the sub and want even fewer.
---
I will give you the same advice I give them. Start your own /r/wowclassicmemes
---
It feels like it resets your auto attack similar to parrying an attack, but the reckoning attack doesn't reset your swing timer. With your seals, it's way better than the 1h damage talent if you are just comparing those two.
---
\-Brokilon hit the ground too hard.

---
It's easier than typing out pepehands every time someone says enhancement shaman or ret paladin.
---
Let me tell you that it's not a pleasure for fury warriors to have to roll on leather shoulders and look like a lvl 39 rogue twink in full pre raid bis
---
Where?
---
I don't think this is a retail symptom. Some players are very familiar with a dungeon, and know which mobs are not required. 90% of a time the reason to run a dungeon is for the boss loot. As such tanks will only clear the bare minimum to get to the boss. The biggest issue is if someone is not familiar with what the tank is doing. Doesn't mean the tank was in the wrong, it was just an unfamiliar setting for whoever pulled.
---
If you're in a pug, no. You greed roll that shit. 
---
Need roll is for upgrades you personally need.
---
what server are you on?
---
Just made a new post regarding this topic. We'll see how it's received.
---
I mean, my comment wasn't meant to blanket statement every case ever. I wasn't even referring to a specific pattern. In general it's complicated, because some people have more trust than others. The whole thing is just a matter of bypassing trust because people don't think people will be genuine with their needs. 
---
If everyone rolls Need on a pattern for a Priest robe and the priest wanted that pattern to make for himself, does that mean that whoever wins should give it to the priest or are you on the camp saying "fuck the priest, I don't trust him and don't think he'll even use it, and even if he does...that gold is more worth to sell for my own gain than it is for their upgrade"? 'cause that's what it sound like. 
---
If we were in MC or BWL and BOE hunter bindings or belt drop for me, would you as a warrior say "fuck you, you might just sell them for big cash?" probably not.
---
I'm not necessarily saying your wrong. In most cases it's hard to really tell what people will do and there are people out there that *will* just sell it. In general I think the only solution we have is to probably just do the everyone Need roll, though I don't personally like that that's what it comes down to. 
---
In general, the system was meant to need if need, greed if greed. It's just that too many narcissists are ninjas who suck and and are shitheads about it
---
The coke went down to Georgia.
---
Yes because factoring in a 5% AH cut (the standard for the last decade and a half) is fucking impossible, only devs and mathmagicians can do this so he must be cheat
---
Ok
---
I just made Sundermiflin last night
---
As someone who has purchased Alterac Swiss from the AH, thanks for saving me the travel time to complete the cooking quest.
---
You’re being pedantic and it’s not as cute as you think it is
---
Just Google azshara fishing guide vanilla
---
Why? The difference between 16 and 18 slot bags is pretty trivial. The people who really want it can buy it which is nice, the guild gets $ for consums/respec that he’ll the whole guild. Auctioning bags is probably the best way to get guild funds
---
How did you get the camera zoom so far out?
---
Ok you can spend 8 hours a day running instances for basically no reason, I’ll do 45 min a day w reserved BIS for the same effect ok 1,2,3 go
---
Best in slot is not subjective. It doesnt assume your unable to perform your rotation. Thats bizarre. Are we going to make 10 different bis lists for 10 different skill levels?
---
Ank here, usually leading groups - would go exactly as above.
---
Had so many mages try the last thing "lol AoE is fun, pull more" "it's ok I can handle the damage" instant kick
---
I would do 20/31 instead of the typical 9/32. But you're right it's probably a minuscule difference. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005323105-3210052020050150131
---
So you get that far then you have 1 point to spend somewhere else. improved Poisons or Improved Eviscerate, I guess.
---
Upvotes are cancer
---
Just came to say that this is a masterpiece
---
HAHAHA, so what you are saying is that when you try to convince everyone to greed on valuable items, things can get ninjad? I wish there was a way to stop that.
---
&gt;Pve is predicatable. PvP is not.
---
I think it is pretty safe to assume when PvPing as any melee class you should be expecting that your enemy is going to try to 'Disarm' you if they can. Seems pretty predictable to me.
---
&gt;there is no prep-time to acquire BiS gear . You just participate with what you have
---
For the predictable scenario I outline above.... I can prep right now and get Stronghold Gauntlets made or go farm Death Grips from UD strat to get the 'Immune to Disarm' effect without having to waste my weapon enchant slot on a weapon chain. So seems like there is some planning and prep I can do?
---
I am glad that you don't just follow the general opinion around and keep trying to understand things at a deeper level.  I deeply believe that's what this post is mostly about. But again, our views about popularity about these two games are far apart. However, at the end of the day, we are all wow lovers and I don't wish the community to divide into retail and classic fractions and oppose each other. I hope retail will be successful since its success is much more important for the longevity of this game genre than classic's is. I myself have been a wower since vanilla and never stopped. It just gradually loses its appeal to me and I just realized that I am not alone.  It is just so frustrating to see I am the only one online on my long friendlist in BFA. Many of them are my RL friends and they just stop playing the game over recent years and switch to other games. But I am glad to see my friendlist is mostly revived by classic. I first believed that it's just hype and then I started to notice the addictiveness of classic and the hype is just not dying down. And like you I started to think about why and finally found this post and realized that what ppl are feeling about  classic and retail resonates with me a lot.  I don't want to say retail is bad and I say they are just different games.  I hope you enjoy the game you like and not to be offended by noises as you mentioned that you like to figure out deeper meanings of things where noises are not.

Horde NA Benediction
---
36 orc Warrior seeking regular questing and dungeon group. Arms spec but can also tank.
---
You can do arena and anger as a healer at 52, yes. Probably wasn't too be at least 54 for the rest,  healers have a little more wiggle room than others on level
---
Savage gladiator chain dropped twice for us back to back lmao
---
&gt;I decided to level a troll hunter on Grobbulus
---
Get a boar for your first pet.  
---
Pretty tanky, eats anything, and charge is a great until you can get dash at level 32 or so.
---
Check out https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/ to see all the pets and abilities.  You have to tame pets in the wild to learn new pet abilities and this site tells you what has what and shows you all the skins.
---
Lots of Horde hunters skip Owls but they look cool and screech is handy.
---
I actually use a Gorilla and Volley/multi shot to AOE lower level mobs.
---
Let him get a couple of thunderstomps off and go to town.
---
Hunter is a lot of fun.  Leveling is fast, farming lower level instances is easy, traps and feign death will get you out of sticky situations.
---
Plus, you pretty much just need to upgrade your weapon as you go so it is cheaper than a melee class.
---
I feel bad because I’m horde haha - I’m sure she will think all the female races are ugly lol!
---
That mark of the chosen. It's reportedly got a 100% up time due to the __one minute buff duration__ insane!
---
A +25 to all stats for a class that can legitimately use all stats while farming is incredibly incredible.   Probably not going to ever take that one off.
---
The Tauren Druid is accurate. Love Druid, prefer NElf. Friends roll horde, so fuck it, why not be a Tauren. Also you have to dismount in the fucking UC elevators because you’re a hulking giant.
---
Bartender has a list of customisation, I can’t think of a reason you couldn’t make it look like QWERTY :)
---
I generally do that in a little more than a day?!
---
Flame them for what? They did nothing wrong. Like I said, if you don't like the group's conditions, just don't join.
---
Communication is also reading, and I just didn't repeat praising you after I commented on it the first time.
---
The point I am making is that IT SHOULDN'T have to be communicated. The reason it's even an issue is because of this "role" expectation . .which needs to go away.
---
You can :)
---
This is what I had read too. I had been avoiding use of SND rank 1
---
Started leveling a Shaman, got up to level 34 after a pretty enjoyable grind. Because I want to raid, my end goal is Resto. 
---
I’m pretty sure I don’t have to spec into Resto to do this, but is Intellect/Spirit the way to go, at least while leveling? And while I’m in dungeons, should I still drop Windfury Totem if we’re Melee-heavy, even at a mana cost?
---
Because on almost any server it sells for about 1/5 that. This is like asking why not buy a $200k house for $400k you’re going to live in it anyways.
---
+hit is so insanely good until 8-9% that it should be your top prio. Other than that, +crit, agi, and ap are what you want. Don't worry too much about stam or int: you'll get enough of that anyway. Remember that 1 agi ~ 2 ap, or 9 agi ~ 20 ap if alliance beacuse of bok from pallies.
---
Are there even that many fist weapons in vanilla? I don't remember them being a thing all that much, same with crossbows.
---
I’ve had ups and downs. There has been times where I’ve had people whispering me asking to heal, and times where I’ve searched around for a group for hours and found nothing.
---
Sometimes just sitting in LookingForGroup chat while doing other things, either on your healer or an ult, is your best bet.
---
In actual vanilla the level 60s queue dodged other premades.  Max level pvp is often about farming for honor to get gear, twink pvp they already have their gear and want the fight.  Twinks go out of their way to set up pre-made vs pre-made.
---
Why 58+, aggro radius? If so, would a Priest's Mind Soothe help?
---
Stallag Holy priest looking for raiding guild I’m pretty geared
---
I was tanking rfk with outlaw sabre from bfd. It’s my first time playing warrior, i was a warrior noob didn’t know much about tanking. I read online fast weapon is good for rage generation. So an green one hand axe with 1.8 speed, has stamina and int dropped, i’m thinking, hey it’s fast, it has stamina, it’s a axe (im a orc), must be good for tanking, so i rolled need on it without thinking too much, and i equip it after i got it. Immediately a mage in the group goes, wtf? What are you ninja looting? I said i thought it’s good for tanking and better than my outlaw sabre. Sorry first time warrior. Then the rest of group all chime like yeh we can tell you a noob warrior bla blaa blaa. You using a weapon with int....I’m think none of you can even use axe, it will just end up go to vendor for 30silver, what is the big deal here?
---
Word, I guess the only hope is payed transfers coming soon, I'd pay to move over to pve then , dont really want to but yeah. I have over 2 days played on this toon which is alot for me since I don't get alot of time to play getting rekt the whole time really isn't worth it Haha. Re rolling would suck tbh the more I think about it.
---
Faerlina is a server with a bunch of streamers on it. It could interfere with overall experience.
---
 I'm enjoying Benediction as alliance. It seems pretty balanced, but I'm only in the mid 40s. Sometimes horde are holding an area, sometimes allies will hold it (stromgaurde keep, nessingwary camp)
---
Dude
---
we went literally 7 hours without even seeing the glad dude spawn
---
:(
---
hmm interesting.  could be since so many people seem to only want to spell cleave runs
---
Okay so enough bars just for the Seals
---
Yes, strut in your ignorance LOL take pride in your casualness. 
---
1k is not “that much” to anyone who plays the game as much as this person or who knows how to make money in game, and 1k for a BiS raiding item is childsplay. Just because you can’t scrounge up that last 30g for your normal mount doesn’t mean others are so incompetent
---
Whatever it is, it's perfect.
---
Very unrealistic. But honestly, do you really feel like you've missed some huge opportunity with some of the BoE items out there? If it were something like Warden Staff or Edgemaster's, I might be the teensiest bit bummed out that I missed out on a chance to get some cash. But I don't let it drive me to writing long-winded diatribes on the internet about how people shouldn't be awarded upgrades, and instead should be forced to purchase them for asinine amounts of money on the AH using the money they made selling other BoE items.
---
But I'm already full pre-bis without reserving anything because I'm not a shitlord. Maybe you should just get a guild that actually does dungeons so you don't have to pug and reserve stuff.
---
Come to Fairbanks I need more targets
---
i went down it once, i felt dizzy and disoriented and i didnt even remember what i was doing
---
Gnomeregan and the jump to the giant gear and jumping down from the airport are pretty important too.  That's one jump I don't mind doing.
---
which game?  are you asking if i have played less retail since classic came out?
---
i feel like it's an obvious yes since classic is a "new" game for a lot of people and retail is at the end of an expansion where there isn't much to do right now.
---
it will be interesting to see the classic population next year when there is nothing to do in classic and the new retail expansion is released.
---
maybe change the question to did you resub for classic?  it could be neat to see how many people came back specifically for classic.
---
What is the benefit of having a SM Warlock in the main tank group?
---
Does this apply to Warlock curses?
---
Curse of Shadow or Curse of Elements?
---
does wand damage apply to spell resistance in the same school?
---
Is the reverse true? (I know using a fire wand on a fire elemental = immune, so I assume it applies the other way around, using a fire wand on a water elemental with curse of elements [-fire resist, %fire dmg boost])
---
Been wondering where this option was for a while, thanks very much. Is this toggle persistent after you do it once in-game or do you have to reset it each time you start up the game?
---
Who’s everyone? Also Faerlina despite being a streamer centric server has the best World PVP going on and events. In terms of longevity I would definitely choose Faerlina over the rest.
---
Hahaha no kidding - I hope they do!!
---
hello kitty island though???
---
Is that ghost cat from The little statues still in? I rocked that ghostly kitten for a long while in TBC
---
Wiki says otherwise. I am not sure myself so I researched it quickly and the result is what I wrote above. After a lot of resitances, spells have a chance to fail completely.
---
Honestly I think it's simply because the resources exist now, when they didn't before.
---
In Vanilla, people went to thottbot but only for quest help to find where the f*ck stuff was located.  Theorycrafting blogs started becoming popular in late vanilla and into TBC, and by Wrath we finally started having full-bore simulation websites like MaxDPS showing people the full numbers charts of Build X vs Build Y and which gemstones to use for optimal gains.  If it were around back in 2004, people would have probably done it then, but it took another three of four years before it really caught on.
---
Now I can go to wowhead and search for 'Class Guides' and be told how to spend every talent point and what gear to wear from 1-60.
---
What server/faction are you on?
---
Absolutely 100% can vouch for this.
---
LBRS where there's a shortcut where you can run along some kind of ledge and bypass basically an entire floor of mobs. The problem with that ledge however, is if you have a druid tank(me).
---
No matter what form I'm form, whether it's Tauren, Bear or Cat, when I try to mimick the very same way that all the others land, I end up landing short of the desired spot and end up stuck in the little area behind a tent. Trying to jump forward does nothing, and I'm forced to jump backward. When I move backward, the mobs in the tent aggro. My hitbox in Tauren and bear forms are too big/fat, and the cat form hitbox is too long. 
---
And by this point I'm stuck probably alone, and there's 3-4 on me.
---
I'm sure there's something I'm doing wrong but I hate this shortcut and would much rather just clear that hallway of tents and just do it the proper way for god sake.
---
Seriously this, most notably in DM:N. I did some tribute runs with a really good group the other night, but the tank INSISTED we skip the first pack to the left when you zone in, by jumping up on the wall and letting them de-agro. Well of course, if one person misses the jump, they're dead. Mind you, this group could kill that pack easily in probably 30 seconds, but I had to fight with them and after many deaths they finally agreed. Talk about adding 30 mins to a run for absolutely no reason at all. The rest of the run was super easy. Seriously people, the parkour is not always your smartest choice.
---
Fuck that guy.
---
You should get all your gold/mat needs from all the shit that drops in MC, selling ingots and mats you no longer need.
---
Any other kind of tax is unnecessary as hell.
---
Mark of Tyranny, no questions asked.
---
The other trinkets you will replace, but you will never replace Tyranny if you ever decide to tank anything.
---
In my above example you think Player A should roll greed because they are going to sell. That's fair. But it breaks the rule that people who can equip it can roll need. This rule requires players to roll honestly. This isn't always the case. 
---
To pick at your example a bit. What if player A knows the item is a tiny upgrade, but needs anyway, because it's something and they don't want to risk the 80% chance of getting nothing. This is allowed within the Need before Greed rules, but a total waste of value.
---
Huge pain in the ass.  Just the size in general. Can't wait till AV where I'm the easiest to click on so I die 75% more than a gnome, who has "click stealth". Gonna be great.
---
Damnit.
---
So basically everyone needs reagents? What a low quality post, only one that has some thought is Priest needing innervate.
---
nobody is upset were just having a laugh
---
But every website I've read still mentions you need 9 % hit to reach ability cap?
---
A druid is a good all rounder to have a go at a bit of everything but it's best Just to leave her to read the descriptions and see which one she fancies having a go at. My BF tried making me choose a certain class and that character is now just a bank.
---
My Tauren Druid is named BillMooray
---
Female troll hunter, they are the best looking female horde models
---
I agree that skull is all you need, and no, I tank as well. I was just memeing about the warriors who gear and play like it’s 2004. They tend to be taurens to maximize beefy role play potential.
---
Over the weekend my friend who didn't play vanilla was shocked when I told him that PUG raids didn't exist for a very long time. It wasn't possible. I quit the game in 2007. The biggest advantage now, though, is not having a 17" non-widescreen monitor on a shitbox family PC haha. A single UI mod would drop my frame rate by 10%.
---
They are 100+ gold in my server lol, people know they’re bis and are priced accordingly.
---
Couldn't anyone just Ctrl+F "Dawnseeker" and replace with their own character's name from the text file? Or is this more complicated than I think it is...
---
Anecdote here:
---
I was running arena pugs for the Ban'thok Sash and finally got the boss to spawn - belt drops, holy priest in group needs and wins. Didn't pre-emptively say he was going for it, didn't also know most likely that it's Mage BiS. Now, I didn't get super angry for a few reasons; for one, the belt is a pretty common drop when that boss pops and arena runs take all of five mins per. The other is that the belt is pretty good standalone \*and\* technically shadow priest BiS, even if this person didn't know it.
---
The reality is, there are a slew of reasons why these folks will roll on BiS items and you could feel tilted a lot quicker and easier than levels previous, but agreed with other comments here that you can avoid by either doing a guild run or at least having a transparent conversation beforehand. If you reallyyyyyy feel skeptical, be the party leader and create a comp where you're the only wearer of said gear - last night I did this to get Boreal and some warrior responses to my "LFM" weren't happy when I said I was trying to avoid having two warriors in group, but they ultimately understand that it was my party to make and was grouping up accordingly.
---
Best of luck in your BiS hunt, y'all!
---
Just sucks that Shaman are stuck with pink
---
I did this the other day.  Came up on the tree someone else was there killing mobs.
---
Me:  Isha?  Them:  Yep.
---
I plant the carcass and spawn him, kill him in a few seconds.
---
Other player:  O.O
---
&gt;Will players have the ability to change factions (for example: from Horde to Alliance)?
---
No, but it will be possible to learn languages and communicate with players of the opposing faction.
---
There was plans to be able to learn how to speak languages of the other races on the opposite factions.  I wonder why that was scrapped?
---
Any other warriors judging him for having Heroic strike on E? 😆
---
The right server for you will depend on your goals. There isn’t a right server for everyone. Faerlina is the wrong server for anyone who wants to avoid streamer related issues and the usual fans that streamers tend to get following them. So unless you want that, avoid it. 
---
First, do you want a PvE or PvP server? This is a big deal and the most important decision. For me, a PvE server is a non-option. But for some, it is the better option. Pvp servers mean you can get ganked, corpse camped, and otherwise griefed. But pvp is a big deal for me, and I tend to prefer games with fewer pvp restrictions.
---
Second, do you care about raiding? If so, the raid times are important. And many guilds raid between 6 pm and 12 am server time (for 1-4 hours in that range and not the whole time). This means you want a server where you can play during prime hours. This also matters for finding groups, especially on med and lower pop servers. 
---
Third, how good it your latency and do you care? Practically speaking it doesn’t matter that much with spell batching and modern internet. But it can matter slightly. Picking a server in your region can be better. 
---
Fourth, do you want a server that is overcrowded and has queues or a server that is less crowded and has less activity outside prime hours. The former means harder questing and open world grinding. The latter means less activity outside prime hours. I prefer the latter as it is more like the true vanilla experience on high pop servers (more like a med pop server today). But some prefer the former and want a super mega server like Herod where all open world mobs are dead but LFG is lively 24/7. 
---
The right choice for me is Earthfury. I love it. It feels like a vanilla server. It works for me. The right choice for you could be almost anything. Maybe even Faerlina if you are a streamer fan. As someone who has not watched any WoW streamers (I am not really into watching game streams...possibly because I am older), Faerlina is a big no.
---
Yeah. You should of asked first
---
Nah it's all good, no offense taken at all. I'm not without my faults of course, my house could use a good sweeping and I definitely don't cook dinner every night but hey who is perfect?
---
Life is about doing what you enjoy, if someone tells me "you should be doing X" I ask them if they are paying my bills. 
---
Same thing I tell players in WoW who try to direct my time/talents etc "Do you pay my subscription?"
---
It worked, tnx :)
---
It will be available when they do.
---
I completely understand and can say this since I have my main on Faerlina, que times aren’t nearly as bad as when classic first came out. The most I’ve seen recently has been around 2500 people in line on a Friday.
---
I went with boar myself, same reasons as above but yes, definitely their menu was a determining factor. I never have to buy food for him cause literally anything I pick up i can feed him. This saves bag space/money alot and that's a huge bonus at low levels when both are at a premium
---
I probably should've made that more clear yeah.
---
There are 2 warlock specs that people raid with. SM ruin and DS ruin, the difference between the two is mainly that DS = demonic sacrifice requires you to sacrifice your demon in order to gain the dps. But it does more dps in general. So a SM (shadow mastery in affiliction) does a bit less damage, however you can have your demons up, in this case the imp to give the stamina buff to your group or more specifically to your tank.
---
Hahaha that makes complete sense! I’ll read her descriptions and answer any questions and let he heart choose!
---
Personal opinion, I think it has developed like this: 
---
(Almost) everyone knows what their "BiS" is now &gt; BiS pieces can have very low drop chances &gt; players feel a need to get BiS due to competition &gt; reserved runs. 
---
In vanilla, from my memory, only the really top players even know what their BiS was, let alone how to farm it. I never saw Jed runs back in vanilla (I'm sure they happened but not nearly this frequently). 
---
I think it's a mix of players being better, and players expected to be better than was the case in vanilla.
---
Blood Pact
---
&gt; Extra points if I use world enlarger prior to meeting the party.
---
I'm really sad that World Enlarger is Gnomish only, while you can craft everything from both sides by switching between them (drop and re-level engineering), it's one of three items in the game that requires a specific specialization.
---
I like PvP too much to not be able to craft the explosives from Goblin engineer myself and it's not worth it for the Gadgetzhan teleport and World Enlarger.
---
I thought I knew the 5 second rule but I didn’t:
---
So for priest, after 5 seconds of no casting, you regen [13 + (spirit/4)] **mana per 2** 
---
So 400 spirit is **113 mp2**
---
mp5 gear ticks mp2
---
So divide by 2.5 to get your mana tick. 
---
10mp5 = 4mp2
---
Bruh you better heal me if I go in to hellfire. How you gonna let your boi down while hes PUMPIN

---
And trolls are my favorite race, especially for hunters . Side shooting so sweet
---
Why are you comparing one reserve to reserving anyrhing worth going for?
---
Would you pass on Deathcharger's Reins to someone who hasn't bought their epic?
---
THROUGH THE ALLY LINES!
---
Oh my sweet summer child. You should expect to run about 100 or more arena runs to get whatever piece you want. 15 is just starting
---
I bought gold and got banned from the game. 
---
Fixed that for you.
---
interface - addons - sexy map, the one you need to delete/disable is the Fade layer.
---
Don’t forget Golem
---
Does Azure Silk Belt stack with Druid Swim form?
---
yes i read the title as well
---
NTA
---
Serious I only get sad when I lose a item to a class who can’t use the item.  
---
Like a warlock taking the +healing mace in BRD etc.  
---
It’s a game and if you want to have loot rules then discuss them beforehand.   
---
Rogue is a crybaby.
---
apology for poor english
---
when were you when Borkilon dies?  
---
i was sat at home drinking brain fluid when fried ring
---
'borkilon is die'  
---
'no'
---
and you????????????????
---
Some guides recommend not using SND over Evisc until Rank 2. I found I was facing a lot of armored targets in dungeons and rupture wasn't that great on dungeon targets because they typically die before it's done ticking.
---
I would definitely lean towards that being correct for solo leveling though, it's probably not worth losing the damage since you don't have any good ways to sustain your HP during a fight and the fights probably won't be long enough for SND to break the difference.
---
You definitely don't need improved SND for it to be the best combat finisher. The attack speed being up at all times is critical. Imp SND will just make it less of a pain to manage since it will last longer, but the AS is just as valuable either way since so much of your damage comes from autos
---
Congrats!
---
It’s about 6% for him to spawn. So you are not outside bad varriance yet.
---
uh...microscopic chance is a bit of an exaggeration, eh? That's what...maybe one other class competing for that wand other than  yourself maybe in a 5 man or whatever?
---
Also, people still do and people still will. 
---
 I can't force you to personally not try and reserve stuff, but If i'm a class that's competing for that with you, i just wouldn't wanna join your group anyway. So if you're a priest wanting that wand and you want a mage in your group, but they aren't allowed to roll on it it's much less likely you'll ever find a mage that'll wanna group with you. 
---
It's just not a good look to be someone advertising in lfg chat with a bunch of items a, b, c, and x are all reserved, also no runecloth for anyone either. It's just kinda silly and ridiculous at that point. That's the whole point of this whole post.
---
Man a 1 day weekend, that's rough. Bet he didn't even get a chance to level some alts
---
I would be the sucker who rolled a 75
---
DM:N - skip bosses, don't try and skip trash, bad stuff happens. If you're with a group you have done the route with them a bunch of times groovy, but in a pug group? Just clear as normal.
---
What's heroic strike cancelling?
---
Yeah sounds like /target.  I got accused of cheating on my Hunter because I knew a rare was up.  I'm salty about it still.
---
The mods of this subreddit have chosen memes to be the bridge the subreddit dies on.
---
The lack of humor noticeably degrades the subreddit IMO.
---
Not everyone is comfortable filling every role. I know I would never, ever tank for a PUG - that's way outside what I'd be comfortable doing. 
---
Also the problem in this scenario is that they didn't ask him to heal - they invited him as DPS and then told him he'd be healing. They could have asked before the invite and solved the problem instead of making a problem.
---
Ahhhh the ole Reverse Uruk-hai sword.
---
Legit.
---
Aggro radius. Yeah i guess it would but it would be fairly cumbersome. If you're 56 or so I'd suggest just running brd  until you have your pre bis
---
not saying its not possible, but everyone i talk to who tells me about DW fury tanking references a video of a guy in AQ40/Naxx endgame gear with thunderfuries and bags full of armor potions and shit.  Its just not realistic for classic.
---
This is a nice job laying out the argument. The oldschool need/greed system is pretty stupid and unbalanced but people cling to it. I've never really cared much so I just try to go with the flow, but it's really clear why just having "need on valuable things" rules protects players and avoids subjective judgement calls.
---
Only time I’ve noticed a difference is when tanking. Have a max Druid and Paladin, let me tell you, the Druid is so much easier to play and better in 90% of scenarios (as a tank).
---
Pattern is 30g
---
Reply "Full on Warriors."
---
He doesn't need to know know it's just you.
---
You're not taking a lot more damage.. you're only losing about 2k armor, and the ability to not be hit with a crushing blow.
---
If it's just 1 or 2 mobs, you dont need a shield. But when there's several mobs you need one because the damage adds up significantly with multiple mobs.
---
Look up skarm no shield tanking on you tube
---
This aint my first rodeo, more of the frustration comes from getting a group together and doing 2 runs then everyone has to go help their grandma or feed their cat.
---
Don’t worry, it wasn’t funny.
---
As is tradition.
---
Awesome, man. Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.
---
So a extra mage or a healer would not allow you to pull more. Aoe grinding i wished for that sweet sweet druid innervate. But even if taken as true ... this applies to one class in a very niche situation (since the devs to like to sprinkle in archers and mages in packs) so as a general rule it's still better to group up.
---
It's both.
---
Would they feel bad if nobody said "grats" back?   Probably.  Which means that they expected validation.
---
But more importantly:  Either way, it's spam.  Unless your guild really wants a constant flood of "ding!" and "I just got this loot!", then all you're doing is annoying people.
---
I’m desperately working on my reputation with other factions so I don’t have to have a horde epic mount. And I swear I will be out with my bf who has an orc and I’m the one they’ll see and go for more often than not. Too big, man! BGs will be unfortunate for my fellow Tauren.
---
PSA: even with safe fall there are spots I do not advise you try this around trisfal glades.
---
You can import data on the addon page (haven’t tried it)
---
I would definitely wait to mount up first if I were you.
---
And not one yell?  That is crazy.
---
Why does size matter?
---
It's that, too, but I didn't want to be that guy who said, "This was around back then, too."
---
And I, too, remember sites and applications that allowed me to min/max my gems and gear based on available options back in early TBC so I know it was around. 
---
I've said since day one that due to the abundant amount of resources out there, Classic wouldn't be "hard" like people tend to remember it being this time around. Classic was never difficult, we just had limited information on how the game worked.
---
Guilds have different debuff slot priorities, but they are usually in the same ball park.  Rend is usually not one of the debuffs that 40-man raids prioritize.    
---
[Here's a quick WoWHead rundown.](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/debuff-management-classic-wow)
---
Anyway, how’s your sex life?
---
If you plan on ever tanking anything ever as a Druid take mark of tyranny, you will never replace it
---
Not exactly true we're getting some new blood also.
---
Honestly, theres a lot of shifty people in game that you will run into more given that you do much more group content at 60. My advice is add the players you liked running with to friends and ignore/blacklist the shitty ones. People forget that Classic/vanilla is a small world and what goes around comes around. That can be especially true depending on server population. But as of right now i have like 15 people that i run dungeons with quite often and theyre all chill and competent. Took a while to network with people in groups but now that I have the option to just PM someone i know is good instead of having a random from LFG chat is really nice lol.
---
I run with a group of friends--two rogues, a warrior and me, the druid. When we are looking for dps and a warrior or rogue whispers me I just say "sorry we are full on [insert class] but I wish you good luck." And move on. If they protest or are rude I just ignore it and keep looking for others.
---
That's such bullshit. Thoes classes that have multiple viable specs have to get multiple sets of gear... also most of the time I'm asked to off spec. How about the rule is if you ask someone to offespec, expect them to roll on multi spec gear.
---
Sounds like you just have a bad guild then. My guild auctions bags, tanks and healers have access to funds for respec costs, there are potions/flasks available for reduced costs, repair costs if needed are covered for tanks etc. the gbank is stocking consumables for future raids etc. like anything you need a not shitty guild but as long as your officers aren’t corrupt it’s fine
---
No. I still had threat on him, he just turns around and smacks someone while I'm in the air and the other tanks are on him.
---
It dropped on my first run but I am warlock so I passed on it. AMA
---
My entire argument is. If you need the item you roll need on it. So yes if a druid needed the gear and they were going to actually use it. They are free to roll on it.
---
I'm the opposite - it's too easy to spend a couple hours collecting an FP or two and turning in old quests without realizing I'm not actually making any progress. I recommend installing TitanBar or whatever it's called so you can track xp/hr (even though it's not the best approximation).
---
If I'm not mistaken, doesn't it outright replace Bear Form in your spellbook?
---
Commenting to bookmark for later
---
Just got to 25 as an Arms warrior after running some quests in Hillsbrad (Tons of PvP/Ganking there) and trying to plot out what to do next so I have a few small questions:
---
1. Can I go DPS in BFD at this level?
---
2. What level would you recommend tanking for BFD? I'd rather not be underleveled and slow everyone else down.
---
3. I haven't done any quests in Ashenvale, would this zone be appropriate for my level range?
---
4. What other zones should I explore for purposes of leveling?
---
It's definitely the opposite on my server. Just had a full group waiting to run UBRS last night and we spent over an hour looking for healers before breaking apart and unfortunately that's been a common occurence for me
---
Might just be an abundance of healers on your server. As a DPS, I've always found tank/healer the hardest role to fill, but I'm also a rogue so I don't get into mage groups or anything 'optimal' so that could be part of my experience
---
&gt;Bye blocking you to avoid getting infected by whatever it is you have
---
LOL. Thanks for letting me know. I'll tey not to lose any sleep over it, kid.
---
No there are only special effects that deliberately increase attack speed by x%.
---
I had this and dark moon blue dragon. I basically never went oom
---
Why are people feel so entitled too loot? It's a roll ffs if you need need if not greed.
---
it's literally just you going plate yes
---
Important to remember is the 9% hit cap is for RAIDS, i.e bosses which count as lvl 63. 
---
For DUNGEONS, i.e mostly lvl 60 mobs or below, 5% is fine. 
---
Sacrificing Agi/AP/Crit for +hit is only worth it if you’re not hit capped for your current situation.
---
Hasn’t stopped them before! Lol
---
Yep when the group's underlevelled, IMO it needs to bring all the more awareness to not skip packs. Another place that comes to mind is UBRS, running up a certain set of stairs to the right. There's packs on the left of those stairs that a level 57 has a high chance to aggro, even if he hugs the wall.
---
I always clear that out when there are lowbies in the run for everyone's safety.
---
Bigglesworth is PVP
---
Then I won’t group with you. I think rolling on more then 1 type of gear as a main spec is overly greedy. I would encourage you to be upfront with your plans before starting a dungeon to avoid any drama
---
Sorry, I know my description wasn’t clear I’ll try to find a photo.
---
But I mean making the actionbar in the center mirroring the layout of a qwerty keyboard rather than two horizontal lines going across the bottom of the screen if that makes sense
---
Im not sure about the axe but i think it just change how many items you get not what items like if you slay 2 bosses you will get less items but you can still get all the items
---
My eye is twitching so fast right know
---
I don't get why they're making it seem like I was losing my mind. I just stated I felt that Rogues are better off. Of course I was wrong at the time. But that's literally all I said.
---
Yeah I just ask in the general if there are any hunters solo farming. At that point you wisper them. Problem is that the chest despawns after some time. So you have to be able to get to the chest from w.e you are in 20 ish minutes.
---
Report him. He won't be able to create many names soon.
---
Healing is different. I healed a full clear of BRD with no problem at 51 other than having to clear extra pulls because my aggro range was much higher than my party members
---
&gt; worst section of LBRS (the tight orc packs along the bottom).
---
Two words. Mind control. those invokers are so strong, and then the ogres later that engrage auto attack for like 500.
---
Dope.
---
Try out Ghostly Strike. You said it yourself, you’re not concerned with topping meters and you like experimenting. This is your chance to do exactly that. 
---
I say go for it and enjoy your custom build!
---
JOOOOOLIAN!
---
Mayhaps thou dothn’t wash thine ears? Perhapst thou mind betwixt thine ears hath gone missing? Surely thou-
---
I’m just fuckin’ with you because I’m bored. That is strange. Last time I hit SW, I I thought I could hear some shit that wasn’t put in the game, either. Like birds. Where the fuck are the birds? That’s probably why I died. Thinking about birds and shit when I should be focusing more on the Alliance who aren’t thinking about birds.
---
That gave me a hearty chuckle, man. Thanks.
---
Also, no minimum ranged attacks. I just wanna shoot stuff -.-
---
Imagine using a different metric, wait for 3 global cooldowns, wait for three threat generating actions to be made, wait for the tank to hit the target with 2 white attacks and two yellow attacks... Doesn't sound so bad right? That takes between 5 and 10 seconds based on position, Los, rage, etc. So you as the not tank can you know wait for that right? Actually let the tank do a tanky thing? Then you do the dpsy thing?
---
That's on my list!
---
I'm only 43 now but at 60, will saying "LF1M tank, can roll on dps" be more likely to find groups or just be cluttering the LFG tool?  I'm one who will quickly cut into my profits and own interests if it means faster runs or shorter waits.  Why wait 20 minutes for a tank when a geared one will do it for the first 2 orbs?
---
Good luck getting a tank and healer with that kind of bull.
---
Cozy
---
You should be fine to tank or dps at that level. It's not an exceptionally hard dungeon. Utilize your ranged pulls and line of sight mechanics.
---
But why? Lazy dps should expect tanks and healers to roll on multiple sets cus they have to do multiple roles!!! How is this hard to understand?
---
Dang, you're right. Fixed!
---
Ah, but I kinda prefer the neutral colours. Thanks for sharing tho!
---
I think people overall have more money this time around than they did in Classic. I know for a fact that me playing on pservers helped me get my mount right at 40 here. Back in Vanilla I didn't have a mount until about mid 40's and I didn't buy my epic mount until I hit 70 in TBC.  The only thing I knew how to do was farm Blue Dragon Sinew.
---
I think I've probably earned more money this time around than I probably ever did in Vanilla, I don't think I ever had more than 150g the whole time. This time I bought my mount and helped fund 5 other friends mounts at 40 as well and still have roughly 100 or so gold leftover and I'm not even 60 yet.
---
That being said I wouldn't be surprised if this was a gold buyer.
---
Yea it replaces the bear spell.
---
Actually sound for some people.
---
I have done this myself simce early Nost. Tradition carries. 🤷‍♂️
---
“They see them that way because THEY are that way.”
---
What a load of bull, you are obviously trolling.
---
Ayyy me 2 got it yesterday! Gz u filthy Alliance:)
---
It's more than just hit as well. It gives more dmg to your glancing blows.
---
You're a good tank then. Yeah I'm sure it's possible but not ideal. How did you keep aggro on the last bosses? They're  7 levels above you
---
I used to lead raids in Kara @70. 
---
12 hours was a fairly standard raid time.
---
My guild wasn't the best but damn they were triers/awesome. 
---
I could have done it faster with another group, or guild, but never taking that option over try hard guildies
---
I'm a 43 Mage on Rattlegore, and its brutal needed 2 elemental fire for robe of power and got corpse camped for hours.
---
I didn’t know I needed this until just now.
---
The issue is that people like you don't listen. So basic concepts have to be reexplained over and over in hopes that those of us talking sense can spoon feed this information to a player base that is very resistant to change.
---
It's why I generally whisper people that have expensive auctions up.  
---
I ask them if we can reduce the price by 2,5% instead of AH 5%.  
---
That way we both save/make more money.
---
Just mention that you are new to tanking and haven't tanked this dungeon before. The scum will probably drop group and the rest will hopefully take it a little easier. 
---
Worst case you'll need a new group but hey your a tank and there's never enough of them for dungeons
---
Good loot or not these are great classic moments
---
UBRS attracts a lot of melee for Truestrike Shoulders, Rend weapons, Felstriker and even the skinning weapon. You sort of need Jed otherwise melee won't want to join a group where 5+ people are rolling on the same item that only drops a small percentage of the time.
---
I've never done UBRS without Jed and the one time I did join a group without Jed, it never filled. I suggested that I could leave raid(as a Rogue) and find him fairly quickly and reform the group but the RL said "no because then people will leave after Jed".
---
How do you PvP as a caster? As a Shadow Priest I know im not the king of DPS but I have never won in a fight, even against far lower level characters.
---
My problem is that VS another player they're constantly stunning me, running around me in circles, hitting me and delaying my casts or outright canceling them
---
A typical encounter looks like this:
---
Get attacked
---
Hit them with my instant cast
---
Begin casting damage spell
---
Get hit so many times im close to death
---
Try to bubble and heal
---
Heal is interrupted
---
Bubble breaks
---
Die
---
At level 38 I was utterly trashed by a level 30 Rogue
---
TFW you’re a noob and your main account isn’t level 11 yet and there’s no lower option
---
Yes it's only 1 spec dps that think this way. Raids are a little different. Dungeons, if you need, roll need end of story.
---
Why is everything pixelated "8-bit" to Gen Z? This is literally beyond even the capabilities of the SNES/Genesis (16-bit)... and might be closer to a isometric 3d sidescroller that could have been done on Dreamcast (64/128-bit) level graphics.
---
For Razorgore EU I only see a dead server that no one I know even uses, here is another one: [https://discord.gg/M88umy](https://discord.gg/M88umy)
---
Ita kind of sad that these posts are becoming so common. It just shows that the "About Community" speeches where all BS Unless it befits you.
---
Nothing to do with being noble.
---
I reserve items because I can, because even if I reserve items I can fill the group pretty easily. Dps usually have overlap either with tanks or healers so filling up a group is way more difficult.
---
So I reserve stuff and fill my party in seconds anyway. Meanwhile I keep seeing dps spamming "LF TANK last spot for XXX, \*insertitematankwouldwant\* reserved". GL with that.
---
Are you a ninja?  No.
---
If you were tanking, then tanking loot would have been your "main spec."
---
So technically, rolling on DPS gear as the tank violated the "main spec before off-spec rule."
---
But honestly, I think you're fine.  The rogue was just butthurt.
---
In the future, you should let people know that you're rolling for DPS gear up front.
---
I mean you can chose 1 spec at the start of a run and say I am “main spec/rolling” on that gear. Everything else you can roll on if no one else needs. You can only be one spec at a time. You should only roll “with priority” on one set at a time. I have 0 problems with a tank rolling on dps gear or a spriest rolling on healing gear. I have a problem with a holy priest needing a healing item and then also needing a shadow damage item when their is a warlock in the group. Either say I am rolling on dps gear and roll against the warlock and roll off spec against the Druid for the healing item. Or pass on the dps gear since the warlock needs it and get the healing item with no challange. 
---
Druids should not be able to need on meele dps gear, caster dps gear, tank gear and healer gear in the same run. You get to choose one.
---
People changed or at least those on reddit are not the same as it was in vanilla.  Need everything for high value BoEs is 'acceptable' and how dare you attempt to get out of your pigeonholed role!
---
You'll want to find an enchant that you want and can afford. It's customary to bring the materials for your enchant with you to the crafter. You give them materials and a small tip, and you get the item enchanted with whatever you want. Best melee weapon enchants are crusader (expensive and not worth for something you will level out of) or fiery (gonna cost a few gold, but it's not something you'll feel bad about replacing).
---
There are no strength enchants for weapons (crusader gives a chance on hit to give temporary strength and a very small heal) and the agility weapon enchants do exist, but are not available yet for another couple phases.
---
Without going into too much detail, I plan on getting 4 beaststalker pieces and both devilsaur for their respective bonuses and attributes. Like you said I figured the rest would be crit chance, agility or AP items, but so many people recommend 5-9% hit chance over them for some reason.
---
You can get a better idea of what I'm using as a guide here:  [https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/hunter-dps-pve-gear-best-in-slot](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/hunter-dps-pve-gear-best-in-slot)
---
But from what I understand you agree crit chance, agility, and AP &gt; hit chance, right?
---
About to finish this grind on a Medium pop server.... Market price of Runecloth is upwards of 1g80s lol. I'm lucky if I can buy 10 stacks a day for 1g20s.
---
I've had to farm more than half of my turn-ins I want to die (also a rogue)
---
Depends on race really. Using Joanas route I got to 10 in Durotar in like 2 hours ~15mins or so
---
I hope you enjoy never pooping again. 😂😂😂😂
---
Wo spielst denn gerade? 😆
---
Nope but I’m trying to only use crossbows fistweapons and was thinkn about polearms too. It’s my own little hardcore mode!
---
Skip that shit and just do MC in what you got when you hit 58.
---
If you're in my server I would buy it definitely
---
I've heard that spirit benefits shamans the least out of the four healing classes so without neglecting it you may want to also look for bonus healing gear.
---
I had no idea there was a path to get there. The lift is the first thing I ever saw when I first got there 15 years ago. xD
---
Better PSA:  if you don't like a grindy game, then Classic probably isn't for you
---
&gt; Agreed.  To me, to ninja an item, would be picking "need" after others picked "greed" while not actually needing the item (be it a generic and/or relatively low value BOE and/or a high vendor priced BOP that they can't or won't use).  Or opening a chest without people doing /roll.
---
That's the perfect definition.
---
Most of the new WoW kids don't seem to understand this.
---
The games been out two months how the fuck do we already have reposts
---
You’re right I didn’t notice.
---
Do you honestly think I care if 1 person doesn't group with me? I'm a ret paladin. I deal with this everyday while still doing my thing lol
---
Asuh dude
---
Just say “need caster, sorry”
---
How long is evasion cooldown? 
---
But those guys hit hard and fast.
---
Lol I paid someone for the ring and it also dropped on my first run lol.
---
See that’s what I thought but I wasn’t sure if the epic was exclusive to leaving all bosses alive as I haven’t found any sources online saying one way or the other! Appreciate your input ! =)
---
when I was like 11 I sold my runescape account for 15g. a couple months later I just used the recovery system to get it back when I realized I essentially just gave it away for free
---
Alts?
---
Dont you have to do something weird when you start wow up to get the console to work?
---
If you are able to play during off hours (early morning is especially good), Devilsaur farming is insane gold per hour once you learn the spawn locations, patrol routes, respawn timers and how to best compete with your fellow and opposing faction players. A couple of days ago I did 5 hours of farming, got 47 skins. At 9g per skin, that's 84,6 gold per hour.
---
Underrated comment, I spent 200+ gold on stupid healing robes, am I going to AOE farm ZF to make that money back? Lol, best believe I’m reserving an orb or two
---
I grouped with BullyHayes recently.
---
So what happens when a Party Leader invites the both of you to the same group? 
---
Is there anything blocking the two of you to group or you can just communicate through /p?
---
Mistake number one: joining a DKP guild.
---
57 healers represent!
---
1- Equip the helmet to make the buried relics appear on your minimap in Tanaris
---
2- Forget you did this.
---
3- Return to Gadget, turn in quests, sell stuff in your bags, repair your gear.
---
4- Hours later, realize your character somehow 'lost' their helm.
---
It's funny, my gpu fried in september too. I mean it was due time for that to happen in any minute, but it's a weird coincedence it happened on classic wow and not on any other game i play... And those are much more demanding on graphics!
---
I mean jeez, as a lvl 31, *hitting* Whitemane and Mograine would be almost as lucky as getting an epic drop.
---
Downvoted just because you mention downvoting
---
Why isn’t it relevant? Are you one of those shit players?
---
That's when I hit the stealth button. Assuming it isn't already too late.
---
yea and it's causing people to get mad at each other "DUDE I'VE BEEN CAMPING THIS SPOT FOR 20 MINUTES, YOU STOLE MY KILL, I WAS NEXT IN LINE"
---
"Check the quest item dude"
---
"oh..."
---
That's banish/seduce
---
Oh hey its the subreddit taking another hit &gt;.&gt; how is this the garbage that gets upvoted.
---
You can tank dungeons just fine as normal fury, and I'd recommend you do that instead of trying to do some hybrid.
---
But talk to your guild about being a dedicated offtank as fury, it's usually difficult for guilds to get their fury warriors to man up to tank so it shouldn't be hard. Hell you might even be allowed to go that fury prot spec if they need your tanking enough for it.
---
I am not the person in the picture, but a guildmate, and was given permission to post on his behalf.  He said on some days he would grind for up to 16 hours.  He's very happy to have finished the grind!  This was on Kirtonos server.
---
My god, I didn't have Available selected.  Embarrassing!
---
not a ninja. 
---
Also, dang man.... you've lost a lot of rolls.  Sounds like you bend over backwards to help people so if you're not already in a guild, its time to find a good one where you can get some benefit from helping everyone else by them helping you in return and if you are in a guild and have been losing all these items to guild mates, it's time they get back into the dungeons they no longer need with you to help you get your gear.
---
Until you get level 60 and are getting pre-raid best in slot items you will just be grabbing any upgrade you can. Mp5, intellect and healing power will be your top 3 stats. Just try and use your best judgment on which pieces give you the most total stats, or look up your bis lists
---
Saw a guy earlier advertising for mara/princess runs, Blackstone ring ok reserve. I'm like bro, most people running princess at 60 need that, good luck lol.
---
Hahahahaha oh man, now I’m stressing !!
---
Yep everyone should roll need on boes.  If you think ts unfair for any reason roll need anyway and distribute the loot in whatever way you think is fair including the example op gave.
---
Hug walls with a combination of cutting through large areas in straight lines and being mindful of pats. Most dungeons really.
---
Dual spec, flying mounts, achievements, summoning stones, barbershop, server transfers, LFD,  LFR, etc.
---
Thanks man!
---
What a rollercoaster of emotions
---
Are you sure you're going to the portal trainer and not the regular mage trainer?
---
Make sure you have the "Available" option checked as well.
---
technically it rolled him before you, therefore they were never yours. He had top place from the beginning of the roll. but i will still upvote cause i feel bad for you
---
Probably gehennas, but there's no real comparasion. Gehennas is just tryhard server which happens to be where most streamers go. It doesn't have big zergs of idiots following some streamer dude or anything like that.
---
It's same for warrior. DPS BiS utilizes a lot of leather.
---
There you go couldn’t remember which.
---
Good to hear. The greed roll still generates a number if everyone wants to agree on the original rolls being valid.
---
The rogue. DIED. Just getting INTO the instance. The ROGUE.
---
I am a rogue main and this hurts me on a fundamental level. BRD is our playground. I solo attuned to MC back in vanilla and plan to do so again when I’m at the level for it. How, HOW do you die just getting in the front door?
---
I ran to the southern part of Winterspring and tried farming those elite rock giants for their shards.  It was on my corpse-run back that I realized the shards were all over the ground and I collected them, not tried to kill the elites for them.

Right, but you probably have gear and you two probably have communication skills. He is a fresh 60 and has no gear or team members.
---
It messes up your queue a lot if you use that. The shopping list pops up every time I open the AH, too.
---
Wow thats a bummer.  I got it on my second run as like a 48 or 49
---
What wait what pools?
---
In trying to farm water for a hide of the wild to my druid. What pools and where do i find those?
---
If you are the tank and your son is the healer, you can pick and choose dps all you want.
---
One night in karazhan?
---
Ah forgot about that, damn rogues
---
So you're referring to extreme cases, which you don't see everyday but complain about..
---
Seems pretty niche and just arguing for the sake of it.
---
There's a guide that says he's the best pet to have through level 26 or something. I think that's the main reason why, it's one of the first things that comes up on google.
---
Whether it was true in the past or on a private server I'm not sure - but that's most likely why
---
Plus he just looks cool, and that's half the point of being a hunter
---
I've heard ranged weapon skill interacts with hit% differently than melee weapon skill. Trueshots I read were something like 1.4% hit chance because of this
---
In Classic in our first MC we had one druid healer level 59. He ended up with 4T1 :D As I switched from rsham to mage I'm gearing way slower from raids (which also will put more value into ZG/AQ and the turn in for CC and AD).
---
Trying to find bijou’s belongings, rare spawn, or convince people to kill invokers for greater fire pot recipe is a struggle
---
But were they the undead trolls in Plaguelands?
---
If you plan on ever PvPing Mark of Tyranny is one of the best trinkets to have don't waste time on a trinket you're going to replace soon like Eye of the best when you could have that Juicy armor trinket for PvP.
---
Avoid Faerlina at all costs than. It’s no wonder that server is the most toxic server available.  No one cares over there. The other servers don’t have to be this way.
---
Always be hit capped (9%). Missing an aimed shot will be way worse than having +10 more dmg on your shot or w/e
---
Well there’s a super simple maxcamera distance macro that most people run when they start a fresh client, also I use dynamicCam to control situational camera movement but I don’t think it unlocks it anymore than the default client can. Cheers!
---
Show me reckful keeping up w/ a BiS druid using a lvl 29 weapon himself and you can have my money
---
The vast majority dont.
---
Because the vast majority of tanks are furry lol
---
No loot rules were agreed upon prior to starting the dungeon - you could roll on cloth for shards and it wouldn't make you a ninja. Out of courtesy, though, you should clarify whenever you plan to roll on gear that isn't for the role you're presenting as. That way, the party is aware of what you want, and they can decide to either take you and deal with extra loot competition or hold out for a different tank
---
D'oh, I didn't have Available selected. Thanks!
---
Put on pastebin as a text file if not too large :)
---
For a safe one, only jump right where the tower is.
---
There is a little "hill" where the road sign is thar's always safe to jump.
---
Someone linked the post, but basically when you queue Heroic Strike it doesn't occur until your next mainhand swing. So long as you have it on queue your offhand hit rating will act as though its using your mainhand special attack hit rating. If you're hit capped then your offhand will never miss. You have to queue it after a mainhand swing and cancel it before the next mainhand swing. And yes it's a pain in the ass to focus on while also paying attention to some boss mechanics.
---
 Left side, next to the minimap, and the right side!
---
I didn't split the proceeds. I justified it a few ways: it was mostly a pug, I was very poor because I had spent all my gold on Truefaith Vestments, etc. Mostly hypocritical. But ultimately, I wouldn't have expected to receive anything if I lost the roll, so I felt ok with my choice. I did however sell it for about 100g less than the AH price to a guild member of one of the pugs. And I gave some pots to the tank. It wasn't the full divide, but it was something. 
---
Our difference of opinion on this comes down to one point you make:
---
&gt;Upgrades, in my opinion, always outweigh someone else's need for cash.
---
This is a completely fair stance. I would have agreed with you not too long ago. Now I'm starting to see there are many ways to play the game. For some (myself included) the gear treadmill is the only way to play. Others enjoy alts, twinks, gold-making, etc. To say one is more right than the other isn't fair. An upgrade is an upgrade to you and me. But that same drop could be 500g to someone else. 'All need' accounts better for the diverse play styles.
---
Yeah, I thought it meant wow classic vs vanilla wow.
---
Got it my second kill along with the plate legs.  Felt pretty good
---
Sometimes its inevitable, but good on you for being vigilant! Most priests forget to use Mind Soothe and its actually a very helpful spell that works great in some instances.
---
It is brilliant, but are you going to argue it is not shitty?

Fresh Rebirth realm plz?

Everyone else in the group: "A what through the what now?"

*wipe*

It's always us mages that are stoners xD
---
TBF, I'm doing it because it will be worth a good amount eventually. Plus I'm a cook so I need the flame sacs cause I have a shit ton of mystery meat
---
There is being greedy and then there is being a dick. No need to be a dick. If it really annoys you that much then you can just add /ignore the person to remove the ads.
---
Well, raids usually want something like:
---
Warrior #1: full prot.  
---
Warrior #2: full prot or 31/5/15.  
---
Warrior #3: 31/5/15 or full dps.  
---
The rest of the warriors: full dps.  
---
You only really want 2-3 warriors with points in prot. It's not uncommon to run with 8+ warriors. So there are lots more dps spots.
---
I don't recall ever saying my view was the right one so I don't even know why you're pointing that out
---
&gt; Probably gehennas, but there's no real comparasion. Gehennas is just tryhard server which happens to be where most streamers go. It doesn't have big zergs of idiots following some streamer dude or anything like that.
---
Thanks. My thoughts were Gehennas because of APES, but I also heard Mograine maybe as that has some streamers (or did) like Joker. It seems that most of the EU streamers even rolled on Faerlina but I refuse to deal with WoW's shitty EU/US account structure and pay for both regions.
---
Wow I can’t believe it! That’s amazing. He rolled a dwarf female. That’s so awesome. Tell him I said congrats, and THANK YOU for rolling such an awkward, unusual race/gender.
---
LFM 2 ranged dps instead of DPS.
---
Typically at peak hours on weekends, you’ll be waiting an hour or two at most to get in. During the week, at most like 40mins or less.
---
Please , PLEASE tell me you are using click to move
---
Especially since warlocks only use shadow spells in PvE
---
Oh i know, i just figure they might get a handle on the few names that are obviously ripe for scammin
---
Got it seconds run 49 warrior along with the plate legs
---
I believe they got humaned.
---
I keep my characters in the exact order as they were created, but my main changed through the years. It will be the same with classic.
---
Classic: Retail sucks because everyone just speed runs dungeons and AoE pulls everything so they can clear as fast as possible.
---
Also Classic: We need to skip as many mobs as possible and finish this dungeon as fast as possible because we've all done it a million times and taking even an extra 5 minutes is a waste of everyone's time.
---
Just a reminder of why retail dungeons exist like they are in the first place.
---
Did you play on unofficial servers?
---
Is it that good money maker and will they be really giving you a orb first?

Top work!
---
It’s literally a scam. I guess scams can be brilliant while still being shitty.
---
On K3 people treated that 8T1 effects as something that should not happen.
---
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
Instead of a 180% armor buff its 360%. And there may be a bit of a health buff.
---
Several preraid BIS for tanks is palladin armor sooo just because it has Int doesn't mean its not good for you.
---
Grab BiS vs BiS and tell me Ferals are in a good place. The scaling only gets worse as more phases come out.
---
Since some people want to see logs. Look at MC DPS logs, the highest ferals are capping out 600-700 DPS on their best fights, rogues and warriors are all hitting 1000-1800 DPS on every fight but Domo. Feral cats are serviceable, but they are not that strong compared to alternative melee classes.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=dps&amp;class=DPS
---
Blame the hunter pet.
---
There's info on the tukui forum that will tell you how to fix it.  
---
But why bother looking in the best place?
---
Where did I say I was feral ?  I play resto and chose the 2% spell crit trinket.
---
Also warriors when they jump just before they charge something
---
Did LBRS as tank and dps at 56 &amp; 57 with jump method, never aggro'd on the jump. Totally doable below 58 FYI
---
&gt;it's a bis 60 piece and you are a guildie. Otherwise that shit is getting sold. 
---
Piece of shit spotted
---
Female Dwarf Paladin must surely be one of the rarest combos in the game.
---
Yeah I'm on alliance and there's plenty of A-holes.
---
It's legitimately not misinformation, swords are just easier to play.   
---
Speaking from my own experience as a dagger rogue myself, I was consistently outperforming the rogues in my guild who had both dal'rends - with blue daggers &amp; these gloves.  The reduction in glancing blow penalties by having these gloves myself was a key factor.
---
Good luck in your endeavors in raid organization! It can be rewarding but also very stressful.
---
The most important thing of course is to communicate with the shaman in the guild so they understand the guild's goal with shaman loot prioritization and what roles they want to fill. Shaman tier was one of the tougher healer loot topics for my guild. The other was healer weapons - that's another whole discussion :)
---
Also I didn't talk about shaman T3 at all but as /u/riklaunim touched on, shaman T3 should be prioritized to shaman without 5/5 T2.5. Shaman T3 isn't game-changing like prior shaman tier sets. The 6/8 shaman T3 set bonus is good but basically it amounts to a sometimes armor buff on your MT, i.e tank healing. Usually guilds will prio the Hunter/Shaman/Druid tokens to druids first for their 2pc set bonus (which is AMAZING). Otherwise T3 can be split among hunters/shaman/druids as your guild sees appropriate.
---
Depends. Cheap BOE sure I always go greed on those. Expensive BOEs should and will always be rolled as need, it's been the standard forever.
---
It relies on you going through a billion menus to make sure your character is the right level, your EP numbers are right (every preset is pretty far off), and has terrible comparison/progression menus.  You're literally better off with an excel spreadsheet and a database browser.
---
As matter of fact I always inform my group I would like too need before I roll. My point is multi spec classes need more gear, they have twice as many slots too bis it's more runs, why should they  be double handicapped? Dw dps classes, you will bis sooner either way.
---
Furthermore I'm shadow, if someone asks me to heal I'll usally do it. But now I have to explain to them evrytime what the ramifications of of specing are? Shoulnt the rule be if you ask someone to off spec they get too roll on both? 
---
Dps classes are just but hurt, go role a class with a viable second spec if you want.
---
I mean your dumbass commented
---
I lucked out and got 1 by killing only 15 when I went to do the quest for Duke Hydraxis. RNGeezus be praised
---
I mark more as DPS than tanks do
---
What a bunch of dumbfucks lol. Blue+ BoEs deserve to be all need. If you're playing by the all greed rule don't be mad when someone actually needs it because it's an upgrade.
---
no... pallys hold threat with holy damage. Int is more important than str.  Seals and consecration hold agro not auto attacks...
---
Are starter accounts allowed for Classic? That's news to me.
---
Wow characters you can just add.  BattleTag they have to accept your request.
---
Genuinely curious (because I'm a mage and the sash is the only thing I'd need from that run) what item would a dps need from that run that isn't reserved?
---
Only time I want a paladin tank is on Onyxia
---
Awesome, thanks a bunch!
---
Oh hey, he's back. And he still can't read.
---
&gt;You’re in bad guilds and have no idea wtf you’re talking about. 
---
And yet, my apparently "bad" guild had no problem clearing through AQ40 and Naxx when they were current. Meanwhile, you're sperging out about MC loot, funny that...
---
&gt; You’re clearly one of those terrible hunters crying of Band if Acuria. 
---
If you'd actually read my posts you'd know I played a Warrior tank.
---
&gt;And there it is again. You are literally asking me a question about the loot council you think I run. 
---
Learn to read please.
---
&gt;You also act like each piece of gear drops once likely because you’re a child with no sense time. 
---
And you act like giving all the best pieces of loot to your GM and his friends is in any way acceptable.
---
&gt; I asked you a simple question on what loot system you prefer.
---
Literally answered in my first post.
---
Maybe stop feeling so damn sorry for yourself and actually try listening to what people are telling you, it'll help you out in the long run.
---
Do you have a buddy named Mattdemon?
---
Yeah of course. I'm just tryna say don't concern yourself with completing preraid bis before raiding. An early on Mara ring paired with voones and warmonger is enough for me to be contesting the meters in a group that's farming MC. Sure we could be more efficient but the point is bosses are dying and loot is looted. None of us are preraid bis completed lol
---
Okay, do you know how to change class colours? I play a shaman and in elvui the class colour for us is the same pink as it is for paladin. I was wondering if I could change it a base level like the ability to enable it? Sorry my question is off topic I know.
---
So because you personally out perform someone else, who may or not be playing terribly, that means the spec as a whole is "roughly even". okay.
---
Phase 2 it’s just wPvP.  The rewards are good, but not really in relation to the effort needed to get them.  AV rep rewards are the easiest of the stuff to get and some of them are quite nice.  The ranking system is just a pin and much better explained in many YouTube videos you can check out.
---
I've been fishing deviant fish, I didn't know where to go for STV is there certain bodies of water to look for?
---
The company does set the prices, I never stated on what terms they do. Don’t assume something then argue the theoretical assumption you made off of what I said. It just an argument with yourself at that point.
---
I usually tell them "we have too many warriors" then they understand
---
Today? I saw this posted weeks ago.
---
The question is how do you disable it, gets quite annoying after a while personally but I like Auctioneer.
---
Prot Pala here; Personally, im done with your need/greed crap. And it goes for all. Generally people are lootwhores, and only willing to pass/greed stuff that they dont care about. - Ive lost Skullflame Shield to amage, and Forors compendium to a hunter. Everyone rolls like buttholes, and so do I. Its a shitty situation, its bad for the isolated servercommunity, but at this point; if you want anything out of doing pugs, be an asshole. I run guildruns with friends, but by now, I really dont care if puggies need stuff. If i want it, I need it. 
---
And I dont doubt for a second this will get downvoted to oblivion, but it only confirms rhe outright hypocrisy.
---
But they are 50g per...
---
I've ran it quite a few times, haven't seen it drop once.
---
I play a holy paladin that offspecs ret. I have a decent healing set but i run into this debacle frequently. I find that saying up front at the beginning of the dungeon is always the best course of action. If you tell them up front you're going to tank, but that you want to roll on your fury items, they should be cool with it. What you did is no different than MS&gt;OS in a molten core, only difference is that you were the only plate wearer and you needed a dps item because that is your main spec.
---
Sadly I am no longer involved in the private realms scene, and struggling to find enough time to enjoy classic.  You can find the core available on github if you want your own private version.  Its little comments like this that make me feel all warm and fuzzy, knowing that we did a satisfactory job in trying times.
---
Whats the fun in that? :)
---
This. Druids are awesome. Feral leveling has no downtime. You can tank and heal and DPS with the same spec while leveling.
---
Yeah, that damn flare gun quest got me again.
---
wow, that's brutal.  We got two sash at least.
---
What server are you on? Because on mine Pristine Black Diamonds are 13g/per
---
I like whelps.  They stay at range and usually drop decent loot too.
---
If it was the mp5 shield,  that was major no bueno. It's preraid bis
---
Does it log pickpocketing too?
---
As everyone else has said, OT should get prio over DPS warriors, absolutely.
---
Blind bidding is weird as fuck IMO for basic loot. I don't like it and would be vocally complaining about it. That alone might be enough to gquit over.
---
Also, how exactly does DKP work with MT's then? If there's blind bid, are you saying MTs get literally whatever loot they want? Because that's absolutely ridiculous if that's the case. Yes, MT/OT should get prio, but they shouldn't be exempt from DKP and can take whatever loot they want over whoever they want. That's crazy.
---
So the hybrids should get to roll on healing/dps/tank gear?
---
Roll need on main spec only. The two exceptions are: 1) You’re not in the instance as your main spec (group asks fury warr to tank; feral Druid to heal etc), in which case you should probably still give a heads up to the group; and, you need the piece for Off Spec and won’t be need rolling against anyone for the main spec (caveat is that if you’re playing off spec you should able to upgrade the set you’re using). 
---
But yeah, if you weren’t asked to go off spec for this dungeon you shouldn’t be rolling need for off spec gear without letting the group know first.
---
Yeah, just don't go into the Mines of Moria room. You'll aggro like mad.
---
 RemindMe! 5 Hours
---
Retail is a singleplayer where most of the players refuse to communicate with other people and it's harder to make friends. In vanilla you're pretty much forced to group up and talk with people unless you want to spend way extra time grinding mobs alone or whatever you're doing.
---
No, mage is definitely not required. Just watch for the pats and keep a pace that your healer can keep up with.
---
Lion heart helm pattern, healer cape pattern from dmn were the main things. We have rag and ony on farm but want to make sure we get every thing we need for the future.
---
Exactly the same feeling dud, that's why I didn't dig into retail. I finally got a sub and I'm about to start classic :3
---
The suggestion was supposed to be unrealistic. To disagree with it shows the hypocrisy of the "you're a greedy ninja" argument. If you want an item bad enough you'll pay for it. Perhaps a better solution is a quick auction when an item drops. Everyone in the group can pay as much as they want for an item, the money is split between the remaining 4. The winner can equip it, or attempt to sell it for a profit as they see fit. 
---
I'm not going to change everyone's mind. But, I used to think need before greed was the better system not too long ago. A rational post in a thread like this changed my mind.
---
I had success not pulling either pack with level 56s as long as the pat is not near
---
now 31/5/15 was not a build i was considering. I figured most guilds would shun arms since it puts debuffs you can't control on the boss. Though i do like the idea of keeping tactical mastery if i go that route. I feel like going deep fury that would be the thing i miss the most its just to useful.

Your server economy is probably in the dumpster then

---
Hey! Would just like to highlight that ' **Block chat messages that you've blocked channel invites** ' is not really a sentence. What did you mean there exactly? It's just a genuine question, I'm having trouble understanding your suggestion exactly.
---
Tgey go for 1-2g on my server and the AH has about 100 at any givin time.
---
Tell your guildleader it is fucking ugly.
---
Reminds me of another scam a former guildie did once. There was someone legitimately buying "unlimited quantities" of something at a specific price, and to COD. This make sense, rather than trying to meet up with tons of random people and doing the trade window. Well this guildie sent like 30 stacks of the item COD for the advertised price, except about 5 stacks in the very middle were for 10 times the advertised priced. He assumed the buyer would just accept them all without checking, which is exactly what he did.
---
I disagree that tanking is unfun, but everything else is 100% true. I read a thread on here once where a warrior was complaining about being expected to tank, and that he just wanted to dps sometimes and switch his brain off. And that is the absolute wrong mindset that any dps should have. At no point should anyone in a dungeon be switching their brain off. Please just have some situational awareness.
---
TBH, I hate partying with warrior dps. I actively avoid it whenever possible. Why on earth should I have to compete with someone for gear when I'm busting my ass and they just want to roll their face across a keyboard? I have no sympathy for dps warriors in pre-60 content.
---
That being said, tanking is still the most fun part of the game. Being THE GUY in control of a combat encounter and knowing that a successful dungeon was made possible in no small part by your hard work is a very rewarding feeling.
---
Genius
---
Where's a good place for my 35 Warrior to farm lvl ~32-34 mobs with high respawn rates? Not looking for questing, just grinding. Looking for someplace like the Harpy cave in 1k Needles.
---
I went to STV thinking I could do both, but there's too much competition for mobs and a lot of them are lvl 35+.
---
Well, considering the solid chest that was linked is not the same as the one from Burning Steppes, ya you will get different loot.
---
You're trying to make something that takes 20 seconds sound difficult.   The ability to customize your eps is literally the reason I suggested it as preset ones would clearly be useless for what op is asking for.
---
Tons of misinformation here.  You don’t need to drop and relevel engineering to go goblin after gnomish.  You just go to the soothsayer book in NE Tanaris and switch from gnomish to goblin after making the gnomish items you want.
---
So, why should a druid tank for you instead of a group that doesn't care? You want tanks and healers that are geared appropriately, right? The pitch of "run with me, and you get to do twice as many dungeons as everyone else to get geared" isn't a great one.
---
Needing to collect several different sets of gear isn't a perk. Even \*with\* being able to roll on everything, it's harder to complete all sets because there's simply more items to collect.
---
Should be very well know to vanilla players. As for the rest. 🤷‍♂️
---
PLEASE don't forget Golem, it's the only thing that makes joining worthwhile as a healer.
---
Thank you, both of your responses were very helpful!
---
Really valuable advice that's gonna get overlooked by masses farming prebis so they can wpvp in it lol

Don't know, I bought my subscription instantly.
---
Kiting then around is extremely important. The first spell you use should be your shield if they are near you, then then shadow word pain. Fear them and run to a 30-40yrd distance. That's when you get your other spells off. The reason your shield first is so weakened soul debuff is gone by the time they hit you again and you can re shield yourself. If the fear fails then it's a race to who can burn the other down. Use flash heals to get health back fast. Throw a renew on if you have time. Mind blast and mind flay are your main damage moves after the dot is on them. Not a pro but I've killed many players 3-5 levels above me on my priest and I'm level 36.
---
Yeah I did both since I completely skipped the STV shitshow.
---
Is the [wowpop website](https://wowpop.appspot.com/) broken?
---
Smite’s mighty hammer.
---
&gt; Many guilds are very successful using loot council. Too bad youre not in one of those good guilds.
---
I don't have a problem with actual loot councils.
---
I do have a problem with someone who's trying to claim that the prime pieces of loot should go to the GM and Officer Clique, leaving table scraps for everyone else.
---
Listen to him "You should give this awesome drop to the Rogue that's already been given a Rag Weapon and a CHT!" Imagine being in a guild that did that? Guilds that do that implode, because it's bullshit.
---
And I really, really hope if you're in a guild like that, that you make it very clear that only the GM's friends/officers get any good loot, otherwise you're just being deceitful.
---
It's no different to the people who make those runs with everything on reserved, you're asking people to show up, but not letting them take anything.
---
Yeah but I'm not reading it lmao 😂🤣😂🤣 we really making a reddit thread after every bad group interaction. Boomers 😁
---
Making a post about it on reddit seems like a smart idea. Why dont you delete this and silently profit from it like we all do? Thank you. Plus its currently 30g+. It used to cost as you said before the announcement of DM (Firemaw)
---
Can confirm, Horde Bigglesworth has patterns at consistently 30g. I tried camping at the NPC but quickly turns into a bloodbath. I bought it of the AH, feelsbadman
---
So you should be able to have 3 full gear sets while putting in the same amount of time as everyone else getting 1 full gear set?
---
So Paladins/shamans/druids should be able to need roll on almost every item in every dungeon?
---
Nah, you’re greedy. If you want to declare a spec as your main spec for that run and roll that’s fine. But you don’t get to say “ok I’m rolling need on all tank/dps/healing gear this run” because that’s literally fucking everything
---
because most people rolled human or orc for weapon skill
---
which makes edgemaster that much worse
---
This is correct.  If you drop gnomish engineering and relevel it you’ll still have to go to the book anyway to switch to goblin.  There’s no reason to drop engineering in “1.12”
---
DUDE!!!! My server is ridiculous. Libram of Focus 75g/per v Pristine Black Diamond 13g/per.  
---
WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!?!?!?!!! I can't even fathom it
---
I do this lol
---
I did BRD on saturday night as a 55 warrior tanking. HOJ dropped and I won it. It was my first run. I'm so sorry for anyone who had to endure run after run for that.
---
Win! 
---
I killed 3 Lost Whelps  (the red ones) the other night while running south through Wetlands and the Crimson dropped. I was shocked! So shocked my lowbie paladin alt HAD to use it :-D
---
and now more people know about it because it's on the front page.
---
Sometimes bringing awareness to a small problem makes it a more common problem
---
Sad. I solo run in, about 170 kills in. I see the ring 3 times a day on average.. sometimes cosecutive runs.
---
Pay a soloer 30g for a drop 5g a run?
---
Run it a lot?
---
What are you trying to get to show? There should be a raid tab in the options,  and when you open the options it should show the movable raid group windows.  If you don't have those then you don't have the raid addon part of zperl enabled pr you don't have it installed.   Check your addons list to see if zperl raid frames is installed.
---
This.
---
If you can wear it and it's an upgrade then need it.
---
This is what happens when everyone knows what's coming, all the pristine black diamonds people have been keeping in the bank waiting for the first wave of enchants are hitting the AH.
---
Pretty much the same thing will happen for all 'new' content that people have been preparing for.
---
This is the in game model, to the polygon.
---
If she's down to try WoW she's a keeper. She will try anything, rockclimbing, parasailing, anal, the sky's the limit.
---
Pretty sure level 1 to level 2 is the fastest
---
When I downloaded zperl it all came together.  I think i got it from curse or whatever the twitch site uses.   I disabled all the raid stuff since im a hunter and would rather not have all the screen clutter.
---
That’s what PMs are for, mate!
---
actually what you do with your healer is have him mind control the scarlet wizards and spam arcane explosion. hits harder than the mages, and it holds aggro. they do crazy aoe damage
---
This is exactly something I would do, if I were a rogue....LOL
---
If you don't need the early bosses, then it's faster to jump down to the right as you come out of the entrance hallway. There are two ledges you can drop down (no fall damage for Rogues/Druids, light fall damage for other classes). Rogues and Druids can do this on stealth runs to solo the orcs for recipes and patterns.
---
Skips about half of the orcs + you don't have to clear the top part to get to the troll and ogre bosses.
---
It’s generally expected that fury warriors will rank dungeons to get gear. The rogue is just stupid.
---
I just did the last night in under 3 hours. Started as dwarf and ended up with my pet and 60ish alch and herb. There's a nice spot to grind ranged troll caster mobs and head hunters that you don't have to melee. I wish I spent more time there because it was easier grinding than questing around the zone. They also drop linen so you can level your FA.
---
Thank you!!
---
I'm doing this tonight. but making a gnome bank alt first
---
Yeah, it seemed a little broken and I wouldn't expect it to work that way here.
---
The who list is truncated. I would rather use an add-on that can run the command many times for me. It sorts thousands of players in an hour scan, takes into account duplicates, etc. I doubt you could even get close to an accurate guess running it manually and spending all day parsing the data. People uploading reports consistently isn't an issue. Even a few people in each zone from both factions is a much better sample set than running a manual who.
---
Unchecking [this box](https://i.imgur.com/SBstCBH.png) does exactly what you're asking for.
---
Does it plug into auctioneer or something to Guage price of items on AH?
---
could just say "Hoj is a pretty good fucking trinket" and left it at that
---
You sound like a noob, I wouldn't invite you either. LBRS is literally faceroll, 52 is no prob
---
Yeah, the one that drops from the goblin?
---
Shit way crazy, both where threatening to leave, It was like a mutual assured destruction for the group, It was like 2am and took us long enough to find them.
---
Us three DPS just stood there while they went add it.
---
If I knew that It was pre-raid BIS for the healer I would have booted the tank.
---
Similar story. I was MH as Resto Druid in a stratUD group. Robes of Exalted dropped off end boss, our dps PLD need rolls, wins, drops party about 3 seconds later. 
---
I was certainly salty, but would never call him a “ninja”. Very poor form. Easily alleviated by some proactive communication like “hey just a heads up, in rolling need on healing gear for raid spec” or whatever up front. Sent him a tell later just to break stones, dude went postal on some entitled rant about how he saved the whole run for our group and he deserved the drop and something else nonsensical. 
---
If you are going to ninja stuff, lean into it and own it. 
---
If you are going to need OS stuff, communicate in advance or just own it. 
---
But don’t go on some self entitled rant about how anyone owes you anything.
---
Ret paladin: check
---
DPS 0: check
---
Sounds about right
---
Yeah, PUG MC and Ont was VERY rare and rarely successful when attempted back then.  PUG BWL was unheard of.
---
I'm gonna thread the needle between these two packs
---
\*pulls both packs*
---
That's because in retail in anything that isn't a raid or M+ (and even then...) you just don't need CC, you just need either good heals, or a ton of DPS. Most M+ can  be done without CC, so people tend to come to classic and play it like that and get their asses handed to them.
---
Similarly to how it seems nobody in classic is actually paying attention to mana levels on healers; since it's damn hard to actually be very low on mana in retail (as far as I can tell, play a lock not a healer so) so nobody really looks at it anymore.
---
...Is that not what I said? The Dragon Soul patch in late Cata?
---
Would help to tell us your class.
---
DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS?
---
*idiots pulling mobs that are skippable.
---
There fixed it.
---
Haha this is great
---
Just cause you misleads somebody to remove a listing doesn't mean it worked to sell their item.
---
Keep reaching. Calling a scam anything fraudual and misleading is very vague.
---
Definition of scam. "a dishonest scheme; a fraud."
---
If someone has no intention of actually purchasing your item,  but is acting like they do in an effort to hold your item hostage, I would say that falls under the "dishonest scheme" part of the definition would it not? Plus I was loosely using the word which is why I used the word in quotations.
---
As a counterpoint: Back in vanilla I had so many BRD full-run groups end because someone insisted on starting with jailbreak, but would drop group as soon as they got their quest done. I can't speak for the guy you met, but I would've been real nervous about accepting someone who only wanted the first 5% of the dungeon.
---
Great addon. Been using it for a couple of hours in ZF.
---
One feature request though. In ZF there is a few grey items you always delete, simply because they aren't worth the bagspace. Is it possible to remove those item from being counted in the gold per hour? Or completely blacklist them, so the addon never counts them again?
---
While that may be safer to avoid it rotting in someone's mailbox you also pay a 5% fee by going though the AH. If you want do to a direct sale of a high value item just do it in person. Instant delivery for both (apart from travel time) and no fees.
---
Shadow Priests do not have mana issues in raids unless you're not putting in maximum effort. Use a proper major mana pot + dark/demonic rune rotation, use mp5 food, and sacrifice stats for spellpower and you'll be way up there on the damage meters (for the time being at least). I logged in at #2 on rag last week and I have a piss poor mana pool.
---
Rofl they complain about 10g a week? Boy would they not like that I wanted to do 25g.
---
Until you ding on the way to turn in quests and they all turn green or worse they all turn grey
---
If you would have cleared it, it would have been because a level 60 warlock was tanking or something. Also, I should note the whole reason I was able to tank at that level was because it was pre Demo Shout nerf. Threat was easy at launch for tanks lol.
---
Sorry, rogue undead lv 60
---
not everyone has to play the way you do
---
Don't really need to. We only have one other Rogue that's a dagger Rogue. Very few contests to be honest!
---
Yeah the biggest problem is transparency, the loot counciling should be happening outside of raid, before the loot even drops. When everyone is in at the start of raid, theyve already figured it out.
---
I healed a full mara run at 48 with resto gear as enhance spec. It helps to have good DPS and mage water lol.
---
Crusty Jugglers
---
No, you don't.
---
He put a message like "WTB Ogre suit, 100g." in trade chat, then some people would see his ogre suit on the AH (posted as a different character) and they'd think they're getting a great deal by buying it and reselling it, essentially 50g for then selling it to this "other" character. But this dude never had any intention of buying it at 100g, or at all.
---
Vague ass definition that should have been updated to be more precise ages ago. 🤷‍♂️
---
No need to worry, you don't need those things for the future. You can clear every single raid in non optimal gear with no consumables with ease.
---
I love how all the realms got one ffa discord, but my realm's got whopping three discords: one for both factions and one neutral. Looks like faction war is the realest on ZT.
---
Overall stats. 30 AP + 15 Stam + 1% Crit + 5 Daggers is a really nice combo.
---
My friend's dad that works for Blizzard told me that if you get all the lockpicking books together, have Onyxia Deep breath on you, then go to Khazaran you can unlock a secret invisible door that lets you get Ashbringer for rogues.
---
anything else?

I personally find BFA other latter expansions more tedious/boring because there’s a huge gap in between rewards. In Classic I get mounts, talent points, class quests for spells, spell ranks, etc.
---
I could say the same about golden pearls, but i wont. Oh wait... shit!
---
I'm torn between Eng + Alch and Herb + Alch. This will be my first time at 60. Herb + Alch just feels more "druid-y" but everyone keeps saying Eng is a must on a pvp server so now I'm torn.
---
Why do you say fish + herb + alch + cook go so well together? I love fishing and crafting so I'm interested in this route over Eng.
---
Any idea where I could go to learn about how to play fury Warrior (dps) in raids?
---
Regrowth rejuv run in barkskin Hurricane attack!!!
---
Usually does the job. Gotta warn the healer tho or its suicide.
---
No youre not a ninja. I would just start clarifying for groups you are tanking for that there are items you are looking for for Main spec
---
Not the ninja.
---
Well damn, that would explain the wasted hours I spent camping some of those spawns trying to get the leather for my armor. Was wondering if they were actually accurate since I kept waiting without seeing any spawn.
---
Holy crap this is fantastic. Can't wait to try some of these. Thank you
---
This is why I don't do connecting flights
---
Classic is a better starting point than Retail.
---
Step 1 Hit vanish  
---
Step 2 find a corner that has as much LOS as possible  
---
Step 3 pray
---
This might be confirmation bias, but I'm convinced the satyre in East is the best way to farm for books. My group doing jump runs have gotten the warlock, hunter and forors of that boss and we've barely farmed 2hours worth of jumps.
---
This is a typical regurgitated spiel that is just hyperbolic bs.
---
In retail, when leveling, you can do most quests solo and don’t have to actually interact with others. Depending on your character, if your toon is decently geared (up to date on quests or have good gear from raiding in previous expansion) and you know your class’s toolset, you can handle even quests designed for groups. Guess what? You can do exactly that in Classic (as with retail, depending on class). For both retail and classic, players that can do this are above average in general skill. Most players cannot do this in either iteration of the game.
---
Players in retail don’t refuse to communicate. They don’t go out of their way to do so unnecessarily, but they won’t refuse. If you join a group/raid or encounter players in the world, they’ll chat back with you a large majority of the time. Making friends is simple, I have a healthy chunk of real I’d friends that I talk to and group with regularly. Players don’t avoid that either.
---
Either you speak entirely out of ignorance (caught up in anti-retail propaganda) or you’re one of the *very* few people that have just been shit on with continual bad player experiences.  If the latter, you are definitely not the norm.
---
Also is a very clear flag for the GMs.  Long periods of repetitive behavior?  Hard to distinguish from a bot.  There have been lots of stories here about people who get whispered by GMs while doing repetitive actions.  This is Blizzard doing a bot check.
---
Story is good, might want to keep to yourself about the macro.  Just say you jumped every ten minutes as you walked around the house doing chores.
---
Good point. There is a noticable curve in performance between the good the bad and the great
---
You get 165rep for every 3 stacks of runecloth ( doing the repetable "a donation of runecloth" in Darnassus).  
---
You need about 600 stacks of runecloth to get from honored to exalted.  
---
that is atleast 700+ gold (depending on the server ofc).
---
My setup is using an mmo mouse (1 through =) on the side, and I use (1 through equal) for action bar 1. Action bar 2 and three are the same but I hold down shift for all the action bar 2 abilities and control for action bar 3 abilities.  This macro wouldn’t work with this setup since I have shift+number for all my action bar 2 abilities, right? I am also using alt+number for pet abilities since I have a warlock alt.
---
I foolishly attempted to delete one in a fruitless effort to skin a mob. Instead I abandoned the quest with only a handful of fragments to go.
---
How often do you run into an engineer or blacksmith who is using the same tactic?
---
Pull with fairy fire or moonfire. Los behind corners. Maul every chance u get. Swipe when I have the rage 2 spare.
---
Thats why im party leader 90% of the time :\
---
I healed 5 cath runs last night and in one the tank pulled Mograine while I was completely oom (rebuffed everyone and healed 2 warlocks that just tapped to near death before I sat to drink anyway, but the drinking never happened). Apparently we didn't clear a room too. We *somehow* lived but man did I use every cooldown and consumable I possibly could. Divine Favor and Lay on Hands really saved the day.
---
Clearly lol
---
Died in Zf and stockades this way exactly. People wanted to skip trash and speed clear, they ended up aggroing said skipped trash and we had way too many mobs and died.
---
Had me at anal
---
I included 3 for ZT because the three seem to all support one another. They're also all active, so that's good. Usually realm discords have one super large one and 1-2 other mostly dead ones. This was a rare exception.
---
Leatrix can do that too with other quality of life aspects
---
Nope they were fully alive
---
Each boss you skip on tribute puts one additional drop in the tribute crate (that item is what the skipped boss gives you in tribute). Cho'Rush has a pretty good loot table as well so I can see justification for killing them based on that - you should only lose out on one drop in the tribute chest.
---
That’s fine.  We just won’t invite people with this attitude to raids, so it balances out :)
---
Yeah, gonna go with no way in hell you did. But that made for a good story.
---
How does he know what a vacuum is even?
---
The +shadow damage capes are worth the investment. They're way better than spritecaster.
---
We at least had to go through angerforge and golem lord to get the info for the clear.
---
Mages HATE him!
---
Yeah agro seems to be exponential when you're a couple levels down. I rip agro off of tanks with my first heal halfway through a fight if I'm lowest level to get into a dungeon. The actual healing is the easy part
---
Don’t feel too bad about having multiple characters right now. It’s actually more efficient to level characters now rather than later down the road. I do recommend you get your main to 60 and in a guild so you can at least run each raid once a week; then continue playing on alts.
---
Lol I have only been kicked out of one group and it was in RFK. I was tired from working a long day and was running RFK. I’m a hunter. Some BOP leather gloves dropped that I thought said AGI/INT, but they actually said Stam/Int. I was looking at the stats of my current gloves and numbers of the new gloves and had a brain fart. I was the only person that needed the gloves. I only needed one other item the whole dungeon and this was the final boss. I was called a ninja looter, told hunters don’t need int, and removed from the group for 30 silver BOP gloves. I messaged the party leader, and he said I could sell those gloves for a g on the AH, but they were BOP.  So dumb....
---
I’m leaving as a Druid and my intention is be a healer. I’m lvl 16 currently. Didn’t start playing retail seriously until BC so I don’t remember a ton of classic. 
---
Basically, I’ve been slapping my tree points in wrath in the balance tree. I’m 5/5 now. And some in the restoration tree. I think I went with Mark of the wild 1st. 
---
My question is, should I leveling as a bear, even though I intend to heal? I got my deadlines quests, even though I’m too low level to use them. Should I go in as a dps or heals when I get there? I have raid healed as a Druid during wrath so I’m not a total noob.
---
Also, is there tree form in classic?
---
More people are looking for DPS than healers. I dont know how that's possible. Makes me a little bitter I was forced to switch from feral to resto to raid. Anyways, my warrior alt is coming along nicely.
---
Use your Fear, Dot, and mind flay first if someone attacks you.  When they are at max distance use Mind Blast and then Mind Flay to slow down their return and deal damage. (when they are at max range or out of range you can heal yourself use rank 1 Greater Heal  to get the most bang for your buck.)  Don't switch to defensive right away.  
---
Remember you have dispel to use to remove dots and cc from yourself, but try not to go out of mana playing defense cause then you are a sitting duck.  Do as much as you can to them and try to get a fear off before you do anything defensive.
---
Yeah dude, i am arms fury not and have tanked everything.  
---
Back in vanilla I was arms fury and tanked everything up through ubrs.
---
Yup
---
Where are you getting that drop rate from? If it's Wowhead, be careful. It's been known to have inaccurate drop rates.
---
I disagree, you should definitely make your intentions clear to avoid this situation from happening. Rogue should have also made his expectation clear and not been such a cry baby though. I tanked all my fury pre-bis without a single reserve but I at least told every dps I invited that I would be rolling on dps drops and if they don't like it they can look elsewhere for a tank.
---
Is being here in this subreddit a sign you want to come back?
---
Come back to us :) we welcome you with open arms
---
I don't like all the negative comments on this.  TBH The entire point of classic to me is playing to your heart's desire in whatever way that is.  As long as you aren't actively hurting people or the community, who cares if someone wants to level solo and just enjoy the journey.  No need to project your personal preferences on someone else, especially in a game like this.
---
Grats on 60 dude.
---
None. You wont find + healing gear until 50+. But as the previous commenter correctly stated spirit benefits shamans the least as we have to cast more often than other healers and thus we rely on Mana per 5 seconds instead of spirit, however that doesnt mean spirit is bad neccesarily it just isnt as great as it is for say, a priest. 
---
With that said, as long as you have some semblance of a resto set while leveling you can easily heal most dungeons until youre 55 or higher. I was even healing BRD till level 56 as an enhance shaman with resto gear. Although after that it gets harder.
---
DKP in 2019, with you competing directly with the GM, find a new guild.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusVZZVMGdctot
---
Something like this, shadow can be different depending on your goal though, mine is PvP mostly
---
Most of my wipes are a mob "nearly dead" so everybody is attacking everything else and then that mob runs off and pulls more.
---
./raidinfo
---
I guess he cares about the envoronment
---
Shimmering Flats for sure, then Desolace.
---
Yeah, I only need the mace off 7D on my healer but trying to find people willing to kill it is a PITA
---
Dropped for my group last night.  We did a full tribute with the ogre suit (no frost trap though, just skipped past the guard)
---
i hope you would allow them to copy paste something like "/cast "  would help a bit :P
---
Press "o", raid tab, click raid info @ top right.
---
You can try typing /raidinfo but i'm not sure if that works
---
You don’t save any time having to mount back up again
---
It gets added in a later phase, that's always been the plan.
---
Hell yeah man! Go ahead and add me whenever! :)
---
I was pretty close to the graveyard, he could have gotten me either way.
---
What does C.O.D Means?
---
Tanking in the late 30s in bear form sucks, you're God mode through the 40s however
---
You can’t transfer from PvE to PvP and viceversa. Only between PvP servers.
---
Rogue resource generation does not rely on white attacks so I'd argue HoJ is more valuable for a warrior.
---
In El Paso I got me $250 for it.
---
Character Notes.  Adds it to your tooltip.
---
Edit:  It does also adds it to chat, and I never tried using it with a player of the opposing faction.
---
Once I got this working properly it's actually really great for xp and gold. I've averaged 60k xp per hour and about 15g.
---
I don't have experience with zf farms, but I'm happy with that results. Also being able to do it solo is nice.
---
Thank you for backing me on this 🥳
---
Not as a stat no.
---
There are abilities that mimic haste (Troll berserk, shaman enchant talent, etc)
---
Ofcourse you can but a dps warrior is less likely to want to tank vs someone who raids as a tank. I have pretty much BiS tank gear, why whould I want to heal dungeons. 
---
If someone is a dps warrior it's either a.) They don't want to tank or B.) They don't have a tank spot in their raid.
---
If someone is  tanking for raids, they propably like tanking and will tank dungeons.
---
You wouldn't do it for 15g even if you wouldn't get gold otherwise?
---
Would you rather farm gold for $10 an hour or work in a warehouse for the same amount?
---
Leveling as feral is way faster and you won't be killing yourself spending 2 minutes to kill a mob.
---
Just save up a set of INT/MP5/Spirit/Healing gear as you level up, and equip it if you ever need to heal for a dungeon. You'll be fine until MC/Ony as long as your tank is decently geared and using a shield. 
---
&gt;Also, is there tree form in classic?
---
Nope, just BOOOOOOOOOMKIN.
---
&gt; Stupid, greedy players like you
---
Yeah not worth wasting my time on this.
---
yea, i also have lower rank frostbolts and fireballs on my keybinds because damage isn't everything, but being able to do damage while not making the tanks life hell is super important as a dps. I've never understood people who nuke right away and then complain that the tank sucked afterwards lol. People are idiots
---
You can right-click to report. Blizzard pushed a change to client code about a week or two after launch specifically to ensure that this is possible. Try again.
---
I started today in Mograine, as an Alliance since I was currently playing Horde on the PvE server.
---
Haven’t played enough yet, but thanks for the tip. I’ll continue here from now on.

---
I agree. As long as the new horrible combat animations dont come with it.
---
A ton of the quest mobs look so good now, like troggs for example and almost every animal
---
It's great EXP no matter what type of run you're doing, honestly.
---
When I was 56 I joined a group of 4 60s that were doing just Omok, Voone, and Shadow Hunter for their BiS and it was still something like a 3 hour level.
---
Ah, that is a good point, I completely forgot about that. It's the [Arcanum of Rapidity](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18329/arcanum-of-rapidity), and it provides 1% haste; which, in Classic terms, only affects the attack speed of Melee and Ranged weaponry.
---
no, they're all random as to if they spawn or not which is awful but something to watch out for as you go through.
---
hey its me blizzard, confirmed legit no /s required thx
---
Uses clickbait title
---
Not clickbait...
---
Pretentious much? Why do you think I dont understand what you are saying? Is it because I havent changed my stance on wanting the player to choose which version of the game they want to play?
---
You can argue how illogical it is to split up the playerbase until your fingers bleed, but I still hope for what I said at the top.
---
So with that, fuck off.
---
That one is already in the list, thanks though!
---
Rogue endgame:
---
1. Create  a level 1 Rogue.
---
2. Send the starting Gear to your Main
---
3. Kill people just with the starting gear within your infinite stun-combo.
---
It will be available in a later phase, there's no need for it now.
---
Preach! You save **no time at all** skipping mobs and pulling before mana and dpsing before aggro if it only means a corpse run, buffs and respawns in your future.
---
Hype!! I just got my Eye of Divinity last night! And already had my Eye of Shadow waiting in my bag
---
I'm one happy priest!
---
Too soon
---
Wiped on my first run in DMEast because we did some trick jumps to drop on the boss and subsequently (somehow) pulled the nearest skipped spawns. I suspect someone backed into them. Got the boss at least.
---
Wiped on my second run in DMEast, again trying to do tricky shit. Someone stepped a bit to far to the left and aggroed a tree, then another two as everyone flailed about.
---
Finally convinced everyone to just kill our way down.
---
Turns out it's like three spawns and maybe five minutes of work.
---
I would do what I do when I don’t want competition on a roll for a 5 man dungeon. Do a message like so, “LF3M Insert Dungeon Name, need caster dps and healer!” If it takes too long to fill spots just say lfm dps and accept the fact you might need to take a warrior with you
---
What about the undead ravagers in south desolace? They’re 37-38 but they must have low health cause I had no problem grinding them at 35. They have a 30% chance to drop silk cloth as well which is nice.
---
Knowledge of the dungeon just comes with experience. You’ll figure out the routes after a couple runs. 
---
As for tanking. 
---
Bind mark skull to something easy to push. 
---
You have maul, causes huge threat. 
---
Keep Demo shout and faerie fire up always. 
---
And swipe when you have extra rage.. 
---
Pick up omen of clarity in the balance tree. It proves a lot and it gives you a chance for rage free mauls which helps your rage build up quicker. Early on you may feel like your not generating much rage, Omen helps a lot
---
If your health hits 20-30% and you don’t see a heal incoming. Pop frenzied regen and enrage, this should save you a few more secs till the healer wakes up. 
---
Most of warrior demo shouts will cancel druids demo shout. So nicely ask warriors to not demo shout. Doesn’t matter if their demo is better than yours. It’s mostly for initially picking up the group you pull but also causes some decent threat. 
---
Save your taunt for when mobs get pulled off you. 
---
Save your stun and charge to interrupt spell casts
---
Just keep tabbing and getting a maul off on your targets. 
---
Any time a mage novas, take a quick step back so you can get healed up. But then Jump right back in before your melee members get owned.
---
Tidy plates is a nice add on. Clearly shows who you have threat on and who u don’t. And places your debuffs above their health bars. Highly recommend this addon. 
---
Also “Druid watch” I think it’s called. Displays a mana bar when you’re in bear form. Nothing worse than switching out of bear mid fight for whatever reason and then not having mana to switch back to bear.
---
I almost always “line of sight” pull, meaning faerie fire/moonfire/facepull and then slip behind a solid object or wall so that the entire group runs to you. Particularly useful against caster mobs that would normally just stand there and cast.
---
So, first and foremost, I would highly recommend you respect ASAP and start down the feral tree.  You will be able to heal any dungeon on your travels as 100% feral and only really need to respect into the 50-60 zone for full healing when you want to heal.
---
Feral will make your leveling journey sooooo much quicker.  You will stick with leveling in bear form until you hit 20 then start leveling in cat form.  If you don't you will rely so much on mana that you will always be oom.
---
However, as a Druid you have options.  Yes, if a group is looking for heals you can/should heal.  If you arent comfortable advertise yourself as DPS so you can learn the dungeon.  You can also tank most dungeons in bear form so you will always have a group.  I've been recruited more for tanking than I have healing and I want to heal and am great at it.. just so many groups nees tanks.  It's basically up to what role you want and what role a group needs you for (and what you're willing to play as at the time).
---
No tree form.
---
You can play however you want, but I think you are handicapping yourself as dungeons before 50 are so easy to heal in.  No one will notice you are a healing build until then.
---
I didnt know that was a TBC thing, damn TBC really was a huge xpack in terms of features
---
Hey hey now, I also soak up all the druid tier drops.
---
I mean, I personally would send it back. But it's not a bannable offense?
---
Fish
---
See I'll tell a rogue that I'm going to roll on a leather piece that's BiS before a run, but a cape? Fuck that he should know better. 
---
Of course that rogues whispering random warriors to tank his dungeon for him, because warriors just don't bother grouping with rogues because of shit like this. I either only tank dungeons for guildies or I don't invite rogues and hunters cuz I don't want the headache/drama. The amount of idiots who don't understand that maybe 1/10 warriors are actually prot is astonishing.
---
**MEDIOCRE**
---
I did. You made a long paragraph about why and how, when I set up the situtation - then you had to end it with the niche stuff and personal experience, making you biased - and of course not. It's kinda implied, when I wrote "extreme" cases that nobody would go with them. Should be able to figure that out, since you think I am implying in the other post.
---
And with your 2nd paragraph. Why should any tank go to stratholme live with pugs then? There's no item drops. Only a repair bill if they don't get any of the blues or orbs.
---
Don't see a difference now? People are playing different things, and people want it differently. You want it your way, others want it some other way.
---
Grats on the cape and identifying a player that you never want to play with again that will never play with you again.
---
He's doing the work for you!
---
If you think that i got some bad news for you. Classic has just as many kids and teens as it did back than twitch streamers helped with that. My server picks up at 3 when kids get off school not 5 when adults get off.
---
Even if that was true, the mechanics are completely separate. The only way to counter spell resistance is with spell penetration. Normal hit is based purely on level of the target. Extra hit% over the cap isnt going to do anything, there's a reason it is called a cap.
---
But why does it seem like ALL hunters are new players lol?
---
I did a dozen Maraudon runs the other day to get gizlock's sword on my Lock. Had the ring drop from princess 5 runs in a row :x
---
I guarantee when I inevitably make a rogue alt I'll do hundreds of runs and not see that thing.
---
Wow that warning was nice though. Would your account happen to be a super old account that includes every single Blizz game? :o
---
I'm gonna be honest, you sound like somebody that does shady things to make money and is trying to justify it to everyone else. It's not a hard concept. If you LIE to someone to make money then you are scamming.
---
Here's a simple test. At the end of this whole process are you able to say "Everyone involved in this affair feels like they got a square deal and weren't misled."? If the answer to that is no then you're almost certainly scamming someone. This is like kindergarten level ethics dude.
---
Its PRICELESS
---
Sure, but the quests and actual leveling are incredibly tedious and unfun, and 50% of the classes lack really basic tools to handle things and are not fun to play until 40ish.  It's really not worth the 'rewards' or whatever if the gameplay is so unfun you'll tire of it by level 30.  I would not recommend classic to a new player at all.
---
Yea please just go away. The guy's intention was kind, clear and not malicious and you try to demonize him for even suggesting that sometimes corruption is misconstrued.
---
Nah that's BS. As someone who mained hunter since before MOP (when they changed that) and after it i would definitely like to go back to the old ways
---
Had a guy whisper me the other day, I went to go get a drink or something, came back and spam again and he flipped out.  Blocked me on all of his characters - making sure to harass me before blocking me. 
---
 Like, dude, give me a chance to speak to you.  Probably for the best (saved me some headache).
---
If I saw guy #2 offering to pay 100, I'd tell him it's on AH for 50 and be done with it.  The only way to fall victim to this scam is to have the mindset of trying to get over on someone else.
---
So it's like there are no victims.  Pretty clever imo.
---
Swipe is bait, only useful at the beginning of the pull to make sure the first heal doesn't attract it all away and honestly demo is probably just as good even with exactly 3 targets.
---
Unfortunately that means you don't have many buttons to push.  Maul is it baby, get to love it.
---
Swipe only gets useful if you do wierd things and crit stack so that your entire screen fills up with little red +5 rages and you can afford to weave mauls in too.
---
I just want that hairstyle on undead
---
It's kind of irrelevant for the tank because if you have a dps warrior tanking, he has no competition for the tank gear anyway.
---
Like, I had a BRD run I walked out of with 5 upgrades because of that effect. Whole party was cloth.
---
Will likely be introduced in P3 or P4 as these Classic phases would coincide with the timeline of 1.7 in Vanilla
---
I know some warriors that have done nearly 100 runs and haven't seen it yet. I've seen it a few times too though. Bad luck for some.
---
For some reason I've never seen that common west side of garden spawn while lasher farming.  Only the east side.
---
Noticed you said you were saving all your wool. For faction rep you only turn in 3 stacks of wool, silk, and mageweave. The repeatable quest is only for runecloth.
---
You're all over the place. 
---
A warlock is not going to be putting siphon life on a boss. That's a wasted debuff slot to the raid. A warlock is not going to be life draining either unless there are some extreme circumstance because the DPS output is basically on par with a tank or worse. If you're life draining in a raid, you're a wasted dps slot. The only positive you can hope for is a nightfall proc.
---
The only life gain that a warlock will use is a healthstone or health pot. That's good for about 4 shadowbolts. The healer's mana is good for many more; +healing gear to health to life tap to +SP gear is a much better conversion of damage.
---
A warlock lifetapping and not being healed is a wasted DPS slot. Might as well bring them in to banish elementals and boot them afterwards.
---
Totally.
---
Which kinda begs the question about what do I/you/we call people that do stuff like that?  Assholes I suppose.
---
The instances(west, north, east) are connected without a loading screen, so if I had to guess I'd probably say they are shared. But I don't know 100% for certain
---
&gt; pass out water/food to healer and anyone else that wants it.
---
it blows my mind other mages don't do this. If I'm about to do a dungeon i usually always try to go ahead and make 3 stacks of water for every mana user and 3 stacks of food for the non-mana users and tank. If I don't have it ready I'll try to get the instance first so I can make it while everyone shows up
---
It's just so easy to do, I don't understand why others wouldn't. The only part that sucks is if you didn't have time to do it ahead of time, so you spam make it for everyone, have no mana and your evocation cd isn't up, so you spend the first couple minutes of the run constantly trying to catch up on mana. It's really not THAT big of an issue though
---
Do you just die to adds after each kill?
---
Funny how you had to specifically ask for small things only.
---
It will be very rare if two high population servers are merged.
---
I'm assuming you mean Yojamba and Argual, both of these are at High/Full during peak hours, and usually at Medium at off-peak times.
---
People who want these items can pay someone the 25-50g to craft them or they can wait for the guild to get them organically. Also what are you doing with all of the shit that drops in raids? No guild should have to tax it's players at the very most you should bid ony bags.
---
New player here.  I've enjoyed it but it took a while to get used to the slowness of it.  Like the run-speed slowness.  Ogrimarr was designed by a masochist.  So much time is spent just.. .walking places.  
---
I'm level 37 with 50g, so I am going to save up and get the mount and see if that makes enough of a difference to continue on. 
---
I find myself passing on doing things I know I should because of the time it'll take.  "Gotta go repair, be back in 25 minutes".  Bleh.  
---
Outside of that, I'm enjoying the actual content and looking forward to getting a mount so that walking placesisn't taking up the majority of time spent in game.
---
You rang?
---
They will never make you delete entire characters.
---
At worst forced race changes.
---
I think people are using the phrase "You need this item. You are allowed to roll." very loosely now.
---
I am a mage. Let's say a 2H sword drops and there are 2 guys who can wear it and it's an upgrade for them. But I do need it... to sell it for gold. Am I allowed to roll? Hell no.
---
There are a lot of ways to make gold, but those for which a druid is particularly suited....
---
1. Charge to tank.
---
2. Stealth runs to solo/duo bosses. 
---
3. Stealth to get mats/craft things at the dark iron forge or w/e it's called. 
---
We're not murder machines at aoeing, so that's really not our ideal. Most of the farming methods are...doable, but we are generally not going to match other classes at stabbing things. If you're doing badly with Princess, consider going elsewhere. It's fairly easy to farm MCPs in Gnomergon via the back door. Sell loot when it ain't a hammer. Bank hammers if you want to be feral. Otherwise, vendor those as well. You can do a solo run fast enough that lockout is a concern.
---
When is a good level to start solo farming dungeons? 
---
People in my guild have been hell bent on farming SFK for them sweet sweet twink bis weapons. I just don't know what level I should consider farming for loot and gold. I'm a shaman so it's going to be hard no matter what dungeon I choose because I have bad cc.
---
What useful mage macros are you guys using?
---
This dumbass mentality is why you have no tanks and no healers willing to pug. Just be greatful someone is willing to babysit 3 people smashing their faces into the keyboard the entire dungeon and let them have whatever gear they came for.
---
Depends on the server.
---
Wait are arena farms supposed to kill golemlord? So far every run on my server is only for arena and anger forge which as a priest healer I need nothing from them so I don’t join
---
I don't actually. I farm day in and day out for vendor blues and herbs.
---
Nice assumptions buddy.
---
Also tldr. When you try and get oersonal I split.
---
This is the internet.
---
Its decent for brand new guilds. But it causes a lot of impatience, frustration and people to overtime, quit the guild.
---
Lets say you get a piece of gear and used your DKP, well now you're in the back of the line and have to wait another 3-4 weeks b/c all your other classmates will be using their DKP to get something themselves. Another problem with DKP is that it rewards attendance, and like you said, if you miss even 1 raid, you're now behind in DKP compared to everyone else and won't be seeing an upgrade for quite some time.
---
If I were your friend, I'd get out now. It will only get more and more rough as weeks go on and people stockpile their DKP for that 1 item they really want. Imagine a Viskag of the Bloodletter dropping (2% drop rate) from Ony, but some guy automatically wins it b/c hes got the most DKP. Shitty feeling. All in all, DKP is horrible (unless a brand new guild). Loot Council is much better, it might suck in the beginning, but the gear starts flowing in more frequently over time.
---
Not for xp runs. He'd be getting 150k xph of he went. You don't skip any packs and just sit back while tank gets agro and mages aoe down. We took a 51 priest in and he was 56 by time I went 58 to 60
---
I am a rogue who had to run Strat UD 30x before the cape dropped. Fortunately for me, I was doing guild runs made around getting me the cape, so didn't have to roll.
---
That being said, the rogue should be happy that you are tanking and if he was that bothered about it, he should have asked you at the start of the instance. Rogues/warriors/hunters are all going to roll on it when it drops. This guy is just salty, no need to make his problems your own.
---
Cool, go fail to understand basic ethical behavior somewhere else.
---
You have a point with that last part... if people don't like the scummy reservations that kill all incentive to run, yeah... they should ingore the reserving pricks and run their own groups.
---
No it's not because nobody 'needs' anything in the true sense of the words it's a video game..
---
I could 'need' all the healer gear that drops as a bear tank because there will be situations where I need to heal in the future but I don't because it's generally expected that people respect MS &gt; OS in dungeons.
---
&lt;bump&gt; Still struggling with this, lol.  Any help is appreciated.
---
Hunter or warrior.
---
Warriors are absolute savages with the right weapons and talents.  
---
Hunter gives you the benefit of a tank.
---
Leatrix has a lot of the QOL stuff packed into one. Highly recommend.
---
Sort by q&amp;a and the first comment is literally OP giving the link to someone who request it.
---
Double check and get back to me
---
This bullshit attitude of gear before all else is why pugs suck. Ms&gt;os has been the norm for ages.
---
Race people around Org.
---
you start making hella gold hella fast after mount at 40. i wouldn’t worry about gold farming til 60 when you can solo dungeons and make some real money.
---
Good soil is key
---
On alliance, BFD was the worst dungeon to get groups together so far (up to ZF at the moment). I imagine SFK would be even harder, but I skipped that dungeon. It's so far out of the way for most of the alliance races that it just sucks to get there.
---
"Pc snowflakes sjws cant handle the internet" is probably his takeaway from that
---
I think it's fairly dead.
---
My 28 warlock friend had the same issue and spent like 4 days trying to get a group.. so I ended up running him through it since I was a druid of a higher level able to solo it.
---
May want to see if a guildie can run you through.  We finished the quest in like a hour or so and I basically soloed it as a level 38 or whatever I was.
---
There doesn't seem to be much else there either than fun but since it's so far away for that level range not many people go.  Horde is off in Stone Talon/Thousand Needles/the south side of Ashenvale at that time.
---
Some people are trash
---
He's going to need some Holy Light for that burn
---
This is extra annoying as a hunter. 
---
"I have aggo. Ill run away from the tank to the back, right on top of the hunter who was mid aimed shot. "
---
Had more than one person die with a low hp mob on them i might have finished off had I been able to actually shoot it. Not to mentiom the person running away with their back turned to the mob isnt helping burn it down any faster. So you get a situation where 1 idiot has effectively nullified the dps of 2 people while also running away from the tank. Blows my mind when people do that
---
Yea it's called communication if everyone uses it these situations wouldn't occur but sadly a large portion of the player base is a bunch of nerds who lack simple communication skills
---
Good thing that not including the rank allows for the maximum rank.  Otherwise getting the (rank 3) into the /cast is going to really slow things down.
---
Is there an add-on that shows when an enemy is casting something but looks nicer like Quartz addon?
---
I'm amazed OP doesn't realize most DPS gear for warriors is going to be a mix of leather/mail/plate. 
---
Try explaining that to random rogues and hunters when you need on their BiS b/c it's your bis too.
---
I mean that depends heavily on your overall gear.
---
Do you meed more AP? Blackstone. Crit? Elven.
---
This is what I do. People have rolled need on a BOE in my groups before and they don't put the gear on. Usually the party is good about requesting them to put it on before continuing though.
---
Gz.
---
Because you're not being a cock gobbling asshole when you roll on something that's a genuine upgrade for them and is something they may not have another opportunity to get. You sound like the type of person who rolls or threatens to roll on BoPs for their vendor cost when your mindset on this is this fucked.
---
Healers can get away with being too low -- tanks cannot
---
What’s really funny is that the only argument against loot council I see here is “people are corrupt and will abuse it” and then they go to praise DKP as some perfect system
---
If a guild wants to be corrupt, they can be just as corrupt with DKP. Both systems are ruined by bad people
---
Just seems like an exaggeration imo.
---
Dinged 60 within the first two weeks of the game going live?  Possible, seems very unlikely. Not to mention, the remaining 4-6 weeks of being capped out he claims to not have any luck at drops.  Again, possible but not probable if at 60 he's presumably grinding instances.
---
I knew it had gotten bad, but reading these forums has *really* driven home how bad entitlement culture has gotten.
---
Seconding this.  Nothing you can’t be running at this point.   Start getting that pre-bis going.
---
Completely not true..... I tank constantly outside of raids and tank some fights on raids. I'm fury, zero points in prot. Your telling me I don't need gear for the role I fill in 70% of the groups I join? Dumb. As. Fuck. 
---
There are plenty of ele/resto or resto/balance resto/feral druids out there that heal in raids and groups but play the game to PvP ect. Shit stains like you are the reason there are zero tanks and healers in lfg, they don't want to to deal with you.
---
I've noticed this tanking in retail. Legion especially during Neltharion's lair, or Darkheart Thicket. You could skip some trash if you squeeze through a certain way but not everyone knew how, or sometimes slip by accident. I learned to always wait after every skip in case someone pulled. If not, we're good. But if they do it's no problem to pick them up. Better than sprinting ahead only to find our my healer is getting chewed on. I get it that after running a dungeon so many times you just want to get it done. But you only make it take longer when you try to solo the dungeon.
---
Tanks are the shortage. Most people tanking, now, are not specced specifically to tank. Mostly, you're probably not going to even be aware of this, because 60 dungeons are mostly pretty doable without being specced specifically for optimal roles. 
---
So, by default, tanks will find groups, and dps will have a harder time finding groups. You know what I do if a group is spamming for a tank and wants to get hyper specific about everyone's spec? I skip that group. It's easy, and it's almost always a good decision. If you want to control the entire party in pedantic detail, go multibox. 
---
Most classes have multiple specs. *All* healer and tank classes do. If you want to form a party with only dps, you are welcome to do that. 
---
Most druids don't actually care about *all* specs. They probably care about two. Same for warriors. They got a role they're filling for the group, and one they expect to raid as. They need gear for both. If you have expectations that they not roll on gear that they need, it is on you to convey that up front. If you do so, fine. If you don't, and are pissed off because of an idea in your head that you never shared with anyone else, you're the problem.
---
If I need it I roll it.
---
If I don't need it, I greed it.
---
Troll or huntard?
---
In classic, characters are SO much more powerful than they were in retail. Patch 1.12 is huge. We had to CC in patch 1.4 because characters were weak as crap, so we needed in. In TBC heroics, you needed it.
---
In 1.12 vanilla, you just didn't need it and we don't here, typically.
---
Sorry, old person here, forgot every kid has internet access on their phone and get 5x as bored in school, the age of ADHD.
---
You can’t/shouldn’t be doing 2 roles simultaneously. You do 1 role you get 1 share of loot. Not 2 shares of loot because you happen to be able to do 2 roles.
---
Shamans do have a weapon enchant that gives them bonus threat, and one of their shock spells does too. It seems like they were gonna be a true tank class, but kinda scrapped it halfway in.
---
Desolace is kind of spread out, but i skipoed the centaur stuff to mostly do the west and thought it was pretty goid in the late 30s.
---
Judging by that fishing pole, I'd say he's looking for some bait
---
Yeah, as long as you arent a white supremacist extremist mass murderer. Stay ignorant.
---
I play warrior.
---
If you have a good cell plan you could try tethering to your PC. It's how I play. I have TMobile and they let you tether up to 100GB month at no extra charge. I've played all month and only used about 10GB so 100GB is more than enough to play each month.

---
I mean, it says Thunderfury has 0 active alliance over 50, and only 304 inactive. Now, I'm not saying there's an overwhelming amount of 60s, but I log in 3-4 times a week and group with them most of those days, so it's clearly not working.
---
This was so me back in the day. Did a Druid because it sounded cool but I really never utilized bear or cat form because neither was interesting to me. I wanted to cast spells and heal. My 2nd character was a mage (after leveling my Druid all the way through BC) and I really enjoyed that. This time around I am a Druid again but feral. Kind of laughing at myself for how I played my Druid back then. Wasn’t efficient at all, but I still enjoyed it.
---
Got my book and doing ony tonight. Pumped to get this. First guild ony run so I hope we get it done.
---
Noob question but how does this questline start? Do you get an item which starts it from last boss in LBRS?
---
Too many people calling non-ninjas ninja. You're not.
---
Reserve the item you want. I bring 4 DPS warriors if I can....with a shaman...easiest, fastest clears possible.
---
Classic cast bars
---
We don't call those players raiders in my circles. We call them 'casuals'. 
---
But yeah you're right. I've personally found a ton of incredibly obnoxious players who basically brag about how they quit in cata and how easy the game is in retail, and then they die to avoidable damage or do some stupid shit that M+ and heroic+ raiding would have punished over and over and over until they got better, and the mechanic is like breathing. The players claiming that retail is easy die to shit that is required on every retail pull in the game.
---
The 'retail is easy' crowd are idiots who don't play retail, or they play retail at such a baseline capacity that their words mean nothing.
---
I've bound the marks to my keypad. It's in the keybinds. No addon needed.
---
Works like a charm.
---
We used this in vanilla my old guild and I think it was a great idea and it worked great. This gives if the guildies are serious a good chance to earn slowly if you are new.
---
Must say that they shouldn't be earning too much dkp each run though
---
Currently working on this https://ibb.co/JFtm3XR, it's much better now imo but I'm not near my pc
---
Never had any issues at all managing bag space/food costs with Cat. The upside is more than worth it.
---
&gt; Sure Reddit might cry about “corrupt loot council” but if the GM knows Jim the mage is a good player who won’t be going anywhere of course you’d want to feed Jim gear.
---
And this is what you said:  
---
" I don't think I've ever seen someone so shamelessly justify a guild giving all the loot priority to the GM and his officer friends before. Oh "
---
The only and single case anyone can be called a ninja if they went against established rule on a loot.
---
If no rule was establiahed you cannot be called a ninja.
---
In youre case he made assumption. Thats not establiahed anything. So youre not a ninja.
---
There is one more side version that happened. On the same item by 2 seperate people in UBRS.
---
1st scenario. Guy rolled need on recepie while everyone greeded. 2ppl needed. One was maxed in profession and had proof on the spot other didnt had anything and when prompted to pass up the item he left raid and ran out. That was a ninja.
---
2nd scenario. Recepie droped again and only 1 guy needed. No profession prio this time. Situation was explained that if you want for money, thats greed not need. After raidroll was prompted to give away the item and the reciver used addon to prove his compilance (some text linking). She wasnt a ninja, but the warrior tank raged that she still count as a ninja and unless i kick her out he leaves. So he left and appologized in whisper that he wont stay in a group whit ninjas.
---
This means that you cant paint the sky for a colorblind, you just have to weed out ppl using friends and ignores so eventually you will be sorrounded by like minded ppl and enjoy the game.
---
&gt;Do you meed more AP? Blackstone
---
What? It only gives 20 AP. Elven gives 15 agi which is 30AP and nearly 1% crit
---
I couldn’t get it to work so we just popped into team speak.
---
New warlock spell: suicide pact
---
There's a Paladin on my server, Golemagg and he is called this also.
---
You’re justifying shitty, greedy behavior. He lied and misled another player in order to make a monetary gain. It doesn’t matter if the sale actually went through or not. The intention to deceive was present. The act itself is textbook scam. If you can’t see that then maybe you need to take a step back and reevaluate your morals.
---
I think their healing spells heal for more, at least on higher level. Also, they actually benefit from spirit in combat and to a greater extent outside combat. But shamans have more utility and can boost damage for melee characters by 10-15%
---
Earthshock is also awesome, as is earthbind/tremor/grounding. The others see occasional use as well, and Mana spring is free mp5 as Long as you get 10 ticks worth - free Mana for all others. Chain heal is beautiful.
---
thank you man this is great
---
Sitting in the guild bank and handing them out to ppl that need them for crafting.
---
I thought it was WC3 Reforged!
---
Can you pm the discord link please?
---
It varies a lot depending on faction. Alliance side Daggers are a lot closer to Swords because of the lack of Windfury.
---
Also, it’s easier to get Daggers than Swords in dungeons and raids since you aren’t competing against Fury warriors
---
Spooky doesn't begin to describe the depravity of that toon.
---
Glowing hands for Beserker rage yeah
---
Bro pugs are wiping on fucking baron geddon.  You are delusional if you think naxx will be easy
---
Pugs can have fun lookong for a tank. I hesrd theres plenty of them. They can also ask their MT to tank their DM for them. I wont tank any pug unless they agree to pass on the book. I dont have a raodong guild so this is the best sword i can get
---
I have done a few full runs of east with no tome spawn so I assume all other wings of DM share the spawn and you just won't see it sometimes if you only do 1 section
---
Just try it.
---
but you clicked on it and took the time to make a comment post about it, how come?
---
No. You fight him up on the landing of the stairs to start, and at about 50% you drop down, heal, and hug the wall. There's a place you can then stand where the ads will get stuck trying to run around the stairs and will never aggro. After the kill you loot, stealth, and walk out. 
---
There's a video I watched to get the technique down but I can't link it as I'm at work. You could probably find it relatively easily on YouTube.
---
I tank I am fully aware of the tank shortage. I always announce that I am main spec rolling on dps items. I off spec roll on tanking items with any other druids/palys/war that want to off spec. I simply think doing more is greedy and wrong to the group
---
Yeah I was looking at benediction's pop.  I dropped wow for a month to handle exams and shit and, well 0 horde players seems like a touch of a stretch considering it was 50/50.
---
Always hit shit. As a caster when go from A to B, never be at 100% mana, move always to your next target, like backpaddeling. There is so much time in these little things.
---
Step 1 go to ah
---
Step 2 type in Taran Icebreaker
---
Step 3 reduce the cost of the lowest one by 1 gold
---
Step 4 Refer back to step 1
---
So while I wouldn’t say you are a ninja or what you did was wrong, for future runs I’d recommend telling people you’ll be rolling on fury gear if you opt into tanking the dungeon. 
---
The most common loot rules are main spec over off spec; and while fury is your main spec you joining to tank makes others assume that’s your main spec which causes these kind  of issues. Best way to avoid it is just to say hey guys I’m rolling for my main spec which is fury.
---
&gt;Get 5/5 armor of the fang and your cat form will do fine killing mobs regardless of where your talent points are.
---
This can be difficult if you are Alliance, and getting the set isn't too easy either.
---
&gt;If you want to level resto you'll be spending tons of time in dungeons . solo questing will be tough. play the game you want to play.
---
Even if you end up grouping most of the time, you'll generally still be doing a fair bit of solo questing and feral is great for that.
---
I liked all those quests in Uldum, had a real sense of adventure.
---
Doesn't really work with HOTW druids. I tank dungeons and heal in raids. I need for both specs, but I just say so in the group so they know.
---
Shield first as it mitigates damage while you figure out your scenario.
---
From there, fear, dot, and flay.  Or even fear first if you took a big hit so you can heal then shield when they come back.
---
A priest is nothing to mess with so I think you just need to get the hang of a good PvP rotation.  Maybe watch some youtube vids.
---
No rag acts like a rooted mob if the tank is not in melee range he attacks someone that is in range. If no one is in melee range he casts an AOE on the raid and you wipe
---
Horde??
---
And, if course, "please don't multishot immediately" followed by the immediate multishot which pulls the dark irons in gnomeregan who proceed to lay mines everywhere and next to everyone as you struggle to regain aggro since nothing is attacking you and only a couple people end up dead since most know to avoid the mines but since the healer is a druid it's time to walk back and clear the earlier respawns.
---
Go and be jealous somewhere else.
---
 How is a game that is more than a decade old, that was designed to be an RTS only, able to create better games than every mobile app in existence?
---
You seem to have to more toxic attitude to be honest. In dungeons you are either healing, tanking or dpsing. That’s one roll. You might be able to do multiple rolls but in that one instance you are their for one. That entitles you to one share of the loot. One main spec roll. You want dps items sure. You want healing items sure. Items of other specs are off spec and you should roll behind others that chose that for main spec. 
---
I tank. I follow the above rules for myself.
---
Verizon also has an unlimited plan as I assume most do. I used this to play while I hiked across Colorado last month.  They don't even have a 100gb cap they just threaten to throttle you after 12 or so which I've never noticed.
---
They’re pretty popular but any of the AH addons are almost mandatory imo. The base AH is so excruciatingly bad, I don’t know how anyone uses it without addons.
---
So frustrating how everyone wants to skip everything in dungeons. People getting pissy because I, as tank, pull a group of mobs that arent absolutely necessary. This is classic, lets chill. None of us are 60, this is good xp and loot...
---
No you are not a ninja the rogue is just a fucking retail sperg. End of story
---
Depends on context really.
---
A player not realizing that something isn't good for them is just ignorant or a noob. (Hunter winning Ravager, Rogue taking a caster dagger etc.)
---
A player taking something over another class when they have another much easier to attain option is an asshole. (Hunters with HoJ or Dal'rends, Rogue with Ironfoe etc.) Though that's the type of thing where I'll just make a mental note of the player before making a stink. That type of action has some level of justification, but it's still a reflection on the person's character imo.
---
Where's the incentive? Who in their right mind would join?
---
Ah, fuck, I'm on grob. What did we do this time?
---
I've also been asked to do plenty of BRD arena/anger runs and jed runs, people just spam who looking for dps sometimes and mages can give food, water, and portals
---
I think it’s because in 2004-2006, for the mass majority, gear was a means to an end, that end being dragon slaying. If they got to kill the bosses, it didn’t really matter what gear they had. 
---
Now, even the casuals see bosses as a means to an end, the end being gear.
---
I think that’s what it is, Rockbiter, I’ll be on the lookout but I think I’ve noticed that as a commonality, thanks!
---
Classic all the way for a new player. It's how most players got started with WoW, and many people's first MMO in general
---
So...when can we download it? OP plz.
---
Tank warriors actually want your daggers, so on horde side swords can actually be the simpler route, since most furys want axes.
---
You can try weak auras, should be able to track dots pretty easy! And very flexible for you.
---
People like that person are the exact type of people who loot council is meant to weed out
---
Anyone with that mentality about loot and raiding is probably gonna bail on the guild at the first sign of some better opportunity
---
And honestly it’s borderline theft by them essentially holding the item hostage in their mailbox. In my opinion this should be a reportable offense that is monitored by Blizz and repeat offenders should be punished accordingly.
---
On my server they were cheap, immediately jumped after the DM announcement due to speculators, then after DM released everyone dumped their stock and now they are cheap again. The supply far outstrips the demand at this moment. Ironically the only people who made money were the people who sold in the week before DM released.
---
Not your bro. Not seething. I just think you're dumb. 
---
Truth hurts.
---
Can ya get to them as a rogue?
---
No but it could also be avoided easily by stating that you will need for MS or OS during a run. Or both.
---
I’m a lvl 60 lock just trying to keep up in gold so I can have consumables for raiding. Anyone know of any good farming methods?
---
I’m going to try and do solo Mara runs but not sure if I can hack it while I’m DS/ruin spec, which my guild requires.
---
You can follow @bigfrodo or @tallfrodo on Instagram if you'd like.
---
Neither of them are me.
---
But you can follow them, if you like.
---
My outlook is "the tank pulled an unnecessary group, more exp for me".
---
South Park goo man reference?
---
Why and how though? No 500000 difficulties every guild has everything on farm already.
---
Wat
---
You gain something from armor. If you can cap armor, then keeping the Mark of Tyranny and dropping armor elsewhere is almost certainly a better idea.
---
&gt; If you get there and the OT is having threat issues, you can be sure he’ll get bumped up the priority list pretty quickly.
---
not in this guild, apparently.
---
So, flurry that gives a 30% attack speed boost off every critical strike isn't "natural attack speed steriods"? Hmmmmm......
---
Should be pretty comfortable in your 40's (or even at level 40... possibly sooner).
---
I say that high because it should allow you to absolutely stomp the mobs, as well as resist almost all of their spells! 
---
Good luck!
---
Yep - and I still remember that druid who couldn't rez because he "forgot" to buy the required reageant. We ended up wiping 3x, once was because he literally didn't say he was going afk. 
---
Guess what? I'll "forget" to invite you, ever again.
---
I assume enchanters can disenchant the version they are wearing, then pickup/equip the new one, right?
---
Wow, this is truly incredible. Great job.
---
Dont watch the video just report character stuck on blizz website, and they port you to west fall... because that needed to be a video
---
well ilvl affects the dps of the wpn, then slower weapons mean the base damage will be higher.  i know there's a 4.0 axe but the slowest staff at higher levels is 3.9.
---
Taking another hit ? There's a million worse posts on the sub, I hope you complain on every single one of them too
---
I think you lack the capacity
---
If you see somebody selling something on Trade and he/she's a bank alt, you're going to get gouged 10 out of 10 times.
---
The only way to see it (unless some add-ons I've not used do it) is to inspect them and mouseover their weapon - it should say which weapon enhancement they are using.
---
I don't see why any Enh shaman past 30 would not use WF, it's the iconic Enh ability (well there is SS, but WF is way cooler). Pre-30 they should use flametongue. Never rockbiter outside of solo play or when they intend to tank.
---
Sir I don't think you understand just how lazy I can be
---
I think you nailed it
---
People with the right mentality won’t care about loot council. People with a toxic “gimme the loot” mentality are the ones you don’t want in your raid anyway
---
You're looking at this from a retail perspective.
---
Goblins aside from Gallywix don't care about giant mansions, they just want profits. Why build something that costs money when a walled out post will work, especially in the desert? The goblin towns are mechanically minimalistic for a reason.
---
Azshara did need to get it's battleground but it's fine the way it is. A wild unconquered zone that houses ancient ruins and lore. We actually need more zones like this.
---
That's my 2 cents.
---
Just to build on this point, fury warriors are gear dependent. If you have pre-raid bis you'll stomp really hard. Your damage scales super well off your weapon, so as long as your weapons stay somewhat current, you'll do really well.
---
I missunderstood what you meant then because you said "the spec as a whole". My bad.
---
It's useful to do this from a standpoint of preventing ninjaing. But when we're talking like...3-5g? Feh. You can vendor BoP items for multiple gold. That's not a need. I've already had people need blue BoEs, and I'm fine with it. 
---
So long as you equip it, obviously. If you wait until everyone greeds, then need, and refuse to equip, then gold value be damned, you're up to no good.
---
It still should be. Shit happens. Repeat issues should be addressed. The statement implies a passive aggressive response that does nothing to improve the situation.
---
Learning some professions can be a drawback until later in the game when you have better access to resources. Being sarcastic and using hyperbole because you didnt bother to do research or ask somebody knowledgeable is still your own fault like it or not. Also the same idea does apply to some skills already. As the price to learn them increases the cost/benefit ratio of learning them massively decreases for certain skills and they become not worth learning the new ranks for basically every leveling guide will tell you that. And most ive seen will inform you about good professions to do while leveling to make some gold as you do.
---
Yeah and it sucks. Because the rogue can’t go without a tank. 
---
If you want to wear leather and dual wield why did u not just make a rogue?
---
I agree with you - I came into classic thinking "I can't wait to level in zone X or zone Y" but I think I was actually remembering the way it was in TBC. In patch 1.12 (ie, Classic), you mostly do a couple of quests then get stuck and go somewhere else.
---
Also, Alliance flight paths are pretty weird (e.g. Rebel Camp flight path in Stranglethorn hadn't yet been added, among other things).
---
Raids could be generically split into three loot distribution methods with some hybrids:
---
1. Free roll MS over OS like you mentioned above is favored by pugs. This is because you are basically one and done with the group. Leaves it up to RNG but also prone to losing out loot to something stupid like a try pally winning a BRE. 
---
2. Loot Council. One of the preferred methods of loot distribution to ensure that the proper pieces have the best impact. This is for guilds that raid as a group for months and know each other. It can go very wrong if you have bad leadership however. I wouldn’t recommend unless you trust the leadership or have talked with them on their methodology and reasoning. 
---
3. A point system is the final solution. This is typically done by assigning points to your contributions to the raid. Basically receiving points per kill or attendance. This can then be used to decide on who will receive the piece of loot and the assigned points to the loot will be subtracted from your sum. I prefer this if joining a guild I have no idea about since it can’t be rigged too bad without being blatant. 
---
All loot systems have their pros and cons for raiding and nothing is perfect. There will always be someone upset over something.  All in all raiding is about the 40 ppl getting together and having fun. Make sure you get to know the leadership and their philosophy on loot and raiding to have the best time. If you receive defensive behavior when asking clarifying questions then it’s a red flag.
---
This is the dumbest justification of DKP.  Raid of 40 people suffers because of one idiot
---
God, the playerbase in Retail just pushed me right off of the game subscription entirely by doing this shit. I got so fucking tired of waiting 45 minutes to get a M+ group that would actually take me along, just to get bitched out because they all start doing some wall-jump fuckery that I have no clue where to aim for to pull it off.
---
M+ pugs in general are just bottom of the fucking barrel for player entitlement and shit behavior. I can say without any exaggeration, the worst-of-the-worst for trolling griefing and abusive harassment, was all from M+ pug keyboard warriors that get their egos wanked by making other people's day worse.
---
I'm just glad that so far the Classic community is more approachable and friendly, because the Retail general population are barely above slathering animals.
---
Is this an undead on Kurinaxx? I've ran SM with him. I asked why the name and he responded "undead".. lmao.
---
BIS doesn't mean necessary and 400g is a pretty big chunk.
---
I'm at work so I don't have discord handy
---
[https://discordapp.com/invite/RbCZJtw](https://discordapp.com/invite/RbCZJtw) should be an up to date discord link, it appears to be working in my browser atleast.
---
Some quick googling brought it up on  [https://fightclub.academy/](https://fightclub.academy/) so that may also be a useful resource, it's where I got the link from
---
did you ARE parents not....
---
Why do I want to know who the top guilds in my server are? Because I think that'd be pretty cool information to know.
---
How? No idea
---
I also don't know what you are saying in the rest of that.
---
Can you just stealth and skip it as a cat?
---
vs flat 30% attack speed regardless? Good Rogues have perm. 30% Attack Speed from SnD. But regardless, it was a 2H Fury Warr from what I remember. I wouldn't care about DW Fury Warr rolling on it so much.
---
Tanks will roll on dps items for dungeons. That's simply a fact. Don't like it? Reserve the item.
---
In the end, the tank is doing you a service by tanking instead of being dps warrior #2942.
---
Dude, do you know that you have stealth?
---
Cash on Delivery - basically you send it to them and for them to take it from their mailbox they have to pay the price you set. The gold will be sent back to you directly instantly once they pick it up.
---
It will stay in their mailbox for 3 days before bouncing back to you.
---
Everyone understands that hybrids can and do play multiple roles. That’s not the point
---
If you want to roll for DPS gear as your main spec when you’re healing a dungeon then do it. Just communicate that X is your main spec and you will be need rolling on gear for that spec. That way the group knows that one more person will potentially be rolling for gear that they want and they can make an informed decision as to whether they are fine with that or would prefer to look for someone else. 
---
It’s not about entitlement or greed or anything, people should just communicate things like that when forming a group so everyone can make informed decisions about building that group.
---
Not saying it's not easier for a lot of it, but there are a lot of humanoids and a lot of agro drops. The butcher comes to mind...and the second he gets off me there's no time to get threat back because someone's dead. 
---
At least he doesn't hit the stun/agro drop often. Same for the skellies and the Ravenian.
---
That and also There Will Be Blood reference
---
There is an addon called "epic hard boss encounters for Classic".
---
To activate this mode, press the big button on the front of your monitor just as the encounter starts. The boss will cast a blindness debuff on you when you do this. 
---
The higher item level loot will only drop if you only click your abilities throughout the boss fight, despite having the blindness debuff.
---
I’m pretty sure if you’ve ignored someone you don’t see what they say in any chat including party, raid, or any general chat.
---
Is this vuhdo? What plates are you using to show casts and mp5 ticks?
---
You understand a majority of your healers and tanks ar t even spect for that right? If you guys are in a Guild and raiding of course but not in dungeons. You pretty much have a beef with every single Warrior tank because they usually tank to roll on fury gear. Followed by ret palys healing to roll on ret gear. Filling a role is filling a role.
---
*~~^(accused)~~* Caught
---
A group begged me to heal LBRS on my druid at 52. I told them I was too low, but it was a friends guild group that was doing it so I joined anyway. It actually went okay until the troll area, then the tank went out of LoS and I had to run in to heal and aggroed the room. Then I got a lecture from the tank about how I’m too low for LBRS and I need to watch my aggro range. I was hot.
---
Do mages really need FR potions against Rag since they have their flame ward and IB spells?
---
I don’t think you have ever been in a loot council guild.  At least one that was half decent. Everything you said here is pretty much false
---
Make sure they're not using rockbiter weapon. But even if they're not; Shaman have high variance in their damage so tanking for them is unpredictable. Sometimes their first swing is a big windfury proc and they're going to steal aggro.
---
The consensus is you don't *need* to switch to prot spec unless you're tanking in raids. While leveling you're better off staying in a DPS spec.
---
It’s doable as a freshly dinged 60 holy priest. You can do it, but it might take a few attempts to get it down.
---
Not what I meant. I mean there's 3x opportunity for Warrs to get armor. I only have 1. This BIS mentality is fucking toxic. I already have to roll against Druids, Enh Shamans, and other Rogues. Now Warriors too.
---
Ding! Fries are done
---
Get boots speed enchant if you're farming princess, it's too annoying otherwise. You should look up a guide as one of the main techniques to slowing down princess is to try and path her to awkwardly go around the small and large rocks, slowing her down and letting you kite her at max range.
---
Met a tauran named "gorbachomp"
---
You can just add "friends" via their in game name, but its just for that character on that server and they dont have to "approve" it. 
---
If you are talking about Battle Net Friends (i.e. Real ID) then yes, they have to confirm it before you can see them.  This should only be done if you know the person IRL, or apparently for me, anyone from vanilla regardless if I knew them IRL or not. lol.)
---
Only if you talk to the Observer, no?
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/farmlog
---
Definitely not a ninja move, just you getting yours and that rogue being immature and impatient. Congrats on the cape!
---
Immersion broken, literally unplayable.
---
&gt;I'm not sure you have been in enough guilds to reliably know what "most" loot councils do.
---
Almost all of them in my 20 years of raiding across almost a dozen different MMOs have been shady and untrustworthy. Its exceedingly rare to find a loot council that operates with any degree of transparency.
---
OP acknowledges that most people take issue with loot councils. Most people have a problem with loot councils because they've had bad experiences with them. It's not a stretch to assume that most loot councils are problematic since such a large swath of the community seems to take issue with them. The assumption that most loot councils are dishonest or unfair matches my personal experience. Maybe your experience is different, but based on community consensus that would make you the outlier.
---
I'm a DS/Ruin lock.  I tried doing the Mara princess farm for gold, but I failed during the princess part.  Is it possible to do without nightfall procs from affliction?  Which pet should I sacrifice?  I tried sending in the void to tank the princess before saccing him but it wasn't enough.
---
That's not a hard choice at all, if you are aware of how unique Mark of Tyranny is. Not taking it basically permanently screws over your tanking ability.
---
Reserving is a lot less exclusionary than just not inviting all warriors. Plenty of warriors might already have the specific item that you need, or are just there to get a quest done. It is clearly the superior option for all parties involved.
---
However, plenty of people are ignorant assholes about it, so to avoid whining in LFG/World it might be better to just go `LF1M caster dps`. Keep in mind, though, that mages typically aren't very interested in Armory, for example.
---
Only Cod mats that aren't super high price.
---
53 warrior here. Hang in there bud, we got this.
---
Just make sure you know whats good or not. I find alot will give out none BIS ei netherwind crown to other mages so they can gear their friends with arcanist helm. Give everyone else the garbage tiers and give their friend boot/helm/wrist combo. Trick people with purples not even better than their blues like oh look you got lots of gear thats useless lol.
---
You do realize that rogues need more than 9% hit, right? Hit cap for a rogue is upwards of 20%
---
That trinket is one of the best available for rogues because of the hit and ap.
---
Thanks for the downvotes, uneducated players. Do some research about your class.
---
Female dwarfs are incredibly OP, them braids are nothing to mess with.
---
Druid healer here, I love HellFire as long as the lock gives me a heads up that they are going to use it. Or just AOE in general for that matter. Communication.
---
Anyone who is dissatisfied by loot council because they didn't get all the loot first week is a toxic raider that I wouldn't want in my guild anyway.  Someone like that will probably quit the game or bail to a better guild after he uses all his DKP on some coveted item
---
Not a shame ignore but had a shame leave group, had a tank and 3 dps (no hybrids at all) but dude kept spamming lf1m dps ready to go even though we kept saying we have no healer, then he invited a mage then we kept saying we have no healer then he just dropped the group.
---
If you're going to use the item and it's not reserved, you roll on it. Everything else is splitting hairs to manipulate others into giving them what they want.
---
No I have a problem with people that don’t communicate. 
---
I don’t care if you’re going to roll on Ret gear if you’re healing the dungeon. But you should say that you’re going to do so beforehand so the group can make an informed decision about keeping you. 
---
Here’s an example of what I’m getting at. A group comprised of a Shaman healer, Warrior tank, Rogue, Fury Warrior and Mage are running BRD for Angerforge. Warrior tank and Shaman healer say nothing. Hand of Justice drops and Warrior tank, Shaman healer, Rogue and Fury Warrior roll on it. Are the Shaman and Tank Warrior ninjas? Probably not. Would the Rogue and Fury Warrior have joined a BRD group with 4/5 people rolling for their BiS? Probably not. 
---
(Or, since you seem to be a Ret Paladin, consider the exact same situation with a hunter instead of the rogue and the Savage Glad Chestpiece.)
---
The point is, most people will be fine with it because we appreciate the need for hybrids to tank and heal. But, you too need to be cognizant that having potentially two other people rolling on the same loot may change someone’s mind about joining the group and spending potentially an hour or two of their time as well
---
They have done that in the past? How does that work?
---
Ohh so this is what RP kids think about 🥴
---
What about guild chat? Probably the same, just wanna make sure
---
Yeap Yojamba and Argual. At some point surely they will both be low pop and they will think about merging them?
---
Meanwhile I have the ring on my mage because it’s unique and everyone else in the group had it.
---
How come people never do Lethtendris in jump runs? Only 1 trash pack and then another stealthed satyr on the way up to her and the imp. Just more guaranteed loot and a Dusty Tome spawn location by her. Is she just not as easy to 2-man as the other bosses?
---
Sure, priest buys it for however much it sells for on AH off whoever wins the roll. They’re just being greedy with their gold otherwise, right?
---
Especially if you're a druid or a shaman with 4 specs.
---
dont they need 5% hit for an equal level opponent.
---
Nah zoth
---
That's vanilla for ya
---
The thing that irks me and I don’t why is the people riding around looking for the one mob type they need to kill not understanding that they spawn as groups. For example if you need to kill wolf in western plaguelands and you can’t find any then you really should kill the spiders and bears because a wolf will never spawn and these people just keep running around with no clue. I would tell but every time it has happened it was the opposite faction. 
---
If you want a great strategy find an area with the mob you need that is a bit off and kill all the mobs there usually about 5-6 depending on your level by 6 one you should start to get respawns. Always kill the quest mob first then kill the others again. Repeats this until the quest is done. I guarantee this will be the fastest way rather then roaming around for an hour.
---
IDK. But I can tell you they won't make you delete characters, because that has never happened or will happen
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CqpGfWrmc4
---
That's about the classic experience right there. I remember being a night elf and levelling for days in Ashenvale, the whole time I periodically spammed for a BFD group.
---
Nah that sounds stupid
---
If you want to heal, then yes. But only their tiered gear.
---
This was one of the mysteries of private realms development. In all my years of researching there was no conclusive evidence or list every produced.  There was a scaling system that we did no about in terms of some debuffs were protected (like sunder armor) and others had different rankings of priority to stop them being knocked off.    
---
I am 99% certain the exact list of priorities was never released, and if anyone can prove me wrong I would love to know.  Private realms emulated this with a two/three tier priority system that was custom set and far from accurate.  
---
The issue I believe is there are simply so many debuffs in total that making a list would be impractical, when you consider the number of items that apply debuffs and the total number of raw spells. The best I could fins (IIRC) was there were a handful of protected debuffs such as sunder and warlock curses, the next tier was class abilities (this group could have separate priories but not sure, and finally item procs which would be pushed off the table first.  
---
Its been maybe 5 years ago when I was researching this, and I honestly found almost nothing, just speculative comments on old forums and websites.
---
I do love some abusive behavior with my inflated dps indeed
---
for real though you guys gotta get your head out of your ass one day or another and understand that some people have different sources of enjoyment or priorities than yours
---
They might not stack I don't know for certain, could be that the imp buff is just stronger than fortitude. I just know for certain that keeping a warlock for imp buff is worth it and almost all guilds do it.
---
Yeah spec is pretty important, if you have Cold Snap a decent macro is to use it (/cast cold snap) and then immediately follow up with either a Frost Nova, Ice Barrier or Ice Block since those are the frost spells that you usually want to follow up with that have long cooldowns. 
---
Just find what you feel comfortable with, in my experience I needed the Cold Snap + Ice Block macro the most, I had it right next to my normal Ice Block spells so that I could immediately 'oh shit' my way out of aggro if my IB was down. 
---
I didn't use Cold Snap as much for CoC, Frost Nova or Ice Barrier since the cooldowns for these are like 20-30seconds anyway.
---
Snapjaws are turtles. They drop turtle meat.
---
Yep. But you see at the down votes. They don't want to ask, they prefer the rude roll, implying everyone is aware of how they think a multi class is "allowed" to roll on gear, no matter how they're skilled or if they ever will even use it.
---
&gt;why would you wear leather when you can wear plate
---
I hate hearing this kind of shit from groups. I've had mages get pissy at me for rolling on +healing cloth gear because it isnt mail or plate
---
I'm enjoying classic but this is partly why I'm hoping for BC+ or even better Wrath+. Having only two classes capable of tanking on horde side significantly limits the tank pool. I'd play the fuck out of DK tank in Wrath again. I might even be down to pally tank in BC, but no way I'd play a rage tank
---
If you CoA a sheep, just throw a different curse on them before the first tick!
---
Adding support for automatically pulling prices from TradeSkillMaster (TSM) would make this addon god tier! :)
---
And then when you've given Jim the mage priority over everyone else because he's friends with the GM, then
---
* Your other raiders leave, because they're not here just to gear up Jim and want more than just table scraps
---
* Jim starts bringing his alt and it's all pointless anyway
---
No-one raids for months on end for zero loot, feeding gear to Jim above everyone else just means he gets burned out or brings an alt, and it means everyone else gets pissed off.
---
At 8 skill, your miss chance is 5.7% so your hit cap is 6% the same as at 5 skill. You do get a little benefit from 8 skill over 5 skill against bosses because it reduces the glancing blow penalty. 
---
Against a boss (level 63) you have a 40% chance for a white-hit to be a glancing blow. This chance is unaffected by weapon skill. However, weapon skill increases the damage your glancing blows deal. 
---
Weapon skill (base 300) | Glancing blow damage vs L63
---
---|---
---
0| 65% of normal damage
---
+5| 85%
---
+8| 93%
---
+10| 95%
---
+15| 95%
---
So the extra 3 weapon skill ends up being about a 3.2% (.4 * .08) increase in your auto-attack damage when fighting bosses. 
---
[Source](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill)
---
For me 40-45 is worst. :P 40 feels so significant I just stop for a while.
---
I’ve consistently stayed throughout this thread that this applies to BoE gear, NOT BoP. Stop trying to conflate the two discussions you absolute smooth brain.
---
Theres a lot the fact that its inherently unfair for some classes. If theres barely any druids in raid, they could get all their tier for barely any dkp at all and save up all their points for cross class stuff like weapons or accessories. While several priests have to spend way more to fight out their tier gear and have very little if any for any other pieces.
---
Theres also the problem with people not spending any dkp at all and would rather be a liability than lose out on getting their favorite weapons.
---
Confirmation bias?
---
Would be good to note that at least some of these are PServers screenshots, so the spawns might be a bit off. 
---
DM North 2 - the monster skeleton doesn't look like that in Classic. I've passed him plenty times on my hunter during tribute solo runs and looked around him for a dusty tome, and there is a full spinal cord on the ground along with other bones, not solely a skull. Also, in Classic there's a 4 mobs pack surrounding to the brazier in the background, while it's empty on this screenshot.
---
DM north 3 screenshot is also not from Classic. Gordok's sword has no shiny enchantment effect on it. Can't really say for the rest, haven't run the other wings yet. All of these pictures look surprisingly dark to me by the way, although that might be a console configuration. 
---
Am I the only one who gets extremely few tomes ? Saw only one behind the last boss of DM north in about 15 runs, none at the rest of the spots (I looked in the PServer locations).
---
I've given up mods literally don't enforce that rule at all they should delete it.
---
Rogue here as well--it sucks but the popularity of fury warriors means more dungeon tanks. If fury dps was lower than rogue dps, a lot of those guys would've rolled a rogue. Without them, it'd take just as long to get all that gear because there'd be more rogues and less groups out there for us to join.
---
Hilarious. When I played prior to the talent changes fury warrior was seen as a meme spec and were miles behind rogues.
---
"Kind", "Not malicious"
---
He's literally justifying screwing over a raid for the sake of an officer clique. You're ridiculous, and when your argument boils down to just throwing out insults then I'm not gonna waste time bothering.
---
I just threw up in my mouth out of envy
---
grats scumbag :)
---
Yeah NW isn't the best, but it was a significant upgrade over my previous helm while the other mages already had some pre-raid BiS helm or Arcanist Crown already.
---
It was literally the second epic mage helm that dropped over our 2~ MC/1 Ony run so I'm really happy with it since I'd like to go for the T2 set somewhere down the road when BWL comes out. 
---
&gt;Trick people with purples not even better than their blues like oh look you got lots of gear thats useless lol.
---
This doesn't happen too often since you can ask for items if you want them, if you don't want a useless epic you just let someone else have it then express interest in something you do want.
---
I believe that if no one wants an item then it goes to the wider raid, or it goes to rolls, or just whoever expresses interest in it assuming no one wants (e.g. Vendorstrike for memes).
---
Other times we just DE the equipment, right now our guild enchanter has 2 pieces of Druid T2 and 1 piece of T1 (Waiting on Nexus crystals) because no one wanted them.
---
ya, I am trying to figure this out as well
---
Hey! How is Kirtonos btw? I have some friends on there but im on faerlina atm. They want me to switch realms but im afraid that it wont be busy enough in 3-4 months etc. Could you let me know how u find it?
---
 I wonder what the entry date is.. cause it's vague as fuck.
---
Definitions need more elaboration.
---
There is of course errors. They may not be grammatically, in this case it's how vague they made it.
---
Stance hasn't changed.
---
There is subjectivity 🤷‍♂️
---
I just really cant wrap my head around that. Taking an extra 10 seconds to ask and be polite saves so much headache and costs nothing
---
Then I must consider this... An act of Arthas.
---
Now you have to share the addon..
---
Yes pvp means only one faction per server if u delete or move ur character to another server u would be able to play horde
---
Tribute runs?
---
There's two type of players indeed, the asses and the ones i dont mind playing with. Funnily enough the first type are all so sure about playing "the right way" they cant seem to shut up about it
---
My favorite was the AV token gear. A sword called "the unstoppable force". A shield called "the immovable object".
---
As someone who is not a healer but has done BRD runs a million times for my guild's healers: Y'all are both right. You can see it both from the Coffer Chest and the 7D chest.
---
The Vast Majority of wipes ive experienced is playing with people that arent from retail.
---
So report them.
---
probably mage x2 or something. or priest warrior? priest mage?
---
They do enforce it frequently. I have only seen 1 high profile case where they didn't.
---
Right now this post currently doesn't show up, but that's most likely due to not having flair.
---
&gt;At some point surely they will both be low pop and they will think about merging them?
---
Maybe they will, but I don't see it happening any time soon considering they're mostly at high/full at the moment.
---
But there will be no way that Blizzard asks you to delete a character, I've never heard of that happening before.
---
People will start to learn that in classic, your reputation and network on the server are important to success and enjoyment.
---
Warlord Goretooth in Kargath tower, he has a dialog option you need to click through before he shows ! mark.
---
They don't get it. Bears get no parry, no block and cannot shield wall. Crushing blows are their biggest enemy in later tanking (MC and Ony are pretty much 5 mans with 40 people, BWL and later will wreck them).  
---
With dire bear's armor increase being percentage based, a couple armor rings, trinkets and a warden staff can actually put them damn near armor cap all by themselves and itemization for armor on items are worth about 4x the damage reduction other classes get from the same armor.  
---
You can easily make up the rest of your stats with other slots, but until they hit that DR cap, armor is one of if not the most important bear stat.
---
Highly desired but your loot is few and far between.
---
He possibly wasnt trying to resell yours, he could have also had one to sell and he essentially removed competition from the market for 3 days.
---
Upvoted out of spite.
---
Yep. Also, it doesn't hurt and can result in friendships, while the other method will result in anger on both sides.
---
Is it enforcing it if it's after 6 hours?  Cuz kinda defeats the purpose.
---
That's not an "i"
---
Did someone say Tribute runs?
---
I'm a hunter, so I'm used to competing with everyone for gear. I assume that everything I want from a dungeon is going to be rolled on by someone else anyway. I'd rather have a tank that rolls on the same gear I need than no tank at all. I understand your bad RNG luck as well. I didn't win a single piece of dungeon loot until level 55.
---
There you go again putting words in people's mouth. Noone said jim the mage should get evrry piece of loot for months on end. Noone. Youre assuming all this bullshit.
---
All he did was lay out one scenario where one player got one piece of loot over another one player once. 
---
Im done with you like this isnt an argument. This is just toxic delusional drivel. Youre arguing with some bullshit in your head, not what was actually said.
---
I wouldn’t say this is witch hunting.
---
Tank scholomance and get the Deathbone set. Scholomance is amazing xp. Other option is farm lbrs for the ubrs key (3 gems).
---
You can tank either no problem as fury as long as you have decent gear and a patient group for the first run (so you can learn the pulls and whatnot).
---
Was doing HOJ runs with my guild had 1 person needed arena said the boss I need wouldn't spawn then he did followed up with well no way he will drop what I need then savage gladiator chest drops. Boss just had to prove me a liar it was also the first time I ever saw him spawn.

Type of guild desired: "Hardcore Casual" / "Hardcore".     
---
Experience: End game raiding in Vanilla / TBC.  Made it to Thaddius in Naxx. Have not touched WoW again until Classic release.  
---
Desired raid times: Anything after 8pm server time and week days. Ideally we would like to join a guild that is currently running two raids for MC and fill in as alternates on an as needed basis since we cannot commit to 100% attendance.  If you feel like your guild meets that criteria, please touch base!

Tbh ldarkspearboi, posting here for internet points dose not do any thing good for your psyche. It’s best to learn how to be humble when it comes to doing something good on your own. 
---
There’s nothing better then being humble about a situation that your doing good in rather to post it on the internet for people to praise you for. It’s a condition we all pretty much live with and a need to fill this want of approval.

I honestly congratulate you and hope you bring these social accomplishments to the people in your everyday life.

maybe i worded wrong, but i have as stated 0 clue about any of the melee classes in vanilla, and i do a TON of the game content (as much as i possibly can).   I dont mind down time, i do mind being "useless" in game content.

It's actually BiS until Black Temple in late BC.
---
Layers are almost gone and low lvl zones are almost empty. Leveling an alt now and questing is bliss.
---
Look up Dire Bear. Your numbers are all wrong.
---
Ahh interesting didn’t realize holy priests could do it. I’ll have to let my friend know.
---
Is he naming a person or guild and talking about them negatively?  If so it's against this subs rules.
---
It's more like "If we all greed on this BoE epic worth 200g then someone will almost certainly ninja it to sell on the AH, so let's just all need." Kind of like a Prisoner's Dilemma.
---
This isn't a thing for vendor trash greens/blues because nobody is going to ninja for 5g and get kicked from the group when they can just greed and probably make more than 5g by the end of the dungeon.
---
To me it seems healing has to be the easiest role to play in wow is that true? I only ever dps and tanked before
---
Make friends with a rogue and do stealth DM: North tribute runs
---
The two prot spec tanks are really both the "main tank" since so many bosses require 2 tanks or require two geared, prot spec tanks. 
---
For me and my other MT, I focused mainly on threat while he's more about mitigation. That means that I can get the big threat up front that we need to ensure dps does not pull threat (they will pull threat against pure mitigation geared tanks - we're horde side and they are pushing top 5% dps parses), while he's more about max mitigation to ease healer mana. In practice he takes about 5-10% less damage than me, but I do significantly more threat usually. This works out nice as we can prioritize different pieces. Helm of Wrath for example, is largely a mitigation / stam piece. I passed that to him, and I'm working on getting Lionheart helmet (amazing helmet for threat). Similarly, since I'm using the +hit pre raid bis belt, I passed on might belt to him, but I got the might gloves first since they have +hit. I also got the Band of Accuria (15 agi, 10 stam, 2% hit ring) from rag first. It balances nicely.
---
Once both of us have a good item in a slot, we pass that slot on to our 3rd tank (also prot, but doesn't have to be). Once he's geared we'll send stuff to our dps warriors.
---
My thoughts on your current situation - try to negotiate something like what I've laid out above. Be the second "main tank". There is no shame in this. Tank gear drops abundantly in MC / Ony; you will be in 5 piece in 2-3 weeks easily, even if your other tank gets first shot at everything. 
---
Blind bidding is one method of doing DKP. I personally hate it. The only DKP system I will use has set values for pieces, though we currently do loot council.
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but according to FAQ on the [Rogue Classic](https://discord.gg/n9rgwz)  discord, “If your weapon skill is 305, that delta between weapon skill and defense is gone and the hit modifier is no longer in place, making the yellow hit cap 8%. In addition to 305 weapon skill negating the hit modifier, it was also determined that it gives you +2% hit making the yellow hit cap 6%.” With precision added on top of this, you should only need 1% hit from gear to reach the yellow hit cap.
---
So why would +4% hit from gear be necessary?
---
If Im not completely off with my math, I was earning up to 5g on a good run, and 1 run takes maybe 20-25 min max. 
---
Its not the worst way to farm a BiS item. 
---
I wish you fortune with the stats roll :)
---
Mans out here just tryna get buffed haha
---
All the rogues are salty this time around.
---
Azshara is super empty for sure. 
---
I wish the darkshore quest line about massive skeletons dead on the shore was continued. It feels like it was meant to lead to something, but was sort of unfinished. 
---
Hyjal or whatever. The zone you can get to from the pass via spawning on the other side of the door. It's all mapped out, just unfinished. 
---
The whole Wildhammer clan thing. Not only is the zone light on quests, there's an entire faction there. A faction that doesn't really matter much. Centaur factions don't matter much either. It'd be cool if they did. 
---
Dalaran. No, not the later dalaran, the purple bubble itself. It'd be fun if there was more to it.
---
get gud noob

How good is the sword from the Tinkerer goblin in Mara for a mage?

Always LFM and create your own group, often much easier

If ur actually multi-boxing? Shaman

It's also turning your mana into more mana than before. Your mana vs more mana
---
You sound like an alliance crybaby, anyone I kill it is a one and done - move on.  Heck how many alliance walk by me and just 1 shot me I cannot even count but they usually just move on and I just laugh.    I never camp anyone to try and ruin their whole gaming night.  I killed some he killed me all fair on a pvp server.   But he decided to camp me.  Camp away - bedtime.  If you want to call jumping up and down cheating then so be it.  His would be called griefing and blizzard frowns on that also.

#**&lt;Tribute&gt;**
---
    Horde | Whitemane (PvP-PST) | Wed/Thu 8pm-11:30pm PST | Semi-hardcore | Loot council
---
This isn't the greatest guild in the world, no. This is just a &lt;Tribute&gt;. Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh! :)
---
Our main goal for &lt;Tribute&gt; is to foster a fun gaming community of like-minded and social players who put the needs and success of the team above their own. Our raids are relaxed, but focused - we get shit done. We prioritize loot and invites with the goal of gearing up efficiently, clearing content swiftly, and no drama. We're all adults here and many of us have families and/or demanding careers, so we want to be strategic in getting the most out of our game time. We think having fun with friends is critical to the overall success of the guild, and host "Game Nights" once every 4-6 weeks or so; Game Night normally includes some form of intoxication and free online games like Cards Against Humanity, Jackbox Games, etc.
---
**Expectations**
---
We'll expect you to bring your best, strive to be knowledgeable about your class, never be afraid to ask questions, accept and give feedback graciously, improve the experience of the team, and be social &amp; have fun. If you like our philosophy and want to be part of our team, then read on. Even if you aren't interested in raiding, social members that fit with our culture are always welcome to join and hang out, level, PvP, and/or farm with us.
---
**Raid schedule**
---
Our regular raid times are Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00pm-11:30pm PST (ends earlier on farm nights). This means we start pulling at 8:00pm so you'll need to be online, at the instance, with consumes, ready to go by 7:45pm. We will have other guild events such as group farming , PvP, 20-mans, old 40-man content, and/or GDKP runs on Saturdays. Our loot system is described in more detail on our discord.
---
**Interested?**
---
Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/yZfrb8S, read things, and chat with us!
---
What difference does it make?  All of these so called counter points originate in the samr .place and  are only created by doing one thing - attempting to skip mobs.   
---
Skipping mobs is for experienced players and guild runs,. For everything else just take the 30 seconds to kill the damn thing.
---
As long as healer is drinking, should be just fine pulling everything but a boss? If not then y’all are struggling hard and might need better groupies.
---
Yea man run scholo, strat, and Lbrs for pre BIS gear. You’ll hit 60 in no time. I did this as a healer, between strat and Lbrs, plus the quests, I went from 59-60 in 4hr 20min /played.
---
Watch perplexity v monkeynews
---
Yeah spoke to some others as well who were having the same issue, so not sure if it was prats interaction with another addon we all happend to have or how I had it set up. But prat was definitely the root cause. I one by one disabled add-ons until the issue went away. Hopefully it gets fixed cause otherwise I'd recommend prat.
---
And once you do the skip a few times, you don't asspull mobs. So OP is just doing skips when everyone is learning skips rather than 6 months in when it becomes commonplace to skip as much as possible because no one actively wants to spend 1 hour pulling literally every single pack in a dungeon when you can clear it in 30 and skip mobs.
---
The casual playerbase of /r/classicwow LOVES to whine about literally anything that "dem retail boys" do because apparently being efficient with your time is bad?
---
I did my first corpse camping yesterday (also Herod Horde). I was riding through Ashenvale to get to a moonwell and saw 2 alliance in their 40s killing 2 horde in their 20s. I killed both alliance, but not until after the 2 horde had been killed. The low level horde invited me to a party and I camped the alliance players corpses until my little horde buddies could res and get to a safe distance.
---
Nope. You good fam
---
The time spent getting to her lowers your gph. You want to be hitting 12-13 minute runs as the real money maker comes from the thorium veins at the end.
---
&gt;  Everyone thinks you have to speed run and blast through the dungeon in the least possible time.
---
No, rushers have always existed in Wow.  They have always been a disease, they have always been convinced that they are right, and they have never had a rational justification for their behaviour, besides wanting to obtain gear that is inaccessible to as many other people as possible, so that they can AFK in capitals for people to gawk at on their mounts.
---
On the other hand, it's that kind of pulls that are the most fun imo.
---
No worries, I watched it last night and he goes into good depth. There’s a summary of the gold per hour close to the end of the video.
---
I believe he did 3 seperate farming sessions, each consisting of 12 resets.
---
I don't know how or why but seeing this jumpscared me shitless... do I have some sort of deep innate fear of dwauren?
---
yes you do lmfao. otherwise ur gnna keep fighting for loot vs different 6 people rather than the same 6 people. if same 6, they can already have the item u need so ur chance of getting loot goes up
---
I'm pretty certain multiple people made that argument and even got significant upvotes in one of my [dumb meme posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dcq39q/let_us_not_resort_to_our_baser_instincts)
---
There are better swords/daggers available for mages.
---
It's not terrible if you get it while leveling and going through Mara, but I wouldn't farm it at 60.
---
Weird. I get 1-10 per session since week 2. Many this last weekend.
---
Did a few guild runs yesterday, we had it drop like 3 times in a row. The grind was not as hard as we expected.
---
What? Rogues get 15 AP from 15 agility.
---
No downsides no, but just think how it applies to your talent spec and the poisons you use.
---
Hunters are one of those classes that have a high skill cap. Easy class to pick up for solo and new players but controlling that tarded ai pet is what makes a good hunter shine.
---
Skill and know-how.
---
Screenshot or it didn't happen.
---

---
You're still dodging the fact that what you are describing is a greed scenario for everyone except the guy needing a car.
---
Man, your interventions made me realize that this whole dichotomy would be instantly resolved if rolling Need would automatically make ANYTHING soulbound to whoever gets it.
---
This would solve SO many problems.
---
I didn't, I ended up holding them for a while and once I didn't see any more go on the AH I learned the plans myself on my Armorsmith, made one and posted it on the AH for 1500g. As far as I know I am still the only one who is able to make these for my faction on the server. I have since sold a couple and crafted a couple more for others who supplied the materials and a not so small crafters fee.....
---
One thing you should mention is that Sword spec shows as sword spec dps on the right but doesnt actually add any dps to the total dps output. Like this sheet doesnt even really consider how talents on arms affect dps lol.
---
So you got carried by your higher lvl grp? Not saying you did absolutely nothing period but levels and hit really matter, especially when dungeons are long af and wipes can lead to groups disbanding quick.
---
I'd wager the last boss was messy if you aren't lying.
---
Honestly just power through with mage. Farm some ZF till 52 then go to brd and collect some gear while leveling it gets better
---
Why didn’t you roll? I’m sure you had a green and blues are always an upgrade
---
You notice the one time it fails and you have to spend 5-10 minutes rezzing etc.
---
You don't notice the 50 times it works out and you saved 2-3 minutes not killing the pack.
---
Yes, it sucks when things fail, but over time you'd be spending a LOT more time in dungeons if you didn't streamline your routes.
---
cell phones
---
That looks like something Peach from Super Mario 64 would wield.
---
He straight up said that Jim the mage and all the other GM friends/clique would get all pieces of prime loot, all the rare drops and important pieces.
---
That was his whole argument, one that you don't seem to have been able to read.
---
&gt;Im done with you like this isnt an argument. This is just toxic delusional drivel. Youre arguing with some bullshit in your head, not what was actually said.
---
This coming from the guy who's got nothing but insults to offer?
---
Interesting, that’s a fair point.
---
I actually just trained swipe at this level after not hitting a trainer for a long time so I’ll have to play with that a bit.
---
Thank you!!! I will take at look at that!
---
I remember wishing that there was player collision in old school AV so that you couldn't just run past the main battle line on your mount unless there was a concerted flank. I know that's not in this game but AV was always my favorite BG.
---
Yep, I tank ~10 minute runs, esp with the trash skip on the last boss. Can easily make 100+ gold per hour from the arcane crystals alone, depending on RNG.
---
The problem is finding a group, and then finding a group that actually wants to stick around for 5 runs
---
I'm using the hypnotic blade and the celetial orb offhand. The blade dropped last night, but I passed on it since I figured I already have +21 spl dmg with my current set up, but I kinda regret it. I'm lvl 51.
---
&gt;He's literally justifying screwing over a raid for the sake of an officer clique.
---
Always always shield. It's your best move, it stops pushback while casting too. So if your going to cast with them in range do it when bubble is up. If they pop the bubble before you can cast it again then fear and get distance and bubble asap so the debuff is gone by the time he gets to you and you can continue to cast while they hit you because there is no pushback while bubble is up. Mind flay until mindblast is off cooldown.
---
Yeah most of the time, especially as a ranged, you should be moving forward to make sure the mob you aggroed still gets aoed down and/or can be aggroed back by your tank.
---
We can take turns DEFEATING HIM IN A DUEL
---
I don't care who you are or what your backstory is, the generally accepted rule is that tanks roll on tank items, dps roll on dps items and healers roll on healer items, unless otherwise stated once the group has formed.  It's so easy to ask if you can roll on this or that, preferably as soon as you see someone in the group who will want it too.  Most of the time they will say of course np because tanks are so hard to come by and 70% of them will be respeccing to dps to raid.
---
And this is valid because what, time playing a video game has value?
---
Slow down. Play the way it was designed. Speed runs are for losers.
---
Warriors have the most gear options, and also get hate because of this.. against a rogue which can only wear leather vs a tank who gets to roll on 3x the loot, its sorta shitty to need on leather without a  fyi up front... i have lost 3 reeds to bear tanks alone, not counting other casters :/         
---
          
---
I think to make it easier for everyone, people should make their requests know, and i think it is also unfair to assume your tank is going to roll need on dps gear without saying anything, as it is unfair to assume a priest is going to heal.. i ask about needing on the demonic runes for crafting in DM.              
---
           
---
and to finalize my soapbox, i think people need to stop watching the BiS loot tables.. the average person is not good enough, or pushing content where 10 ap or 3 spell-power is going to change anything, so get a slightly less optimal drop and move on.
---
&gt;Imagine a Viskag of the Bloodletter dropping (2% drop rate) from Ony, but some guy automatically wins it b/c hes got the most DKP. Shitty feeling. All in all, DKP is horrible (unless a brand new guild). Loot Council is much better, it might suck in the beginning, but the gear starts flowing in more frequently over time.
---
Maybe my experience with LC has been shitty, but unless you’re part of the loot council, your chances of getting that 2% drop rate item are just as nonexistent as they are in the DKP hoarder scenario. At least, in that scenario, there’s an objective metric
---
ummm, cool dude?
---
&gt;When does it really pay off to get your green items disenchanted? 
---
For most items, this is the case.
---
Sometimes greens will go for a fair bit of gold, but you need to make sure you know what they are. For example, any Green cloth bracers of Frost/Shadow can go for like 50G+.
---
Even something like a random plate belt of the bear can go for 10G+ if someone wants it bad enough. 
---
But the cloth chest piece that gives +str/dex? That shit is asking to be disenchanted.  
---
&gt;Meaning that'll pay better on AH than vendoring them? 
---
For some 2H weapons it's better to vendor it since at 60 you can get like 5G for it, if the essences are less than 5g on your server it's better to sell it.
---

Is this why people say "buying all thick leather, 1.2g per stack COD"? i always wonder why they do that

That sounds.. wrong? Based on what I've been reading. I don't have awesome gear you know.

Played Nostalrius for a month last year and it got shut down :( fell in love with wow then and got right back into classic with a huge passion. I am a sucker for RPGs and go at my own pace. Love the questings and have an awesome low level guild to do dungeoning with! If youre like me youre in love ❤️
---

---
I would suggest you turn off your xp bar and do the following. As others say being 60 doesn’t magically change anything and you will have to do the following regardless so you might as well get a head start. 
---
1. Get attuned to MC and clear the whole BRD quest log
---
2. Work towards Onyxia attunement 
---
3. Work on getting your hit and defense gear. 
---
Hit is by far the most important piece of gear you need as a tank. Get Voones gloves from the Ony quest line and work on getting the crossbow from shadow hunter or doing diremaul for the hit gear there. 
---
Just as reference 59-60 is roughly 2.5 full LBRS runs.
---
For Elite leveling quests Inusually end up tanking as a priest.
---
I am lvl 52 atm, so not quite the slowest
---
grats tho

i lost intrest when its all stand at a distance, hit 1 button, or 3 if i aoe XD . but its not engaging, wont help much hit 60, i dont think.
---
Agi gives no AP to a fury warrior.
---
A) Then don't group with people that pull extras and waste time. Changing something that works for  the one person out of 5 that can't  figure out how not to backpedal into more mobs is silly.
---
B) The only way to play a video game wrong is to spend too much time caring about  how others play it. People that enjoy  endgame will rush to it. If  you don't, then just move on.

Not sure if the same level of crowd control is used these days but years ago when my main was a mage I had a “focus sheep” macro. 
---
This enabled you to sheep a target and then attack the dps target, you could then just periodically resheep the “focus” target without retargeting from the main dps target.
---
flair checks out
---
You'll be fine, I've seen mages in MC using Hypnotic Blade.

Just try to upgrade to the dagger from Scholo, or get the Rod of Ogre Magi.

Ideally you want the dagger/offhand combo, but a good staff can be nice too.

I have the cold snap/nova macro, its really useful for aoe pulls if i get a resist. Might set up the ice block macro as well as an "oh shit" button like you said

I would suggest using an addon like auctioneer. After you run an auction sweep, it will look at items and give you an approximate expected disenchant value along with the vendor price.
---
If your ally highcrown

If your horde impact

It can depend on the fear as well. Sometime fear will run them perfectly in the other direction in which you can start a mind blast into a mind flay or a heal. Sometimes fear will run them through you and into a wall by you or a tree. Creating distance against melee is important. I'm always running around while not casting just incase you are playing a less skilled player you can gain some advantage. Instead of bubble stand there and dot them I'll bubble turn and run away and while I'm waiting for the global on bubble I'll jump turn quick with my mouse and cast my dot and continue running until my global cooldown is almost done. Then you can decide what to do from there. If you created a little distance throw in a mind blast, then a fear if they are hammering you. Then create more distance, re shield and dot if needed and continue casting mind blast and mind flay. Throw a renew on just before they get to you and continue running and jumping until you need to cast. Just make sure you know what's around you and you dont run into a mob of stuff.
---
I don't need many things from other dungeons, and if I do I don't automatically get it like tanks are trying to do. I've done plenty of dungeons where I don't win anything. So, I guess I'm wasting my time too since I wasn't handed something that run? I'm not against needing money, but everyone needs money. Roll greed like everyone else. You don't need something from a run? Well now everything you win is profit just like if I didnt.
---
pretty cool
---
I don't know WoW very well and don't know what a Tribute run is. I don't really care what I do at 60 as long as I can farm something for gold. :)

Most classes have mindless or simple rotations. It's just a part of Classic.

Tbf, pets and how they worked back in vanilla seems to be QUITE a lot different from how it is in classic. Pets in classic just seem...smarter somehow (which I assume is just because it's a legion or bfa backport)
---
Na not at all. It's crazy how mad rogues and hunters get about warriors 'rolling on their gear' but its complete crap and your entitled to it. Just keep covering your ass before hand by telling ppl your gunna roll on dps gear. If they agree then they got nothing to complain about.
---
if you need an item - roll need.

just don't be that guy that rolls need on everything for every spec you never intend to play.

Then it is suddenly 8.
---
Then it changes to 10 or even 15!
---
So which one is it? Why not use the belt + Talents to get 8 or 10. And then wear devilsaur set instead of these gloves.
---
Welcome to the "never group with this person list" ;)
---
While I agree that chasing down every pre-raid BIS gear piece is unnecessary as many of the lists aren’t truly BIS and some of the items are only best situationally or even just not worth farming. And yet other items aren’t worth running a dungeon many times to get. For example, my lock has mostly pre-raid BIS gear just from helping guildmates out with various runs. But I am missing a couple of pieces where my alternative is nearly as good.
---
With that said, MC does not have all the BIS pieces. For both pvp and PvE many of the BIS pieces are not in MC or Ony. Yes, some MC pieces are great upgrades. But not all of them. 
---
TLDR: Don’t go crazy over specific pre-raid BIS or BIS lists. Play the game to have fun. You will naturally pick up BIS pieces as you play. But MC isn’t the magical solution. Sure, many MC pieces are huge upgrades, but your BIS gear with raid gear included will include dungeon and crafted gear as well.
---
About 1% to hit yellow hit cap, and 4% to be decent with your white hits, assuming you have the Precision 5/5 talent and the Weapon Expertise 2/2 talent in Combat, "bud."
---
After yellow hit cap, hit only affects white damage, and with all stats, its worth has diminishing returns. Crit is extremely valued after hit cap, and not only does QSR give more than 2x the AP that TER gives, it gives me the most valuable stat after hit.
---
If you're going to vilify someone with all this salt though, vilify the raid leader who decided that everyone can roll on it. I was one of several rogues and hunters and warriors rolling on this ring.
---
Easy to get addon called Blue Shamans.
---
There's a part of me that wants to troll that dude so very badly...see if I could make him explode or something.
---
Probably should've done your research, enchanting only really becomes worthwhile to disenchant at around 50+ and even then a lot of the greens / blues are still better to vendor.
---
Depends what server your on and if that server needs more alliance then horde, there was a chart with all servers and the amount of horde/ally
---
It disappears yes
---
No, it's something about the eyes and the messy hair on top... I think it's because it reminds me of the scary maze game face which always haunted me when I was younger.
---
I saw a github link somewhere but I'm not sure how to use that information. Do I compile the addon myself? Do I have to or can I just made a folder for it under \Addons and put it there?
---
I am horde, so I don't need to "git gud", I am just really really bored and disappointed.
---
faction balance isn't really relevant in a PVE server, it's the PVP servers which suffer.
---
When there is a faction imbalance, the opposing factions' playerbase tends to writher away and die as they either quit from being camped, cannot quest efficiently and eventually lead to not being able to get groups for dungeons etc.
---
cheers man, really helpful input that was
---
they made it possible to roll both factions before they merged pvp servers. they also made it possible to server xfer from a pve to a pvp server and vice versa. so don't worry. 
---
after a server merge, all three realms exist on the selection screen, it's just in game they're all one realm.
---
Yes the Bilge Water Goblins are based in Kezan.
---
The vanilla goblins are of the Steamwheedle Cartel, so that's why when I saw a map with Steamwheedle Port the gears in my head started spinning and had this vision of goblin Las Vegas.
---
Yeah but all of those can be done by a regular Paladin.
---
It’s clearly your sleep paralysis demon
---
The warlock pulled aggro and died
---
There are only 2-3 quests in silithus
---
Love it, the big brother feeling is what I came back for.  I never get mad about getting killed, I love it actually.  Even more so if it is a pretty fair fight.  I can hold my own, disc priest broke 2k several times through the years.   I am old though, camp me and I am done for the night.  No rage just 2 tired to wait, lol.
---
nah, your just greedy as fuck... your get to need on your currently filled roll, and arrange to need on off-spec assuming the person filling that need agrees, on a group by group basis.
---
I've done like 40 and not seen it... I'm preparing for the time it drops and I lose.
---
Whatever SHE wants to play
---
Yes some classes are easier than others but she needs to pick and play what she thinks is fun and cool.
---
This! Until your heated out and tanking a single boss, arms is the better bet for a dps tank if that’s what you want to do.  Dungeons are about the trash, what destroys trash and can pull threat off a regular tank and never give it back...an arms warrior. Weave thunderclaps for the debuff, whirlwinds, and revenges. Pull with sweeping strikes. Easiest aggro ever.
---
Barrens sucks for actual questing, but Barrens chat is entertaining enough to make it worth imo
---
I’m willing to transfer to severs that need allies
---
On PvP servers, past experience says: no.
---
"Time is money, friend" =) Not everyone has 5 hours to waste in BRD every night.
---
And if you wanna talk about "play the way it was designed" then I'd like to introduce you to [The Baron Run](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:Dead_Man%27s_Plea)
---
This is a good run down.
---
Maybe it’s semantics. In this context need to me means an upgrade that allows you to continue progressing. An item with no obvious comparable. A fresh 60 doesn’t need edgemasters because there are plenty of options better than their current loot. But, at some point edgemasters will start looking desirable. At which point the player will decide they need them and buy them from the AH. 
---
Expecting to skip all that progression because of a lucky drop is greedy.
---
No, it stays
---
how do you know this information?
---
Dig that one
---
You can kill the second eye much safer before the ramp. Right after the spiders
---
Only they're not victims at all.  They were trying to get over on someone and it backfired.
---
Just don't send invites to warriors then.
---
Grats! Good thing a hunter wasn't there
---
there's an addon? damn lol i didn't think it was that much of an issue
---
if they're public, warcraftlogs.com will rank each guild based on how well they clear mc and onyxia.
---
Rogue pick pocket guide , make 50 gold per hour :)
---
seriously did you google it?
---
Well, need for hit rating is determined by the difference between your weapon skill and the enemy's defense, right? So if you're level 50 fighting a level 53 it is almost equivalent to a level 60 fighting a level 63, is that right?
---
So in MC everyone should roll need on the boes so they can sell it for 300g instead of people that can use it and that way no one gets those who actually need them?
---
Honestly man, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Once you hit 60, you and your friends will be 60 for longer than you felt behind, cause its forever! The new content will invalidate their progress in true WoW fashion and you'll be there to join in.
---
Pre-BC I remember reading somewhere that I think a warrior, a druid and a mage(I could be wrong, this was a long time ago) 3-manned Onyxia. They were all full naxx geared and really damn good players, but it was still impressive. But honestly, I'm a bit more impressed by this, as the gear used isnt quite as powerful as Naxx gear would be. 
---
Just kind of a fun story. Maybe the news article still exists somewhere? I might see if I can find it...
---
What's the best site to look up pre-raid BiS gear for this patch?
---
The real problem is that you accepted the role of tank, but then surprised the party by rolling on DPS loot.
---
That would be like a druid healer stealing loot from a rogue and then being like "lol well my main spec is feral" after the item dropped.  That just makes you look like somebody who's collecting two sets of gear, without commiting to a "main spec", which will make people angry.
---
As always, you should declare your loot intentions up front so that everyone knows.
---
And honestly, unless fury makes you tank better than prot, you probably shouldn't be tanking end-game without being the proper spec.  That just makes the healers job that much harder.
---
Can you translate the 12 min video? Cant really follow a guide when I dont speak another language.
---
Bloodrazor will do more raw damage but the proc is a detriment when you're using Gouge/Blind. Plus it isn't worth the opportunity cost of the gold you'd need to either spend or sacrifice by not selling it (whichever situation applies here).
---
Just use Thrash Blade until you can get one of:
---
Dal'Rend's (Rend)
---
Ebon Hilt of Marduk (Marduk - Scholo)
---
Skullforge Reaver (Baron)
---
I used to pug MC, Ony, Aq20 and zg all back in the original vanilla fine?
---
Didn't see pug BWL though.
---
Maybe it depended on server and where the game was at though, when it was fresh content i imagine no one was pugging unless it was the last few spots on a guild run.
---
Back then though it seemed more common for me that guilds would have alliances with other guilds and would ask their friend guilds to help fill raids.
---
It's not just hit though, it's glancing blows. That one talent is sooo good that nothing else compares
---
Does it still require Elf riding skill as well (I.e. exalted with Darnassus on top of exalted with Winterspring Frostsaber trainers)?
---
Or just don't be a ninja
---
Just do it and don't be afraid.   
---
If you are smart you will take a look on the wowhead dungeon guides. There are much information about the quests, loot and bosses. You can tell your group that you are new to tanking. Ask them for important things to know for this dungeon. For example the Dwarfs in Gnomeregan who place the mines. If you don't know that they are doing this you will probably wipe. If they don't knew it why you should do it?  Experienced players will find out anyway that you are new to tanking.   
---
Every tank had to do its job for the first time and no master has fallen from the sky yet. And if you had a bad run or some stupid group mates don't give up. Let them talk. Do it again. Just be friendly even to the stupid idiots.
---
The humanoids are all squishboxes &amp; you can LOS them to get the casters into your consecrate. There are lots of pillars on the walls you can snugggle up against to break LOS even though they dont look like it. The butcher is a legit douchebag but if your group stays close to you &amp; doesnt run around like morons when he dumps aggro its a whole lot easier to reclaim him. You can LOH in a pinch to dump a couple thousand aggro points onto the threat table too. For Rav's trash you just burn them harder and they dont have time to drop aggro. You dont have to pull them all at once, can get them 2 at a time. For Rav himself just put your back to a wall and get an exorcism off soon as he drops, this will bring him right back.
---
The only boss that is really a problem is Jandice, but only because of running oom. A pot and a rune fixes that.

---
It drops from both!
---
Well that any you dont need to be disp or holy to heal while leveling :D         
---
As a loc, i generally coordinate with the priest to see if they are collecting shadow gear, i assume everyone is collecting spellpower.
---
Some good ones I like to use:
---
Copy/Paste a macro for all your spells that is:
---
\#Showtooltip
---
/cast "spell"
---
This will allow you to not have to worry about updating your spell bar after each upgrade.
---
For spells that require fast timing like Counterspell, Ice block, cold snap, fire/frost ward, polymorph, etc., add a /stopcasting command before the spell:
---
\#showtooltip
---
/stopcasting
---
This is good for not having to jump/strafe cancel to cast a CS or w/e.  Can be a life saver in pvp.
---
Again, for spells like CS and Poly:
---
/cast \[@mouseover, exists\] "spell", "spell"
---
This allows you to simply mouseover a target other than your current one to cast a control spell.  Might take a sec to get used too, but it's such a nice QoL improvement.
---
There are also cast sequence that is good for simple buffs and food.
---
/castsequence Arcane Intellect, Mage Armor
---
/castsequence Conjure Water, Conjure Food
---
Maybe add /cancelaura Ice Block to the end of your frostbolt or fireball macro, any spell that you can hit that won't instant cast.  Can help in pvp for quickly blocking a fear or something and getting right back into it w/o having to click the block away.
---
As far as any complicated macros, there isn't really too much necessary for mages.  We don't have heals and there is no focus frame in classic, so much of our usual cc macros don't really come into play.  No pet management either.
---
You could also make a wand macro that can wand down totems.  I don't have it on me atm, but its basically just a bunch of
---
/shoot Grounding Totem
---
/shoot Tremor Totem
---
etc. etc. just go down the list and give the more important target priority on the list.  One button wand macro for totoem bashing.
---
Leveling is the majority of the game in classic so it'll feel monotonous at times, but the game is great at supplying you with breaks from questing. With new spells every other level, the game pushes you into the cities where you could find a group to do an dungeon. You could also take a break and work on your professions or just go find some enemy players to gank. Questing for the most part is soloable, but there are some quests that you might not be able to do solo or even at all until a later level with a group. Don't feel left out and rush to 60 because leveling is the best part of the game imo.
---
You can do The Crown of Will questchain which perfectly fits into your level range, gives lots of XP and in the end you get a +4 agi, +5 str, +6 stamina neck.
---
Most of the mail from there outside of the helm and gloves arent worth it for a hunter.
---
Are you forming groups for things that casters want to do or that melee dps wants to do?
---
Not exactly a huge amount of overlap there.
---
Like, I'm a fury warrior and I have zero desire to enter scholomance other than to build a tanking set, because there's like 3 melee DPS pieces in there that actually benefit me in a meaningful way and one of them conflicts with the devilsaur set while the other two really aren't worth going out of my way for but it's teeming with great BiS and non-BiS caster gear.
---
On the flipside, UBRS is a treasure trove of many of the best pieces of melee DPS gear like Dal'Rend's, Truestrike, Battleborn, PWB, as well as a bunch of great alternative non-BiS gear like Emberfury, nightbrace, Dragoneye, Eye of Rend, Blackmist, Blademaster, Tristam, Brigam, etc and a bunch of other pieces that aren't great but are nice upgrades to 50s greens----But it's completely mediocre for casters unless Jed is up
---
Deep, big thank you, mon.
---
Imagine not being a total dick to your guild mates. Imagine just ignoring the ones who annoy you. Imagine never using the worn out expression “Imagine [something something something]”  ever again. Just imagine.
---
Some of the stuff might as well be gospel. As a fury warrior damn near anything with hit it something that I lust for. It feels really weird to be wearing a lot of leather.
---

Okay cool thanks, I feel better.

Ur always going to try rationalize ur stupidity. Look at the leaders of ur country, that trickles down into ur culture and education. I dont need to say anymore lol

Just looked into this and apparently blizzard has intentionally broken this kind of thing. Any idea of a workaround?
---
Introducing my sister to WoW for first time tonight.  She wants to roll a Pally.  Any ideas which class I should roll an alt with here (assuming she’s dps)?
---
It’s not bad to skip mobs by the way. There is usually one person though that doesn’t know how to listen or they’re too hesitant and worried about pulling that they usually are the ones that pull extra mobs. Don’t wanna sound like an elitist nerd but you can tell if everyone knows what they’re doing within the first five minutes. If not and people seem hesitant, I won’t mention short cuts because I know things will go wrong. Too many times we wiped in LBRS because people didn’t listen or because of silly mistakes like back pedaling into sleeping orcs.
---
As someone who has only ever played classic (through TBC) I was really excited when Blizzard announced Classic and my initial thought was “oh cool, they’re gana bring back classic but have all these great updated models! It’s gana be the same game but look
---
way better!”   
---
I guess that would have been a lot more work, but I really wish they went this route. Seems like an absolute NO BRAINER
---
Don't forget the infamous "hunter weapon!"
---
there is diffrent forms of braindead\mindless though :P . but guess i asked wrong place
---
I run it over and over with my Mage wife for that stupid Epic Dagger that procs from spell damage.  I have run it at least 20 times, and most likely have 80 more before it drops.
---
Weirdest thing I have seen.  We ran it five times back to back with the same 3 other people once.  And that ring dropped every.single.time.  It's drop rate is all over the place.
---
Here you go
---
Have better self control.
---
Hit is in a weird place with the Heroic Strike "feature" to me. Really throws a wrench into what I want.
---
I started day one hour 1. I am 51 haha
---
QS was the reason I rolled a tank in vanilla. Such a cool sword.
---
No the guy is right. It really doesn't matter what class you play but outside of utility and specific situations literally every single class is hit 1-3 buttons while leveling.
---
There's a video of a warrior holy pally and a hunter 3 Manning it back in the day. Pretty neat watch
---
I've ran Wailing Caverns twice and lost a guy to the cliff each time.
---
My buddy had 70+ under his belt first time he saw both of them drop was last night and he happened to win both rolls against 2 other people
---
I like hearing when people ding every level... I remember it being htat way in vanilla too. My guild would all ding every level.
---
Damn as a warlock this is kind of useless
---
awesome, thx man.
---
Depends on the server.  It's off on a bunch of them.
---
How does it ruin your gym life? You go to the gym 1 hour and you have 23 hours to rest. WoW and muscle growth are best friends. I got extremely fit playing WoW. Don’t blame the game if you are lazy.
---
Yes, you should be allowed to name yourself Blizzard... What you shouldn't be allowed to do is have the GM logo next to your name, or fall for stupid phishing attempts.
---
Oh man I hate having to either risk running through the jungle from BB or talking a nice long walk through duskwood.
---
You won an unopposed roll congrats
---
nice boomer post look hahah it took me so long to hit 60 wow ! 
---
pls stop this
---
I'd be a little upset, most tanks have no business being in cloth. Now if you were a rogue though, that's just the game
---
why the water breathing?
---
That is correct.
---
This is seriously not worth worrying about mate. Just roll that new toon on another server and enjoy.
---
Come try remulos. Pve players are really kind and helpful over all. Less competitive neck beard types, more 35 year old dads who like to raid.
---
For some reason the wtf file won't save changes for me. It immediately reverts when I try to change values or add lines.
---
Is it worth it for a duel wielding Fury War to get this?
---
Nah chain was about 6th arena over all I passed hoj to two rogues in my guild that I was running with so still need my hoj.
---
Yea so make that clear which is what OP failed to do. Instead he joined and didn't say a word until the item dropped.
---
Nah, not so long as you're cool with it if they don't take you up on the offer.
---
As a Skinner I've been farming the mobs in blasted lands that drop mats for buffs. They are high 40s/low 50s so super easy to kill. You get a lot of thicc and rugged leather. You also get a lot of mats which you can turn in for buffs. They have no vendor price so they cost 0 to sell on AH and they sell for like 50s to 1.50g each (basilisk brain, scorp pincers, and boar lungs). You will also get a bunch of Grey's and also green crystals that you can turn in for  random greens.
---
Oh, he'd be real easy to heal all right.  Problem would be all the other people getting their faces smashed in.
---
more hordes = more targets
---
Ive been torn betwen theae choices to, from what i can gather mage is the way to go. Aoe farming is just to powerfull
---
Still good advice though
---
Fury warriors are very desired they are superior to rogues in literally every aspect of the game in PVE to be frank, and I say that as a rogue
---
It's nice in that it gives you some quick aggro on everyone fast. Now, Maul is still super good for building up a lot of aggro on the main target, but swipe is definitely more useful than many say.   
---
It's also a great rage dump if you're banking more rage than you can use.
---
I think the issue is that this list is older than the servers, therefore a lot of this was just pre-launch guilds getting ready.
---
Obviously this doesn't work now and needs corrected, but its going to require that the existing guilds come back and update that information and that is going to be a huge task to undertake.
---
I agree though, as of current this list is worthless and its frustrating since there isn't really a good way to find guilds in Classic.
---
because I like to have all fly available now so I don't have to do it later
---
My guild helps me get BIS epics, but they’re mostly BIS’d out so they have little incentive to run the amount of dungeons I needed (they did help quite a lot but obv no ones gonna do 20 rend runs for fun).
---
If I were to do it alliance would be double pally so we're invincible or warlock priest, cuz they both do shadow damage and have shadow damage debuff and wands powerful
---
does for me yea
---
I saw that name on Mankrik the other day.
---
Im level 37
---
Best two-box duo for farming at 60? Horde. 
---
I don't know what to farm, I would just like a good duo at 60 where I can make gold.
---
sorry bud, work comes first!
---
There's plenty of dwarves in Tauren areas, so it was bound to happen.
---
I was under the impression the threat table from phase 1 carries over minus the reduction from fireballs during phase 2. Input is appreciated, we've been struggling with the transition for a while.
---
Grinding your next piece of gear of course!
---
HotW/NS allows you to effectively tank, heal, dps, and solo cat form things. 
---
At 60 I'd suggest swapping to bear focused talents rather than cat for easier tanking. I'd also refrain from dpsing past level 50ish.
---
But yeah it's just a nice leveling spec, go all the way down to cat form speed upgrade, then put 5 into resto to get the instant energy when you swap into it, then finish off feral to heart of the wild, after that full resto until 60.
---
how many days played
---
It is a little unusual, but I'm not your mom so...
---
Main hand and to fast,  so its not that good for dps fury..
---
The other guy's definition is sorta true.  For context, a BOP (soulbound to the receiving party) can only sell it to a vendor for a small payment.  
---
A BOE, especially a blue or purple BOE, is valuable because it can be sold on the auction house and, sometimes, are worth A LOT of money even as a green.
---
Step 1:  Be really bad at the game.  Really, really bad.
---
Step 2:  Think you're such hot shit that you refuse to even consider helpful advice from other players.
---
Step 3:  Repeat steps 1 and 2 ad infinitum.
---
Heh. I used to have a snake/serpent pet on my original hunter. Named him Monty.
---
I am aware of only 3 chest locations in DM:North. Any idea where I can see more info regarding chests?
---
All that tanking and you haven't learned to deal with other players?  If you're not enjoying being a tank, don't tank.  
---
EZPZ.
---
Maybe you shouldn't have done rmt then
---
I’m not berating ppl, but I’m not taking a bad dps if I’m short on time
---
Black as Dwight would say, because it overpowers all other colors!
---
Not recommended. 
---
Server imbalances tend to be nearly impossible to fix outside of Blizzard's intervention (and even that sometimes fails).
---
Keep playing
---
yes you do.   you level to 240, learn gnomish, build the BoP trinkets, then drop eng, re-level to 200, and *then* you can use the soothsayer book in tanaris to choose goblin.
---
Well sure, I'm not really comparing myself against my other specs but just against other dps classes and I suppose assuming your tank and heals are also not Paladins.
---
It's three people and they fight like 45minutes, however that's in naxxramas gear the paladin pretty much never runs oom due to the 100% mana refund upon critical heal.
---
Did you actually gain good gold from killing boss or did it get eaten all up by consumes?
---
I've been Prot spec since I dinged 60 in order to find groups and get gear. When PvP releases properly I have no intention of raiding or tanking. So I sympathize with you.
---
However your situation is very similar to the Crimson Felt Hat dilemma. If a holy priest heals a Strat run can he roll vs a mage? 
---
Morally you did nothing wrong but I can see why he's upset. The real problem here is the overemphasis on BIS lists and perceived guild elitism cuckoldry on gear that the rogue probably sees the Cape as some sort of gateway.
---
I cannot imagine going through Strat UD as a BM Hunter. Using a pet in that dungeon is next to impossible before the gauntlet.
---
as a undead warrior as well when i hit around 38 i did SM over and over again until i had enough gold and once i hit 40 i was only 8g short so did SM 2 more times and was good to go. i also saved my money as well (didn't buy any gear and only bought talents that were needed)
---
Try opening in administrative mode?
---
Right click  &gt; properties - is it read only?
---
I did a run late Saturday night because I saw this grp had been looking for a tank for almost an hour and felt bad for them. Join the party and see they had a warrior but he refused to tank. 
---
We have a few close calls but we drop Princess and there's the ring and I roll need and beat the other warrior and immediately start getting passive aggressive shit from the party about 'oh I didn't realize that pre-bis tank ring'. I shrug tell them I am Fury and ask if we are doing Rotgrip. Group breaks up.
---
If you want the ring tank your own runs and reserve it
---
&gt; Just f-ing move on, if you cannot add anything productive or positive
---
&gt; Moron
---
They both have their perks for sure. I'd say if your more of a melee guy go rogue obv and if you like casters go mage. If you like to play both then just choose what you can see yourself enjoying more overall when you hit 60.
---
Apparently it's the fireballs hitting you while she is in the air that resets your threat. If youre not hit by a fireball, you won't drop threat and are going to get smacked in p3. Sounds weird, but has been tested.
---
There was definitely a 3 man group that did it, warrior, hunter, h pally, but it was in T3 gear and right after the TBC patch released so they had all those updated talents.
---
It's not just the community.  It's the game.  
---
Retail is full of "group" content that you end up mostly doing with randoms.  They removed the time consuming process of forming groups of people in a limited population server and replaced it with automatic worldwide matchmaking.  This eliminated the consequences of being an entitled asshole in groups.  
---
Before the LFG system was introduced, if you were an asshole, people on your server would talk and you might end up having to wait longer and work harder to form groups.  The day the new LFG system came out tanks started being entitled pricks: kicking low dps, dropping groups if they didn't get their way and just being generally toxic because they could.  There was no-longer a downside.  As blizzard "improved" their queueing systems and further expedited forming groups for even more things, they removed more and more of the repercussions for being toxic and the community adjusted accordingly.  I find retail unplayable now.  They've removed all of the obstacles to progress that being impolite added to the game which has left a hyper-focus on a constantly churning set of game mechanics and a player base who feel it's completely appropriate to be assholes.
---
It reminds me a lot to **For the King** staves
---
The only thing I’d say is if you come in as a tank roll for tank gear if you need the upgrade. Unless it’s stated or something but in this case you’re in the right cause you needed the item as an upgrade
---
No, to fast! Would be for fashionreasons tho
---
And does feline grace prevent all damage upon landing from that ledge? That’s the context that I’m talking about. We’re all jumping from the ledge as the big bad cool mage insists we do.
---
Well, have fun with that. While I disagree with basically all your logic, I enjoyed this conversation and getting to learn why people would leave money on the table.
---
I haven't tried or checked either of those things. I'll have to look at it when I get home, thanks for the tip!
---
This is the equivalent to Facebook photos in /pics
---
Exactly 1% of uncontested rolls happen this way.
---
Some people are excited to share their accomplishments with others. This isn't an excuse to make someone else feel bad about  what they are proud of.
---
Even if you prefer not to congratulate or whatever, you don't need to intentionally make a scene about it and disparage others for getting excited about something you don't take any interest in. If someone can't be happy for other people happiness, maybe they shouldn't be in a guild. Or at least find another like minded and dull set of people to play with instead.
---
Referencing the reddit hate train on reserve runs.  OP was obvious joke
---
Lol you could strive to not be a total noob?
---
Getting a proc on average every sixty seconds won't give you 100% uptime. That's not how randomness works. It takes over 100 hits a minute to reach 90% uptime.
---
One could say justice was on your side
---
Ya mine went from undead pirate to gnome priate
---
Sell em for more. And they turn the person into a ninja or pirate if they eat it. Well not deviate fish but the savory deviate delight is what is cooked
---
Well said. Took me a while to realize mana burn so worth it
---
Contrary to the popular meme, dont DoT her in phase 2 and have the entire raid group up on one side during 1 and 3. Ensure you have tanks assigned to two sides for p2 and one for the entrance. Dont use cool downs at the start of the fight, use them at 1% before she transitions to phase 2, this way you get max uptime kn her while she moves around the room and isn't hitting your tank, ranged DPS should continue to blast her as hard as they can during Phase 2 whilst tanks should call for AoE on the whelps and melee should handle the larger dragonkin. Once she comes down, its phase 1 repeated, just ensure the raid is constantly topped off and DPS dont over-agro.
---
From Phase 2 to 3 she regains the threat table of phase 1. However the fireballs reset aggro one by one starting at the highest threat on the threattable from phase 1. 
---
In a 40 men you want to have the second tank around place 15 to secure that he wont be hit by a fireball before she lands.
---
In a 10men due to the time shes flying I could imagine that everyone's threat from phase 1 is wiped and it's a piece of cake for the tank to get her aggro.
---
Honestly, it should just come down to the healer saying "I'm not doing another run without doing some golem". If they say no, he absolutely should just leave the group.
---
That’s where I’m at. But sunk cost fallacy is really kicking in, I can’t accept that I’ve spent all this time and haven’t been rewarded. Gotta keep grinding it. Good advice though.
---
i skipped my axe since i couldn't fine anyone to help me and just used  corps maker and that SM axe until i got a polarm from ZF.
---
Everyone's leveling experience will be different... but that said:
---
* Mobs will *not* be scaling with your level as they did with BFA. There are power curves to every zone, and every quest. You might find that annoying, because mobs *will* keep you from moving through a zone or getting to a quest hub if you're too low a level. Or, you might find some fun in progressing through a zone and becoming a little better with each level.
---
* Talent points come every level 10+. That said, not all talents feel rewarding to take. It's much different than BFA's 1 talent point per 20 levels or so. There are a lot of different builds and playstyles, and you can try out a lot of stuff. On the one hand, there's a lot of room to try different things. On the other, there are a lot of "filler" talents that don't feel very fulfilling. It's important to move toward the goal.
---
* You will need to group up with people from time to time. If you're interested in interacting with people beyond the "find group" button (this does not exist in Classic), then you have a good shot at meeting people. Not everyone ends up on your friends list. And sometimes you run dungeons and chat is quiet other than "brb" or "mind if I roll need?" so it's not a guarantee you'll meet people. But you'll have a better shot at doing so.
---
I say try it out and see if it's what you are looking for. Classic is free with a subscription, so you'd be out the $15 for the month's subscription, and that's not a bad price to pay to see if it's the game you want.
---
Druid and anything because you have such a versatile setup.
---
People love to cosplay.
---
I can solo them one at a time as a 0/30/21 druid if I use bear form and precast clease poison (otherwise my attack speed is total garbage and I lose the battle of attrition).  Not great, but I've got no raid gear at all.
---
The table definitely doesn't reset. 
---
Fireballs reduce threat of players hit. It's 100%/number of players hit. So you can either stack players and soak the damage so the threat dump is minimal, or have your 2nd tank aim to be around 5-8 on her threat table going into phase 2. This should prevent him from being a fireball target and allow him to pick her up in phase 3 with little to no dps being targeted first.
---
They're fun
---
I hit them hard with my weapon
---
To ninja is to take something you cannot benefit from any other way than financially
---
So I don't think it's true that the aggro table resets from phase 2-&gt;3.  Her fireballs may reduce aggro of people they hit, but I've never had this confirmed.  What happens usually is tanks stop doing anything while she's flying, and people pass them on the threat meter.  
---
If you have your tanks sunder while she is flying, you should be fine.  Otherwise have your dps go really slow in phase one, then nuke her in phase 2 as fast as possible.
---
Ok so it’s best to use the highest possible food?
---
So...you'd rather run two healers in a 5man? Or are you saying the other healers are "shit" [too]? :P
---
I tank just fine, because I'm usually #2 on threat in 5mans. I think it's because of Judgement of Wisdom. Only time this doesn't happen is in Raids, but I'm also woefully undergeared. So who knows what'll happen once I get full T1 or better.
---
Ret doesn't bring the DPS, it supplies the DPS. You're right, Holy could give +10% Stats, but this how is the warrior getting +155 AP stacked with his +185 AP from shout? - Again, bringing two holy paladins?
---
How is the mage/priest/druid/lock going to cast that extra 1 or 2 damage spells before OOM? Holy paladin just gave them +10% stats; no Wisdom. - Or more if the paladin judges Wisdom.
---
On that...how is the Paladin going to 'keep range' when Judgement has a 10yd range? Someone's gotta be 'up in that mess'; you want your healer there?
---
Same with Auras; healing is 40yd. Auras are 30yd. Most boss 'random target/aoe' abilities are 30yd or less.
---
You say Ret isn't important. But it sure as fuck makes the life of a Holy paladin a hell of a lot easier.
---
How did I convince myself? Didn't need to. I play the class and spec I like.
---
But, eh. I'll just keep grouping up and running stuff with other awesome people. You have fun with your class and spec, and I'll have fun with mine. :D
---
BTW: If you want to have 'the best' you should only take Warriors and Priests. For the best tanking/dps and healing (respectively). - Sounds a tad boring.
---
Does retail turn BoE into BoP when you need it? That's an interesting solution
---
Well I started tonight, played 1 hour as druid elf and met a guy to do leveling already. The mobs are hard to kill it takes time, it's slow and friendly : Exactly what I was looking for, only one hour and I already don't regret these 15 bucks.
---
Thanks guys!

If I’m spec’d fury my main spec is fury regardless of what role I am filling. If you message a fury warrior ask him to come do you a favor and tank a dungeon for you , you think it’s right for the warrior to pass on gear he needs for his mainspec ? Why would I run a dungeon for nothing ? You are the greedy one my friend
---
Only hunters get 2 AP from agi.
---
I once had multiple people give up on a strat run before we even started because I had the audacity to keep the 57 mage that whispered me first eventually filled the group and that mage played better than some 60s. Ended up doing two runs with him before parting ways. Inderleveled can be a pain with aggro and resist but it doesn’t mean it’s impossible.
---
Well you see, i work an 8 hour job :/
---
I use to go to the gym 2-3hours everyday. Then i have a little time window to play, but when it comes time to work i feel exhausted and tired.
---
not bad. everyone on this server was openly mocking the dude trying to sell it for 1500 on Tuesday
---
a cpl went for under 1k that i know about
---
I've played this game for 15 years. I dont care about what's viable. I care about what's fun.
---
Imaging thinking a common phrase in Latin mass for Catholics is a white supremacist term because some idiot used it. Anytime an idiot uses a word that must mean we change what it means and conform.
---
Not at all
---
Yeah, just get the lionheart helm recipe.  It’s easy.
---
I ran Uldaman 4 times yesterday and did not see either rockpounder or stoneslayer, getting frustrated but know that is the way things are
---
I love this. Ppl complain about not wanting to farm MCP as a druid but the way I see it, no other class has a broken consumable like this. Funky itemization is actually the selling point IMO.
---
Smack you with my tigo bitties
---
I'm OK with this. If someone is dumb enough to fall for that, they deserve to be scammed. They'll need the life lesson.
---
Pew pew
---
Swipe generates shit for threat. Only swipe when you have an excess of rage. One maul generates more threat than 4 swipes
---
did you rename the addon folder to remove the '-master'?  The addon folder should be named just 'FarmLog'
---
Never said it was.
---
You know 70 runs for MH aint that much right?
---
Mage AoE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pickpocketing
---
Mob AI is really weird in classic. For example, some mobs are not only linked together, but also somewhat really protective of each other, in that as long as you keep fighting one of them, the other is going to assist it even while evading. Pull a mob, let the rest evade, fight it and all of a sudden the mobs that were evading come back to its rescue.
---
Also when there are 2 players close together fleeing mobs, they mobs will somehow always keep switching targets and never reset because of this. Especially if one of the two players keeps buffing or healing the other, even if both never touch the mobs chasing. But sometimes, just being close together is enough for the mobs to lose and gain threat constantly and keep being leashed.
---
Are thorium grenades the standard meta grenades for pvp? What about pve?
---
Almost ready for Heigan!
---
I agree with you and tbh I don't understand why there is even an ongoing debate. I think the argument is about defining "if you can use an item." To me that means if it is an upgrade that you will definitely equip, that means need. Otherwise, in every other scenario, it is greed.
---
Damn I wish this was the case in classic.
---
How about this - join groups as dps and demand this of your tanks and heals, see how people react, what the general expectations are.
---
As a druid who tanks, I'll generally roll on tank and dps gear.  I'm the tank, I'd rather dps but there's a shortage of tanks, and I'm trading some stress for the ability to roll on more items.  Most dps classes understand this.  In some situations where a dps, or the group in general is making it a nice smooth run, I'll ease up and ask or pass on dps gear.
---
Tanking is not as fun as dps in pugs, objectively, so I will offset that by doing -less- tanking and rolling on what I want.  DPS can cry about it, you are partially being carried by the tank.  I've been on the dps side of this - dps is the least stressful role so I won't cry if a tank rolls against me.
---
Even though I plan on healing at 60, I generally give healer priority.
---
How realistic is 300g over a few days? I’ve read the Mara farm is realistically about 40g per hour and I only have a couple hours a night to play if that
---
I've killed rend 4 times. OH on 2nd run, MH on 4th. MH roll won with a 62 other rolls were 2 and 52. HOJ 38 runs never seen it drop. AMA
---
That's is exactly what every (5 man) group I've been in has done, without question.
---
So divide your time better. You can still play and go to the gym, go to the Gym an hour then you still have time to play for a bit. Three hours a day is pretty excessive anyway.
---
As a mage I used:
---
* Greater Arcane Elixir: 3g
---
* Major Mana Potion (x4): 10g
---
* Greater Fire Protection Potion: 7g
---
* Rumsey Rum Black Label: 1g on AH (can be gotten cheaper)
---
* Elixir of Fortitude: 1g
---
* Hallow's End Food: free
---
* Runecloth Bandage (x4): \~50s
---
So, all in all I used about 22-25g of mats and looted 15g from Onyxia. I also won the Onyxia bag, which goes for about 150-200g bid in my guild's main raid, so I saved quite a bit! :D
---
Our main tanks both used a Flask of the Titans though, which is about 90-95g on Firemaw right now, so they weren't quite so lucky.
---
All in all, I don't think anyone actually made a profit.
---
I feel the sam envy but for Skullflame shield. Can’t wait to get it once I get to that level.  
---
Grats on the sword :)
---
Can I input console commands in regular chat ?

Yes daddy

Night Elf females are hit or miss

Human males are completely random

Human females are usually the coolest people

Gnome females are mostly fine

Dwarf male and female are always cool and calm

Gym 2-3hrs a day your doing something wrong , you can fit a complete high intensity high rep work out in 45 minutes , try cut your rest time down to 1minute recovery in between sets.  You just gained an extra 2 hours wow time
---
Tribute runs are a variation of a Dire Maul North run.
---
Instead of killing all the bosses, you avoid or skip them. You kill the final boss (Ogre King), and you are awarded a tribute from all the bosses you skipped.
---
It will typically contain 3~ blues, 2~ greens, and some decent white items (Major mana/health pots etc). There's also dusty tomes and other loot available throughout the run that makes it worthwhile. 
---
Because you don't need to kill any bosses other than the final boss (Which can be beaten using some clever terrain movement), it's very quick and easy.
---
I saw it for the first time last night just to lose it to a hunter that didn’t know why he needed it other than he saw it on a BiS website.... it’s not even BiS for them anymore now that dire maul is out lmao
---
Hey all I'm new to WoW and just dinged 40 last night and realized I'm lacking on gold for my mount. Quite significantly in fact. Playing as a level 40 priest, what would be efficient way to farm gold in order to get that mount?
---
It dropped for me today on my second run. I lost.

Yeah already subbed. My gf loved his vids too
---
Dear OP,  
---
I don't care.
---
Sincerely,
---
/r/classicwow reader
---
&gt;A player taking something over another class when they have another much easier to attain option is an asshole.
---
You're assuming the player even knows that. Only a small (but loud) part of the player base actually looks up bis list (or even loot tables) and goes on message boards
---
BTW when I tried to download the ZIP from github for version 1.6 it wouldn't show up in my addons until I renamed the Folder from "FarmLog-1.6" to "FarmLog"
---
Not sure how you got to that conclusion. I just made the point that saying X guild ninjad an item isnt necessarily witch hunting, it’s informational. Before pugging with a guild, I would like to know if they did something like this.
---
2 hours a night, assuming your not super optimal, over 3 days will net you a little over 200g assuming 35g per hour. You do it 3 hours a night your over 300
---
Absolutely not. As prot spec I've cobbled together quite a bit of fury gear for whenever I go DW prot for tanking/farming. No Dal'rends as I've passed when those drop. Doesn't matter as I'm about to make Quel'serrar and have Mirah's for OH.   
---
It's a 5m, they didn't have it on reserve. Don't feel bad.
---
yea i always do that. i tried 1.6 version renamed it it shows up in list and i can use ingame commands but the window just wont show up
---
Instead of complaining for a free transfer just roll an Ally. You constructively knew what you were in for when you joined horde.
---
I love classic wow, it weeds out so many lazy whingers.
---
My co GM is going armor so I was thinking of complimenting it with weapons, as alliance are swords my best bet ?
---
A mage was getting a node with an NPC he sheeped right next to it. I wanded it and stole the node while he had to re-sheep. Ninja? No. Asshole? Yes.
---
Same, but the difference is that I still don’t have it...
---
So glad I’m not the only one that think those boots are good tanking boots.
---
I guess if you want to be 100% up front you should mention the pieces you are interested in.
---
I got it on my first ever run of BRD with my hunter.  Tank and rogue both had it, clothies had no use at all for it.
---
Always felt kinda bad, but it served me well.
---
I better not let you know where the lemonade is made.
---
Double the armor, more stamina and more attack power. No drawbacks!
---
what about shams
---
I remember running this scam in runescape like 15 years ago. Good times
---
One whisper is a lot of effort?
---
If you cared what other people thought you wouldn't have taken the helm so why are you here?
---
on weapons the stats are the least important. its all about the dps and damage
---
Thank you for the recommendation! Will check it out!
---
That's awesome, thanks for the detail. I'll start planning my 9-man Onyxia run now :P
---
Loch Modan
---
Awesome! Enjoy your time in Azeroth!
---
If it wasn’t an upgrade to yours and you did it just for the appearance, then yeah, dick move bro.
---
Oh man, reminds me of that random Mage I met and quested with for a while in StV. One or two days later at like 4am (!) I met him again on the small naga island in Desolace. Was a similar reaction to the one you mentioned: “Quest XYZ?” “Yeah” “wait... IT’S YOU AGAIN, LOL”. 
---
Haven’t met him since sadly
---
i mean he said he wanted Cadaverous Armor so i figure anything else is free roll. he should be the one that says reserving so and so items in his LFM
---
I think originally Pick Up Group, but I also consider it to possibly mean "PUblic Group". Either is understandable, although I think the first one is the original definition.
---
Sorry, I meant Phase 1.5 or whatever Dire Maul should be called.
---
I'm on run 76 now, been doing brd today for like... 8 hours.
---
Only found 1 hoj but 2 savage gladiator chains. I sometimes wonder why the trinket isn't epic to be honest
---
Thanks, the list has been updated.
---
Listen, I'm a druid. I love druids.
---
We kinda... Suck at dps at higher levels, compared to other classes.
---
If you're looking to dps at a competitive level you probably dont want to be a druid. Or you will want to really do your research and know up front that you'll be working twice as hard to keep up with an average player of better dps classes.
---
So yeah I suggest if you're gonna group at a high level, you try to secure a heal/tank slot. You can dps dungeons, but if that's your goal: spec your talents for it and know that you're not gonna do amazingly most of the time. And all groups will justifiably be skeptical of your abilities until you prove them wrong.
---
Hey guys why are we skipping those
---
T- they don't drop anything
---
H- yeah but they drop xp
---
T- just follow me
---
At next mob me and h- uh those mobs are behind us!
---
Annnnd dead
---
For some people, their only interaction with others is on Reddit or Discord.
---
P1. We’re in P1.
---
The only weapon specialization worth going is axes. The other two are complete trash. Axes gives annihilator which is a good raid weapon, and eventually Nightfall.
---
I have done 100s of runs at this point both as a tank and pure dps spec. This is how it’s been on every single one of my runs with no complaints. Maybe it’s different server to server. I hold myself to the same rules when I am tanking. I am either main spec rolling on tank gear or dps gear but I am clear up front about it. 
---
I personally find it baffeling that people don’t follow the ms&gt;os as a general rule. It’s how i remember everyone doing it in vanilla and again how every single one of my runs has been in classic. 
---
I don’t find tanking any harder then dpsing so to me I don’t think that should equate to more loot.
---
Just let them know that you will roll on such items (run role + off), no big deal.
---
This wasn't blizzards doing, it was streamers. This didn't happen in vanilla but now some R T Ard does it and suddenly EVERY mage wants to. it's a nightmare to tank against these type of players at 60, it's like they don't understand that I can't build aggro on every mob in 3 seconds the way blizzard does.
---
I have been out of the gaming scene for a good while before Classic, my standards for what warrants telling someone off became that of my workplace - pretty much just a last resort preferable only to firing someone.
---
I was *not* prepared to deal with the amount of people who have the impulse control of a toddler and freak out over trivial things like the tank pulling an extra pack to reduce drastically the probability of a wipe.
---
What does your mom have to do with this?
---
In regular Vanilla I bought one of those off of the auction house for 20 gold and used it for like an entire month.  Loved it.
---
Don’t know if serious or not. Don’t care if you are joking; if you’re honestly letting it effect your life, get rid of it. At the least, get a friend or family member to set up parental controls on your account to limit play time. 
---
If that won’t work, go a step further: Cancel your subscription, delete your characters and uninstall the game. Deleting your chars is a good step because it takes away a lot of the incentive to relapse. 
---
WoW is good but if it’s effecting other functions of your life it’s time to take action.
---
Good job! The ultimate tease for the next weeks.
---
You're both rogues needing on the rogue set piece that is not BiS. So no.
---
Ninja is what you would call it like in my UBRS run when the mage need rolls the priest set chest piece and wins it over the priest because and i quote "it's good for pvp though?"
---
This are pretty specific though. Like getting the gloves for disarm is just one thing. And maybe there are other combinations people can use to achieve the immunity without sacrificing X. Maybe their team comp means they can skip Y gear.
---
Maybe what you're looking for is not "BiS list" but "useful items for PVP".
---
CHRIS NO YOU CAN'T SAY THAT...
---
Keep in mind, druids are also one of the more complex classes to play efficiently, especially in pvp. You got 2 animal forms and caster form to use in each situation you come across, while keeping your mana in mind. Requires quite good keybinding or efficient use of macros to make your life easier. Also you should try to collect a set of healing gear for dungeons, just in case.
---
That said, Druids are very good solo levelers/questers(heal, tank and stealth make all kinds of quests soloable the other classes could not.) and always welcome to dungeon, usually as a tank. You won't need to swap gear for tanking if you level as feral, which is the easiest way to solo.
---
Number 1 and 2 aren't necessarily independent of each other and how the player reacts to getting called out is usually indicative of which side they'll fall on.
---
lol so if the tank needs absolutely nothing from a strat live, why the fuck else would he go with a bunch of pugs?
---
from the kindness of his heart?
---
maybe it just makes sense for the other four to bite the bullet and give up a righteous orb that might not even drop so the dungeon can get cleared.
---
nobody cares what a dps needs. and i say this as a dps main.
---
If you needed the item you didn't ninja.
---
This reserve a item shit that this sub is on is stupid.
---
What is the reference for auction house value? Can you use data sources from TSM, Aux or Auctioneer?
---
I do 30 min stretch warm up before then my session is about 1hr-1/2 then the rest of the time is for accessory work
---
Lol I started wow in the vanilla beta and played w/out stopping all the way through the cata patch in wotlk. I JUST learned this too.
---
So why don't you just go farm there? ^^^/s
---
Makes more sense now :)
---
did u make it stop disappearing randomly and while clicking esc? literally everyone uses esc to open system settings
---
can i edit lua somehow to make it stop disappearing when i want to access system settings? rly annoying great addon otherwise
---
Human Female or Male Gnome for warlock based on looks alone?
---
Because they didnt want to fix it right awayband they eventually did. 
---
Their temporary solution of making gms patrol these areas 24/7 to catch "cheaters" is a poor solution to a problem. 
---
With rereleasing the game and leaving it and using the above solution as the permanent solution is.... ridiculous.
---
With how many servers and places this can happen they must have like 50 gms whose entire job is to just check hot spot locations across all servers.
---
When a simple update could make everyone's lives easier lol.
---
Yeah lemme just quickly farm up 1k gold in order to get my Warden's Staff off the dps who won a need roll in order to sell it. It's real easy for feral tanks to farm, what with all the AoE they have.
---
This kinda mentality just hurts tanks. If we're bringing you through a dungeon, and our best in slot for the entirety of Classic drops, we're gonna roll need on it, and quickly blacklist anyone who decides not to. Loot is loot, and if somebody actually needs to use something, they should be entitled to it.
---
If you spent 2 weeks looking for someone to get an enchantment, then it's probably quite rare on your server and worth the 20g.
---
Right now there's only one enchanter on my server doing +30SP for Alliance, they charge 80-100g, so it could be worse.
---
The grind above 60 was like that in BDO.
---
Yeah, I got 2% today!
---
Because people love to have others tell them they're correct/not wrong.  It's why games have achievements now.  People need constant reminders that they are great and hand-holding, and participation trophies.
---
Got it after only 17 boss kills. Props to pagle players who didn't even try to need it over me lol
---
Considering a level basically takes 4-7 hours from 40-60, it's not surprising. Did for me anyway.
---
No changes, get banned like the golden days.
---
No, you're not. As a Rogue myself I would probably have been frustrated as well, but not more than if someone other than the tank won it and I certainly would't be calling you out for it like that. 
---
That said, beeing a rogue is annoying too at times. Everyone and their mom taking leather and we dont have any other options. I just went dagger because of the lack of swords and cba to even try anymore. Its all frustrating by design it seems, not the players fault that bis for warriors is often leather/plate
---
Pretty exploitable, but you had to give up good priest racial spells to get it.. which sucks.

The meta game is intense sometimes.

When Auctioneer first came out I went with a hunch and posted a semi-obscure but essentially worthless item on the AH with five different alts at ~400g for two weeks.  Then after everyone had gathered auction data on its supposed average selling price, I posted one at 200g and it sold within an hour.
---
I always felt kind of bad about that one and never did it again.

Looking for a social raiding guild. Level 27 at the moment as a Warrior wanting to go protection once I'm 60.
---
Can play at any time Friday to Sunday, but unavailable Monday (6PM to 9PM), Tuesday (7PM to 8PM), Wednesday (6PM to 9PM), and Thursday (8PM to 9PM) due to some very weird school schedules this year.
---
Ready to be as dedicated to this as my schedule will allow me! And will gladly help other members with whatever they need as long as I'm able.
---
Can't really use a mic but I understand English perfectly for voice coms during raids and I'm active on discord.
---
That sounds like the type of run that would be perfect, thanks for the explanation. Do you have a recommendation of a 2box duo that could do this?
---
sounds like a douche you sound fine, the only thing I would mention is that casting the heal and moving to cancel the spell before it hits allows you to basically always have a heal for the tank ready to go and cancelling it will make it cost no mana - I found this strat was really good for resto shaman when the tank is on a boss or the pull is larger than it should be. My resto is the same level as you and I had the same idea to level as enhancement but I will say the reduction from 2.5s to 2s healing wave is a big boon for sure
---
Is nightfall any good for alliance tho? Thought it was more a shaman weapon
---
As a Paladin who wants to tank level 60 instances is Holy Shield worth it? Should I only use Rank 1 Holy Shield? Should I even spec into it and instead look at things like parry chance in the Ret tree? 
---
Right now I'm thinking it might be worth going 21/21/9 for Solo Farming and raid healing utility. 
---

(Also should I spend points in anticipation or toughness?)
---
I've also considered something like this and removing all healing utility:

Hi, I’m a rogue using the hit trinket. 2% hit gives me more dps than 2% crit at the moment, as I have lost several major hit pieces (no devilsaur set and I have Bloodfang helm which loses 2% hit from the unforgiven mask). 
---
In that note, has anyone made a spreadsheet yet to calculate gear upgrades for rogues?
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Well the thing is as long as you have proper tank gear you can tank any of the 5 mans in any spec, its just that the vast majority of warriors just don't want to get the gear or learn how to tank.
---
Nice, make a post about it like this guy.
---
You can change that in the ElvUI settings iirc.
---
Gnome ofc!
---
Rogues only get 1AP per STR.
---
Some people are just not good people no matter how nice you are to them.
---
They enjoy being angry at everyone.
---
It's equally good for alliance as it is horde.
---
Did you ever see that episode of the x-files where that guy kept using the word "Cerulean" to hypnotize people?
---
Doesn’t the bonus from both of them stack?
---
I know, but some of these are better than others lol https://i.redd.it/5j9gjr5vdst31.png
---
That's when you make an alt and tell him you'll buy it at that price, then log out once he gets the item from cod.
---
Appreciate the replies, yeah I joined his group and he had guildies try and press me for the 35g price, but stuck to my guns and paid off.
---
Yup, even if you get something amazing like the Arcanite Reaper recipe you'll need 20x Arcanite Bar.
---
The Crystals alone go for 50g~ on my server (If you're lucky, otherwise 60g+)
---
Transmutes are 5g minimum that I've seen.
---
You're going to easily spend 1k+ for a blue weapon that you know will get replaced.
---
There's no cap on the value of weapon skill, but the first five are the most important.
---
lol get got
---
Woah. Those are some trippy mechanics.
---
As others have said, weaponsmithing will not be a big source of income no matter which tree you choose. Most big crafted items will just be made internally in guilds. Axesmith is the most common cause it has the most sought after weapons. Swordsmith/Hammersmith are kind of uncommon but still can make some niche cool weapons. 
---
Like I said before though, go for what you want to make for yourself, or just coordinate with other weaponsmiths in your guild so you have the option of anything without having to find some rando to make it for you.
---
Yep agreed. I'm shadow spec (for levelling) but always heal. I roll MS on healing items and OS on DPS items.
---
Nice. Thanks for posting.
---
Yes that’s a great sword. Combine it with Thrash Blade and it will last you til 60 and beyond.
---
Eye of naxx doesn't do the emote 90% of the time now
---
Yea I'm not that geared. Good blues and 3/8 t1 so not BAD. But nothing crazy lol
---
Hunters can solo it, I imagine two druids would work well with one as a healer and the other tanking.
---
Sure it stacks.  But it doesnt reduce the glancing blow damage penalty any further once you hit 308 weapon skill.
---
Awesome this is good news for me lol
---
screenshat\*
---
Not a ninja but it would have been preferrable to announce that you eanted it beforehand.
---
Razer Fang Chasm is the secret dungeon only accessible by jumping off the north eastern side of Freewind Post. If you slow fall, you won’t enter it.
---
Yea that happened to me a couple times haha
---
I’m not OP I just know I got about 4 from MC yesterday.
---
Yeah I’m not looking to play on a real competitive level I have my mage for that. I just like some of the things a druid can do. The girl used to play a moonkin back in burning crusade. She did rather well.  I hear moonkin is not the way to go in classic. Although, there was one in the uldaman and seem to do quite well although he drank all the time LOL.  Maybe I will try the spec if I don’t like it I can always change right? Thanks for the info It’s been really helpful
---
You really dont get it. I wish you a happy day.
---
I was there killing lions and it spawned so I tagged it quickly and got the kill. Man was the guy who blew the horn behind me mad. I had no idea that’s how it worked, I was just waiting for him with the horn in my inventory. That’s why you read quest text.
---
eh, close enough XD
---
Depends. Seal Fate plus Imp Backstab is a combo point machine. Add in Cold Blood and you’ve got ALLLLL the crits.
---
What's the best levelling guide for Alliance?
---
Reps during flight paths, cancel the gym
---
I know. I'm not attacking you for playing something unviable. I'm saying that because the spec you rolled for is *not* viable, the general expectation of your group members is that you wouldn't have rolled on it because you aren't actively playing it.
---
For basic items that's not a big deal, but for something as rare as HoJ, it's extremely rude to not communicate your intentions beforehand.
---
Would you put thrash or assasonation in main hand?
---
Where you fish only matters if you want to catch different types of fish.
---
You can level 0-300 in a starter zone and do so probably easier and faster than in a high level zone.  It takes forever and gets slower as you increase your skill.
---
Fishing skill increases based on the number of successful catches.  In early levels it's basically 1 catch 1 skill point.  By the late 200's IIRC it's around 8 or so per skill point if not more.
---
I tested this by comparing places like BB to fishing just outside IF in the ice lake and the skill gain.
---
Bait is only for raising your skill cap to catch fish you wouldn't otherwise be able to and or get fewer "the fish got away" messages.
---
Lol my undead has a human mask and it looks like there are black tears running down it’s face the way my hair clips through it
---
Damn just realized I need to buy her the game and gametime hahaha. Is there a version of wow I can purchase with everything she needs to play classic or do I need to buy each expansion separately or how does that work?
---
Thrash
---
Fix it later after weeding out a ton of toxic stupid people that abuse stuff like this. Seems fine to me.
---
On Smolderweb there send to be an understanding that the boat is alliance territory, but the rest of the cove is for the horde. I regularly violate this treaty with great enthusiasm, but most of the local horde won't get involved unless it spills over to the shore.
---
Isn't the PVE server pop the lowest of them all though? I have thought about it a lot, and while there is a lot of annoying moments, there are also a lot of interesting moments that come up due to having to worry about PVP. Sucks being outnumbered though 3 to 1 though.
---
so you skipped a pack but you are dumb enough to have forgotten that and ended up pulling it cause misplayed
---
clearly the skipping part is the issue 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
causation =/= correlation
---
You definitely can. When you get to 10, you'll start getting talent points. A lot of druids invest in Feral because it's a big boost to survivability and utility (faster movement in cat form when you get that, etc.), and that makes it easier to level and get around.
---
When you get to the point where you'd like to be healing full-time (some people do this at 55 or 60 to be part of a raid as a healer), you can visit your trainer and ask to "unlearn" your talents. *This gets more expensive each time you do it, so you don't want to do it often.* 
---
If you don't want to permanently go Restoration, or want to be able to juggle between DPS/Soloing and group healing, you can easily level feral and keep some gear with +int and +spi on it, and pop that gear on when you want to heal an instance. For most instances, and certainly all lower-level instances (pre-40), you will be just fine without any healing talents, but different gear.
---
If you're interested in a hybrid spec for varying play, there are fun druid specs to invest in both Feral and Restoration trees (usually the main goal is to grab Nature's Swiftness in Resto) that allow you good utility in both trees to level well on your own, and heal in dungeons.
---
Why are they reducing caps?
---
Sometimes I suggest to kill certain packs of trash that might get pulled on accident or will make the dungeon easier to navigate.  Usually the tank asks me why and I'll respond "just to be careful, it would only take a minute or so to clear them after all" which starts an argument about why you shouldn't clear that certain pack.  Usually doesn't happen, but when it does comes back to bite us I get a certain joy.
---
Dude just go 1 hour, I do 45 mins of weights and 15 min of intense cardio. 
---
It’s good to play WoW but don’t forget to lvl yourself in real life also 👌
---
That is good news!
---
if its pvp server theres shitload of possible scenarios. Maybe he had to sneak past some pvp and got hit by aoe/random flare or ae/assumed its safe so he didnt stealth and someone popped up. Idk why u tunnel vision this so badly, theres like no skill in stealthin in pve.
---
Just a little joke.
---
DM hasnt even been out a week yet. Im terribly jealous of some peoples game time.
---
In that case I hope they pay handsomely for it.
---
Do people actually buy flasks these days? The price is about 70g on my server but I have no idea if they actually sell. I have supreme power and distilled wisdom and the Titans recipe is getting pretty cheap on my server (150g)
---
Found it fast, tanaris is a good zone zf is a good dungeons. Lot's of quests to do, lot's of easy unpopulated grind spots that also make some money.
---
You mean set with no +healing but stamina/int/spirit ? It's good for any cloth casters pvp set, mage/lock/priest.
---
Stalagg has a solid core of alliance in spite of being heavily outnumbered.
---
First off, one of those items has to drop. I have seen 1 in 3 clears. 
---
Second, you have to beat out 15-20 others that also want it.
---
Depending on your luck, BWL could release before you win one.
---
I would be okey with it, as a dps specced healer.
---
I would tell you boomkin is a huge mistake though and should be avoided. But if you are a boomkin but are nice enough to heal for us of course you can roll the dps gear. Would be insanely greedy also rolling on dps/tank gear but if you plan to play feral I'm not against it. Just don't take shit you won't use
---
He didn't say vacuum cleaner....
---
Okay, thanks for clarifying that. I have a list actually, but I wasn't sure what made them so good. Some have stats, others on hit effects, etc. But now I know!
---
It's almost like the 5 of you are supposed to go in there are a team to efficiently and effectively clear the dungeon. I have never seen so many healers cry about actually having to heal, it's mind boggling. You wanted the AoE runs for the exp but also want to afk in them? Nah. If we are pulling at the pace where we only stop when the healer drinks, you bet your ass I am tapping as much as I need to in order to kill stuff. That doesn't mean i won't life drain. And most importantly I will drink whenever you drink. But my class is unique in the fact that we can keep chain pulling as long as you have mana, because your healing efficiency turns your small mana investment into my entire mana bar. 
---
Way too many people go into dungeons thinking it's 5 teams of 1 instead of 1 team of 5. I summon you, soulstone you, and give people healthstones. The least you can do is heal me when my class mechanics allow me to keep pushing out maximum dps as long as you have the ability to heal.
---
Does anyone know what addon makes it so the world looks normal instead of grey when you’re a ghost??
---
Sadly you are gonna be way behind the curve. The game requires significantly more time investment in leveling than current wow. Once you get to max level it really only takes about 30 hours of play to get pre raid bis depending on class. If you are a warrior or rogue it will take much longer. But once you are fully geared you only need to log on a couple hours a week to farm a bit of gold and log in for raid.
---
Not all gnomes are played by pedos but all pedos play gnomes
---
You can ST farm at more than twice that xp rate out in the world. Why do this to yourself?
---
You see, if some piece of gear is marked as BiS - people will go crazy over it.  
---
Even if there's some other item, that have like 0.1% worse stats)  
---
No-no, everybody want go get the best out of the best!
---
The last like, four times we've wiped in MC it's because we skipped some trash and wound up pulling it at a bad time.
---
Why would that matter in Classic? It's not like you're getting whispers from paladins on Horde or vice versa.
---
Always played a Druid, will die a Druid.

Sadly you arent even half way. The half way point is 46-47. Once you get to level 51ish the grind really hits you and it feels bad. I would recommend finding xp dungeon groups as it is the fastest level route.
---
How many deposits do you need to do in order to scam someone? Prob isn’t very effective
---
They just might not want the hassle of searching the auction house for full stacks. People definitely are willing to pay a bit over the actual cheapest prices if it means not having to wrangle the house. Additionally, thick leather is common enough to be in demand but not so important that they want it ASAP.
---
Are you just standing in place against princess? The way to fight her is to get runspeed on boots use your DoTs on her and run away.  When she catches up to you, shell usually AoE within a few seconds.  Run away from that till you're out of range, use wrath once then keep running.  You should be fine in terms of mana if you do it this way.  
---
I would swap to bear just as she catches up so she does less damage to you since she can store attacks and hit 5-6x.  
---
I've done roughly 100 runs of princess on my priest, so haven't experienced it on druid, but the key for me to make it work was runspeed on boots.  Without that it felt impossible
---
Edit: the big money maker isnt the loot from the bosses though it's actually selling the Blackstone Rings to melee dps.  There's a spot in the waterfall room where any class can stand and get credit for princess loot, meaning you don't have to even bring them to the boss.  I made 750g in 5 days roughly selling these, and that was only playing 3-4 hours a day
---
Oh right, forgot about the Darkshore boat.
---
Not in this raid tier typically, next raid tier for sure it's going to be much more viable and a better choice. This raid tier is a bit of a joke.
---
Don't listen to this guy. Threat never resets between phases. Her fireballs reset aggro. She will slowly work her way down the threat list.
---
Additionally fireballs that hit two people will only reset threat on the lower of the two. Have your tank stand next to each of the high threat players and soak fireballs.
---
The longer you are away from WoW the further you fall away from the top of the heap. Quit your job. Play WoW and obtain epic purples to become 1337. Your raid needs you more than your coworkers.
---
Yes, that's the way
---
I’ve done 40+ runs of DM east and haven't seen one at the left entrance, at Lethtendris, or Zevrim but I have seen the other ones
---
As a gm I'm always happy to hear my guildies get new stuff, just means that our raids will go smoother and that we'll go harder in pvp!
---
Also they're my buddies, ofc I'm happy for em!
---
Timewise I am well over half way. Just under 4 days rn and I'm tracking at 8/played to 60
---
I should mention that I use exp/hr add-ons and questing using the guides and questie. Dungeons seem so much slower

Can you just get your dad to ban him for using "some1"?

And that is kinda crazy, was not expecting that.

I hoped that this was a troll thread or copy pasta, but I think it isn’t, which saddens me greatly.
---
Neat plates also display shamans with pink health bars. I got so confused at first, couldn't understand how that tauren dude got a paladin before I thought of reading class name.
---
Even that is beaten by staff of westfall.
---
English is not my first language.
---
Barrens sucks for questing? You go from like 10 to 20+ in Barrens. Do things in decent order and it's a lot less running from here to there then back to here maybe a few more theres. Throw in all the mobs you can kill from quest to quest. Barrens is amazing.
---
Like seriously back in vanilla I don't think the concept of "ninja looting" applied in dungeons because you used group loot and rolled. You might be a sick but you won the item with a roll. I "reserved" one item in all the dungeons I every did and got out-rolled by someone who decided to be a dick, but that wasn't a ninja.
---
IIRC ninja was basically in runs where people ran FFA loot and people just picked shit up.
---
Yep, it can be fixed in whatever expansion/patch it was fixed in before. #nochanges
---
I picked Hunter because I like to be able to solo anything and also farming.
---
I can transform into a bear. Why wouldn't I pick this class ?
---
I think the biggest one is your pet accidentally pulling stuff in dungeons, especially the places you have to jump down a ledge. Weirdly enough there's some places where the devs decided to add in a convenient teleport (e.g. wailing Caverns after the big moss elemental boss on the uppermost level) but not in other places.
---
its weird its like karma isnt real

---
Sounds about right for today's gamers. The new generation of gamers are all beta as fuck, extremely illogical, and clueless.
---
It is the only class I did not play in Vanilla. I had a 60 of every class (including a horde shaman as I rolled on smolderthorn when it was opened). 
---
Plus, I like the idea of playing a strong 1v1 duelist class. The big reason I avoided a lock in vanilla was soul shards and pet management. I disliked hunter pets and that made it easy to just not roll a lock alt. Plus soul shards seemed annoying. 
---
Now, I don’t mind pet classes as much. And I don’t really mind farming soul shards. So it’s a much smaller issue. I already have a shaman alt (49) in the works and will likely make a few other alts over the course of months (or years if I play that long).
---
Hurf blurf no hard coding vars!
---
It’s usually the few levels leading up to 30 40 50 60 that are the most painful. Def a lot of flying arund ferelas and many other zones and cities Turing in quests running across maps. I am hunter so it’s less painful to run around and I can escape death fairly easily, unless alliance gank me
---
Oh I get it, "sleeping with the fishes" lol
---
&gt;Any other examples of "optional" packs that you don't feel are optional?
---
The first pack as you enter Dire Maul North has been my main headache. Some groups actually think its a good idea to skip this by jumping up on the ledge and waiting until the pack resets.
---
This usually fails when one of the group members fail at jumping fast enough, get killed, only for us to have to clear the pack anyway to res the guy. Even worse when the healer dies.
---
As a tank, I refuse to skip that pack now, and if they group keeps insisting we do it and get angry over my decision to just kill them, I leave and find another group instantly. Not worth my time dealing with nonsense like this.
---
I also always clear the pack of four casters in Stratholme Undead side, the one next to the Ziggurat where the frost mage boss is. The amount of times I have wiped because some moron backpedaled into the pack later on is too many to count.
---
Just do it like i did and get deathbringer on your 2nd Ony ID. Easy.
---
If someone joins or leaves your party during combat, things get fucked up and you have to reload UI to fix it
---
I didn't want to click more than one button ever 30 seconds

No, I may add quick AH scan (takes 20 sec), for now you can manually feed AH price with "/fl set \[Black Lotus\] 55.2" to set a 55.2g price for BL
---
Ofc he gets tank gear if he queues as tank. What I am saying is, I don't think you know what counts as tank gear in this current meta. A LOT of dps gear, is used by tanks as bis.
---
If you mean a warrior queueing as tank, rolling on all leather gear that he can, ofc that isn't fair. I agree.
---
And expecting others to not roll on dps gear is ofc silly.
---
What I'm saying is, a lot of dps plate, mail, weapons, jewelry and trinkets are great tanking gear, that I absolutely would expect a pure tank to roll on.
---
Usually mid-high 40's and 50's items disenchant well.
---
Speaking as an enchanter, dream dust, illusion dust and other mats are for the high-important enchants.

These are the kind of threads I was hoping to see on this subreddit.

Set hearth to Darkshire. Fly to Sentinel Hill to get to Raven Hill. If hearth is on CD, use Sentinel Hill to fly back.
---
I find myself more and more inclined to agree.  You want to reserve items in a guild group because you’re trying to gear a whole raid - I get it, but in that case keep pugs out of it.

In random group play, this is just begging for loot drama.

Exhausted is a new alliance guild on Westfall switching from the horde side due to population issues. We are looking for new members dedicated to the game. Currently re-rolling means re-leveling, but during the switch we would like to build a core that is ready to raid in 1-2 months minimum. Our current needs are social members, but also people who plan to strive for endgame content. Everyone is welcome to join, but at the same time we will be looking to build several raid ready rosters for split MC/Ony runs, as well as a community to push PvP rank in phase 2+. 
---
    Warriors: Need All
---
    Rouges: Need All

---
    Warlocks: Need All
---
    Druids: Need All
---
    Paladins: Need All
---
    Hunters: Need All
---
Exhausted is built on the hope of obtaining several core rosters to push each phase in classic WoW, and we need people who are willing to persist in that goal. We want like minded individuals who are willing to help others and be a part of a community.
---
These are the current raid times.

Well.. as a rogue of 15 years who had over 100 days played at 60 in vanilla who has yet another 60 rogue in classic as my main, I'd actually try to help you ;).  Also it's awesome you're sub instead of combat.. I don't see the point in leveling combat, you don't need the extra DPS and the utility of being sub is just so nice to have.
---
Sub is great for leveling because of the burst damage and I leveled my rogue sub originally and then again for classic (well, a hybrid spec but prep and other such tools are too useful). But you are right, you do a lot of burst damage which can cause problems... *that said* there's no reason to ever pull aggro as a rogue.
---
0. Get a threat metre. If you have Details! you already have one. They need all the group to have one for them to work but thankfully most people seem to - pay attention to it and you'll soon learn how threat works and where and when you're at risk of pulling it.
---
1. Put Feint on your bars, use it! It's only 20 energy and if you get a particularly big crit early on then immediately hitting Feint will solve your aggro problems. You wouldn't believe how many rogues never use this insanely useful ability.
---
2. Try not to have an ego. Rogues do crazy DPS in vanilla, and it's good fun, but if you're on random trash mobs that are dying in 5 seconds then honestly who cares who is getting the highest numbers? You are much better off being "that awesome rogue who specced sub, got improved sap, never pulled aggro and *still* did amazing DPS on the bosses/everywhere else it mattered". Yeah end game raids you'll probably want to respec for higher numbers but that's a long way away.
---
3. Expanding from point number 3 - if you're in a fight where the DPS *is* going to matter.. hold off a couple seconds before starting on the skull. I promise it won't hurt your end result and the tank will love you for it. If you still chain a bunch of crits then immediately hit Feint, with Vanish in reserve for when you just can't drop aggro.
---
4. Understand how your class works.. rogues don't have mana, we have energy! A lot of people don't realise this means more than just spamming abilities the instant they are up. We can go from 100 energy to zero in seconds... so it is completely fine to just autoattack a bit, you won't lose any damage regardless of when you use that energy as long as it doesn't cap out at 100. When you make your UI, ensure it includes an energy tick as well.
---
5. Onward from 5, there's other tricks you can use to manage your threat. For example if you unload on the skull and now you're about to pull aggro even after Feinting? Use your built up combo points to pop Slice and Dice (2-3 points is fine for trash) and then switch to the X, but don't use any abilities. Autoattack until your energy is about to cap out then switch back to skull and by now the tank will have all the threat they need. 
---
6. Don't always feel like you need to be going DAMAGE DAMAGE DAMAGE DAMAGE. Kick is hands down one of your best abilities.. stopping a mob from healing itself/others or preventing a mana burn on your healer is absolutely invaluable for your group., there's no words to describe how much I miss this ability when I play other classes that lack something similar.
---
7. On from 7, if you have a particularly annoying mob, consider stunlocking it instead. A caster that keeps mana burning your healer can be completely taken out of the picture with a cheap shot / kick / kidney shot. The people who matter will appreciate this.
---
Anyway I could go on forever about rogues but that's probably way more of an info dump than you expected.. hope some of it is helpful!
---
Yea, so many of these comments are absolutely fucking pathetic. I'm past being diplomatic about it.
---
Theres so much more assholery to be upset about. Flipping over a guy celebrating BiS? Jesus. 
---
Try getting mad at ninjas, chest thieves, safe spotters, trade chat racists, etc instead of being angry and petty at well meaning people.
---
Do us all a favor and quit if this triggers you due to being a miserable shit.
---
Nobody is getting their mount at level 40. People either really lucky with some random expensive drop or were farming gold for hours.  
---
Majority of players get mount at 43-44, and it's normal.  
---
Past 40 quests start to give a lot of gold. Uldaman have ~5 quests for 42, each of them giving 2-3 gold rewards.  
---
Continue leveling, do quests, sell things. Stop buying every skill, stop leveling your profession. Sell this Mageweave and Silk, don't disenchant items that better to vendor, start selling Essences and Dust. Or sell all herbs/ore/skins.
---
People are sure quick to ignore you sometimes...
---
I bought a Supreme Power flask for 65g yesterday.
---
Any name plates addon where you can disable friendly nameplates and only have yours showing
---
Also more xp.
---
Leatrix plus
---
Good idea, I'll add this to the todo list
---
You really should get it, it's super nice to have.
---
40-50 was quick for me... started out with STV, last part of Desolace and finishing some Hillsbrad/Arathi stuff.  Then started going between Tanaris, Feralas, some Badlands, finishing up the 40+ stuff in STV.  Then I was able to do Hinterlands and into Searing Gorge.
---
I'm probably forgetting a couple.  Also had 2-3 ZF runs, a full Mara run and just past 50 a full Sunken Temple run to help things along.
---
Doesn’t DW fury prot stay in berserker stance?
---
I need to figure this out because this dung is so fucking tedious and annoying
---
37-43 was pretty bad for me. I ran out of quests big time. But the future looks great! Looking forward to Tanaris.
---
I still ask my buddies to hop on vent. I've given up trying to correct myself
---
I don't recall insulting you or being mean mate, I'm just explaining why things sometimes cost money to someone who was surprised to see it.
---
Mages create food, everybody else use bandages, warlocks suck!
---
It has ruined my sleeping schedule twice or trice. Do you have anyone you care about/NEED to tend to? If not, play as you wish.
---
this is like knowing people are robbing you, admitting having police around would be nice but being like I dont want to fix this till later. 
---
Then being like we should just instead for the time being hire 50 private detectives to go around and knock on doors asking questions about the robberies and then executing them on the loosest of positive results. 
---
When you could instead hire 5 police to do the job that you are paying 50 private detective to figure out and do.

---
Could u link the gear you came up with for pvp? I play an ele shaman and am planning to pvp mainly so would appreciate it.
---
I checked out the pve bis and its all staves and cloth armor which as you said would make us a free kill in pvp
---
There's nothing I love more that seeing a mage pull 14 mobs and die.
---
That's ridiculous, most people who play WoW do so because they enjoy it. If you took 8 days to hit 60, and you "value your time at all", then buying a 60 would be worth $2000 to you.
---
&gt; Thank you! I'm currently doing Tailoring and Enchanting and finding that quite exhausting in terms of money management.
---
Ah yep, these are both quite expensive professions as you'll typically be using the items most other people vendor or AH (Greens/cloth).
---
&gt;I've picked up fishing and cooking and been levelling them as well as grinding Whelps in the Swamp of Sorrows. I think grinding dungeons is my best move at this stage and a bit more exciting then farming mobs.
---
Fishing/Cooking is nice, and you can make decent coin selling things like Deviate Fish or raid food (Grilled Squid, Tubers, Nightfin etc). But it's quite slow and tedious. 
---
Dungeons are probably your best bet, your level range is perfect for SM/ZF so spam them until you get the gold you need. If you get lucky at time you can make 5-10g per run depending on rolls/drops.
---
Edit: Another option is to sit at the bank, offer free enchantments but accept tips. I've found that people can be quite generous when they're getting something for free.
---
Nzoth?
---
Make sure no turtles make it into the water.
---
Yup, got to figure out why it disappears sometimes
---
People are downvoting you, but you have a valid point.
---
A properly geared Sword Rogue is better for raiding than a properly geared Dagger rogue, sure.
---
But be real, when Vis'kag or Brutality drops, you're going to be competing for both with every other sword rogue every non-orc fury warrior (and probably a few orcs who don't care about the racial) and even hunters for the latter.
---
That could easily be 1/3rd to 1/2 the raid right there (My guild for example usually has 6~10 rogues and 6~10 warriors in raid)
---
But dagger rogues are unicorns and thus will likely get perdition/core hound tooth uncontested the first time they drop
---
Even if you prefer sword rogue, statistically speaking you're probably better off leveling as a sword rogue then grabbing your welfare weapons off Rag and Majordomo and swapping daggers to use em while everyone else lags behind competing for viskag/brutality, then just pick em up cheap once everyone else has em and swap back.
---
Yeah but I can't see it. No matter how you slice it you're deciding to be pissy over the fact that someone else is enjoying part of the game just because you think it no big deal.
---
Some people have limited time and energy.. to them hitting 40 *is* a big deal. Getting that mount *was* a major achievement. I don't even understand people who are annoyed but silent.. is it such a big thing to be happy for the people you're supposedly friends with?
---
Maybe the event candy? The candy from the halloween event have a chance to turn you in a ghost which is basically just a 20min levitate.
---
Many warrior tanks use somewhere between 1-3 pieces of mail while tanking to aid with threat.  The mail gear tends to add some much needed hit, weapon skill, crit, and dodge.
---
Glad to see someone else having the same experience. I absolutely refuse to do this skip. Luckily I am a tank, and there's nothing people can really do when I insist we kill the mobs.
---
I may be misremembering... but I don't remember anyone needing BOEs period without asking the group first.
---
Guilty of this in Freehold runs where I'd skip to last boss for mount and have turkies who continuously failed skips. Definitely learned my lesson there and playing it safe in classic... Except that one time where I got impatient and didn't clear the last prison room before the last boss in Stockades and he feared my group into said room and wiped us. I had no idea about the fear, and felt so guilty. Especially since Stockades trash completely resets every wipe. Fortunately for me, I was able to stealth through and loot his corpse, saving me another run. Big ooph to my group though.
---
It's not worth it over dalrends.
---
My obsidian edged blade would like a word.
---
Or turn off friendly names in raid but turn yours on
---
I get bad addiction habits as well with games and if your starting to make excuses for yourself to skip gym then you need to add some structure to your life. 
---
First optimize your gym time that you should be at the gym. You shouldn't be there 2+ hours unless your socializing, playing sports etc. If your weight lifting, have your routine with substitute excersises known incase machines/benches w/e are in use. Get in get out. If you are their to socialize, then idk how wow is beating that out. 
---
Anyway. 1 hour that's it. Now ask yourself. What can you do for one hour in wow? 1 quest? Make 20g? Maybe a dungeon. Now go look at yourself in the mirror? Do you want to stay that guy? Is losing your gains/staying out of shape worth that small amount of game time? Will your health later in life be worth that 1 extra hour?
---
Srsly just don't alow yourself to play until after you gym. If you drive to they gym, don't go home from work till you go to the gym. Or go before work. I find that great for productivity.
---
Now for sleeping in time. I lose track of time. Set an alarm for yourself 1 hour b4 you need to sleep. The moment that alarm goes off you tell whoever your playing with this is my last run/quest etc. And finish what you're doing. Additionally if it's still a problem I installed Flux. It washes the colors out as the evening gets later. The game honestly starts to get so dark I don't want to play. It also helps reduce the blue light on your monitor helping you get tired.
---
/end bad habit rant.
---
Where do i find the classic shaman discord? Apologies im computer illiterate i tried googling but came up with a few different results
---
I'm being pissy by myself though, not dragging down anyone else, I even said I tell them gz. I don't understand what you want from me tbh.
---
See, that's the thing though. I like leveling, I like MC night, I like helping guildies farm Mindtap Talismans, I like random PvP shenanigans. I love playing WoW. I hate mindlessly grinding Tyr's Hand.
---
I'm not saying I buy gold, nor am I advocating for it. I'm saying I get it.
---
"RUNwwwwwwwdddddddwwwwaaa"
---
Yeah I'm not sure how intentional that was.. undead were broken as fuck in many ways in the beta/early game, to the point I feel whomever was in charge of them didn't really understand balancing.
---
Was under the impression that was the case. The item is good, but the price is so high. Same thing with Stockade Pauldrons, people asking for 200g for them
---
How about Oprah Windfury for a shaman?
---
Just simply ask if main healer needs it? If its upgrade for his main spec you should pass, its normal etiquete. "off rolls" are for spec you are not currently running or pvp gear. Respeccing talents cost shitload of gold so you shouldnt be mad at main spec prio.
---
My question is why would you blur the web site, this is easily usable as a PSA for ppl who have stuff like this happen to them, so let ppl see what web sites to block on their browsers, or let it be widely know for being a scam site at least because I doubt they only target wow players
---
Iirc yes, and nah you can stack elxirs and flasks.
---
I can still remember on a few occasions just dismissing my pet half way through his aggro run (realizing after the fact and seeing him dying).  Then when mobs wipe group and people ask what happened, I just shrug and say "I don't know, I dismissed my pet."
---
Yeah I have played both factions.  I have not noticed any real difference in factions at all in terms of personality.  Alliance draws people more focused on PvE maybe?
---
I think some servers draw more assholes for whatever reason though.
---
&gt; Is it just an instant, massive buff to bear form with no drawbacks?
---
I'm not saying it isn't...
---
I'm just saying that nobody expects their healer to roll on melee dps gear unless he states he will do so. That's literally all I am saying.
---
So why should we have an issue with the whole guild over this guy?
---
If there's no crime to commit then how do you identify and put the evil people in prison? As far as i'm concerned the bug is creating jobs for GMs and filtering out people that I wouldn't want to play with anyways. Seems like a win win in my book.
---
No, this isn't on the other rogue, it is bad communication strictly on you. The question is, at any point did you tell the other rogue before the item dropped that you specifically were after the tier 0 helm and would need it if it dropped? I'm doubting you did based off the rogues response which means the other rogue was under the impression you didnt need it as an upgrade and was surprised you selected need. Unless an item is a direct upgrade or you mentioned ahead of time you wanted that non upgrade to them, it appears to be a ninja. Now this wasn't a ninja in this case because you needed it for a purpose, but it is all on you for not communicating properly to the other players your intentions for it.
---
Gürkchen :D
---
Nah bro. Classic takes longer and involves a lot of running but at least the actual questing is engaging and not a chain of 30000 mobs that you just instagib anyways
---
Unless you plan on becoming a fitness champion I see no reason to spend 3 hours at the gym, 3 times a week 45-60 minutes. More than enough to do some gains.
---
Sleep is lost when getting kids anyways so doesn't really matter unless it effects your work.
---
If they don't respond after two inquiries it's a no, just move on.  And as someone who makes most groups I'll get spammed by dps wanting invites, I'm not going to respond to them all when I'm trying to figure out who is what spec, what roles we need, etc
---
Hey now, paladins can get thirsty for cloth too dontchaknow.
---
wow
---
Yeah but it happens a lot.
---
That’s what I figured
---
You're playing with a bunch of n00bs who don't understand the basics of the need vs greed loot system.  Use = need, sell = greed.  Simple as that.  I don't ever recall anyone doing this in vanilla.  Fights with hunters over daggers, yes... but this is a whole other level of retardation.
---
Yeah it sucks. Gl and all of that. 50-60 is better fwiw.
---
Druids not being able to interact in their shapeshifting forms is annoying.
---
Guild banks 
---
Druids not being able to use polearms, bears and cats miss out on some amazing polearms and it doesn’t make sense why we can use staves and not polearms.
---
All specs being somewhat viable. Moonkin, Ret Pallys and dps shaman are basically spat on.
---
Good ol retain mentality.
---
This was unintentional, I just accidentally put 75 in gold instead of silver. So I guess just 1, lol
---
Wow.   Excellent fucking point I had never considered.  I just assumed there was something about that Hunter class that just attracted dumbasses.
---
Fairbanks
---
Yep and you actually don’t even need to stand on the candles. You can do it right from the floor
---
I never seem to have even rage to do all these things you are mentioning
---
I went warrior, because I go warrior in every game that lets you pick one
---
Lol this is nice
---
well that went from 0 to 100 real quick
---
Druid because shapeshifting has always been, and will always be, The Coolest Thing Ever.
---
My main back in tbc and wrath was druid too, for the same reason.
---
Of course!
---
Undie on Kromcrush horde is a ninja.
---
I just followed this:  [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-enchanting-guide-1-300/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-enchanting-guide-1-300/) 
---
Try to scan the AH every time for cheap dust. Try to avoid enchants that use non-dust (generally more expensive).
---
I'd avoid the clan Toxic entirely on Kromcrush horde
---
You could do arena/anger/golem runs, probably hit the other two bosses in the start that people don't usually care about (Roccor and the Interrogator). I would avoid the highway boss (Bael'gar), the mobs on the way to him can be a pretty big heal check as they hit really hard. The grim guzzler mini bosses are also pretty easy tank and spanks, so that would be an option after Golem.
---
I would say go for it. Go in and go as far as you can. You'll have to be a little cautious to not pull any extra mobs,  but your tank hopefully will know what needs to be pulled in order to get you from point A to B.
---
Neither is evasion 🤷‍♂️
---
Halloween candy gives you levitation for 20~ minutes if you get lucky.
---
Pretentious would mean I'm of higher status. You mean "Condescending".
---
Since your expectations are really fucking bad. I'm just giving you benefit of the doubt by assuming you're young and need problems laid like they are in your math class.
---
Would be really fucking tragic if you were an adult.
---
Moonkins are called boomkins in retail.
---
Moonkins are called OOMkins in classic.
---
Mana is always gonna be an issue.
---
Can't ever say I've had this issue but as stated above turn off friendly names keep yours on
---
cant tell if memeing or?
---
Not sure why it would be considering they can always say no
---
advertising games of chance on global channels is against the rules
---
players /rolling (or dueling, or any otherwise 'legal' agreement) for gold has never been against the rules
---
source: ran a casino thru most of wotlk, paid for my mechachopper xD
---
There are no balanced PvP Servers, get over it you loser or Play PvE
---
I think it's the worst kind of people that utilize this aoe meta.
---
Same argument different perspective
---
You rolled horde on a pvp server. Don't know what else you expected
---
Had a DPS paladin basically "steal" a good blue ring with a rare-ish random enchant (~3%) from our patient warrior tank not too long ago. It was practically ideal itemization for a tank, and while it wasn't BiS they probably would have held onto it for a fair while.
---
Since you obviously have a hard time finding motivation to gym skip the Arnold workout and train like normal people 3-4 exercises of each important muscle group breast, back, leg, biceps, triceps, shoulders and abs. Split them into 3 days and you'll have time for both wow and gym
---
If you can eliminate the action or thing that you consider evil why leave it easily accessible? 
---
It's like leaving a gun loaded in the middle of the town and then being upset when some crazy psycho uses it to kill people.
---
What the fuck did you expect? That no one would touch the gun or some crazy fuck wouldnt use it? 
---
So why leave the gun? "So we can find out the crazy people"
---
Sounds like a lose-lose, who exactly wins in this scenario.
---
Your win-win is very chaotic evil lol. gotta kill a few people to find the bad apples y'know?
---
"How do we eliminate griefers if we dont let them grief?" -You
---
Hmm I dunno eliminate the action they use to grief entirely lol?
---
ok
---
Dude what the actual.. I remember a post a week or two ago about some creep whispering a guy after a duel saying some messed up shit, and people in the comments encouraged op to report him. Please tell me this is enough to be reported then too? No one should have to hear that ever, what a messed up thing to say
---
Crit is more important for warriors because of their talents that proc off of crits.
---
Edit: On the blocking: the amount of damage you block is based on your block value. It is not like a dodge or parry where all damage is mitigated.
---
Block is determined by the block rating of the shield and also str. I don't know the exact number of str to block but it does factor, but no block never blocks all damage, it just mitigates.
---
not enough volume to be worth flipping a market over.
---
Warriors only roll on them cause it's bis. If they gears were more shit, we wouldn't be.
---
Please learn the basics of macro programming...
---
"Shitter mage"
---
Thanks imagination for twisting that into a weird, secret scatalogical spec. I need some mental bleach now.
---

You’d level faster if you knew how to progress the quest tho :p
---
Startattack
---
Yeah and some people believe he actually killed himself in Org. Crazy!
---
I vaguely recall there being different languages even within a faction.
---
I mean considering that specific phrase was popularized during the first crusades in very specific scenarios like cleansing entire cities from young to old, it means exactly what it means. Present day idiots use it for a reason. Dont know why you want so specifically to have people name their guilds after shitty extremist phrases linked with bloodbaths, when you have infinite non-shitty alternatives.

What boss do yo do in uour jump runs? Is there a special trick to know?

OprahWindfury reporting

Which is why they spend all day on Reddit and discord...

There's a handful of actual tanks at 60. The rest are Arm/Fury tanking. Of course we're going to roll on DPS gear.

Just don't respond to them, those filthy dps peasants are used to it anyway.

nope i am horde  and i know there is kinda a small horde side here and wanna help with the population with tanks as well.
---
Yep, I would left if I saw someone get kicked
---
YNAN - You're not a ninja, but Everyone here is wrong.
---
You were right regarding the setup, you were brought in as a tank but wanted to roll on that item, for your primary build. You rolled on it as was your right. You won it. Their misconceptions and poor play and platitudes don't factor into this.
---
Doing x amount of runs, having good or bad luck for 6 weeks, a prior group being rude to you, a mage stealing something from you, having to put up with hostility etc. have nothing to do with you being a ninja or not, and really don't factor into your original statement.
---
I realize it was catharsis to explain that all, and I am glad this community is here to help out with that. But need rolls for gear is really a platonic thing. You needed it. No one said before the run began you couldn't have it. It's really that simple.
---
It has the best set bonus in game but I don’t know that it out damages current BiS, otherwise it would be...
---
4 piece dark mantle on the other hand according to what I’ve read CAN be as good if not the best.
---
Macro a jump into every ability that way you will be constantly jumping
---
ticks and fleas
---
you can solo ZF graves and I'm fairly sure it's worth a lot more gold than 15 an hour but if you're still leveling then mara seems like a good spot too
---
practice dueling your friends. you’ll eventually get the hang of it. just takes mat time. :)
---
Just say your looking for ranged, bam ez pz

What’s up man? Alia, the mage :)

Calm down bud, there's an ignore feature. Behavior like this shouldn't get a rise out of you so easily. I personally get a kick out of witnessing a good ol' dumpster fire group like this one every now an then.
---
Twinking was part of classic.
---
I run Mara for gold on my Warlock and I think it dropped like 3 times in like 10 runs these last few days. Keep at it cause it will drop, OR if you hit 60 and still don't have it you can pay Warlocks to solo her for you. usually cost like 20 to 30g on average
---
I'm so disappointed I thought bgs were phase 2. Gives me time to level an alt I suppose
---
you could just memorize your keybinds and hide them behind the UI
---
If my mana is good I'm happy to heal you as a healer, overall my mana converts to your mana pretty efficiently (something like 3 for every 1 of mine). But making the entire group waiting for my extra drinking while you don't drink is selfish -- it's a fine line. Sort of "I know it when I see it."
---
Worst are warlocks who don't drink OR tap, until the next pull is started. Great, now I have to get heal aggro or let you die to AoE (or your aggro because you're already dotting and the mob hasn't reached the tank) because you didn't do it at the end of the last pull, or even while I was drinking, just stood there like a dumbass.
---
remember guys, you dont actually have to press 'jump' you can just walk fall off and save yourself just at tiny extra bit of damage that otherwise might have killed you.
---
You can grind as a holy/disc priest. Quests are still able to be completed.
---
Added you
---
You can hit that greed button on all those BoEs then, because obviously you dont NEED them.
---
You're not a victim if the only way for you to fall for the scam is to be a shitsucker yourself.

---
Just say, "full on warriors"
---
Technically true
---
Gnome mages are notorious dickheads
---
You cannot tank at 60 without holy shield. Currently 58 paladin tank, 75% of my threat comes from HS. If I were to drop it, then GL trying to outthreat any decent dps.
---
Just a sad warrior with a rogue GM who also thinks every piece of gear is better for him than a warrior.
---
Paladins are alliance only so that's out the window. and I really don't like tauren cat form. There is also no tree form in classic.
---
Spent a time deciding between shaman and priest, but eventually the shaman won out. Mainly due to all the utility they offer, the fact that chain heal has a really cool animation doesn't hurt either. I'm a bit of an altaholic so i've played all classes sans monk and demon hunter at max level at some point another, but the ones i have the fondest memories of are my shaman, so i decided to revisit that for classic.
---
Yup but apparently it's an aspect of the game people are not allowed to enjoy. If you enjoy things in this game that isnt pve, shame on you. 
---
You will find the moment you talk about thinking your character people will turn their noses up and think you just slapped their baby.
---
That's actually a change that positively surprised me about retail: you can order your pet to run to a specific position rather than having to rely on indirect positioning effects like attack/follow.
---
Classic grammar  police, sad that people still hasnt realized there are as much non native english speakers and has to point out every misspell.
---
Most of these groups don't even use tanks. 3 mages, one warlock for eye of kilrogg, and a priest to bubble the eye and heal. No tank needed usually.
---
Dwarf hunters and they always fail. They failed upon rolling dwarf hunter.
---
My guild has an effort point system where attending raids and downing bosses gathers you effort points. Receiving gear gives you gear points. Your total effort points are divided by gear points coming out to your priority level. The higher priority meaning you “win” drops but you lose priority as soon as you receive something. Just keep showing up to raids and you get gear. Not instant gratification but it is fair.
---
I feel this so hard. I’m 44 and the grind of leveling has slowed to a snails pace. I can’t leave the little hub in Tanaris and go far without getting ganked so it’s hard to go after these plentiful quests and mobs that everyone talks about. Every time I get into pulling mobs or questing a group of Horde players sets their eye on me like I’m Christmas dinner.
---
I can see where you come from but, it can be annoying when somebody will need for 2 different specs when doing instances or raids eg. we have a ret paladin in our guild who heals during raids at first he thought he would be able to roll as ret as well as healing but you see that's not quite fair for the healers as well at our dps warriors. So my take on this is that you roll as the role you play unless you tell and make it clear to your group our group before you enter the dungeon.
---
I had this in vanilla. Loved it
---
Killed her 3 times as a hunter leveling up, seen it drop twice. Ended up losing it to the tank the first time and a fury warrior who did under 10% of dps during the dungeon the second time :/
---
You get a like, and you get a like! You all get liiiiiiiiikes!!!
---
I'm surprised more people don't run with ML and clear item guidelines. There's no way I would be doing dungeon runs on need before greed. Otherwise assholes can need items they can't use to grief. At least if it's ML  and someone ninjas you can report them.
---
Calm down softie, maybe you shoudnt do ++ without doing normal firsts or just climbing keys progressively? If anything playerd there expect some kind of knowledge from you, cuz you are signing up for challenging content. Runs are timed so if you dont know what to do tell/ask teammates before they use a key. And if it took you 45mins to get invited then prolly you aimed too high with so little to show. And ofcourse classic is more friendly, worst thing you can do is pulling another pack.
---
Nerf that ish with Kenjimuyo yeh man hi
---
I rolled a lock this time cause i knew how broken they are in world pvp, little to no effort against average players required. Also they are in high demand for raids and pve in general. Basically i chose to play the game in easy mode.
---
By your logic, raising is the most unfair practice of all. 40 people going in and maybe 50% of them getting upgrades. Most guilds bank all BoE items to make money for consumables and things for further raiding. You won't see a dime of it unless you're the guild upper echelon.
---
If an item dropped that immediately upgraded your setup (let's say your a hunter), but a mage wins it for cash, you're telling me you don't feel duped ever so slightly, because it's fair that he gets money and you get nothing? 
---
It makes sense to me that an upgrade goes to who needs it, and rare cases of extremely precious loot be dealt with in a method previously established by the group. Cut out the middle man and upgrade someone's equipment.
---
That would be the dream eventually but by the time you add multiple characters, multiple panels and backgrounds / props the time sink to make a comic grows exponentially so for now it's just [memes](https://tapas.io/TallFrodo) so I still have some time to play wow after drawing and work.
---
If nothing else, my lettering is a long way from comic quality :P
---
It’s sad that I know this is fake because when you responded it didn’t say he was ignoring you.
---
Bad bot
---
Eh, I was a Naxx / AQ40 raider and maintained separate PvP and DPS gear. Raid DPS gear tends to leave you very squishy - absolutely bonkers with a healer but useless solo.
---
Your raid leader is a joke and so is your guild.
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.93559% sure that Duality_NA is not a bot.

Accused?
---
dwarves have been the most agressive, and nightelves but only when they are in duos+ with other nightelves
---
Or he could use classiclfg with classic.
---
Telling people how to play is lame.
---
Bad healer
---
Its even better for a 2h warrior because the extra swing is with a 2 hander.....
---
You shouldn't care at all about a warrior rolling on HoJ unless you are fucking stupid.
---
And your dodging as to why "need" in this situation outweighs "greed".
---
The only reason we're having this discussion is because there's some arbitrary distinction between the two, when really the only mechanic difference is a need roll beats a greed roll.
---
There's nothing that says your "need" is more important or valid than someone's "greed" and while the mechanical difference is fine in most cases, in cases where need/greed are effectively interchangable like in the case of BIS BoE epics, it breaks down.
---
Which is why everyone should need, since there's no difference between your "need" and someone else's "greed" and a flawed mechanical system shouldn't dictate behavior
---
And to avoid having shadow priests roll on healer drops i simply don't invite them
---
Well, after DM it's hardly as much of a game changer.
---
If my understanding is correct, the *first* +5 dagger skill (assuming combat daggers with +5 skill from talents) equates to a massive +3% hit against raid bosses. The next +5 skill points (taking you to 315 total dagger skill) only equates to +0.5% hit.
---
Now that you can much more easily obtain +5 dagger skill from Mugger's Belt or +6 from Distracting dagger (solid offhand with a 1.3 attack speed) these suddenly aren't as insane.
---
I know there further hit beyond soft cap still has value (I've read equivalent to 14-20 AP pr. % depending on overall stats).
---
Sure, they remain decent gloves but I feel like weapon skill is widely misunderstood, there is a *massive* amount of diminishing returns when stacking it.
---
If anything I wrote above is wrong or anyone have elaborations, please chime in.
---
This is interesting to hear because I'm running HS at the moment and find that I hardly ever have to use it. I almost certainly don't use it on trash and I only use it on bosses for damage mitigation. I'm sure the threat helps against single target boss.
---
This is my current build:  https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/055531-053201330301551
---
Man iv been grinding so hard in real life but I just cant seem to get any good BoE's to drop. Any tips for better gold/xp per hour as an alternative?
---
It's called Eyes of the Beast in classic ;)
---
Maladath, Runed Blade of the Black Flight has entered the chat
---
Yea I think you deserved it grats :)
---
Trying to rip someone off = victim, i getcha
---
Fair, you could add In like a sheep squared lmfao
---
Guild Wars did that. Leveling to 20 is basically the tutorial, and then you're 90% of the way to maximum strength and everything from there is completionism and horizontal progression (unlocking more options). It was a cool way to do it.
---
I think too many games are afraid that people will stop playing as soon as they max out their character's power.
---
Recognizable as a paladin though lol
---
idk if this is the case. But I personally often wait with needing on minor upgrades to see if anybody else in the group needs the item before I need it, so I could pass for them.
---
1 guy represents whole guild? This also deserves a whole post?
---
Raiding is fair as long as it's not a corrupt guild. Everyone walking into the raid has a chance at gear. Fair.
---
The gbank taking boes to fund further raids is essentially a membership fee, if you don't like it don't raid with that guild. Fair.
---
If a boe drops and the hunter gets to roll on it too, that's fair. He had a fair roll, he just lost. He can be a sore loser about it, but it wasn't unfair.
---
Yes everyone needs upgrades, a boe is an upgrade for everyone, so everyone gets a chance.
---
So you are indeed saying that because of the arbitrary middle step, someone should get an upgrade by default over other people? That's not fair.
---
You're running angerforge, not the emperor right? ;)
---
You're basically there already my fellow warrior. Focus on farming your pre-raid bis. You'll be 60 long before you get all of them. Focus on getting your hit to at least 6% (preferably 9%), TS shoulders or the Wyrmhide shoulders are important. Mask of the unforgiven is one of the best and easiest items for u to get. Farm scholo for bloodmail boots or windreaver + a decent chest ( tombstone or cardavourous).
---
From there you can start picking out what items you want most.
---
Don't be like me and start farming the hardest items. HoJ and SGC can wait. We Fury bois have a lot of time to farm those before phase 3.
---
Do it with guildies or friends if possible. Makes the grind a lot more fun and much less painful.
---
Well in Mythic+ you are racing against a timer so you need to take the most efficient route otherwise you might not beat it in time, plus the faster you beat it the more rewards you get. So I can understand when time is a factor, you want to take the most efficient route and skip as many groups you can. Because the bosses aren't the hard part of Mythic+ a lot of the time, it is the trash.
---
In Classic there is no such timer so you might as well chill and take your time.
---
My friends and I have a very poor job of communicating which server we should all be on.  Consequently, I’ve started mains on servers three times now.
---
First two I went druid - druid was my first raiding character in retail way back when, and I’ve always enjoyed the class and the community around the class.
---
This last time though, for a change of pace I tried a mage.  It has some real conveniences and real weaknesses.  For the most part I’ve enjoyed it but am also ready to fall back into my druidic ways.
---
It’s always funny when people quit playing games because of such nonsense. No one cares, you will come back. Until then you brave White knight 😂
---
Interesting, I start every fight with downrank holy shield, just to get that increased block (to proc sanc) and get some early threat in. Then take the rest of the fight nice and easy with seal and judge of wis
---
more mobs to pickpocket, go right ahead imo
---
With regards to WPVP and balance - have Blizzard ever looked at capping the balance of power to a certain percentage +/- the other side and any extra are unflagged till a spot becomes available.  
---
EG 1000 players logged on. 700 Horde. 300 Alliance. To artificially create balance the last 300 Horde to login are unflagged. Therefore a war of 400 v 300 which isn't quite as ridiculous as the 700 v 300.
---
:O
---
Way better than 95% of the ad infested guide sites!
---
As a undead rogue I feel like human paladins take one look at me and believe it is divine justice to kill me.
---
You can use Target of Target frames and look at the tank, he might be focusing another add at the time but usually he's targeting the target.
---
Otherwise tabbing as previously said works fine too.
---
Did not know about the AOE, I have not done research on boss actions yet, but I was planning on getting to that once I reached 60. I have noticed the threat distance thing though, when you have the most threat but the mob can't reach you, they will attack whoever is in range of them without walking. That's good to know going into this though, thanks for the info!
---
Gnome mage. Just annoying assholes
---
Use testosterone and trenbolone.
---
I had a strat live run and I asked "is everyone cool with Round Robin for orbs ?" 2 said yes and the other 2 didn't reply.
---
So we clear through the ud side and I stop at the gate and ask again (I'm tanking so they have to wait)
---
The healer says it doesn't seem fair but isn't sure. So I explain what round Robin is, we all roll on orb, winner passes on any of the next ones till everyone gets one, it's the most fair it could be. And the healers like "oh I didn't know that's what it meant that's super fair let's do that"
---
The Rouge still hasn't said anything, so I call him out directly and ask are you cool with RR, I need an answer b4 we start pulling so everyone knows how to roll. 
---
And he flips out. "I don't want to do RR if your going to do RR then I'm just going to leave!" so I said, "well that's why I asked, you sure? It's definitely the best way not to get screwed by rng, but I guess we will just all greed"
---
And he says no, I'm leaving RR is dumb and I don't want to play that way and drops group and hearths out. So we grab another Rouge and all walk away with an orb.
---
Moral of the story is even if you try to be transparent / fair, some people are still going to get upset.
---
Conjure food. Nuff' said
---
I started playing Paladin in diablo 2 and loved the class fantasy so it was easy first choice in tbc when I started wow. Went pally in classic as well and I’ve tried to level alts but hsve much less interest in them
---
Why? If the tank methodically does long range line of sight pulls you should be fine.
---
Agreed. Across the board. Hate them
---
Are you pregnant?
---
Saw it drop today for the first time at 101 kills. Gave it to my rogue guildie though, he offered me 50g for passing and I still need to farm BRD more for my SGC and I also need gold for my Lionheart helm. :p
---
What server do you play on? Can I have your gold when before you close your account?
---
Can confirm, am gnome mage.
---
Seen a priest named Ally McHeal.
---
We actually had a group do SM Armory with a Tank and 4 DPS because the leader forgot we had no healer. In the end, we actually managed just fine with our ret pally just auto-attacking and using his mana to top the tank off every now and then. But it would probably have gone pretty badly with zero healing capability!
---
You’ll say &lt;n-bomb&gt; but no decency to not filter  a word that is highly offensive to a lot of people. Good ol’ gamers l0lz0r 1337 bro dog.
---
i had a similar dilemena as you, trust me just push through it and start doing the high lvl dungeons (blackrock mountain, dire maul) assuming you're not just getting carried by geared 60s should be a lot more than just 2 2 2 , having to manage aggro, polys, dealing with patrols and stuns/silences/etc
---
I’m excited
---
Rogues in any faction are always dickheads I have found.  Feels like half of them like to roll rogues just to take on clothies while the clothie is already engaged grinding against an NPC.
---
Had a rogue last night in Searing Gorge (my Warlock is 52) who was Level 52 also and I was just grinding on the Lookouts and the War Golems and probably 3-4 times he would sneak up stealth while I was fighting the NPC and proceed to kill me.  When you see their true colors of course is when they are forced into an actual fight.  One of the times he killed me I had a soulstone up and I hit my soulstone, death coiled him and put two dots on him and rather than fight me he sprinted off like a little girl and vanished.  That's all I needed to see - wouldn't fight unless you are half health fighting something else, anything else they run.
---
unless its a little kid I don't feel bad for anyone who falls for this tbh its such an obvious scam lmao
---
Yeah whenever an epic drop, I try to ask all before anybody press anything if we all should just need on the item. Haven't had anybody getting angry about that in my groups so far.
---
You have to be mentally 12 years old to enjoy barrens chat.
---
I went mage. I always tanked and wanted something radically different. I started playing wow in its inception and I realized very quickly that people had absolutely no idea how to tank. I rolled a warrior and barked when anyone made a mistake and I ended up tanking for a raiding guild. One swing of the camera and I knew exactly who of 40 people were messing up.
---
Mage is stupid easy and fun. I only have a few hours a week to play so I know I will never raid again. My goal is to complete every quest possible be an Azeroth wanderer and all around scrub.
---
I picked mage due to the convenience of being to teleport to cities, and because I can be a gnome. That’s literally it.
---
I'm about to hit 40 soon as well. I'll be able to afford my mount I think, but I do have a similar concern. I don't want to feel burned out after this milestone.
---
What I'm saying is why does there have to be an extra step of selling it and buying another upgrade when it can upgrade someone right this minute? There are thousands of items in this game, and you'll get your chance at any number of them. Why consciously screw someone out of a right now upgrade by taking it from them for your own gain? That is, by definition, greed.
---
exactly that as well
---
Ran 70 runs to get this :) while struggling to find a tank half the time. It’s a euphoric feeling to get it.
---
You might need to spend money on pots for rag until you have him on farm. That is about it.
---
I'm very curious about these numbers as I've read that Shamans simply cannot be tanks in raids (not that I doubt it) but I'd be interested in OT and what the number required are.
---
true it takes some serious balls to own up to a reddit comment.  im such a coward
---
also 31/5/15 is a good pvp arms with some prot talents for tank
---
This guy Scholo’s
---
Carrot on a Stick represent
---
Yeah this was a warrior, 2 rogues, mage and i forget the other class but it was not a healing class at all.
---
Well.. It beats dalrends still so you can decide if it's worth it. Visqag is much better however.
---
Yeah but I've done maybe 10 Princesses and have seen 4. We even out.  
---
Small sample sizes are small.
---
They should try SWTOR where you have permanent stat buffs locked behind parkour elements. I kid you not.
---
No, you are a saint among people.  That rogue is probably a kid with severe acne, or a 40 year old virgin.  Grats on the cape!
---
http://www.mediafire.com/file/fg19esagjyfj3yl/RogueDPS_Bloodmoon_v.1.8.xls/file
---
That's ridiculous.  You're not going to have 1k people all in one spot fighting anyway, so capping it would just create imbalances in different zones depending on who gets flagged and who doesn't.
---
I'm not sure we're on the same page here.  I know what /startattack is but I don't know what you're saying to do with it or how it can help me accomplish my goal.  I believe there is a misunderstanding between us about what for which I'm looking.
---
These items help raids, but they are not essential in any way. The flask is the major cost and what contributes to about 50-60g worth of consumables per run. 
---
But in general all you really need is to:
---
Buy 4-5 Greater Fire Protection potions (2-3g/ea)   
---
Buy some Nightfin Soup/Grilled Squid/Tubers or equivalent food  
---
Buy 4-5 Restorative Potions (few g for a stack)  
---
Buy Greater Arcane Elixer for casters (2-3g/ea) or Mongoose Potion for Melee (2-3g)  
---
Other than that, you can get world buffs (Onyxia), DM buffs (Tribute run), and the food buffs from Blasted Lands that more than make up for a lack of flasks.
---
Is it up in the twitch client now too? i see a farmlog with 0 downloads from w33dm0nk3y
---
Which Server are you playing?
---
I will farm it for you for free as a warlock.
---
At low lvl there’s very little rage too dump. Druids don’t generate shit for rage till you get some Crit gear and ur talents. I’m not saying don’t ever swipe but if there’s 3 mobs just maul each one before u start spamming swipe.
---
Didn’t get my mount until 42, luckily my two friends both rolled mage, so they were balling in gold and even helped me out.
---
I there an addon or something in interface options that will let me how class colors in raid group rather than 40 green boxes?
---
Leatrix Plus does lots of those things in one addon.
---
so... no conflicts, easy to update (its one addon!) and good performance!
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic) 
---
not to mention the sexiest map addon ever to go with it...
---
Awesome, I'll keep that in mind when I work towards getting gear. I heard skarm recommend 380 defense going into MC, but besides that I was going to try and get as close to Pre Raid BIS as I could for now. I'll keep benchmarks like this in mind. Thanks for the info!
---
Can this be done as pally warr?
---
My rotation trash is:
---
Pull with Judge of Righteousness on Skull, Consecration, Seal of Wis, attack skull till about 50% and then switch to X, rank 1 Consecration. 
---
Generally I leave the fight with 80% mana. This often means I lose aggro on skull at around 20% health left but usually but just stun them and I have no aggro problems with the rest of the pack for the rest of the fight. 
---
I run ret aura + improved righteous fury.
---
it was a non damaging curse
---

---
Well, at least he dropped the group so you guys could get a healer rather than kicking one of the DPS he had invited. XD
---
Jokes on them I have 30
---
Heh, in my world 'shitter' is just a common term for a shitty player.  Never thought of it in that way.
---
cool you can download mobs now?  i want that draenei boss duo in throne of thunder please... where can i download them?
---
Use the assist key (F). This will select your target’s target. 
---
Ex. Tank is attacking skull. You click tank, press F. Now you have skull targeted.
---
I was on my hunter when a krol blade dropped. I needed on it and I won it, then I sold it on the AH. I ninja'd that weapon, I did not actually need it, I took it because I wanted the gold I knew I could make from it. That is what a ninja does. You don't sound like a ninja to me.
---
In vanilla after stratholm ud runs on my mage I would usually go back and open all those supply crates that we skipped for those sweet potions and holy water.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Come back, u/dbauch!
---
Have some fucking conviction.
---
Trinketmenu by FAR. Cant and wont play without it! Even If I only had 3 trinkets...
---
This behaviour shouldn’t be tolerated or simply ignored. I’d report that kind of talk. Telling someone to kill themselves over a video game is a total overreaction and creates an unnecessarily toxic environment. It absolutely should be reported so it can be dealt with.
---
The classic community with their bipolar moods on twinks and changes.
---
I can’t say you weren’t asking for it. Hopefully you appeal and he lifts the ban.
---
Flask and buff food/potions are ridiculous over kill for MC and Ony.
---
But you should bring mana and or healing potions.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion but if you join a group and don't make it clear that you intend on rolling for Off spec, you're kinda scummy. I wouldn't say it's ninja'ing, but not making that clear from the get go puts unfair expectations from other members, who probably could have rather waited longer for a strictly tank player to join.
---
Consider the flip side where your dps steals your shield because "I'm actually a tank, I was just dps'ing this time"
---
Happens on kill quests all the time. 
---
Kill 15 wolves. Players ride around where questie tells them. Only kill wolves. Sooner or later all the spawn points are taken by spiders. They continue riding around, bitching in general about no spawns.
---
I feel attacked as both a classic mage and a vanilla hunter lol
---
r/unexpectedsabaton
---
If i'm posting via a macro and don't need/want a specific class i just have a message like "Sorry, we have enough physical/melee dps" saved to the CopyPasta and just whisper those rogues &amp; warriors who's asking to join.
---
I have a paw caster named JoeWorgan
---
I do almost all my instances with a guildie tank. Most LFG posts of mine starts with LF3M DPS. I get hit with 5-8 DPS almost instantly.
---
Idk man. I have a hard time believing that a troll from a small coastal village understands the complexities of a  vacuum
---
I spend way too much time on the AH lol. Used to have crazy gold up until Cataclysm when I played retail, so I kind of just took my knowledge of that game into this one.
---
Don't want to go into details because it has diminishing returns the more people know about it, as a lot of gold things in wow, but a mix of 4 professions on 2 characters (alt is 35 ftm), plus leveling up cooking and fishing helped. People sleep on those two side professions for sure.
---
Gonna potentially have to get rid of one of those professions for engineering, now that I'm finding out how clutch it is for tanking though :(
---
With DM tribute runs, I'm seeing a lot more of "LF1M Rogue DM Trib"
---
I don’t believe this syntax is supported by Classic.
---
What's different for them, though?
---
heh, i actually fixed that typo before you made your comment
---
I was thinking about this last night on my rogue in SM too LOL. I saw a chest in SM Arm and it was red, so I told them I couldn't unlock it (because I couldn't) then I thought, there was no way for them to know. I am going to start doing that if I don't like my group xD
---
Short answer: no
---
Longer answer: nope
---
I'm in no rush to get it ftm, would rather have good gear to start off, but that's just me. Epic mount always felt like a clout chaser, but i'll get it eventually lol.
---
There's an interface option, I forget which one but I have mine displaying as class colors rather than green.
---
Check your raid options or your interface options, it should be there.
---
Fuck that rogue, he was just salty because he didn't get the cape.
---
Also, Grats to your new cape!
---
most of the mob skipping wipes i have experiance are the normal skips but you have a low level dude who due to range pulls the mobs.
---
At least you're a self aware coward
---
Druid for nostalgy. But I learn to realise how great this class is. Even if not as strong as other classes at a particular role. Druids have so many tools. So many options. I just really miss out of combat rez but I guess it ads to the class identity.

What’s the strategy to grind this reputation?
---
What's the best way to judge gear based on Intellect + Spirit compared to Increased DMG By Spells by X. Resto Sham here looking got best gear comparing two. One has 12 Intell and 10 Spirit, other has +22 DMG/Healing. Is there a specific correlation between the two to judge which is best, i.e one Intell = 8 DMG etc. Looking not just for this piece but understand how to compare stats to increased output for other gear too.
---
Ok ty!
---
Yeah, you can write cyrillic in chat on english servers, but not in names. It's not madness, it's the only right thing to do, and I think that those weird nordic and accented letters should be confined to german/spanish/etc realms as well.
---
I got banned during WOTLK for running a casino.
---
I do some trash pulls with no healer while waiting. It's a game of can the dps kill them before I die and then they get killed. Good times.
---
spoilsport!  i still want my draenei boss duo though...
---
Gnome anything. They're evil little fuckers.
---
There has to be that extra step because thats what's Fair.
---
I'm arguing for fairness here, the argument of impatience you're making doesn't convince me.
---
Do you go with blessing of sanc? Or kings?
---
I find even with Holy Shield I leave with 70-80% mana purely because I run judge and seal of wisdom which with hanzo sword hices me solid returns. I am sceptical on wisdoms threat through...
---
Nobody should expect that their tank is a main spec tank anyway. It's not like protecting wars bis is defense items. Most of the time they need to pump out damage to keep threat high.
---
I figured that was it.
---
I was supposed to be the healer in my group of friends, I was taking my time leveling and another friend leveled past me and now he is the healer, so here I am, speced shadow and oom most of the time, but its sort of fun I guess?
---
Love that sharp as tack warlock who in that instant remembers that curse of recklessness prevents fleeing.
---
My fav: wipe to a pack that shoulda been pulled. Everyone running back and someone aggros another skipped pack and dies again
---
I get red, the constant need for external validation do get old. But I know people like that IRL and it is kind of sad that they need so much external validation in their life. And his point about parents is harsh, but true in many of these cases.
---
I’m a healer.  I use 1 FR pot and 5ish nightfin soup every raid.  Every once in a while, I might use a potion. 
---
I think I’ve only died maybe 4 times in the last month of clearing MC &amp; Ony. 
---
If you’re pushing big DPS numbers, you’ll use a LOT more consumables, but this tier of raiding doesn’t need to cost a lot.
---
You can start saving rage near the end of a fight, then u go into the next one with full
---
Depends on where are you going and if you actually have a mount, but yeah. Still, that blink's fall negating component is too poweful, that's why in retail almost all of the classes have their own "fuck-physics move".
---
Wait for some Rogues to get Vis'Kag MH and Brutality OH. You already have some dagger rogues with both Perdition's and CHT whereas none of the top dagger rogues have both of their BiS weapons. Then once BWL drops it will only swing further in Swords favor with CTS and Maladath while Dagger Rogues will keep Perdition's and CHT until C'thun.
---
I know people like Cats for all their little perks such as stealth, Claw and Dash to go with their high damage and attack speed but I've been using a [rare plainstrider](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=2172/strider-clutchmother) and haven't had a moment yet where I wish I had a Cat to do the job instead.

Shadow priest dwarves are absolute pvpaholics

Felstriker is also a good tank weapon because of its weapon speed.
---
Insinuating that people who grief on video games go out and do worse things irl if they cant grief people in games. 
---
Can you give an example where this has ever held up in court lol? This argument has been used for decades yet has always come back false. 
---
And of course it's just very similar
---
You are essentially suggesting
---
That in order to prevent griefing we need to let griefing happen in the first place lmao? I don't think this line of logic has ever worked.
---
Well so for jump runs we run a heal/dps/tank and one is a herb and other miner
---
Kill water ele boss -&gt;sacrifice satyre boss -&gt;final boss. Takes about 12 min depending how much we're fucking around or ass pulling while chatting on discord. Your teams gotta be on it tho to get good times and we run a druid tank so I innervate on CD the healer so we never stop for mana.
---
Also you should be clear about distribution, I run with people I know so we just spit everything dead even and AH/sell things and mail each other their splits when they sell. Not sure how pugs run it.
---
My comment was mainly in jest. These posts about acquiring an item and displaying their character are very popular right now. So in my eyes if someone wants to brag about a single item, we might as well start bragging about every single achievement.
---
Got mine today, tipped the Master Warlock 85g
---
*cries in warlock*
---
Fucking hell!
---
Edit: that was my initial reaction. A very, very inappropriate laugh to go with it.
---
That's racist bro
---
Oh yea, I've accepted I'll be first to die a lot. I'll take a couple bullets for the team though lol. 
---
But yea, from what it sounds like in the comment thread, it's not an objective baseline, but rather just approaching stat priority as efficiently as I can, so I'll just make sure to have great hp and defense while still focusing on threat generation. Thanks for the reply!
---
I kinda agree with this guy. If the healer is gonna try and heal you and the tank is breaking his back but still taunting off you, why not continue to play balls out? 
---
Let em die a few times and run back. Maybe then a constructive comment or two may sink in? 
---
And no... I don’t play a dps toon, nor do I waste my mana healing or res’ing one who is fully aware they are playing like an ass.
---
Some Logan Paul spot
---
Oh man. I'll never forget the day I convinced my parents to buy me eq after I played it at a friend's house only to get home and realize i didn't have enough hd space. Oh the pain...
---
Thank you Captain Obvious
---
Are pun names like this allowed on RP servers? All the pun and joke names I see in Classic really annoy me because I'm a no fun old loser. 
---
Am I the only one who feels like 50% of names are some sorta string of words or pun or wordplay compared to back in Vanilla where that sorta thing was actually a novelty. 
---
We had a rogue undead high warlord on my server named Ihategnomes and I remember thinking that was so funny because I hadn't seen someone do that. Now it's so overdone it kinda ruins my immersion. 
---
I know I'm way in the minority and I kinda wish I rolled an RP server but would it even be that much better there? Seems like the gamer culture is more towards silliness like that now-a-day in general and I just have to get used to it.
---
Edit: I don't mean to shit on people who love this kinda thing, just really surprised me as someone who doens't play online games much and the last MMORPG I played was vanilla WoW. Puns are great if that's what you like!
---
spoke to a GM who just basically told me that as long as I
---
1. did not advertise in globals or spam my advertisement in locals channels
---
2. honored the rolls/bets/etc
---
that i would be safe (and i didnt get banned)
---
did you have an unhappy customer, or scam someone maybe? as long as you honor the rules of whatever /roll game you're doing and you dont spam your /s /y macro you shouldn't have been banned
---
It also keeps people engaged. I’m not playing wow to work on my platforming and metal gear solid sneak skills
---
It's fair to the person you could be upgrading to give them the item. I realize we're all playing the game for our own enjoyment, but it sounds like there's a majority of people here who apparently don't enjoy other people getting items that help them. It's only about their own personal gain.
---
Ashkandi tho
---
You run it again next week and hope for it to drop again.
---
that's why you have the tanks go all out on threat gear instead of protection. If you check the logs of the best guilds it's very clear that warriors are dominating.
---
How to 40-50? Cause im ready burned out
---
He won't get banned. Gold has IDs, and if a botter is banned all the gold it farmed gets flagged. They watch where it goes, and that's how they find gold buyers. 
---
GM was messaging OP to find out if he was a gold selling bot/non-english speaker to determine his punishment. It was already determined he was in possession of RMT gold. Permaban if on the selling side, 3-6 months long suspension if buyer.
---
What part about my sentence (quoted below for you) insinuates anything about real life? I specifically say "there it may not be a bannable offense."
---
&gt;they'll be getting their sick entertainment elsewhere and **there it may not be a bannable offense**
---
I am referring to these griefers going elsewhere IN GAME, but again you are trying to compare griefing to crime irl. You need to really start separating video games and real life it seems? You seem to be always jumping back to that comparison when I am solely only trying to discuss a video game here.
---
As for a more legitimate argument to the main point since you have derailed this so much with your incessant irl analogies and content: Just because in hindsight we know the bug was fixed down the road doesn't mean it should be fixed now. Fixing it now would mean all the people who would have been banned for it are now still in game and effecting the community. Leaving those people in the community is a negative change that would be a result of your so called "positive change". No thank you.
---
You can also log in from twitch and always endure your add ons are updated.
---
This isn't possible. Sorry these brainlets want to flame you when they don't understand the issue you're having.
---
Equating it to spam is pathetic. You can try to justify it all you want doesn’t change the fact other people’s excitement makes you uncomfortable.
---
While we're naming names, Braille on Kromcrush is the bastard who said he was going to pass on the sash only to roll when it dropped.   Although, it was really my fault for trusting anyone from Prestige World Wide.
---
Same.
---
Yeh mate I wanted to do undead priest something I've never done. Rising in ud starting zone day one was pretty awesome! What are you doing now
---
ok but why the fuck do i have to connect my blizzard account to look up the price lol
---
I’d like to transfer off of Arcanite Reaper because it’s a low population pvp server and boring as hell.
---
Ugh this comment is so beautiful to my eyes right now.  Lol, ty
---
Earthfury is an EST realm. So your schedule shouldn’t be an issue if you play EST hours. 
---
Earthfury has:
---
1. Good faction balance that is close to 50/50.
---
2. Population similar to high pop servers in vanilla, but a lot less than most servers today.. World pvp is great. Questing our doors is possible. People get to know each other. Your reputation matters. 
---
3. The server is called the dad server by many. Activity dies down late in the night. This is especially true for lower level content as sub-60 activity dies down a lot more than higher level content. 
---
Is it a good choice to move to EF? Maybe. I love it. I am glad I transferred. But there are some risks. If a lot of people quit, our numbers could go down. But it’s not like high pop servers aren’t negatively impacted if layering is turned off.
---
That's pretty geared relative to where we are on content.
---
What level were you and what boe?  Sounds like you needed on the Assassin's Blade.
---
It’s retail mentality. When you have everything handed to you for 5+ and for the past 2 years you get loot literally placed in your bag with 0 competition and RNG possibly making said loot BIS for an entire tier...that’s why you see these casuals crying.
---
I’m playing a gnome warlock over on Atiesh. I love it.
---
Kill him secretly while no one is watching in a sanctuary zone
---
Also that + healing causes threat I'm only just finding this out. Trying to figure out how much threat you get froma judge / seal of light.
---
I play horde but (male) humans have BiS jokes and it's not even close.
---
You can still melee her if you're directly under her during P2.  Sometimes you might need to jump though.
---
Do you have our eredar discord I made? We have 100s of us in there
---
Awesome, I was able to find spreadsheets for Fury but not Prot, so that will be easier to reference when looking into how to get gear. Thanks for the link!
---
classicLFG
---
Round robin is such a bad way to explain it, I wish that term wasn't adopted for the loot rule you're referring to because most of the time "round robin" is used outside of WoW context it means that there is a preset order that you cycle through. That's what a majority of people think, I know, since I too am a tank and have done orb runs and there's always one person that doesn't understand. A better way to explain it is "limit one orb per person until everyone gets one." It's simple and as clear as can be. That rogues reaction was a bit odd, I wonder if he fully grasped how it worked. Either way, good on you for determining loot rules ahead of time!
---
Mallet.

Always hated 30-40 lol

Imagine getting angry on behalf of someone else for trying to help perfect their foreign language skills.

---
Rolling Need on an item better than your current item, with immediate equip, is not 'ninja-ing'.
---
Next question.
---
Wow for real. Never knew
---
I'm probably not going to be able to raid, so the priority is running dungeons.
---
On Faerlina, you will almost never see a UBRS run that doesn’t have MH on reserve. 50% of LFG groups have something on reserve, incuding the orbs in stratholme

Man, we all remember that one windfury video.

Experienced classic Hunter. Looking for decent group of people to level, pvp, and eventually raid with.  Can't wait for battle grounds to begin.
---
ty man!
---
I'm still arguing for fairness.
---
So you're arguing away from impatience (good call, that was a poor argument), and now want to change your argument to generosity?
---
Well that still doesn't undermine my fairness argument, and neither does your attempt to paint me as selfish for wanting all 5 party members to have a fair chance.
---
You're the selfish one for wanting 1 person to arbitrarily win by default over 4 other people.
---
I actually put people on ignore for constant random whispering. Whispering nothing else but dungeon boost begging, to a point where the most annoying person kept spamming me multiple times on a day. I guess he just whispered all the mages that were 5-6 levels higher than him for his AoE grind. First I said no, later I asked him not to whisper me again, eventually put him on ignore. Seriously, get the message. 
---
I also tried grouping up for a LBRS, advertised as a quest run. Turned out to be a 10-man. I tell him you won’t get credit for the quests. He leaves the group, I whisper him if he is setting up a new group, but am on ignore.
---
Healing is a 0.5 threat modifier so I assume half the heal? Unsure though
---
Bloodsail buccaneers is one of the smallest us servers I believe
---
Don’t need an add on for this 
---
/console ffxdeath 0
---
I got the ring first time I ran it 🤣 but I can’t get any of the leather gear 😫
---
This works on target frames but not on nameplates :(
---
This is an unreasonable expectation and bad advice for the OP. Either you explicitly reserve something or you deal with potentially losing the roll. 
---
It shouldn’t need to be clarified that just because someone is tanking, they are prot spec.
---
It doesn't beat dalrends though, not even close. If you wanted an upgrade over thrash blade you could buy mass of mcgovan instead for 1/10 the price, or just wait until you get dals.
---
ya that is one of the realm it gives me.
---
If you are a female nelf on a rp server you may want to hit up goldshire inn
---
How much of the game can be solo'd? I unfortunately dont have the time with how my job is structured to do raids, nor do I have the knowledge to back myself in pub raid groups (if they even exist). 
---
Also, what do battlegrounds entail? Is it similar to SWTOR'S pvp match's?
---
Just read that tanks Flash of Light when people CC pull to get initial aggro after a sheep / sap.
---
Well cuz groups need a rogue and the rings are pretty trash for anyone not a rogue or hunter
---
Short answer: No, don’t worry about. You did nothing wrong.
---
Long answer: I’ve found the higher level you get (I’m still not 60), the more people bitch about... everything. There are tons of people who get super salty when they don’t get the drop they wanted. I’ve found that if you know the dungeon/loot drops fairly well (which it definitely sounds like you do), try to get an idea on who is rolling on what BEFORE the fight so that if there is any bitching, you can hopefully clear it up beforehand. 
---
Doesn’t matter what dungeon you’re in, once people get 45+ they start getting very whiny. You can’t make everyone happy and in this case you certainly shouldn’t feel guilty.
---
I don't know anything about shaman tanking specifically, but I originally leveled shaman in vanilla back in 05. Tbh, shaman tanking seems like a nightmare from my knowledge, they can really only generate threat on single targets, and I am not sure if they could keep up with threat to match better dps with gear progression in later raids.
---
Not only that, but a tank that can go OOM seems like a bad idea in general
---
But who knows, that's just my two cents on it.
---
The cc'd mob or the dps target?
---
More like creative opportunist.
---
That's because it is.
---
I've played a bit of every class and Hunter was always the most fun for me. Still is.
---
I've had a run in with this dick bag. He is a fully fledged ninja. I reported it to the GM of the guild and I was told to fuck off. Avoid them everytime now.
---
I'm not changing my argument at all. If it upgrades me, of course I want it. If it upgrades someone else, I want them to have it. If no one needs it, everyone greeds it, and that's where the money should be made.
---
Try and get the Big Iron Fishing Pole +20. Its from Desolace so I'm not sure how easy that is for Alliance but I had quests to the Clams that drop it. Took about 40-50 of them. Or buy off the AH.
---
What are the largest?
---
Dude. HO-LY FUCK there are a LOT more rage-y illogical people this time around. That being said, don’t be so insecure that you need to validate what you did to reddit. Fuck people like them, don’t even let them phase you. Not worth the negativity or the stress. Put this in the past with a clear conscious and next time just know to laugh at them if that’s how they react.
---
Oh, right. I don't know of any. Nameplates seem almost useless right now because of how short the range is.
---
You can need on the tank gear if you want it’s my off spec it doesn’t bother me. There is no tank gear in Strath UD minus 2 shields but you can clearly look at my character and see my Draconian Deflector
---
LOL saw this yesterday and was wondering if I missed something, either in context or in terms of a smart trade
---
i told him i didnt need any BIS item, he said he wanted CAD armor... i said okay we gucci then. how is this my fault ??  if he said he wanted all rogue items and didn't invite me, then yeah thats fine - his party his rule. but he said he only wanted CAD so i said thats okay
---
do you clarify your loot intentions everytime you join a party?? no1 really does... its the party leader to clarify reserves. if they don't, then everything else is fair game
---
I've been looking for an addon that counts how often i jump, is this it?
---
There will be plenty of world PvP on normal servers once phase 2 hits. It just won't be involuntary. Normal servers are for PvE and PvP. PvP servers are for ganking.
---
Turns out that for judgement of wisdom/light, every dps who triggers the proc gets the threat, not just the tank - which is good to know
---
Warriors roll on more shit than hunter, plate, leather, mail...yet people bitch about hunters
---
Use your brain. These are not the only things being said in Gchat. However, every few minutes someone saying ding for some small level increase is annoying and gets in the way of actual conversations in the Guild chat which in turn does make it a dead Gchat.
---
Thanks love your positive attitude !
---
I've got wrymhide and hoj already luckily. But the way things are looking my guild is wanting me to tank. I've been trying to get into ubrs, scholo, and strat living since 56 and even at 57 and was constantly told too low of a level. The biggest pain either way for me is going to be getting the gold for edgemasters no matter what I am since I rolled tauren without thinking about how important weapon skill is in classic.
---
"Looking For More".  As in, we have some people, but we need more to fill the group.
---
Every boe upgrades you, you sell it and buy an upgrade.
---
It also upgrades everybody else.
---
I've been over this.
---
Ok will do!
---
And yet the trash drops the  best loot.. .
---
Just say you need ranged dps
---
I was in a mostly Brazilian guild in Lk. I dont know any portuguese, thats mostly what was spoken in our vent server.
---
Yes Im a lock!
---
I second the druid.
---
Everyone else is covering the consume side of things so I’ll throw this out- There currently is nowhere near enough content to justify three raid nights. If I saw a guild that needed three nights to clear MC and Ony, I’d dip out immediately. Even with sloppy wipes and a casual attitude (which yours apparently isn’t based on requirements) MC is 4 hours at most and Ony is an hour.

---
Over 100+ runs.. never seen it once lmao leveled up from 50-60 using only BRD and I can’t even roll on what doesn’t exist for me. I swear this game is handicapping me bc still outdps all the rogues/warriors with HoJ with my carrot on a stick..
---
Yeah... "Nice this fury warrior will tank for us so we can get our run done and not have to wait an hour to find a pure tank!" -Rogue before the run.
---
"FUCKING NINJA YOU'RE A TANK DON'T TAKE MY GEAR THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN SEEN WITHOUT YOU!!!" -Rogue when he loses a fair roll.
