Just to talk about keybinding for a moment. This is a likely benchmark when it comes to people who keybind nearly everything like me. At the very least:
---

---
I use a G600 Logitech mmo mouse. The bare minimum start to any mmo I play is to start putting my abilities on the 1-12 slot bar, map Shift+1-12, and also map Alt+1-12. That is 36 keybinds right away. I also change mappings for Q E R T S Z X C F G V B and also Shift + Alt variants for most. I remap middle mouse button click also with Shift and Alt variants.
---
This is just to start and I may customize more depending on class and profession choice. I have ZERO reason to remap my mouse scrolling function so I maintain my mastery over my camera view, unless someone else simply maintains the same level of function through alternate binds.
---
The goal of any good MMORPG player should be able to play the game equally well without your UI even turned on.
---
---
---
Just because you play with friends doesn't mean everyone does. 
---
Thats a tricky one, I never knew about quest helper at the time but I would have deffinitely used it. I think those types are addons do cross the line personally since there is little to no social engagement. At least with wowhead and thotbot you had people sharing their experiences in the comments and not just following waypoints.
---
I think toggling would be critical, so that people can have the experience they want. 
---
&gt; pre hot
---
It's currently being debated on the forums whether or not a pre-HoT caused post-pull agro in real authentic vanilla. Will be interesting to see how it turns out.  
---
If someone misclicked need then tough shit.
---
If your RL was a retard and assigned Helm of Wrath to a Rogue then tough shit.
---
The ONLY time it would be valid to get GM help is if you misassigned a Legendary Item, but wuite frankly if you fuck that up then you kinda deserve to be shit on by your Guild.
---
Loot trading goes out to fix an issue that scratched the surface of 1% of players. This system will have the potential to affect 100% of the playerbase. Does that seem fair to you? To me it doesn’t. You guys pretend like an RL messing up loot happens on a daily basis... it does not. I raided for three (THREE!) years and my RL fucked up ONCE. On ONYXIA. During AQ!
---
But OP literally said he’s a tank 
---
Using Shift+Mouse Wheel has always worked great for zoom functions.
---
Also,  
---
a discord exists for Classic WoW, along with official Classic WoW forums on battle net.
---
Are you NA by any chance?
---
LF1M amok run. Shoulders reserved.
---
&gt;Classic will ship with loot trading, sharding and spell batching
---
You're as bad as all the YouTubers that never played vanilla and have no idea what they are talking about. 
---
Dire Maul is not a dungeon though it's a zone with 3 dungeons.
---
Have you tried Diablo 3 before ? WoW loot is pretty much the same. Each item has a chance of being titanforged , with better stats,sockets and even special stats
---
Mine is Ctrl+shift+plus and ctrl+shift+minus but this is better 
---
Mind control.
---
!Remindme 3 months
---
This is a really late reply but Im doing it anyway. Rogue has been my long time favorite class and main character, so I honestly didn't even consider rogue when reading the original post. But after reading your reply I honestly cannot disagree, there is literally nothing a rogue brings to classic that another class cannot fulfill. Even rogue gear diversity would be absorbed by dps warriors, hunters, enh shams, and druids.
---
Reluctantly I must agree with you. Take your +1 and git out
---
I don't generally agree with the #NoChanges argument as I find it to be reductive and somewhat fundamentalist. Which I believe to be self-defeating in that it frequently focuses on the details without considering the context. Which is ironic given that's exactly what I think of your argument there.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We will all have a choice as to how we would, individually, like to modify the classic client in terms of add-ons but none of us have a choice on the core build. Perhaps the best context to view this through is that the choices people make as regards legal modifications to the client aren't anyone else's business but the core client build and mechanics are everyone's business. So, regardless of whether you (or I) think someone is right or wrong on "core client issues", they are entitled to express a viewpoint and have it considered. No-one is entitled to care about what add-ons anyone else uses as long as they are legal. That's just being nosy.
---
I personally think they cross the line as well but they were popular then and retail features a similar product, which perhaps could be toggled on and off in Classic. However, that’s a change.
---
I bind next to useless stuff like camera zoom, disable UI, toggle framerate, reply etc. to the right side of my keyboard. That way keys that are otherwise mostly dead like insert, delete, pageup/dn get used for something.
---
My current keyboard layout is:
---
12345, RTFG, ZXC, Tilde  
---
And then ALT/CTRL/Shift + QWE, ASD, ZXC, RTFG, Tilde. S is /script Stopcasting(); which as the text implies, stops any casting.
---
Those are fairly easy to learn keybinds. The hard part is setting up your action bars in such a way that those hotkeys don't collide with movement. For instance it's a bad idea to put an ability that you use frequently on shift + W since that keybind will constantly collide with the move forward key.
---
Usually I tend to put abilities that cannot be used while moving on A/Q/W/E/D. Usually spells with a cast time.
---
I tried to use the mouse wheel for a while but my brain sucks at using the mouse for anything but camera control/unit targeting. I'm not the most mechanically gifted person in the world and it was really bothersome to both use the mouse for precision targeting/grenades/aoe placement while also trying to cast something with the mouse wheel so I gave up on trying.
---
Thats not gonna happen. Blizzard will recreate Vanilla and this is what they said:
---
&gt;first and foremost is authenticity as our goal
---
&gt;
---
&gt;want to create and experience that feels just like 2006 World of Warcraft
---
&gt;https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1811
---
Have you picked which class you want to roll yet? That could help a lot in deciding which skills/opponents you should focus on learning about.
---
I always bind my camera to +/- on the numpad.
---
I've rarely ever needed to adjust the camera distance.
---
I have never ever saw anyone referring to Deadmines as VC.. How stupid is that lol. If you are in Westfall then assuming people have braincells it's easy to deduce that they are not referring to Dire Maul by DM....
---
I always saw Dire Maul mentioned with the specified wing, like you wrote...
---
Yet true. I don't expect anyone to care about tryharding things. I merely mention it in case some care as some do.
---
When I played my core sports and the few competitive video games I participated in, you care about these things. It's how you get to be the top 1% of 1%.
---
Absolutely NOT required in Wow. I have no interest in playing along side such tryhards like I used to in games like Counter Strike and Day of Defeat (top CAL league play). I just can't help but play that way. It's just my style.
---
When you run into the top premades in BGs ... you'll experience these players.
---
Ele shaman, then boomkin!
---
And you'd be wrong. Every server had a different culture and, not only that, had two chances to have a substantially different culture. One for each faction. It was also far more common EU then it was in NA. It also didn't slow down getting groups, because it was part of the server culture you'd join a group, be told something was reserved, and say "OK, got it" and off the group would go. Unless you were running the instance for that one item, which is fairly unusual, it was still beneficial to be running the instance. But the point is, it is not a pserver phenomenon. It happened throughout all of vanilla on dozens of servers as a matter of course. 
---
I've had over 4 different gnome mages at different points on different guilds who were very generous and spent a lot of effort into grinding materials
---
&gt; I feel like the overwhelming consensus of this sub is that people want a Classic experience to be No Changes.
---
There's a good core of people here who understand that this is not quite right. They understand that you can't bring an MMO from 2004, which was made in a different ecosystem and with different expectations—particularly security expectations, into the current year.
---
Even something that seems innocuous, like having Classic connected to the current B.Net client, affects a sort of change. Ditto the move away from GMs micromanaging everything. Like it or not, you're not going to change the industry's move away from automated GM systems. Bringing Vanilla into 2019 means adapting it to fit as comfortably as possible with in a new ecosystem.
---
Some people want a museum relic. Some people want the “best” version of Vanilla (whatever that means) and some people want a game that is spiritually true to what Vanilla was, and yet is built with the intention of *lasting as long as possible.* I like to think the core players on this sub are in that category. They want something that is actually sustainable in the long run, for players *and* for Blizzard.
---
Hell, some snarky assholes in this sub (hopefully ironically) don't even want accessibility options added to Classic. There are players who argue that we should have log-in queues and broken servers because “that's how it was back in the day.” Those people are saboteurs, plain and simple. They're not interested in the long run—only in some bizarre, unreasonable vision of what a AAA title in 2019 should be.
---
Regarding addons, there are some categories, such as Gearscore, that people say are cancerous to what made Vanilla great, but I don't understand whats the difference between that and just inspecting someone. 
---
There's not *that much* endgame gear and unlike retail WoW, there's no Titanforging or random iLevel boosts. Anyone passionate about the game is going to be familiar with important gear pieces and will quickly be able to sort out who's been grinding and who hasn't yet.
---
Weapon skill is negligible for ranged attacks because they can't glance, so that 5 bow skill is a mere 0.20% crit and hit
---
When people say VC they mean "Viet Cong" which is a clear call to action for WPVP against the other faction in Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Dank ash’kandi . 
---
Bop loot should be final. That's the whole point of bop. And for most vanilla players it was. 
---
Just because a small percentage of players abused the gm to trade loot doesn't mean it was a thing for the rest of us. 
---
I don’t care what legal add-ons people use and I agree that people should make the experience with add-ons they enjoy. However, I suspect the No Changes community would lose their minds if there was a toggle ability to implement a Blizzard, say quest helper, that exists in retail into Classic, but have no problem with an add-on that does the exact same feature.
---
You are an idiot. 
---
Sunken Temple is amazing just from an atmospherics perspective. I love all the hanging roots and water. But it's a nightmare.
---
Could you tell us what class you play primarily and give us examples of what abilities you prefer to put on the mouse vs. keyboard? Ctrl vs. Alt? How do you handle downranking, if applicable?
---
The more I look at this, the more I like it. Please upload more pictures as you do them!
---
Thank you so much, your reply was so helpful and meaningful.
---
Shamans seem so interesting - if I were to narrow it down between Shamans and Priests, what’d you say then? 
---
Thank you for taking the time to help me brother!
---
I made mine Alt + Scroll Wheel = Zoom
---
Honestly, young people in the game can rule the roost. I'm excited to see new blood in the mix. 
---
Took me three separate tries and groups to actually beat deadmines back when i first tried beating it, although one of the groups did disband due to a server restart. The fact that beating the first two or three bosses would spawn a patrol that would head from the entrance to the end meant after one or two pulls the group had to be careful to not be in the middle of a fight when 3 or 4 more elites would just aggro onto you from behind.  
---
  
---
and then there's accidentally aggroing the top deck when you got onto the ship.
---
The reason QoL addons are acceptable vs having them baked into the game is...  
---
Options.  
---
You have the option to install it in vanilla. In retail, the addon is forced upon you in some cases.  
---
You whore!
---
Dont worry bud pservers will still be there for you
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.  
---
This is my during my pserver visit. Taught me some lessons for classic tho. No need to buy frost nova rank 2 lol
---
Warriors stage 4 best in slot shield has mp5 🤪
---
why the hell would "release" be relevant in a discussion about gold making strategies? lol
---
Suggestion. Need roll makes everything instantly soulbound. 
---
People will learn really quickly not to need roll on things they can't use as they won't be able to AH them or trade them to a friend. 
---
No need for loot trading or gm tickets. 
---
nothing is as fucked as dire maul.
---
See, you don't even know what's wrong with your statement that I quoted. 
---
Would be acceptable if it was a toggle? 
---
Yeah, blizz did say that they would prevent addons such as LFR/G but I wounder if they would stop those kind of addons as well since quest helper bassically is apart of retail. I have faith that they will try distance Classic away from retail as much as possible to make it clear that they are very different games and therefore it would drive the insentive more for people to buy retail with all those QoL additions.
---
Yup - this is the ticket because the value will actually change as your gear gets better/worse and diff stats have diff weights. Great part about vanilla. Not sure dumb iLvl chasing.. actual nuance and changing weights..
---
This math sounds spot on to what I had when I was using the sheets - usually around 10 SP per 1% crit or hit etc, broadly and on average.
---
I agree with you completely, but if they are going to keep the tradable items thing a simple fix to this situation is having items that were Needed be bound to you on pickup.  Similarly to how BoE items are bound to you when you need on them in live. 
---
This fixes the issues with people needing on loot they dont need to trade to a guild mate, while at the same time fixing the "accidental ninja" issue in raiding.  
---
"Oops i accidentally MLd that tier piece to my warrior friend, dont worry I'll totally open a ticket and have it fixed."
---
Because you misquoted me. Idiot. 
---
Here's one that I'm not sure if possible, but I want anyway:  
---
An in-game music addon. The addon's UI is a list of all the zones in the game, organized however you want because there are a LOT of zones (drop downs for dungeons, Kalimdor, Eastern Kingdoms, etc)  
---
Next to each listed zone there is a slider bar that allows you to select how often you want to hear the in-game music for that zone.  
---
The slider bar is configured left to right with the following options:  
---
Music off, play music loop every 15 mins, every 30 minutes, every 45 minutes, every hour, every 1.5 hours, every 2 hours, Music on full loop.  
---
Every time you zone into a new zone, the addon checks the list for the adjustment you made for that zone. If the zone was selected for "off", it simply never plays music in that zone. If it was selected for "every 45 minutes" it plays a single loop and then waits 45 minutes.  
---
Why do I want this addon?  
---
There are some zones where I love the music and I could listen to it all night. Elwynn, The Barrens, etc. And then there is one particular zone where I absolutely cannot stand the music. That zone is... Stormwind City. It's terrible. It is the reason I don't play the game with music, because I know I will come back to that zone and have to toggle music off.  
---
lol nice. I applaud this choice because of my background in sports and still current passion for fitness. I've personally see very bad outcomes to MMORPG addiction.
---
I've know a guy who dropped out of College because of his addiction to EQ.
---
I've seen marriages end due to Asheron's Call and Wow (both times, it was the main guild leader). Yet a good rl friend married someone he met in Wow too and has a child with her. 
---
I've seen a coworker gain so much weight that he started having medical issues in his 30s.
---
Oddly I lose weight when I play too much. I forget to eat and often stop eating carbohydrates if I gain fat. I have ZERO cardio mind you ... I just lose weight until I work out more and regain my appetite. 
---
Jesus...too many things for me to get into here.  You’ve got me cornered into arguing over specifics instead of seeing the big picture.  Go ahead and take the video at surface value and not see what I’m talking about within the market when this particular gold making strategy is worth anything.  
---
Anyone who objects to a toggle-able feature is being childish but, to be fair, I haven't seen that particular argument being made as part of the #NoChanges manifesto so I think you might be lumbering them with that unfairly.
---
What does VC stand for?
---
&gt;  The truly savvy LW will be watching the race to the bottom and buying out the bottom.
---
You're missing the point here though.  If someone plans on using this strategy to make AFK money, then being undercut doesn't even matter.  If I posted 5 stacks of thick leather on the AH at 1g apiece, and someone rolled in and put 100 stacks of it at 75s apiece, then the savvy leatherworker would buy up *all 105 stacks,* because they're still making money on it.  Crafting a green to vendor it is infinitely immune to inflation.
---
As soon as your group hits 40, you're going to wreck people. The priest will be the backbone of your group in world PVP.  
---
Name one particular reason for not always playing with the camera zoomed all the way back. Single one.
---
This guy's right. I only threw out the very occasional free cast instacrit attack whenever that CD was up when I healed on my Ele shaman. Just didn't have the mana for it. Plus, as a healer I didn't want that much extra attention from mobs anyway.
---
It's not a significant penalty, and as a warrior, sharing that xp with a friend is gonna save you a lot more time than corpse running all day by yourself. Plus, it's fun!
---
You do realise that reddit marks that your post was edited don't you?
---
Chill out music. And I agree. It makes videos feel nice.  
---
it can be a potential raid issue, if people collude with points or their raid loot system to win items and trade it/sell it to other guildies for gold etc. it can become an issue (not to mention pug raid). It's much less likely to happen in a raid setting and it can be caught by watchful guilds which is why i said it's mostly an issue with dungeons but it definitely won't be 100% isolated to dungeons.
---
lol whatever,  the video specifically mentions this method working on both the launch economy and later on.   He even calculates the hourly profit based on 1.2g a stack
---
You've replied to this comment:
---
"always be able to AH stacks of thick leather for 1g apiece instead of the 60s vendor price. Kind of a neat win-win there!"
---
With: " I wouldn’t be surprised if it drops below vendor prices. Wouldn’t be the first time."
---
Your argument being that the the oversupply just after launch will crash the prices.  But as already established this video and the original comment aren't focused on release, and barring any initial low value the value of thick stacks will rise.
---
You’re right, in a vacuum.  But it’s not just a revolving door of people posting and people buying.  Think about real world terms and the time factor.  
---
I highly recommend that you play Warcraft 3 before Classic. 
---
My comment was to someone regarding being the skinner here....ffs
---
I very much want to pay Blizzard for a version of Classic. I likely will even if the complacency of the player base leads to Classic being closer to a pristine server than an attempt to recapture Vanilla.
---
But that won't stop me from pointing out ways in which Classic could more closely mirror Vanilla - especially when they were accomplished by volunteers working without access to the 1.12 codebase.
---
&gt; that submitting a ticket requesting a GM to do so will result in a 3 day (or whatever) suspension of the person's account. If they still submitted a misloot ticket despite the warning, then they should actually be suspended.  
---
The gaming news media would ROAST Blizzard alive for doing this. I can see the headlines. "Blizzard bans players for asking for in-game support"  
---
Never.  
---
No loot trading, no GM support. Copy paste a standard default message to any GM ticket submission (should take &lt;10 seconds to finish the ticket)  
---
At first they'll have to deal with a lot of loot tickets, but over time after replying that they wont help, loot tickets should go down in volume.  
---
!Remindme 2 months
---
Oh totally, if you want to play the best paladin, dwarf holy is the best. Gott go human for the memeret build. 
---
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
why do ya'll keep thinking this is gonna b a thingggggggggggggggggggggg
---
Let's gooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
Will this show the BiS lists for less optimal specs, like Enhancement, Shadow, or Feral DPS, just to name a few?
---
it's ranting/fearmongering.
---
it's every other day somebody soapboxes about it.
---
I have literally never seen anyone refer to Deadmines as VC, I only played Classic for a few months before TBC dropped but I always saw people use DM for Deadmines and then DM+wing for Dire Maul. Maybe it's just an US servers thing?
---
Yep. DM is quite a bit harder than WC.  I very rarely see groups wipe in WC but every turn 4th pull in DM has the potential to wipe the group.
---
eh, it ain't too bad, mostly just big open rooms and a boss in the middle, you can run around most Pulls and go straight to the bosses
---
I really only started to notice the difference in the 40s and up. Mind you I was an ele shaman with only partial resto spec so that was a factor too, but it started getting a lot harder to heal tanks starting at about Uldaman and especially Maraudon. I actually don't think I saw a full prot warrior until Sunken Temple, where our tank was getting pasted and hearthed out to respec halfway through.
---
He didnt start the whining, you did. Youre the bad guys here.
---
Is it wrong to sentence a murdurer to death? Youre killing someone but he did it first. 
---
It’s never an issue because they’re so far apart in level, but back in Vanilla, people called Deadmines VC, after the last boss Van Cleef, and Dire Maul DM (typically followed by east, etc.). 
---
I have the same key binding for that wow 
---
Man do I miss having an actual BiS list and not this lottery warforge system, I'd much rather work towards the items rather than farming keys for 425 titanforges.
---
22 here. My sis was born in 2000 and she even played when she was around 6 or so, probably back during late BC or in Wrath. 
---
I don’t think it has to do with age, as much as what kind of games you’ve been conditioned to enjoy, or perhaps, what your peers are more likely to enjoy, which for younger folks definitely isn’t MMOs.
---
But I think it could be a hit among some high school cliques, just like it was until recently. It also doesn’t have to do with handouts or challenge, but more to do with pacing. Most kids probably don’t like Modern WoW for the handouts like LFR, but rather the fast paced adrenaline fueled gameplay. 
---
Classic is as far from fast paced as you can get. There is still adrenaline, trying to kill 2 mobs and almost dying, narrowly running from the ?? Son of Arugal trying to bury you, or a tough boss fight are all adrenaline fueled encounters that make the game entertaining. But it’s got peaks and valleys of excitement, rather than being based around flashing lights and hit-this-button-now gameplay.
---
The RPG element might also be less of a hit for a younger generation, since I feel like the rpg genre has regressed in many ways, so the generation is less conditioned to enjoy RPGs. 
---
Maybe the Skyrim kids or DnD players will flock to Classic though, since the MMORPG market is dead, aside from a couple games, and Classic could be the surprise hit with that crowd.
---
Awesome work man! With such great volunteer resources hopefully the devs will have no excuse but to implement the proper items. Keep it up!
---
When leveling a Warrior, deciding which spec you're going to level as is pretty straight forward.  
---
Is it a PvP server? If yes, Arms. If no, maybe 2H Fury is better.
---
It's not like Arms is a poor leveling spec. [Here's a short clip](https://streamable.com/ccnmc) of my Arms Warrior. It's really very straight forward to level and it's really not that much slower than 2H Fury at all.
---
Step 1: Pull one mob and don't spend your rage.  
---
Step 2: Then pull two mobs and cleave them down with sweeping strikes.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Don’t worry about your age. I started Vanilla at 8, and although I was the definition of bad, I found a guild by BC that I could raid Kara as. I was tanking Kara at around 10-11 years old, and I hesitated to use voice comm longer than I should’ve. It was such a relief to speak freely and not be judged. 
---
Anybody who judges you for being 18-20 is a tool, given that that was WoWs biggest demographic back in Classic.
---
Preach, my friend!
---
I agree, but I can’t change the entire WoW communities mind, and I want to fill my group, so I still call it VC or just type Deadmines.
---
It's pretty common for Paladins to have a full reflect set for that reason. It's the most reliable way that they can farm cloth from low to mid range dungeons like Deadmines or SM.
---
You sometimes see Paladins wearing reflect sets in PvP but that's not as common.
---
A 19 priest twink wouldn't use starshards. Gravestone Scepter wand does 29 dps even without the wand specialization talent, while starshards does 27 dps.
---
Bis list consists of 3-4 items in each slot. 80% of items will always be garbage when compared to the best. Do you want to make this bis list even smaller? If you had a static list of items from launch til naxx that never changed you would very quickly acquire those key pieces in each slot and run into months of no character progression. This already happens as is in vanilla do we want to make the issue even worse?
---
Why the fuck are they adding it.. classic was fine?
---
The only instance that rivals them in my loathing for it is Gnomer
---
So? I fixed a spelling mistake right after posting. Don’t be such a dunce. 
---
Is there a possibility of adding second and third best is slot for eqch tier? 
---
You could use it in 1.12 as a way to use seal of light for quick self heals
---
https://youtu.be/C8BPATSVpRg?t=95
---
Or you could just downvote like without knowing anything
---
vancleef
---
First i'll state thanks for typing that out. Second I must ask why have such specific timers for other zones? If you dislike stormwind, I could look into something a little more rudimentary that simply doesn't play certain tracks (if i can affect that). That way we could kick certain zones. 
---
Still, I know too little about the platform to know if thats possible at a glance, but thank you for the idea. Many moons ago I actually replaced the background music in Final Fantasy 11 (it had music that played in combat that i got sick of) so I feel you. 
---
I remember changing it to Linkin Park or something and quickly realizing that i'd ruin songs I enjoyed by doing that. The intro to "Papercut" would play every time I got in battle.
---
Not wise on my part, but I learned!
---
Damn I was thinking that might be the case, is this true even with scaling + arcane gear?
---
I still think its funny so might do it anyway.
---
I love old sunken temple so much.
---
One of the reasons I despised cata.
---
It's an interesting feeling walking through town in your T2 set people come up and whisper you meanwhile in the back of your head you know this cool looking gear is for noobs and they have no idea lol
---
Serious business 
---
Loved those places
---
Is it the exact same post? Is the post the exact same to the letter? No. Stop trying to be a pathetic corporate shill. 
---
I'll believe it when I see it.  There is a minimum level of common sense that should go into incorporating systems like this into classic, and I suspect most just want to believe blizz wouldn't do something as stupid as making all loot tradable.
---
I thought the solution was to use VC for Deadmines. I mean, it's even mentioned in the original strategy guide from 2004
---
^(I can navigate ST)
---
The reason why I want specific timers is because some zones I could listen to the music all night, and then others I would like to hear sometimes, but when you put it on repeat it's annoying as hell.  
---
The best example I have of that is orcish horde music. I like hearing it when I enter the zone, but if it were to repeat, i'd shut it off.  
---
I'd put orc music on a 2 hour timer, and probably gnomish as well. Basically I'd only want those songs to play one time for the theme effect, but not again any time soon because I don't actually like hearing it on repeat.  
---
A zone like Elwynn Forest, I'd place this on a 15 minute interval. The music is so good to me, but sometimes the best part of music is the pause, and 15 minutes would serve that purpose very well.  
---
At the end of the day, you're the guy with the coding knowledge and I am not. It's entirely your choice what you do. Although I have already been searching for quite some time for people who are open to some... arranged donations... to create addons I seek. Because I have other addons I want as well.  
---
Nice work. Can you elaborate on crit diminishing return? Cause I think I disagree with your logic, although it might be because I understood it incorrectly (or because I understood it correctly but am wrong).
---
If I read you correctly, you say that going from a 99% to a 100% crit rate yields less damage than going from 0% to 1% (or from 98% to 99%).
---
Let's say a Mage deals 250 damage with an uncrit Frostbolt. He never gets resists fr the sake of this example.
---
0% crit: 250 damage every 2.5 seconds, i.e. 100 DPS.
---
1% crit: on average 252.5 (dealing +100% more damage 1% of the time means dealing +1% more damage on average, hence 250 x 1.01 = 252.5) damage every 2.5 seconds, i.e. 101 DPS.
---
This is a 1 DPS gain per +1% crit.
---
99% crit: average damage of 250 x 1.99 = 497.5 every 2.5 seconds, i.e. 199 DPS.
---
This is a 1 DPS gain per +1% crit too.
---
100% crit: average of 500 damage, i.e. 200 DPS.
---
+1 DPS per +1% crit again.
---
Going from 99% crit to 100% yielded a 1 DPS increase, which is exactly the same as the DPS gain from going from 0% to 1%.
---
What is true is that getting from 99% to 100% crit was, relatively speaking, a lower gain as it only translated to ~ 0.50% damage increase (1/199), while going from 0% to 1% crit was a relative gain of 1% (1/100).
---
However in both cases the absolute value of the gain is the same, i.e. 1 DPS.
---
Hence I don't think a +crit should be modeled as having a diminishing return, because the +average damage is the same.
---
Otherwise the same would have to be done with +spell power, because the more +dmg I have, the less DPS gain it will bring me in %, even if it's still always an absolute value of +X average damage.
---
Did I understand incorrectly what you wrote? Did I miss something? Maybe you were referring to another mechanic?
---
What do you guys think?
---
I am hoping for a transmog addon for vanilla, won't effect pvp, will barely scratch the surface of "muh economy" if it has any effect at all. If it isn't part of the base game and is client side only there is almost no addon you can reasonably be against. They had addons that would scan for rarespawns and quest helpers with timers, mods that showed enemy cast bars and cc durations, as well as enemy cooldowns like charge etc. If addons that lower the skill ceiling were accepted then what grounds does someone have to reject a clientside dressup sim.
---
I 100% remember it being called VC on Uther and Frostmane US all throughout vanilla. 
---
You could, but it would take about +55 spell damage gear to break even with gravestone scepter + wand specialization. Also smite scales a lot better so you'd be better off using it instead.
---
"No Changes" is simply a bludgeon used to keep Blizzard on track. No one expects to get a 100% pure Vanilla server.
---
I don't see that as a problem since the points/positions/whatever are finite.
---
30 years is young right?
---
Started playing wow when I was 8. My neighbors brother was a huge blizzard fan and had all their games. I would sleep over just to play more wow. Got my own copy around tbc. Never made it to max level until wrath. Eventually quit in mop. Tried out pservers after the nostalrius petition and fell in love all over again. Is the leveling still boring and tedious all these years later? Yea. But I think many will be surprised how well the gameplay truly stands the test of time. I used to praise blizz for making the game easier and more accessible but now I can understand why the journey is a necessary evil.
---
That's a nice hand-carved wooden microphone you got there.
---
&gt;pathing needs to be recreated.
---
Blizzard actually has both the code AND the data used for the original pathing. 
---
Private servers have had to build nav-meshes based on third party libraries using client-side only collision data and built pathing algorithms to navigate those nav-meshes with very little knowledge of the original behavior. 
---
You can't have picked a worse example. 
---
There are usually people who will watch AH like a hawk with addons constantly scanning for anything submitted below vendor price.
---
It increases linearly, starting at only 10% IAS/Cast speed, up to 25% at 40%.
---
So its particularly useful for priests and shamans looking to get a fast heal off since beserking costs no GCD.
---
Also, bare in mind all sources of IAS are multiplicitive in WoW, so its best to also use it when you have other sources of IAS going as well (rogue SnD+Blade Flurry , Warrior + Sham Flurry , Hunter Rapid Fire + Imp Hawk proc).
---
Thank you for your research on this and making it into a resource for others to use. A search feature would be nice, and separating by armor type (cloth/leather/mail/plate) would be an option to consider as well.
---
If anything you could argue that your best profit margins would probably be around early release.
---
Side question - warrior uncrushability came from getting enough block etc to push crushes off the table. What is the table like for spells in vanilla? I know there's a permanent miss chance, but do resists/partial resists put a sort of cap on potential spell crits?
---
No bullshit, the average dps for tier 1 raiders is probably around 250-350. People will claim its higher but honestly I’d bet most lvl 60s fall into this kind of range. 1000 is high, most players will fail to ever reach it, and those who do generally won’t until Naxx.
---
https://youtu.be/u0wciSPO9zg
---
This video has the best parses from MC on Anathema 
---
Full buffs and consumes are exp
---
Average for hunter is 363, and this is their best tier relative to other classes
---
Note this is the ideal situation and doesn’t reflect the real average of the player base
---
There are other videos in the same series  showing BWL and Naxx numbers, I don’t think any list has all top 30 of a class reaching 1k dps
---
Basically it’s good
---
Yeah, I’ve done it
---
I'm NA (Magtheridon US East PvP in vanilla) and we've never called it VC. Horde side at least.
---
lel
---
What addon do you use for unit frames and UI? Looks clean and simple.
---
Yea people severely underestimate how tanky warlocks are. Literally more effective HP in pvp than a raid tank. It just gets swept under the rug because how weak they are in early patches.
---
I think it's better for the health of the game if 80% of raid drops are not worse than dungeon blues.
---
Modui experimental branch and Luna Unit Frames.  
---
The combat text addon is MSBT and it's not configured properly yet.
---
They do so much threat blizz had to give them a health buffer to tank a few boss swings lol
---
He’s also doing melee dude lol
---
3k was end game tbc friendo
---
I don't negotiate with terrorists.
---
I don't think so, since there are two separate rolls, my understanding is that getting +crit is always worth the same amount of +damage (all other things being equal I mean, apart for the amount of crit you have, like in my example).
---
Well I am both a skyrim player and a DnD player, so you may be on to something!
---
On Alleria - no one referred to Deadmines as VC.
---
I used mouse wheel up to target party 1, down party 2, shift up 3, s down 4. Just rebound camera functions to my arrow keys since I rarely adjust it
---
Life drain effects are also unaffected by healing reduction effects in vanilla, making SL Warlocks solid turtles of doom even when focused on by a MS Warrior.
---
[removed]
---
Haha those were the only 2 RPGs I could reeeally think of that have a semblance of popularity. I was surprised how big Skyrim was when it dropped back in my High School days.
---
Yea this notion that you should vendor items only holds true if the server population is low. Depending on how they handle it could be better to just mail leathers to a bank alt to dump.
---
Hybrid tax mate.
---
You bring me well i will roll on your items as well
---
of course only if i need them but it sure isn't being a ninja.
---
Lvl 18 WTB DMW carry
---
Your examples are stupid, that is just ninjaing and the community will take care of that by listing those players as ninjas.
---
The real problem is a a friend joining a group and unequepping the item their friend needs, so they can both roll on it and if he wins he can equip his piece anyway and trade the one he won to his friends.
---
This has not been my experience on private servers.
---
Same on the servers I played on, from 2004 - WotLK (Azgalor, Crushridge, Drak'Thul, Shadowmoon, Area-52) mainly as alliance. Then started playing private servers and that's when I noticed people referring to VC as DM. Was extremely confusing for a while.
---
I never thought a WoW movie like this existed, until it did.
---
Fury is bad in every game mode and shouldn't be played.
---
Make sure you comtinue to workout when you are smashing wow.
---
"It was commonly known as "VC" (named for its previous final boss, VanCleef) to avoid confusion with another instance (Dire Maul) that shares the more obvious initials. Since the release of Heroic Deadmines and loss of Shen'dralar reputations, however, the abbreviation DM almost exclusively refers to Deadmines."
---
[-Source](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Deadmines)
---
NA here, its always been VC
---
The only reason I really hated full mara clears is the level difference from the start to finish.  Pretty sure it is over 5 lvls.  So you get quests to kill Khans, but a Princes kill in the same run, at level is just asking for pain.
---
Best in **Soon™** 
---
I had to google it, that image on the right is from a movie called [Guns Akimbo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6902676/). I had never heard of it before.
---
Isn't a lot of good hunter gear leather?
---
I got another example.   
---
Imagine this:   
---
You join a 10-man group to ubrs, most of them are in the same guild. You are a single rogue, you want those Truestike shoulders for your upcoming mc-raid. They drop, but prudently you roll against every guy in the group because they want it on their fury warrior. Just as the example above your chance to get the item goes from 1/3 to 1/9. This is not okay at all in my opinion. 
---
Maybe pre raid. There is a ton of hail mail that no one else will use later. 
---
Literally not an issue as the people who shout for deadmines won't be in the same chat as the people who shout for dire maul.
---
Same in vanilla, was never an issue. The only reason this is being talked about is because pservers brought in a global chat so all zones could talk same channel.
---
Unless classic does this, which I doubt, you might never see a deadmine shout once you leave the zone.
---
This has always been my opinion on it too, yeah. Nobody ever says "LFG DM" for Dire Maul, they always put E/W/N/T after it.
---
I am pretty confident in navigatiny both of them but I know most people only do them once or twice while leveling.
---
I liked tanking (just not raid tanking) and getting all the quests done, so my guild knew I was always up to do them.
---
When LFG got added to live, I leveled all my alts using it, had plenty of refreshers about the patching since then.
---
You role on gear that improves the role you’re currently playing. And you let others know if you’re looking to also roll for your offspec.
---
I suspect there will be much greater knowledge of itemization now than back in 2006.
---
&gt; Same on the servers I played on, from 2004 - WoD (Azgalor, Crushridge, Drak'Thul, Shadowmoon, Kel'Thuzad, Area-52, Frostmane)
---
And here I am just staying on the same server, same faction from BC -&gt; Legion.
---
no, u just spam world chat
---
Im just wondering, whats interactive about this? It's just a list in a different format isn't it? I expect if it is interactive it does something else, like maybe compare current gear or something.
---
Who said it was all the time? It’s only sometimes. ;)
---
Go to STV and you won't have a problem on either faction.  
---
That part about crit having diminishing returns confused me as well. The way OP uses that phrase is not how I see it usually used.
---
The only way I can take it to be true is if you look at the relative increase of adding yet another percent of crit over the previous one instead of the absolute increase, but that's true for spell power as well. If you have 100 spell power and find an item that grants 10 more that's a 10 per cent increase but if you already 200 spell it's only a 5% increase.
---
True diminishing returns would be if the game internally said:
---
* well if you don't have any crit chance yet, 1% crit adds 1% crit
---
* but if you're already at 10% crit, an additional item with 1% crit will only count as 0.9%
---
* and if you already amassed an overall crit chance of 20%, each additional point adds truly only 0.8%
---
* etc.
---
&gt;count
---
not if you are a huntard rolling need on hoj...
---
Yup. I was leaning towards a warlock already, but now I definitely know what I am rolling come classic. The only thing stopping me was that I had played a warlock on private servers before, but only as affliction. Now I hear the siren's call of soul link.
---
Exactly. Let's see the OP's response.
---
I'm super bitter over what Blizzard has done to Shaman these past couple of expansions. We feel like a shell of a class. The worst part is, Blizzard launched bfa and said that shaman was unfinished and said we would get big class changes in the upcoming patch. Upcoming patch rolls around, and all we got were some crappy new talents and old artifact traits back. What a joke.
---
I can't wait for Shaman to actually be a Shaman again.
---
Lotta transfers for arenas back then.
---

---
That is the leveling and PvP spec and you can tank fine with it in everything but raids. Arms is superior because fury needs hit to peform, which isn't on low level gear. 
---
Do the Arms tree first. Rend is decent damage at low levels so first 3 points there.  Get Anger management ASAP because it passively gives rage, which is a big deal.  You really can't screw the rest of the tree up. Get Sweeping Strikes ASAP though because of how it interacts with things like whirlwind on more than one target. Things explode. 
---
In the fury tree after you finish off arms, Booming voice is due to demo shout revealing rogues.
---
As Horde Orc is the best choice for pvp and pve if you plan on dpsing. Orc racial means you take less raid damage at times from raid stuns that do dmg. Fury has some nice axes in BWL which orcs get like 5 percent more damage with. Orc Racial can be used on most bosses and troll sucks for pvp, so it's a no brainer.
---
/giggle
---
Lies, back in vanilla everyone called Deadmines DM. Because for a large part of vanilla, Dire Maul didn't even exist!
---
I've been saying it for years.
---
i was born in 1997 my IT and tech club guy at the elementary school got me into wow i played when i was in 4th grade burning crusade came out shortly after my very first gaming memories came from vanilla i absolutely cannot wait. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg7t4Lwj4cg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg7t4Lwj4cg)
---
Played vanilla from release (EU), never ever heard the abbreviation VC for Deadmines.
---
JOSH IS THE BEST AND WE LOVE HIM!
---
also cuz he interviewed me and wants to again :P
---
Everything was evolving during Vanilla, but by the last six months of Vanilla, VC was the common name for Deadmines. 
---
I wasn’t looking to debate the point — it’s factual from my personal experience. Noobs would call Deadmines DM and get mocked by longtime players. Calling it DM instead of VC was an inductor that the person hadn’t been to max level and didn’t know what Dire Maul was.
---
Grasping at straws here. This complaint is silly.
---
Nice, that's what I was thinking. What about druids?
---
Would the story ignore the part where legolasx say the pop-up that said, "if you do this, you will get suspended for 3 days" and then did it anyway?
---
There's really no need to. For most classes 1% crit is within 15 spell damage. The items really are so simple that you can calculate at a simple glance in most cases (as it should be imo screw having to simcraft for every item drop)
---
That is why they call it "STVietnam", yes.
---
I’ve never had a need to zoom, but you can bind zoom to whatever keys you want — it’s not something you need to do frequently or in any great rush.
---
Looking for a simple addon to display both healing done &amp; mana cost on spell icons in your unit bars. (Also be interchangeable with damage done and other resource cost such as rage or energy.)
---
Bonus if it also is able to display these stats quickly at a glance within your spellbook as well.
---
Here is a [mock-up](https://i.imgur.com/poNO8JC.png) of what I'd like it to look like. Colors, stroke width, fonts, and positioning are all up for modification.
---
Seems like way more abilities than anyone needs. Also can’t imagine using shift 11 in the heat of battle.
---
You also need to keep in mind in a raid environment you will be buffed with diremaul buffs +onyxia buff which should give you 18% crit for free. This drastically reduces the stat value of your crit rating on gear. Obviously you're not always gonna be fully buffed but for serious boss attempts where you want to fully min/max your gear it's important to keep this in mind.
---
2 60s in Vanilla, two servers, DM on both. NA
---
I think you did not read what I wrote :).
---
The problem with that is it says VC was called VC because of DMs existence... But for us in the US DM did not exist at launch.... thus on many servers it was called DM in the same abbreviated style as any other instance is; There was no reason to give it a different name until DM was actually added to USA servers months after launch.
---
Yes NA played on thorium brotherhood most of vanilla
---
It's not problem for Trolls. They can farm the centaurs by Sen'jin
---
Sunken Temple was a fantastic dungeon and you can;t change my mind.  Maraudon on the other hand...not a fan.
---
There is a certain crit chance where 1% spell hit gives more chance to crit than 1% crit. What the actual breakpoint for this is I'm not sure but I do know if you have 16% chance to miss adding 1% hit increases your chance to crit by a large %
---
You don't really gotta look anywhere beyond the front page of this subreddit any given day to see people bitching about Blizzard removing GMs from the loot trading function and just giving it to the players.
---
A lot of people might say that's stretching it, but, just like addons, loot trading required going outside of the game for a perfectly legal benefit that could give you a leg up on players who didn't.
---
If by chokepoint you mean kill zone. When the horde have a lot of people they will roll through both cities back to back no problem. 
---
Darnassus.  
---
We had CTRaid and Bigwigs in Vanilla. Suck it up and download the addons or don't get invited to raids. #nochangesamiright
---
Yeah, it's impressive.
---
I specifically remember Warlocks in Alterac Valley in full tier 2 with fel hunter that would stack resistance flasks and similar effects. They were basically impossible to kill, especially when played defensively and backed up by healers. So you would have an alterac valley open for 3-4 hours and these players wouldn't have died once.
---
Another way to think about is that you don't need 100% damage reduction to become unstoppable. If you have, say 80%, it's already nigh on impossible to burst you down because your healing then outpaces the incoming damage.
---
It's also self boosting in the sense that, the more damage reduction you have, the longer you live and living longer means more time and opportunities for healing which means you live even longer.
---
It's a crutch for the terrible masses. Either way is fine though and won't affect me.
---
Enhance Shaman. 1H spelldamage gear or 2H melee damage gear your choice.
---
What about darnassus. Just as easy as thunder bluff
---
Vanilla Sunken Temple is, without a doubt, the worst dungeon layout Blizzard has ever made. I've done it dozens of times and still have absolutely no idea how to navigate it.
---
Only if you are the dummy trying to click on them instead of tab targeting! 
---
I'm from a US server. One of the [OGest](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Azgalor_US).
---
TB is the easiest city to raid.  Not due to entrances, but due to the lack of players and the easiness of the boss fight. We always go through the front door on the raid.
---
&gt;Sure the tram connects SW and IF, but it’s a terrible choke point for the Horde.
---
Org has some decent choke points on the backdoor route. A couple of Frost novaing mages could separate the entire raid group with ease.  Org also has 2 raid bosses to deal with both in the same room and that fucking troll king has AOE frogging.  IF only has a single raid boss.  The primary reason raids on IF fail is the horde doesn't bring enough people to them.  Bring 2 raids: One to attack the front door to pull the AH crowd away, the second to attack from the tram towards the king.  
---
SW should be about on par with raiding TB, but a lot more alliance players hang out in SW than horde in TB making it much harder.  I don't know about Darnassus, but frankly, no one in the alliance cares about it if it's attacked. Raiding the UC is pure hell for the alliance.  I've seen 2 40 man raid groups wipe on Sylvanas when trying to fight her in the throne room.  
---
Okay? Its still true. DM wasnt available for any US servers at launch. So it may have been called VC, but not for that reason.
---
Well, for there to be open world PvP, both factions need to be there. So it's 1:1. 
---
I think what your asking is which faction tends to be out looking for pvp as opposed to farming or sitting at the ah. That's mostly a server personality question but from my experience horde tend to be out starting shit more than alliance and tend to call in backup. So I'd say go alliance and start ganking in hillbrad or stv and you should be set.

Probably the only person who freaking LOVED Sunken Temple and got mad they shortened it with Cataclysm 
---
Idk I'm just posting sources of information. We called it VC before DM was released anyways, someone might find the sources helpful or informational.
---
Yes!!! There are more of us!!! 
---
It's not that crit has a diminishing return, it's that when compared to spell power it does.
---
At 1% crit spell power is worth 1.01 of it's value, at 98% crit the spell power is worth 1.98 of it's value. If you have high crit then you value spell power more. 
---
&gt; Sharding is a great example of a change that delivers a Blizz-like pop cap for 99% of your play experience
---
huuuh? Could you expand on this. Sharding is antithetical to the mmo experience but go on, I'd like to know more.
---
The answer is to roll horde.
---
Old Sunken Temple is something I’m super excited and looking forward to. It may be one of my favorite classic dungeons.
---
Some UX feedback for you: Change your workflow. You should pick the Class first, then the "Stage". Not vice versa like you have it. Anyone who is wanting to use something like this is, first and foremost, going to want to view the different BiS stages for a single class they are playing. The way you have it set up now they gotta back up an extra level and choose their class over again after picking another stage. Make sense? Looks good though!
---
This won't work in classic, sitting to proc crits didn't work in the demo &amp; it didn't work in actual vanilla. It's only a pserver thing.
---
With the amount of damage you eat on the way to 60 it is a considerable improvement to have even 5% less of that. 
---
Nobody means Dire Maul when they say DM. It's DM:E/W/N/T like the OP said. You'll never see someone saying "LFM Dire Maul" just like you  will never see someone say "LFM BRS" or "LFM Blackrock Spire".
---
Heheh
---
The easiest to raid does not really factor in the geography of the cities, but rather how desolate they are compared to the "main" cities.
---
Also, just to touch on Specs. I didn’t quite remember this but : holy shit so many talents are SO good.
---
As stated, I’m rolling a mage and I aoe farm mostly, so I specced into improve blizz and no Frostbite.
---
God damn I’m missing out on 3 points of improved frost bolt, frost bite, 6% frost dmg, and 100% increase frost crit damage.
---
Those are just the talents I could choose right now but had to skip because of other options. I dunno if it’s just a “feeling”, but there are so many amazing talents you REALLY have to make a choice and cut back on talents you would pick but can’t because of point limitation.
---
So when people created those cookie cutter, they weighed the pros and cons of all talents and decided on a build that’s superior. But what if you have a GG Mp5 item. Then maybe you don’t need that passive mana regen talent? It’s all about adapting and making conscious, smart decisions.
---
-
---
All other games I play, I immidiately google the min-maxed cookie cutter build. I’m an elitist jerk, what can I say, but with Vanilla, honeslty, I didn’t quite follow the leveling guide for my mage and went clearcasting first, then respeced at 22 for imp blizzard. Worked wonders for me...
---
TLDR: Be smart and aware of your character’s weaknesses with it’s current gear and make decisions around that (also obviously predicting equipment changes.) Don’t just follow blindly builds, Vanilla isn’t for brainless players, you will find the game very tough at times if you don’t think on your feet.
---
Going up against an undead, having full worldbuffs and optimal debuffs (including dragonling and chicken), being in full BiS (including Kel'Thuzad trinket), spamming holy water everytime it's off cooldown, using a unique one use only consumable that grants a whopping 300AP and 400SP, spamming enchanted pummelers, cheating in 100% Wrath of Cenarius uptime, having both Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer and Warchief's Blessing...
---
Is that supposed to be impressive? A fully buffed fury warrior can do better without cheating.
---
Maybe. You never know what’s gonna be a can of worms 
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=8956](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8956) not quite damage on hit but decent aoe damage in melee range worth mentioning.
---
It's not? Most world pvp happens in ungoro, BRM, EPL, etc.
---
Im still gonna need on everything  even if i have to vender it.
---
It's easier to look for another healer than for a tank, so that's how it goes. 
---
LH
---
!remindme 3 months
---
Well ultimately, I look forward to any unexpected stuff to crop up.
---
Devilsaur, the mask of the unforgiven (not always BIS if you've got other hit), pads of the dread wolf are pretty good.
---
All of these are not always BIS depending on how much hit you got, but they good
---
Assuming you mean whole leveling, it’s just my Hearthstone and food, along with any profession item.
---
Raids (assuming it's not a pug) are almost always set on master loot. If they could just implement loot sharing if master loot is enabled, then that would be the best case imo
---
I mean one of the major reasons blizz cut down the max raid size to 25 is that managing a guild of 50+  people who all have to be geared was really difficult and even getting the players could be hard.
---
Yeah, I would be fine with that.
---
It may have already been done, but a mod showing rare spawn and treasure chest locations. 
---
Nobody:
---
Sawyermblack: #Shopping list. After selecting which gear tier you're after, the app will generate a shopping list for those items. This is mostly useful for pre-raid BiS.
---
While leveling it’s just not needed. It’s not that you wouldn’t be better at the role — you would — it’s just that it’s an improvement that isn’t worth the cost because you can complete the content regardless.
---
I'm confused. 
---
"I dont need to do it again" then dont play it and dont dictate how it should be for people who haven't experienced it 
---
I started as a pretty hardline no changer. After I saw the graphics updates on the demo, I can't lie, I'm playing Classic with max graphics.  
---
Wow has always went for that aesthetic, it's just that in 2004 even the old design was too cartoony for many people.
---
Since you did melee hunter, how about bring it home and do hunter normally! And prove or disprove the theory of the raptor strike rotation?
---
I'm excited for Classic. I can't stand retail WoW. I loved vanilla and TBC. I'm disappointed with all current MMOs so I'm really looking forward to playing vanilla again.
---
If BOEs or very rare items are listed as BIS I suggest listing alternative in the slot adjacent to that (for a respective stage). 
---
I think the people asking if a spec is viable, or any person who regularly browses this sub, will 100% play the game to 60. People know what the game is, that is why they have wanted it for so long.

Careful, you'll get banned just for asking on this sub

Naw I’ll think what I want, and you can think what you want. I don’t think they should update the textures and visual presentation beyond the original product. Stop with your high horse.
---
I don't know, I'm tired as hell and it came off funny to me how you just jumped right into the suggestions without even prefacing it with something like "These are some of my suggestions or something" 
---
That sounds absolutely awful.
---
That’s something I was a little worried about. Should I delete this post?
---
Lol accurate 💀
---
I'm on these forums so much I probably just lost all the intros and niceties in time lol.  
---
How does pickpocketing work? Do different mobs have different loot tables, or is it basically just some cash based on mob lvl? Where is it done, instances?
---
Sounds like an Alliance NA thing then, at best.
---
PvP gearing = Stamina &gt; Spell Power &gt; Spell Crit
---
Simply put, you can't do anything when you are dead
---
I do not recommend SL but this is mostly a personal preference. Everyone thinks it's some God tier, unstoppable spec and while SL is good, all you get is tankiness, which seems contradictory to what I initially stated on stat weights. Most of the other specs that warlocks utilize add more tools while pvping. Extending your toolkit is often more advantageous in most PvP situations than simply adding tankiness.
---
SL is fine for 1v1 situations - but in any battleground/group pvp/1vX situations SL can find itself in some trouble.
---
I played on my dad's acct. when I was 6-7 back when he wasn't busy keeping his High Warlord rank. Never made it very far, but I can't wait to play it with him at level 60 like we never could because we only had one computer in the house. I've leveled a couple of classes to about 40 on a few private servers, but I've been saving the max level experience for when classic finally releases.
---
People will make it to 60 with their crazy builds. It may take them longer to do it but they will get there. If they want to see end game raiding they will need to be in a guild that doesn't care or know about viable specs. These guilds exist even on pservers. It is also possible when they do eventually hit 60 they decide they want to try to raid and start talking to guilds about what they need to do to raid. If a rogue messaged me asking what they should do I would direct them to the rogue bible. I was a raider in vanilla as a resto druid. If we could do it back then, and i had no idea what bis was or viable specs, then they can do it now. They just won't be as efficient. 
---
Probably for the best. 
---
GMs should not intervene in loot issues, even if they have loot trading.
---
Only if you have enough warlocks
---
not sure if you're planning on leveling with that build, but its very important to put 5 points in wand specialization and spirit tap.
---
just an fyi in case you didt know!
---
the only thing nochanges ever meant was not adding anything into the game that wasn't in patches 1.1 - 1.12. this is perfectly reasonable. I hate when people say shit like "well you won't have the old monitors or dial-up" so it can't be nochanges anyway  
---
as for the graphics, go and max out the 1.12 graphics from the game files and see for yourself. the old world looks 90% like retail. perfectly fine  
---
&gt;A simple addon does the same thing.  
---
then let addons do it. just make it like it used to
---
Do you mean the Sapphiron shield?
---
So you think it would be unnecessary to have a separate PvP gear guide for organized and unorganized PvP? (I was thinking about likely having a healer for example)
---
Addons give people the ability to give themselves that QoL change if they want it without forcing everyone else to have it by default. If I am no changes then I just won't use those addons. However, Blizz did talk about certain addons that wouldn't be allowed.
---
Everything
---
&gt; or a total noob who doesnt know how to assess their class and racials.
---
Damn dude, I was 11 when I started playing WoW as a Dwarf Paladin, I read the manual and I thought it would be cool to be a damage dealer with a 2H mace, and it seemed cooler than a Warrior cause of the holy aspect.  Also the only other class to wear plate armor.  It took me a year to hit level 60.  Even if I cared that much, why the hell would I reroll after spending that much time with that character?
---
Sure!
---
The misconception most players have is that sharding is about server load. *It isn't.*
---
Sharding is a server technology implemented so that you're not forced to create *too many realms at launch,* or break starting zone mechanics (spawn rates, graphics-throttling) like private servers have to do in order to ensure a smooth, stable launch.
---
Well, whats wrong with creating enough realms at launch for everyone who wants to try out Classic? The more the merrier, right?
---
Because we know from experience (and private server trends) that even within six months, realm populations will plummet when all the tourists leave. This will result in low populations across the board. At that point, the only long term solution is destructive realm-mergers. Last time they merged realms the playerbase nearly revolted, which is why they developed CRZ—a sort of *soft* merging.
---
So sharding starter zones for a limited time gives you the power to create less realms, ensuring a smooth, stable launch while respecting the low population cap of Vanilla. Sharding works by temporarily cloning each realm (on a zone-by-zone basis) as many times as necessary in order to handle that initial flood of players.
---
Sharding starter zones will impact maybe an hour—an hour and a half, tops—of your total Classic experience. Permanent server merges? Hours-long queues? Ironically, the least damaging, least anti-community of these solutions is sharding starter zones for the **first** hour of leveling your **first** character.
---
Some complaints are that the actual launch of Vanilla won't be replicated—but that's because for most people *there wasn’t even a proper launch,* due to realms crashing and log-in queues, etc.
---
Finally, there's fear that sharding starter zones will mean players will be able to “shard-hop” to multiple Kazzak’s, for example. The devs have been adamant that there will only be one Kazzak per realm, which means only one Winterspring, only one Blackrock Mountain, only one Tanaris, etc.
---
People who spread this myth that allowing starting zones to shard for the first weeks of launch will mean that eventually all zones will be sharded, like retail, are either not paying attention, or are willfully trying to spread misinformation.
---
The current "big" Vanilla server named LH is a honest dumpster fire and is already getting close to releaseing naxx to finish off its content cycle.
---
The pop is about  A 65 -35 H. Furthermore, most of the english speaking pop moved on to the new TBC based private server.

A fully buffed Fury Warrior did more DPS yes at 1700-1800 DPS but with the same buffs available to them.
---
Any more "knowledge" you wanna share?
---
Well to be completely fair, graphical options in the game are entirely personal, and if done correctly (in terms of visibility of npcs/players), should absolutely be left to the discretion of the player, in my opinion.
---
Blizzard has even had an "advanced tooltips" feature in the game before. There's no gameplay advantage or difference between two players where one could have that option on, and the other could have vanilla-style tooltips. It would allow a player access to more information in game, so that they don't need a third-party site (which I'm inclined to believe vanilla purists *will* use) to identify things like procs per minute, or exact values of effects.
---
Do you believe that all "nochanges" people will refrain from using any addons that provide more in game information, regardless of whether they were created back in the mid 2000s or not?
---
Same on Archimonde.  Since launch, and thru BC.  
---
Since I'm no changes, VC it is!
---
Non-linear dungeons ftw
---
When you constantly die here you come to realize that you can basically hug a wall to get to orange or purple.  It becomes easier to navigate over time....
---
 source:  died here until I had to repair a couple times 
---
The /sit critical stuff should go too methinks. I also agree with a graphics toggle.
---
St was a sunken nightmare....I loved it...
---
I simply won't play if loot trading is in. Because if they're willing to bend that rule, then it's not any better than a shitty private server.
---
Changing "include spell batching" to "Not include spell batching" isn't a spelling mistake. Its reversing the meaning of it. 
---
And the fact that you tried to claim I misquoted you and are now claiming it was a spelling mistake just shows that you're trying to cover up that you've got no idea what you're talking about. 
---
Instead of arguing with me you could have just been mature about and gone and done some research (or even just asked) into what spell batching is and actually learnt something. 
---
But that would mean you had to admit you didn't know what you were talking about and were just parroting back things you had seen on here. 
---
The "Cookie Cutter" build paired with "BiS" lists are also min-maxed for the sole purpose of raid PVE.  Most people don't give a rats ass about min-maxing for PvE and people who try to world pvp or BG with those builds and gear sets -- they often get their shit kicked in by people who focus on PvP.
---
Point I'm trying to make here is, depending on what YOU PERSONALLY want to accomplish and do in Vanilla/Classic, you have a bit of leeyway to play around with your build and gear to be better at what it is you're looking to do.  I.e. maybe you want just all crit and stamina and PvP a lot, and don't care about hit% because you don't need it in pvp.  
---
Vanilla *IS* and MMO with actual player decisions for people to make to cater around what ever the hell it is they want to do. Even if its just fishing 24/7.... I'm sure aside obvious fishing gear people could find a way to change their character in a way to benefit that, too.
---
Yeah, bosses might have slightly different resistance values. Gonna be a real shock to the system.
---
It's going to be hard to adjust to the fact that some mobs might have slightly different armor values.
---
Does anyone know how easy or hard BiS rogue gear is to get in vanilla?
---
My guild's MT is deep fury. The best guilds no longer run deep prot tanks.
---
Just goes to show how little knowledge there really is in the general community.
---
Considering that was never in vanilla wow, it won't be in classic wow
---
&gt;A simple addon does the same thing.
---
So use the simple addon that does the same thing? Don't beg for it to be a part of the game for everyone if you just want it for yourself? Is the addon that serves that exact purpose not already an optional QoL feature?
---
And I don't get why every post like this has to bring up modern monitors/internet/etc. It's completely irrelevant to features being added to the game and comes off as some kind of weird, desperate bargaining, like everyone's opposed to these obnoxious QoL features because they're just hysteric cavemen who don't understand them
---
What do you think is wrong with reserving loot?
---
Darnassus is the easiest.  TB is a bit harder because of the super short flight path from Org and the elevators can be turned into a nightmare'ish choke.
---
UC is actually a lot easier and third on the list than Org/IF/SW.  Why the Hell Blizz decided to add a backdoor to Horde cities is beyond me.. but it makes attacking Sylvanas a lot easier than it ever should be.
---
Org and SW are about tied.  IR is basically impossible because Blizz didn't give it a back door like horde cities and there is the entire alliance population sitting by magni.  
---
How could you make conclusions about future climate when it hasn't happened yet? Come on now, try a bit harder to be consistent.
---
Viable is not synonymous with optimal. You can heal without any damn talent points and you'll probably do fine in casual dungeon runs, that doesn't mean that it's optimal 
---
Some pservers still do VC these days for Deadmines
---
NF/Conflag for PvP
---
Me too! 
---
An addon that shows how much you healed a target (similar to damage numbers on a target).
---
IIRC that didn't exist until TBC.
---
And then you have the "giga chad OP Blood Elfs"
---
OP racial
---
Totally fucks the lore and doesnt give a shit
---
Seal of blood OP so can actually do great dps as ret
---
Can tank like a boss
---
Tall and glorious flowing mane of hair, very regal
---
POE gives me that feelsbadman when i get 1 shot for some stupid mistake now.
---
Good
---
I'll be honest, I started playing in BC/WOTLK and I had no idea Sunken Temple had a whole different section. Maraudon, though, Maraudon I remember... 
---
What's a "very decent /played" in actual numbers?
---
Blizzard may have attempted to mimic the design of vanilla, but they failed. Without legitimate reasons to be out in the world except artificial rng grinds, it feels tedious to be forced to the ground even when max level and having already been through every zone many times over.
---
By definition every time there is wpvp, both factions are involved.
---
STV will make skeletons of everyone, and everyone needs to go there some time.
---
Nah I totally respect that. The reason why I ask is that when I understand the why behind the what it adds to the whole thing. If I can really get behind why the user/client wants the program I can get more into it If I were getting paid that'd be one thing, but this is me looking into doing stuff for the sake of learning, so I always wanna get behind the project at hand!
---
Plus, at the end of the day, everything is developed so that someone uses it! Thanks for the input!
---
It was common, I guess it varied from server to server.
---
I don't like it so no one can have it is not what no changes is about. No changes just wants the game to be as it was in vanilla or as close as possible. If there are things you want added in that's what addons exist for.  
---
No changers don't care about toggles. We care about gameplay. Of course there are fanatics who take it too far. Fanatics are ALWAYS the vocal minority.   
---
Even on pservers years later Vanilla was just as good. I'll be playing on vanilla graphics but I don't care if you play on max graphics. Those things don't affect gameplay though. I care about the big things like transmog which we already know won't be in. 
---
Proc per minute, so not at all
---
No modifiers: camera zoom
---
shift: stances like shadow form, warrior stances, the crucial druid forms
---
ctrl: once a fight/long CD consumables

ctrl+shift: buffs

EU seconding hadn't heard it called "VC" until I played on NA heavy private servers.
---
Thank you for this dank meme. 
---
But now my brain will always read Western Plaguelands as, WESTERN PLAGUELAAAAANDS!!!
---
:|
---
Don't worry, most posters here are about your age.
---
I wouldn't mind if all addons were blocked, especially the questing, raiding and auction house addons being banned would be funny as hell.
---
Orgrimmar is pretty easy because you can send a decoy raid in through the front and have the main force come in through the back entrance. 
---
UC's backdoor is easy to stop because we all have to jump down. Just AoE the crap out of it. It's a lot harder to come in through the front of UC.
---
TB you can block the lifts.
---
SW/IF just takes a few warlocks to corpse run to the tram and summon the raid in that way. Still annoying to do I am sure. We just have to stop the horde coming up the path to IF. SW we just seal off the valley of heroes.   
---
Darnassus has the one portal but no one ever goes to Darnassus except lowbies. By time we realized it was under siege it would be too late. For some reason in the past the horde always attacked Darnassus first so we could prepare for IF and SW. 
---
You have to realize not everyone will know everything or even seek it out. I have seen guilds on pservers who are raiding MC for the first time. People in those guilds who didn't bother to look anything up because they wanted a more authentic experience or they didn't know where to look. 
---
I hate wands, but it def makes leveling easy. Also get that lifetap while leveling. 
---
Catch you on the flippity flop!
---
Hi, my name is Squeeshyrogue, and I am an altoholic. I legit want to play every class.
---
The Frost tree is really well made. It's my favourite example when people claim talent trees are just an illusion of choice, because that tree shows how different things can be. 
---
I'll be playing 24/27 elemental at 60, and I'm skipping the +6% Frost damage talent. I can't justify dropping anything to pick that up, even though "+x% damage" talents are always mentioned as the braindead must-haves.
---
&gt;Why the Hell Blizz decided to add a backdoor to Horde cities is beyond me
---
A frontal attack on UC would end up with mass death from the elevator drops alone.  UC, in general, is just a bad design which is why they probably tossed in the backdoor.  Org needed a backdoor because the other path is right through the AH and bank, resulting in raid death, same reason IF has the backdoor with the tram.  Though I've always thought the tram needed a second entrance from the outside in IF.  
---
A lot of the inconsistencies about the cities raids I think stems from a lot of the design team not wanting cities raids in the first place.
---
Nah, you can easily heal any 5-man as shadow, really only need a dedicated healing spec for priests if you're raiding seriously, then often a guild will help their healer with raid materials.
---
Well if This guy didn't do a video about it I never would've known! exciting stuff
---
No one says lfg DM when they want Diremaul, so it means Deadmines. Diremaul is DM tribute or DM east, etc.
---
boring.
---
Can't wait either. Also, can I have some water, food, and int buff? Maybe a portal?
---
WoWhead and the other sites also use Blizzard assets. Do they have an exception?
---
in fairness   
---
recalling my first experience with western plaguelands there was a lot of shouting! :P
---
Fair enough, I don't doubt that your personal experience involved calling it VC. I played from vanilla beta through WotLK on the Tichondrius server (NA PvP) and always heard it called DM. In my experience, long time players will mock you for calling it VC.
---
probably shamans since they dont have as many mana problems as priest, especially shadow
---
Can't expect anything more from Alliance players ;)
---
I would more recommend &lt;this&gt;[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVx0sZbZEhgzztot]
---
It’s not really a hard choice. Elemental mage damage doesn’t come from frost bolt so +6% frost damage is pointless for that spec. 6% dmg increase for 3 points is excellent so of course frost mages should get it.
---
Yeah just like that trogg dungeon is called Thermaplugg right?
---
&gt; Has anything been said about this
---
Every day, multiple times per day actually.
---
Too many things? Lol
---
Country Home! Where the Tauren roam!
---
Oh wow, that’s great. Thanks for sharing the data. 
---
I've leveled 2 characters to max in Vanilla and a third to mid 50's before TBC came out. I still don't know the viability of every spec at max level. Your post is made on several false assumptions. I certainly will get to 60, blows your first guess out of the water.
---
You can say never, ever all you want but you’re wrong and it just hurts your argument. DM is generally always for deadmines, but I’ve played since beta and on private servers and have had to whisper to make sure or shift click a name out of habit after being burned too much. 
---
if they stagger the shit properly naxx shouldnt be out for a year or two
---
You might find more info on discord!
---
Same.  Called VC on Ursin-US through out vanilla.  I remember asking a guild mate why.  Explained the whole VC is Van Cleef so doesnt get mixed up with Dire Maul.  Worked for me.
---
So you're grudgingly confirming what he said, OK. 
---
Any horde city 
---
Lul
---
I agree with that. I don't want gameplay changed. Transmog is something I definitely don't want in. If everyone looks epic, no one is epic. 
---
People will look for groups in Ironforge/Stormwind.
---
I hope they never force the servers to go xpac based but fine if it’s an option that you can copy the character over to. 
---
I want them to release more content for classic like runescape is doing. 
---
July isn't in winter, so I don't buy it.
---
I ask for unanimous consent: Cookie Cavern.
---
Cringey as hell sure, but I love seeing this piece of history. Thank you.
---
You can't fix stupid that's for sure.  I offered to pull for the warrior on my hunter and he declined and continued body pulling multiple packs.
---
&gt; People who spread the fear that everything will eventually be sharded are either not paying attention, too cynical to be reasoned with, or are willfully trying to spread misinformation.
---
Or people have been playing Blizzard games for over a decade and know from experience that Blizzard can turn their coats any minute. There's been lots of "We will never do X." statements which eventually were overturned. Infact if they kept their words we wouldn't be even getting Classic WoW in the first place.
---
Personally I could accept all kinds of QoL changes without losing any sleep over them, but sharding is my number 1 fear. That's a deal breaker. It absolutely makes sense to use it at the starting zones but I can only hope that's where it stays.
---
I thought we had DBM back then or was that not tell WOTLK
---
False if you're Horde. As Horde never ran Deadmines, only Dire Maul was DM. That being said, we still differentiated between wings (although people would often ask DM E or W actually entailed.
---
Nice idea. As a warrior I can take rare items and force other players to bid
---
odd, I played horde and on my server (Destromath US) it was referred to as DM multiple times in my playing experience, I remember it being VC on at least that server once Dire Maul was finally released.
---
I'm only speaking from my experience from 2004-2006 and on my particular server, I could certainly be wrong!
---
&gt; Elemental mage damage doesn’t come from frost bolt so +6% frost damage is pointless for that spec.
---
Lol.
---
I think the beauty of vanilla wow wasn't the end game. It was leveling multiple characters with different races and classes before really focusing on one till end game. There was just too much to explore. I think the sad envitable truth about classic wow coming out is that too many people already know too much and will all just be over competitive racing to the top.
---
vc!
---
Burning Crusade was my all-time favorite time of WoW. All my friends were still playing, I could actually raid as enhancement shaman AND Moonkin for the first time. Good memories.
---
Why did your last tank quit right before the last bosses?
---
I wouldn't want to join your group. 
---
While I'm already against loot trading, this is a pretty convincing argument against. If we don't have loot trading, you can screenshot the Warrior rolling need on healer cloth. And post it to the forums. Where that character (possibly) can be linked to the account/other characters. Which helps to incentivize not being a loot ninja. Which means we can a healthier community that works together.
---
No loot trade. Be an adult, pay attention to the buttons you click. 
---
I played on Draenor &amp; Rexxar back in the day (both NA servers) and remember deadmines being called both DM and VC but mostly VC.
---
I was 12 back in vanilla and had no idea what I was doing. I clicked all my spells and wore leather gear on my warrior because I thought it looked cool. It was awesome, though I'm looking forward to playing it again with a different perspective.
---
&gt; If someone ninjas an item it's likely that only 1 of the 4 people in the group will actually complain about it on forums or in trade chat while the rest won't bother to say anything.
---
In a "limited" community you don't need to be publicly shamed for ninja looting to have repercussions. Some ninja looting here and there will always happen, but if you only do it a handful of times you will quickly find that your options for finding guilds and groups will diminish. Not because the entire server knows you're a ninja, but because guild members talk. 
---
Sure, someone could probably sustain themselves on random pugs for a while, but if they're burning every bridge they can find just to get the optimal dungeon loot they're not exactly gonna find themselves doing much with that sweet sweet loot.
---
&gt; There's been lots of "We will never do X." statements which eventually were overturned. Infact if they kept their words we wouldn't be even getting Classic WoW in the first place.
---
This is disingenuous, though I understand your cynicism. No one ever *promised* that Classic wouldn't happen. And furthermore, it's rich to hear people seriously think that most retail WoW players would even want a return to a Vanilla-like game.
---
Look at the current meltdown on r/wow over the *removal* of portals in the world. In an ironic turn, they're trying to remove a lot of conveniences added in past expansions that made the world feel smaller, or made it too easy to just zip around.
---
I can't wait for all those angry players to play Classic and see what it's like to go to RFK as Alliance.
---
The other point left unspoken is that many of those “We will never do X” changes came hand in hand with players *begging* for those changes. Heck, the WoW Token is something Blizzard actually resisted implementing until it was shown beyond a reasonable doubt that it's the only method to combat the multi-million dollar Chinese gold trading industry.
---
You want a *real* deal-breaker? My argument for adding the WoW Token to Classic—that's a deal breaker for most people. It makes sharding pale in comparison, lol.
---
Or call both DM and shift click someone before you invite and use your brain...it takes less than a second and saves everyone the trouble of discussing this petty, yet comical, topic ever again
---
Using a preventable edge case (because, ya know, fucking pay attention?) is not a good reason to make changes that are abusable. 
---
&gt; sort itself out
---
rofl
---
What you're asking for is essentially Rawr. 
---
VC wasn’t the common name until later xpacs were out
---
VC was actually an old alliance name for it at the start of the game.  Back in westfall you got the quest to kill Van Cleef before you ever entered the dungeon at all and frankly most of us had no idea what a dungeon was and if you looked at your quest book, you'd only see kill Van Cleef.  Hence people would say LFM VC and it kind of stuck.  
---
As people grew more fimilar with the game, Deadmines was slowly being replaced by DM until Dire Maul came out.  Back then people would often run 2 or more DM wings in a single trip, so it was rare to see DMW, DME, or DMN, which led to conflict with people trying to run Dead Mines.  
---
What are nightflag and drakedog?
---
Okay.. So just shuttle everyone past the starter zone everything will work itself out! I mean, you have the player behaviour data you know what you are talking about. One hour, hour and a half and most people will check out. Yep.
---
:)
---
Is it too cynical of me to conclude that you are full of bovine excrement? 
---
&gt;I know many want Classic to be just as they remembered it.
---
Not really. I just want a wow game that's challenging to level and quest, conducive to building communities, and puts the *WAR* in warcraft.  Classic wow is pretty close to all that than is retail.
---
When I was on Alliance in vanilla it was always DM E or W just for simplicity sake, but there also was reference to DM in general for Dire Maul and you would full clear or find out its just one wing or whatever. Then I distinctly remember there was a certain point where people used to get pissed when you would say LFM DM and they would message you and say I thought you meant Dead Mines, Dead Mines is VC...no, no you didnt, you know what I meant as soon as you shift clicked me and you know I’m not trying to run Dead Mines at this level. Both can be DM, just be better and don’t complain when you accidently join the wrong group for one second
---
I just type out “Deadmines” every time now. Can’t argue with the full name 
---
We're squabbling about DM vs. VC and we're ignoring the REAL problem: shitty LFG messages.
---
"lfg dm" is a shit message.
---
If you're looking for Deadmines, tell me what level you are. If you're looking for Dire Maul tell me what wing you want to do. AND FUCKING TELL ME WHAT CLASS.
---
You're not allowed to repost this yet. Someone has already reposted this for today.  
---
Off topic, but what's the name of the Simpson's episode that this is from, I thought this scene was a fever dream.
---
I don't know how you play but I zoom my camera in and out all the time.
---
&gt; Okay.. So just shuttle everyone past the starter zone everything will work itself out!
---
Even though I've leveled on pservers more than enough times, I'd still rather have an actual starter zone questing rather than your weird, non-Blizzlike idea of making everyone skip the starting zones entirely.
---
A worse idea than sharding if you ask me, but hey, you're also the kind of person who thinks this...
---
&gt; :)
---
&gt; Is it too cynical of me to conclude that you are full of bovine excrement?
---
... is somehow a slam-dunk own. Lol.

Same experience as a Horde player on multiple EU realms. Dire Maul was DM and the rare times Deadmines was even mentioned it was VC. Generally speaking Horde didn't run VC because it was too much work to get there so 99% of times it was with a lvl 60 friend who'd help you get twinking gear.
---
Would be interesting to see stats on who used what name. I had never heard of VC being used before playing with people from the states (EU here)
---
The first thing you have to ask yourself is what type of pvp do you care about the most, and then you pick your spec from that answer.
---
World pvp and duels?  SL
---
Skill based 1vX and organized pvp and all around pvp?  Sm:ruin 
---
Glass canon unorganized pvp god nuking noobs?  Conflag
---
Thanks, I'm aware of the addons existence but I would rather experience the zones and quests as they are. I just dont know which ones to go to and in what order.
---
I used both and with level context there was rarely any confusion if someone used DM. The real question is Live and Dead vs East and West Strat 
---
BiS for warrior is shield of condemnation?

---
you re roll or you endlessly pvp or you actually quit the game and move on.
---
I’m not sure this is possible since most of the heals have a range in which they can heal. For example Healing Touch heals 37-52 so you can’t always have an approximate value. 
---
Unfortunately there's nothing in the wow api that allows you to start a sound file at a certain point as far as I am aware, each time something is played it's played from the start and that's about the only limitation when it comes to playing sounds/songs.
---
It was VC on Stormreaver - US even prior to Diremaul coming out, I think its one of those EU/US things much how EU players seem to call "damage dealing classes" DD where as US players call it DPS.
---
Ah I see
---
This is great. You should absolutely monetize it (if you can). I would absolutely pay a few dollars for something so easy
---
How come? What's stopping you from multiboxing?
---
The only obvious limitation here is the ability to predict the effectiveness of a heal on another player. Consider that you could have focus macros/mouseover macros etc that wouldn't be able to correctly predict the next heal accurately.  
---
There isn't a substantial amount of gear to really swap out depending upon the situation.
---
Get the gear from the honor system (Either rank 10 or rank 13 depending upon how much time you want to invest [Personally I will probably be going for rank 12]). Add in raid gear for off pieces emphasizing stamina and spell damage.
---
Only thing that may change in organized versus unorganized PvP would be your off-hand or trinket items.
---
Deadmines was referred to as VC pre-Dire Maul on Khadgar-US Alliance 
---
If your on a PvP server go wherever your not being ganked. 
---
I'd recommend doing the first few quests in Wetlands and getting the flight path at Menethil Harbor. I wouldn't start Duskwood until 22-23.
---
DM because Dire Maul wasn’t released when Deadmines was. 
---
20, Played Vanilla on my brothers account, I only got an hour or two every day, played a hunter and named it after my dog.
---
Ashenvale is a good choice around then too.
---
All these people saying tough shit no restoring items at all like this game wasn't founded on NOT being a game like that.  That was every MMO pre-WoW, and they made a positive change cause for good for the overall health of the community. 
---
None of you will be complaining when an item you worked your ass off for is in need of a legitimate loot trade, and you will have an instant resolution.  
---
i hear her voice in the discord she calls me, the dark portal reminds me of my home far away, flying down the road a get the feeling that i should have level capped yesterday, yesterdaaa - ay

How would your off hand and trinket items change exactly?

I donno, everything ends doesn't it. Do you really want to be playing this game forever for the rest of your life? Will the countless hours you have put into the game by the time you clear Nax not be enough? If not, roll an alt I guess.
---
they sound a 'lil like sexual maneuvers. Drakedog is a pvp vid legend,
---
I'm saying that it's not like that person is actively a noob.  They could know what they're doing by the time they're max level, continuing to judge them as noobs because of it is quite awful, especially that there's a fantasy element to the game that being a Human Paladin is kinda fucking boring.
---
This is the gospel truth.
---
Hi, /u/gregg_cumia

This looks fantastic!

---
I hate to tell you this but loot trading was in classic. Blows the whole argument up.
---
This is absolutely fascinating. I wonder, though, does a dataset like this exist for skills, spells, or talents?
---
War. Never. Changes.
---
You'd rather play some sort of single-player coop hot-seat version of wow. Got it.
---
Generally speaking, Ashenvale and Wetlands are good for you right now. You should hop between Ashenvale, wetlands, Stonetalon and Duskwood between 20-30. Hillsbrad will be tucked away in there around the higher 20s as well. 
---
From my recollection it was both. It was always DM North/East/West, or VC. 
---
I'm sure it was server based as well, but I don't remember anyone really saying just "DM".
---
We called Stratholme sides "Baron" and "Scarlet", however I know on other servers they were referred to as "Live" and "Dead"
---
This is officially the best post on this sub
---
Never heard of this being a debate before private servers. Never heard of "VC". Alliance EU. 
---
Either way, DM to mean Dire Maul doesn't even make sense to me because anyone who is looking to run DM is going for a specific wing or a tribute run. "DM" alone is insufficient information and would require whispers and extra dialogue to actually figure out what said person is advertising for. Who actually runs all of the wings at once? Seems very rare
---
Honestly, having already played Classic WoW back in 2005-2006, I'm in favor of plenty of changes for WoW Classic in 2019 to make it more enjoyable or maybe a few key changes rather, but I know that's complete heresy here.  And I understand the desire and intention to deliberately keep Classic WoW as something in a museum.  When I think about how I feel about Ragnarok Online, I can certainly sympathize with the nostalgia.
---
Try to hit 22 in Redridge and then head to Duskwood. In Duskwood you can level till 25. 
---
Now go to Wetlands, plenty of quests here you can do till 28. 
---
Once done go back Duskwood because now there’s a bunch of 28 to 30 quests you can do. 
---
Once you’re 29-30 go back to Wetlands again because now you have a bunch of 30 quests you can do there. 
---
Once you’re 30-31 you can go to South Shore for another 2 levels. 
---
At 32-33 it’s time for STV. You can stay in STV from 32 to level 40. But after a few levels you can always go back to South Shore to finish off the higher level quests and at 35 you can go to Arathi Highlands. 
---
Lots of back and forth as you can see. Locating all these quests can be tricky at times. I strongly suggest downloading a quest tracking addon. 
---
My path from 10/12 to 20:
---
- 12-17 Darkshore
---
- 17-21 Darkshore / Loch Modan / Redridge / Darkshore
---
- 21-24 Ashenvale / Stonetalon / Darkshore
---
- 24-27 Darkshore / Wetlands
---
- 27-29 Wetlands / Redridge Duskwood
---
- 29-30 Duskwood
---
There is no direct path, especially when a zone can have quests across a 10 level range. Do a couple levels, do another zone for a few more, then to a third, then back to the first, then to a fourth zone, then back to the third.
---
You should have said earlier that you have no idea how sharding even works! 
---
That way I would have explained how it works like you were five years old. No wonder you’re so confused! I used too many big words. 
---
I really need to work on communicating for *all* mental ages!
---
I've written this before. For alliance specifically it is VC because it's the first dungeon you go to and the only reason you went was because of the quest to get the epic loot in there. The quest doesn't mention the deadmines. It only says "go kill van cleef" so you the quester who wants the shiny blue says "lfg for vc" at which point you try to figure out where to go and what that actually means. The name stuck. After that other dungeons became known for what they were - dungeons. And the actual name of them is used. 
---
You can see plenty of versions of atlas that show the dungeon code and they say VC. Some say DM too but it has never been a permanent thing and those that think it's DM are missing the logic of why VC even came about. It was a thing way before dire maul was.
---
This guy STVietnam’d. 
---
This contradicts the logic behind the abbreviations for literally every other dungeon in the game. Calling B.S on this. 
---
Was always VC on the older servers I played on. On new servers that launched, the people that said LFG DM were often ridiculed for trying to find Dire Maul groups in general, which the response was always that nobody would be running DM for a few weeks/month anyways.
---
soc is not locked to 7 procs per minute, thats just a formula it uses for its proc chance. slow weapons will have a high proc chance and fast weapons it will be lower, since you are attacking more but the same ppm. but its not a guarantee or limit.
---
Seriously  
---
All the “adults” I played with on private servers were some of the most deprived people I’ve ever met. It made vanilla WoW and even Diablo 2 online back in the day seem like a quaint 50s suburb
---
When I started circa patch 1.9, it seemed to be LFG VC for Deadmines, but often it was just, "LFG Deadmines."
---
Good meme, though.
---
Dire maul was patched in after dead mines. People were abbreviating dead mines to DM before dire mail was even releases.
---
Deadmines is the OG.
---
Huh, I didn't hear DM until BC+. It was always VC on high pop-NA server from day 1. 
---
What was the one item added in 1.12?
---
As someone who works professionally as a mobile dev, my experience has been the exact opposite. Traditionally iOS dev has been smoother, with Android dev being more bumpy. It’s gotten better recently thankfully but for a long time it was common to avoid porting to Android for as long as possible just because it was such a pain the rear.
---
Most warlock specific gear has large amounts of stamina on it, I wouldn't go as far as to say focusing on any one stat, mainly you want to have a healthy balance of stam/sp/crit in general, the best gear for pvp is usually R12-13 + a mix of T2/2.5, in general though it doesn't matter , as long as you are wearing anything from T2 onwards or R13 gear, the impact to gameplay diminishes beyond that point , meaning you  can obviously gain slightly more stats from min/maxing but those stats are not large enough to notice at that point.
---
As for specs, deep destro is the least common of the ones you stated, it's somewhat a relic of the past where it's only true function is open world 1 shots vs bad players.
---
SM/ruin is viable in pvp but is more of a hybrid all-in one build with a heavier emphasis on the pve side of things rather than the pvp, it might be surprising to hear for some but fights usually favor burst over rot situations, the rot playstyle fits SL specs more but they lack the added damage that siphon life and nightfall bring to the table which is why sl/sl gained such notoriety in tbc. 
---
In vanilla however  SM/ruin build is a glass canon dot spec with less burst and stronger dots, not exactly the kind of glass canon spec you want to be running , which is why nightfall/conflag is the superior choice for warlocks in any pvp scenario where your goal is to kill your opponent instead of just survive ( SL).
---
Soul link has two builds, most are familiar with the SL/nightfall one as that is the one most used for 1v1s, but the one I prefer to use most with SL is the 7/31/13, both specs have ups and downs ofc, SL/NF has added range which is truly great in pvp, especially when u need to tag the warriors before they charge u, but on the other hand the SL/shadowburn build removes the rng element tied to NF and gives you on demand burst which is a godsend for that spec, not to mention you gain faster immolate/shadowbolt casts  and although you use searing pain when being focused people tend to avoid focusing the SL lock in bgs so chugging those bolts becomes pretty smoother.
---
Both specs have ups and downs as I've said , I'd argue though that SL in general is more of a starter build when you just happen to ding 60 and your gear is too shit to kill anything anyway and u die to anything that looks at you and it does work wonders then , but once you get some gear going for you ( conflag builds need a lot of crit )  I'd swap off that build asap unless you only want to duel or 1v1 in general and never lose.
---
Hope this clears a few things for you
---
Yeah same. Gonna tank dungeons on my warrior, I ain't gonna have any competition on my own loot. Till I get gear anyways. After that, any loot is free roll, I'll only keep all the extras to finance warrior costs. 
---
@ /u/CTHN
---
Ah, that makes sense. Let's expresse it like this: spell power scales better the more crit you have.
---
Let's say that you have a basic spell that does 100 damage and hits for double damage on crit with your character starting out at a base crit chance of zero. Now if you have the choice to pick an item that adds either 1 more spell damage or 1% crit, on average they will boost damage output by the same amount:
---
100 * 1.01 = 101 * 1.00 = 101
---
But if you already have some crit, adding 1 spell power is slightly more beneficial than adding 1 per cent point of crit. E. g. for when you already crit 20% of the time (a realistic value):
---
101 * 1.20 = 121.2 &gt; 100 * 1.21 = 1.21
---
Basically the extra 0.2 points of damage you eek out by choosing spell power over crit stem from the the fact that 1 spell power doesn't just translate to 1 spell damage, it's actually translates to 1.20 points of extra damage (because 20% of the time the spell crits). 1% more crit on the other hand always means 1% more damage relative to the base value.
---
As a Horde player, “DM” meant dire maul, and no one ever did deadmines so it never came up.
---
Problem solved!
---
I don't know, it makes you able to actually do things while finding a group. I'm quite 2 third of dungeons run are only possible because of global chat. Nobody gonna wait in a capital for SM when you can be leveling.
---
Yes, the kill exp is reduced for both but for example if you have a priest with you who basically renews you and wands dudes you dont ever need to stop killing stuff and you can even do 4-5 mob pulls from time to time. And yes mage should go for aoe farmspec but my friend was a noob who didnt really know too much about vanilla.
---
The outnumbered faction has the easier time finding open world PvP
---
This is basically correct. It was unanimously "VC" for alliance leveling. Slowly, it began to turn into a mix of VC and DM. But once dire maul released it swung back to VC- but people still said DM obviously. 
---
In my heart it'll be VC (but if im in vent id say dead mines) 
---
I'll probably be one of these terrorists. As a tank, I'll make my groups. I didn't suffer through all the leveling process to not do whatever the fuck I want when 60, hunters can suck it. That, and it's the only good way to make money later anyway (if you res things like orbs.) 
---
Roll Horde, forget VC exists problem solved.
---
Enjoy scratching that itch!
---
The best onez everyone forgets.  Oil of immolation and cloak of fire
---
Getting into Karazhan on my moonkin, and not feeling like.a bum leg getting dragged along was pretty cool.
---
It's a classic. Why would you invite a warrior dps when your the tank? 
---
I’m gonna be 25 when classic launches. Born in 2001 feels like such a short time ago, but OP is an adult... Am I old?
---
Yeah it confused the hell out of me when I rerolled late in vanilla to a pvp server with some friends. I was use to calling it HU strat and UD strat on Uldum US and then I started hearing East/west strat in in the new one ( I think shattered hand US).
---
Whichever faction isn't the dominant one.
---
Even further distinguished by DM jump, tribute or lock mount. Because why would you do anything else?
---
I do know how it works, it literally breaks the game world up. You can't seem to carry the scenario further than a two year old though. 
---
So sharding the starting zones, after about one hour or two, in your mind most people have quit the game. That's the strategy for a good MMO launch in your mind. That most people quit the fucking game. Your words.
---
Quote me where I said that people quit the game. I’m facinated by your twisting of what I said. 
---
Sever dies and you say you're not going to re-roll somewhere else but after a month of tumbleweeds rolling through Ironforge you say fuck it and re-roll.
---
You cant travel back in time so all this i want it the exact it was isnt going to work anyways. Its like sayn hey lets life without phones or the internet. There will always be modern impacts we can only trim it down to some extant to make it feel like the good old days but you cant erase 15 years of technological development
---
Agreed, on servers still running, everyone says VC for Deadmines, in fact you want them to, since they will likely know it inside out.
---
Princess is all people say in the end.
---
please make this a mobile app it’s fantastic
---
I played on Elune from Vanilla-Wrath and VC was ALWAYS used for the Deadmines.
---
Dire Maul was DM + wing you were doing.
---
I cannot speak for any other server, but there wasn't a single time in my time on Elune where I had heard DM used for Deadmines.
---
I bounf frostbolt to my mouse wheel so I didnt need to use my left hand in raids, but now we're in aq and am fire 
---
I'm gonna message ya :)
---
I don't know about knowledgebases, but if you wish to be truly prepared, you'd better farm enough irl money to be able to take months of time off from work when it's released...
---
Unrealistic. Nobody has 100/150g sitting around that they can use to buy extra rolls on items.
---
Idk about him but i dont know what SVT is and i doubt he knows as well. Sorry if its a noob question but what is it?
---
&gt; I think it bears repeating: Unless you never leave your starting zone for the first couple of weeks, sharding at launch will only be noticeable for the first hour of leveling your first character. That's it. That's what this is all about. 
---
So for "sharding the starting zones" to work well then people better stop playing the game in hour 2. Don't they?
---
Thanks.
---
Played US vanilla servers from release. Never heard Deadmines abbreviated to DM. Was always VC on the servers I played on. Migrated to Oceanic later, was still VC over there.
---
I guess it's pretty region/server specific.
---
Playing private servers was very confusing for me with everyone saying DM.
---
Honest question, though it may sound completely stupid and I might not be thinking about this properly:
---
How viable is it to focus kill the demon first? I forget how much Stamina they get from the Warlock in Classic or in other words roughly how much relative health they have.
---
The original posts context is in terms of pve, which at different tiers of progression and itemization give a literal best in slot list for what  is the most dps/hps/or threat per second according to the current meta. Items that aren't as good as another obtainable item in-game are not best in slot by definition.
---
Has no one on this subreddit heard of satire?
---
Both are problems
---
If you really can't see a single way loot trading can be abused in a raid setting I don't know what to tell you.
---
No one is asking for mythic level difficulty. 
---
Yeah, dev effort should go into streamlining the approval process for legitimate misclicks and that’s about it. That reduce the workload on GMs. They know it was a problem in the past, so use modern solutions to fix it, without altering gameplay. Adding loot trading is altering fundamentally crucial gameplay, and seeing as how classic is a loot-based and social game, and loot trading damages both of these things. It really is a perfect storm of nope.
---
Most of the cost to blizz for running Vanilla WoW was actually in customer support. That’s why I think Classic should have a standalone sub fee which can fund Classic the way it needs to be funded. Just because the content is reused doesn’t mean it can be underfunded and provide a blizzard-level of experience, nor does it mean that a proper polished Classic game isn’t worth a standalone sub fee. Cutting costs in ways that make the experience worse will also cut their profits, so you might as well just do it right and make the game as gold as possible. That will do the most for Blizzard in the longrun by actually putting out a polished game and regaining some of their lost reputation.
---
I want the best possible experience, and I’m willing to pay my fair share of what it takes to get that, just via a sub fee for the love of Elune, not garbage fucking cosmetic microtransactions.
---
The literal reading comprehension of a five year old, folks!
---
&gt; Sharding at launch will **only be noticeable** for the first hour of leveling your first character. 
---
Do you know what noticeable means? It means to be aware of something. So I’ll put it in words even you can understand:
---
Sharding the starting zones at launch is something that will only be *noticeable* for an hour or two. After that, it won’t even affect you. 
---
Haha, the reading comprehension of a jar of mayonaise, lol. 
---
Burning Blade alliance, it was always VC = deadmines, DM = dire maul.  
---
Ok, so it should be obvious to the group that you are currently in your offspec. In higher level dungeons you should state this whereas in low level dungeons it is a given. Stating what you will roll on ahead of time is always good form though.
---
Low level dungeons: You roll on weapons and armor (of your armor type, not lower) that will benefit your levelling. You will also roll on leather/mail/plate gear with int etc. for your healing set but leave int cloth and spell damage/int weapons alone unless nobody else needs it. Reason for this is that int leather/mail/plate is not useful for levelling whereas int weapons and cloth are usually worn by the caster DPS full-time.
---
High level dungeons (starting around halfway through BRD ~lvl 54+): You roll primarily on healing items. Items without +spell damage/spellhit are usually fair game for both healers and caster DPS because they will be replaced quickly but anything with +spell dmg/+healing should go to the specialized roles as some items in this level range are already very relevant for lvl 60. However, the cloth/nocloth rule usually still applies and non-cloth is usually safe to roll on.  
---
If you wish to roll on DPS or tanking gear you should explain this to the group first so they understand the reasoning (e.g. healing is your off-set or similar). Be advised though that specs like ret/protpally/moonkin are usually not viable in vanilla and not considered to be good enough reasoning by most players and feral/shadow are kind of limited in viability.  
---
It is also important to know the impact of certain items. For example nobody will complain all too much about sharing lvl 52-58 twohanders with a pally because it helps their last stretch of levelling and a warrior would just replace it quickly at 60 as well. But if you start rolling on highly contested best in slot items like Hand of Justice or Truestrike Shoulders you can make some enemies very quickly.
---
NA alliance, Burning Blade.  Deadmines was VC 100% of the time.
---
This is really simple. If someone posts about DM at all, shift click their name. If they a re around 19 they mean Deadmines. If almost 60 they mean Dire Maul. Geez xD
---
The 10 people I rolled with through karazhan actually let me do some Moonkin tanking, sometimes even on purpose!
---
Can you do a "realistic" BIS mode to, I give you a exampel thunderfury are probebly BIS for sword rogue in Tire 1. No guild will give a rogue a thunderfury then Trie 1 are relevant (if they are not extremely lucky or the rogue is the guild master) 
---
Josh good u bad

KT Shield on Private servers has bugged item stats - it uses the TBC version, which adds an extra 500 armor and over 30 block value. Saph shield is superior in all ways using the correct values.

---
Yes they are in this instance.
---
One of the most well known early questlines for Alliance is the Defias Brotherhood line. It's very hard to miss, fun and rewarding so almost everyone does it.
---
The finale is a quest that tells you to kill Van Cleef. It gives amazing gear for your level so people were always looking for a group to complete that quest.
---
Since it's the first dungeon in the game for many people they wouldn't already know the conventions for abbreviating dungeon names. People were looking to kill Van Cleef specifically rather than do a Deamines run for the sake of doing a Deadmines run so it evolved from that.
---
"Anybody want to kill Van Cleef?" "LF1M Van Cleef" "Any groups for VC?" "Let's put together a VC group"
---
Replace "cloth item" with flask of titans recipe
---
"LFM 2 DD, DM /w me (no rogues)"
---
It was probably somewhat server and faction dependent. I have personal knowledge that on Garona Alliance, it was VC pretty much 100% of the time. But I totally believe that might not have been the case everywhere.
---
Main purpose of skipping skills is to save for mount, which paladins don't need to do.
---
If you have another reason for skipping, you could get away without resist auras, holy wrath, anything past r1 Seal of Command (it just increases judgement damage which stops mana regen), all ranks of Seal of Justice, and anything past r1 turn undead (or all ranks probably). 
---
Try to exhaust everything you can, because when you hit early 30s, you will hit a dry spot. I'd say, definitely exhaust Redridge, and then Wetlands is very friendly to 22-25s. Duskwood has some low level quests you can do whenever, but theres enough later level quests in Duskwood that should supply you from 25-30. Ashenvale is also an option, but in my  *years* of WoW i never thoroughly quested through there. I'm pretty sure most of it is mid 20s as well.
---
So, exhaust what you can in Redridge &gt; Do the easy quests in Duskwood while youre there &gt; Wetlands &gt; Ashenvale &gt; Clean up in Duskwood.
---
No doubt it'll be xxxtentacion and lil pump
---
Christ how do you people play? That would not work for me AT ALL. The game environment is too varied to not be constantly using the zoom.
---
It hurts seeing a Hunter with TF.
---
Caster spells work off a two roll table system - first roll to see level based chance to have the spell land, and another roll to see if that spell becomes a hit. While for melees, it is a singular one table roll - which allows for certain rolls to push off the chance for other options in that roll.
---
What about the source for the vanilla stat spread on kt shield?
---
I never agreed with people that were against personal graphical changes. However, before even the first update after Blizzcon 2017, there were plenty of people saying that revamped models wasnt a big deal. That's a dead discussion now, since theyre 100% not included, but with model skeletons and animations, and the drasticness of the difference in stylistics, that's the only personal flavor choice i've been against.
---
Also, I still kind of want to test the extent of the water graphics, and how it could give an advantage to world PVP. I know for certain, you can hide a few feet under the old water, and you would dissapear, as well as your nameplate. However, I think with the modern water, you can see people hiding much further down, and their nameplate is more visable. I could be wrong, and I hope I am.
---
If I'm not wrong, then anybody is encouraged to update the water graphics (which I prefer the old water graphics) so that, for example, they get ganked less in STV. It seems like a small thing, but it's a long way to 60, it will come up at some point.
---
I remember calling it strath on AoS

the first implementation of loot trading didn't allow need rolls being traded.  FYI  So all of this is skeptical

Also, the fact that you haven't even bothered to inform yourself about what "nochanges" actually means, proves that you are very young, and a liberal. They never inform themselves.
---
I won't spend my time explaining you what "nochanges" means. 
---
Be a good boy and read about it. All your questions were answered previously.
---
Absolute BiS? Very. Very hard. Everyone's is, to be fair. But for Rogues..  
---
Your best MH (both Sword and Dagger spec) drops from Kel'Thuzad and you'll be fighting both the Prot (they REALLY want Hungering Cold but probably won't say no to Gressil either)/Fury Warriors, other Rogues, and potentially Hunters (to a lesser degree, any hunter that bids for this sword is being a butt since their BiS is a 2H in the first place, and there are SO many other weapons).   
---
Sword offhand will probably not be as bad, mostly a Fury/Rogue fight, if you go for Raz sword. Hungering Cold offhand (if not playing a human rogue) you'll probably never see, since there's 8 tanks in Naxx who have first dibs before you get to the non-human Fury/Rogues. Dagger offhand not terribly bad since it's a trash drop, just Rogue/possibly Hunter competition, alongside RNG for getting the trash drop at all.  
---
Armor is mostly Tier, which is hard to get a full 8/8 or 9/9 set of in ANY raid tier, and Naxx is no exception. Sword wants the full 9/9. Dagger only usually takes 7/9 Naxx tier which is nice, but then their BiS belt comes from C'Thun, but their BiS gloves are arguably the easiest to get; they're from all the way back in MC so hopefully you picked them up several tiers ago.  
---
Neck isn't awful, it's the Nefarian neck (the dropped one, not the one from Nef's Head quest) from BWL for both dagger/sword, so decent competition but imo Rogues should have at least a tiny bit of preference for this piece (if running loot council, DKP obv is DKP) because it lasts them through Naxx as well and removes them entirely from Naxx neck competition.  
---
Cloak is from Sapphiron, second last boss in Naxx. Every melee/agility dps ever wants this cloak. You will be competing with EVERYONE for it. It's not BiS for Feral/Fury iirc but it's still a slammin' good cloak so they'll still fight you for it.  
---
One ring (to rule them all) is covered by Tier, the Naxx Tier rings drop from KT so that's another ass of a piece to get purely by which boss it drops off, but it's Rogue competition only. The second ring is from Loatheb, and you'll have the usual Hunter/Fury/Rogue competition.  
---
Trinkets are always a crapshoot. Again, Hunter/Warrior/Rogue competition BUT hopefully your Hunters and Furies already have one trinket spot filled with the DFT so you'll only have to compete half as much as usual.  
---
Ranged Weapon, since it's mostly a complete stat stick for a Rogue, you'll be hella down on the list behind the Hunters first and the tanks next (for ranged pulls) but you can get away with absolute BiS from KT, or runner up 2BiS from Four Horsies, either way you will never ever be first in line for either of them unless you are being a massive butt like the Hunter who bid on your Sword MH.  
---
Uh, I don't think I missed an armor spot or got anything TOO horrifically wrong, but yes. Very hard. And the above list is assuming you're on Naxx farm. Once you throw in progression (Naxx is haaaaaard), general loot drop rates (3-4 pieces for 40 people per boss) it'll take you a long, long while. Which in some ways isn't honestly a bad thing, it means farming Naxx to get a full BiS raid group will keep the endgame (if they don't add any more content, which they probably won't) going for a very good while!  
---
Anyway, let me know if you want the actual gear list I was working off instead of vague mentions, I'm **pretty** sure it's the correct BiS list for both Sword/Dagger Rogues.
---
&gt; I am hoping for a transmog addon for vanilla 
---
Yeah...not going to happen.
---

---
Won't notice sharding. Oh, you actually believe that. 
---
You just found out why this idea looks great, but can't beat a spreadsheet. It looks nice and it's easy to check out, but a spreadsheet is ultimately just easier to use and more informative. 
---
No one's in Westfall scouting a party for Dire Maul. 
---
Explain to me how you’ll notice sharding in Duskwood. 
---
I’m dying to hear your clearly well-thought out logic. 
---
I'd be fine with an average value taken from the lower and upper values of the spell.
---
I understand that it will always be an approximation due to the nature of different heals having varied healing pool widths, buff/debuffs on you, buff/debuffs on your target.
---
It would never be able to display perfect values but I feel that having "at a glance" healing and mana values  on your spells would be better than nothing.
---
STV is the acronym for the zone Stranglethorn Vale in Eastern Kingdoms.  
---
STV is sometimes called STVietnam because of the large amount of world PVP that occurs in this zone.  
---
PVP occurs in this zone a lot because several quests are shared by both factions via the Nessingwary Camp and Booty Bay quest hubs, which places both factions in the same areas at nearly every turn.  
---
One common event is Nessingwary's camp being "controlled" by one faction or the other, and in order to turn in your quests there, you need to take it over from the other faction.  
---
I actually enjoy being the vending machine haha. 
---
Human nation, Night Elf nation, Gnomish nation, Dwarven nation so long as bargains are your inclination you’re welcome here. Don’t be shy come on by! 
---
Just want to weigh in and say it was always VC on my server. 
---
I was an Altaholic so i did a lot of "LFM VC"
---
I remember people talking about the constant 10-15K on Nost PVP like it was a good thing. What a fucking meme.
---
Imagine unironically believing that people who care about gear in an MMO are unimportant. What? In retail, did you just not care about gear in the slightest?
---
That was always true, though. Any decent dps would run simcraft in the later expansions to find out stat weights according to their own gear. Especially when they added stat ratings, which came with diminishing returns. 1 point of haste wasn't worth the same % depending on how much you already had. 
---
That's what you get for going Druid instead of Mage
---
Nope. You laid out your bad sharding idea and I poked a hole in it. You took personal offence and here we are, nowhere. 
---
Can i see you swing Corrupted Ashbringer and stack spell damage? in my testing i can get ~1350dps
---
Nice try, but you’re not gonna Trump-pivot your way out of this one. 
---
So, explain to me: If you only shard the starting areas during the first week of launch, how will sharding affect you in duskwood later that month?
---
in fact, dps can go higher if you tailor your gear to the fight duration.
---
I'm pretty sure you can do that. You're the only person who'll see your character looking any differently, though, but you can change your character model on your client. I'm sure certain if it's against the TOS.
---
Off-hand:
---
Generic stamina/spell damage stat stick
---
Furbolgh Medicine Pouch
---
Skull of Impending Doom
---
Trinkets:
---
Engineering gnomish death ray or net
---
ToEP / Hakkar Spell Damage Trinket
---
Generic Spell Damage Trinket
---
&gt; but I don't see how that minor of a change hurts. A simple addon does the same thing.
---
I don't like this one.
---
I think the game should be kept simple, and if people want more.. detailed, informative, better versions they can resort to addons, as it allows you a fully custom experience to the game, instead of blizzard shoving one addon down everyone's throat and saying this is the only one people should be using. 
---
Give me that damn wand you filthy murloc
---
hmmm playing as horde only i only ever saw DM referred to as dire maul. Basically no one ever ran deadmines since it was really out of the way. 
---
Wow this is sick. Are you planning to publish it on a website for the community during classic?
---
What classes can beat sl locks 1v1? Spriest, warriors and maybe rogues?
---
I suppose I'll be chitchatting while waiting for Hogger to respawn cause we don't have a login queue anymore? You never did expand your scenario past that 1h you know..
---
On my server it was simply “Looking for members to join a party in order to venture into the Deadmines so we can kill Van Cleef and obtain new gear for our characters whilst also earning some experience points”
---
Like, I don’t get how this is even an issue 
---
You are kind of terrible at this trolling thing. You forgot to put "MAGA!" At the end of your post. 
---
When I first started playing, I was told it was VC, so I always called/call it that. DM, VC—doesn’t bother me. Context usually gives it away.
---
I'm wondering if calling it vc was an American thing or something, because in my 7 years on European wow servers starting from vanilla, I never once heard it being refered to as VC. But on private servers these days I see it all the time. 
---
Oh. Oh no. You should have told me you've never even played WoW before.
---
You... you do realize Hogger is a level 11 quest mob *in Elwynn Forest*, right?
---
Yikes. Either I've been destroying a twelve year old, or you're just trolling. Honestly, I can't tell, but I feel a bit dirty now. :s
---
People who hate res runs are usually pretty short sighted, people with brains won't hate you for it. Especially as a tank. 
---
I am in the #nochange camp. I will always be. But, you clearly don't understand what #nochanges actually mean. Also, there is a difference between changes and improvements. Clearly you don't grasp that.
---
You are coming with the example of graphics options in Classic. In your twisted mind, this is a change...well, it is not. It is an improvement.
---
\#nochanges means keep Classic as much as possible to Vanilla, in regards to everything related to the GAMEPLAY. Classes, specs, skills, gold sinks, content, zones, raids, etc. etc.
---
Nobody in #nochange camp asked for OLD GRAPHICS. We asked for OLD MODELS. OLD SPELL EFFECTS. New graphics were not only expected (for fuck sake, we are in 2019) but also WELCOMED by everyone. New graphics won't change the GAMEPLAY. 
---
The main reason I paid them greedy ActiBlizz for the virtual Blizzcon ticket was to see how the Classic demo graphics look like. And they look fucking AMAZING. Were the graphics changed? No, they were IMPROVED.
---
Also, stop repeating what we all ALREADY KNOW : yes, the community won't be the same, but it will be as amazing as the one back in the day (private servers prove it time and time again).
---
At least you didn't told us that it's just nostalgia, and we will all quit 10 minutes after logging in.
---
This was the original "res run". People just not inviting other people who might roll on the same items. I remember doing exactly that, refusing to invite anyone who wore the same armor class as me when I was a noob. 
---
But I want my character to look like the dude on the right.
---
The one on the left is a pansy kid. The one on the right has that crazed 'dont fuck with me' look.
---
Thanks that seems very nice
---
Then you run to nearest mailbox, send it all to your lvl 1 Orgrimmar/Ironforge bank alt, resume playing. Takes a fuck all worth of 5-10 minutes, tops.
---
Isn't the point of Gbid that it's somewhat evenly distributed? It makes sense that the guy organizing it takes a small cut from the pool, you might also think it's fair that the raid carries get a slightly higher cut than the guys getting carried, but it's usually just split evenly to avoid headaches. 
---
Since I'm also against loot trading I could live with that. 
---
If it turns into Burning Crusade I doubt I'd bother with it unless TBC was a separate shard
---
During Vanilla i have been playing alliance exclusively and no one ever called Deadmines "VC" on each of the servers i've played, so its deffo not "VC" for Alliance in every case. 
---
From what i can tell on topics about this is that "VC" is generally a US thing and possibly US Alliance generally. 
---
i use "-" and "+" on the numpad.
---
Not gonna happen.
---
Source article: Gamepro/EB Games Presents WoW magazine 2006!
---
Nobody knows since Blizzard hasn't said anything about it. It's very likely because they are waiting to see if Classic is successful or not.
---
My guess:
---
A) Make new content if the game is a huge success.
---
B) Upgrade to TBC:.. very likely 
---
C) Upgrade to TBC and keep Wow 1.12 servers around.
---
It's what I suppose as well. Never saw it referenced as VC in EU either. 
---
Just for the lulz, though, I might start referring to dungeons by their endboss in Classic now. 
---
Curious to see who'll get AA, PT, GD and IT. 
---
No changes on gameplay. But hey give me that awesome graphics 😍
---
Yeah...it might happen. Third part addons and all, I don't want to play battle for azeroth you troglodyte.
---
That's the worst misspelling of worst I've ever seen. 
---
As a Canadian always playing on US servers, I had never seen it referred to as VC during vanilla. 
---
Alliance Warrior, Stranglethorn Veil circa 2005.
---
I can't accept that as it has a letter from VC but not DM. How about DC for dead cookie?
---
Don't forget he can also have trinket that absorb some damage on top of it :)
---
Why is this even a discussion? It'll be different from server to server. 
---
I mean it's good to know the different options, but if someone calls deadmines "VC" then he should not wonder if nobody wants to accompany him/ her OR people just whisper you "what's VC?" And then you win because you created social interaction. 
---
So please... that really should not be worth 2 reddit posts in a couple of hours. 
---
Is it how people who were PvE remember Vanilla ? If you did, were you always going to WB before raiding ?
---
From my noob point of view, i was told that Vanilla PvE was time consumming and about having enought gear to pass some boss. Not a 20 minutes prepation to switch to "easy mode"
---
Maybe i'm wrong and Vanilla players were all doing this..
---
Incorrect. Horde players who weren't afraid of going on a hike ran deadmines and we called it DM. 
---
Okay, that makes perfect sense and I agree with your logic :). But shouldn't be modeled that way, rather than by an actual diminishing return to spell power? It feels wrong, doesn't it?
---
My feral tank just laugh when 3 melee try to cap my flag fast enough so that no one else come def it. 1 min later i'm still alive.
---
7k hp + 2k frenzied regeneration on top of 75% damage reduction = 36k effective health
---
none
---
They could just make that automated popup and also automatically delete the ticket. So if people want to write 100 tickets, let them do so. Nobody will have an effort with it. 
---
With AI this shouldn't be that big of a deal these days.
---
If I'm leveling a warrior and tanking a dungeon with a shield and one hander there is no way I'm passing or even asking before rolling if a sweet 2hander drops. 
---
And anyone that would argue otherwise can fuck off. 
---
The actual solution to this is to learn a language in which the translated dungeon names don't have identical abbreviations and then play on a server of that language.
---
If you are not interested in competitive pvp I would say alliance warlock. Works well in bg's but not 1v1 against UD rouges. It's probably the least played class on alliance and there seems to be a lack of them in raids.
---
Only priest can dispel magic on horde so you would have that going for you atleast.
---
I shit you not, I replied to a "VC" run once in Westfall, given the fact I still needed to kill van cleef I asked and join the group.
---
Well. It was a Wailing Caverns run 
---
I'm saying your sharding idea is bad enough to retard server progression that far. One month to get out of Elwynn Forest. That's how stupid I'm saying your idea is. It is really bad. Understand? 
---
Having played since vanilla: Dead Mines was DM to everyone leveling, and then it turned into VC when they turned around at max level and began running their friends through it while waiting for their Dire Mail group to get together.
---
How does one do emotes while the UI is hidden?
---
Isn't every dungeon abbreviated by the innitials of the final boss? No? Then it's DM.
---
I am starting to think this is a Horde vs Alliance thing.  I remember on the US realms I played 3 servers during their launch periods.  The 2 times I was alliance DM was deadmines everytime (also obvious because everyone was low lvl, but I think it was also that way for alts) and it was DME/DMW/DM trib etc.  The 1 time I went horde obviously deadmines basically did not exist for us so LF1M DM happened fairly frequently and it was obviously dire maul (wing was usually indicated but not always).  I dont think I ever heard LF1M VC etc during vanilla but could have been due to the specific servers I was on.
---
Yes it's bad and loot trading shouldn't be in the game (or at least restrict it to raids), but holy christ this community always blow shit out of proportion. No loot trading won't ruin the game nor the community aspect. The community would figure out a way to deal with it and the community will move on.
---
Y'know, it's like I read 200 posts exactly like this one.
---
O wow that sounds sick actually. Thanks for the thorough response!
---
Feeling's mutual. Born in 2000, and I'm obsessed with the concept of Classic. 
---
Initially I thought the first verse was sang to the tune of Frozen... :^)
---
looks mostly that NA uses vc while european crowd sticks to dm
---
Deadlines is VC named after the last boss.
---
Dire maul is DM 
---
If it is a voidwalker not very.  Felhunters, succubus and non-shifted imps were pretty easy though and usually worth it.
---
Very appropriate tweet https://twitter.com/Jaythebard89/status/1101686096868433920
---
I can’t accept that because DC is a comic book company. And it will cause confusion. How about we call it VM?
---
was just DM everywhere for my realm. People understood which one based on context:
---
*\*Level 30+ asks\** Dire Maul
---
*\*Level 15+ askes\** Dead Mine
---
You telling me to do something to solve the solution? That’s to much work!
---
Shift right click on random person in LFG chat, and if level is 18-20ish = Deadmines or 53-60ish = Dire Maul  
---
Literally this. Never ever did I ever see it called vc and literally never was anyone ever confused. 
---
For me the game was basically
---
VC or DM TRIB/KING RUN that was it in chat. 
---
Born 2002 and I can't wait to play vanilla. I started playing WoW properly in 2016 (WoD) and enjoyed the 1-60 leveling experience and Northrend but after that, the game felt really boring and uninspired.
---
Vanilla is going to be great and I can't wait to experience it for the first time and get really immersed in the world of Azeroth. All the stories people have shared from vanilla, the old world, the slow pace, the old talent system. Awe man I'm so goddamn hyped. Time to make my own Vanilla memories which I can remember forever!
---
US-Proudmoore used to say Live and Death for sure. 
---
Probably because EU servers didn't exist when there was only VC. 
---
23 yrs old and ready to max the fuck out on classic
---
I think it's safe to say you shouldn't go full Resto when leveling up.
---
Classic will be different than vanilla. I will be forced to do world buffs in Classic if I want to stay competitive. It's just a chore getting all those buffs and coordinating them all.  
---
World buffs were not commonly used in vanilla except for in Naxx and a bit of AQ40, but that doesn't matter now. People change, and so have the attitudes about raiding and min/maxing.  
---
We'll be the old grizzled vets sitting in the back /guffawing at the new blood getting munched by kobolds and quilboar. There's gonna be a lot of skellys in those starter zones.
---
See now you’re lfg marathon (maradon)
---
🧐
---
I agree with your Alliance warlock suggestion. It's worth noting that with proper skill and a stupid amount of free time, a warlock can solo all of Scholomance.  
---
Very carefully...using the keyboard, I think I had 4 hours of footage after filming.
---
But you cant type or use Marcos when the UI is hidden
---
Yeah it's viable but I wouldn't advise it until your guild has the raid on farm mode which means your guild is geared to the teeth. 
---
Nope, if I say DM I mean dire maul, if I say VC that means I have lowered myself to being ally 
---
Right!? Thanks OP, now I feel like I'm 80.
---
&gt; threat caps DPS.  
---
&gt; paladin
---
Lmao
---
There's a high chance you won't have good gear if you are leveling up unless you go out of your way to gear up in an instance which would slow down leveling anyway. And also some of the paladins bread and butter talents won't be able until you are over level 30. 
---
I have no idea what people care about in retail I haven’t played retail since 2007, been playing private server.
---
I ran deadmines a lot on horde and shadowfang a lot on alliance.
---
They were both fun places with good gear and the journey with friends was fun. 
---
I still remember traveling on foot and by boat from dark shore through ashenvale and the barrens to get to theramore and wetlands to run all the way up to silver pine. The world was this amazing huge place where you traveled and were rewarded for your efforts. 
---
But no one in their right mind levels a warrior as prot.  Of course they will be rolling on 2 handers. 
---
I was there. And i still remember this event. Everyone tried to fight back, no one succeeded :D
---
Still, it was epic af. 
---
By vanilla you mean retail?  Because vanilla didnt exactly regress in terms of player numbers ...
---
Thanks. I thought... things happened...
---
to "just clear raids" then yes, since they could just carry you. But good players (esp. min-maxers) usually like playing with others who take the game as seriously as them, which means playing rogue or fury warr instead of ret xd.
---
DM versus Dm discussion :)
---
I think I may have used the macro recorder on my keyboard, but i dont remember having to do anything special.
---
Alright
---
This will pretty much be 90% of Westfall general chat on launch of classic
---
The other 10% will be ‘where is the messenger’ 
---
I just want to play the game. Currently playing Lotro, its quite fun and enjoyable. Also rockin ESO, but thats without friends is a bit boring. End my life
---
This has to be a phenomenon only on US servers, during my lvling experience on eu servers everyone said DM. I never heard of anyone saying DM if they meant “we’re doing all three wings of Dire Maul”
---
Yeah I think in vanilla I had roughly 0 ninja loots in groups/5-mans and maybe had it happen once? during raiding when for some reason it wasnt on masterloot (was early vanilla during MC).  
---
So either the "community" got severely more toxic post-tbc when I quit or there are just a lot of people in this forum injecting their own toxicity/delusions.  I recently played on an EQ progression server and everyone I leveled up with was nice with 0 problems with loot (despite almost all drops being tradeable and quite a few selling well).  
---
Maybe people just don't remember that in old school MMOs (and I will include original vanilla in this) even if you knew absolutely nobody when you start by the time you are halfway to max level you probably have your own dungeon group on friends list with several alternates depending on who is on/available/correct level.  People usually are not going to break off all their relations with their community over one drop no matter how good it is because these are the people you are going to be playing/raiding with for months or years.
---
Its called dm/DM.
---
“Let’s add LFD tool, if ur a purist just don’t use it lmao xd and u won’t be affected”
---
yeah because that’s how it fucking works 
---
I’ll give u a half eaten hotdog and two pickles for it. 
---
Really like wtf, do you enjoy the game copy pastaing shit like this. I hope i can ninja your stuff lol nerd. You need people like me to make classic like real classic. Xxx
---
Are we talking two whole pickles or two slices? 
---
Hunter.
---
Hunter, the only class that can kite bosses, Warlock can do few kiting tricks with dots and jumping, druid just face tanking with hots, paladin can do pretty good aoe damage vs undeads and healing self without pushbacks. 
---
I can't accept that because VM means Virtual Machine and computer techs play this game, so it will cause confusion. How about we call it CM instead?
---
True, I've never seen Deadmines refered to as VC in my years of playing Vanilla. 
---
Yeah the wait sucks
---
It's been a while but leveling as prot IIRC is viable by AOE grinding with a shield spike, holy shield and sanc at level 40. You can pull a heck of a lot of mobs as well.
---
How about callingThe Dead Mines TDM
---
What pet with this, Felhunter?
---
It has a higher armor than face of death but is missing something like 3% block chance making it worse. The defense difference is likely irrelevant since T3 is massively over cap. In conclusion, it's a bad shield for wares but not AS bad as you would think.
---
This. 
---
For any class, which spells if any can you keep at rank 1 throughout the life of vanilla due to increased ranks not doing much besides costing more mana?  
---
Not just me..  thank god
---
Added on discord.
---
&gt; The real question is Live and Dead vs East and West Strat
---
Neither. It was a either a Baron run or Scarlet side, at least back in vanilla in the EU.
---
Druids have a pretty easy time soloing to 60, and they can take on most things outdoors thanks to entangling roots. Stealth allows you to bypass mobs for quests and to infiltrate dungeons to reach soloable bosses. 
---
However in terms of being able to solo kill challenging stuff, that's a different story. Indoors especially Druids don't have as easy a time. Mages on the other hand, if they're frost-specced, [can pull off some pretty crazy stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5frS6BjaiD8) . They really need gear to do this sort of thing though, which is going to come from dungeon runs for the most part. Feral druids on the other hand have bizarre itemisation that is all over the place, meaning you can get a fair bit of it without having to group up.  
---
Nice idea but is less useful than seems. Issue is that often you swap sets based on fights and your place in the guild, instead of just having 1 set of bis gear. Examples: mages swapping to speak gear for kiting ie Gluth. Shamans swapping to chain heal set on heavy some fights like saph and viscidous. Mages swapping between fire and frost spec gear between low and high end raids. Warriors swapping between defense and evasion gear (PW). In essence, most classes had multiple BiS sets at any given time. Maybe offer multiple choices for each item or something? 
---
And are you still 11 today, rolling your first paladin in a fresh new game? Cause that seems to be your point.

Still lots of radio silence around Ghost...
---
Eh bis is kind of gone in a sense that there are multiple BiS sets depending on which fight you are talking about. You aren't wearing 1 set all the way through. 
---
That's amazing! There can't be many of the old Beta veterans left playing!
---
Naga?
---
Presses shadow bolt for 4 hours 
---
Hunters can solo a whole bunch of high level instances if you're up for the challenge! Invis pots and imp feign death are your friends.
---
Not to mention 'BiS' lists are based on private servers and won't totally hold up in the light of day when classic drops.  There will be changes.  Hell there are already arguments about what is BiS.
---
A proper distribution of food and water is very important if you want to grind efficiently and minimize downtime. Personally I got Monster to the right and doritos to the left (best calories/gram ratio to reduce eating time). Use straws to drink so you don't have to take your hand off the keyboard or mouse. 
---
And remember that if you feel like passing out, set up macro to spam spacebar so you won't get kicked out of server for inactivity. 
---
&gt;I haven't hit 60 but I know what's best
---
Well okay then.
---
Has anyone managed to decide on what to play yet? I feel like I keep getting stuck between lock and mage.
---
Shaman uses rank 1 spells to proc armor buff. Chain heal rank 1 is also used often. 
---
Because that's what it was, and most of the bugs are bullshit.
---
I actually calculated this once, and for Ferals it gave a little bit less than 70% damage reduction with the gear I thought was BiS. However with Barkskin I think you can break the 90% damage reduction line for like 20 sec. Completely unkillable for melees.

---
Awful quiet around here.  
---
To battle! For the Alliance!
---
I played most of vanilla, the rare mobs in the demo were correct to my recollection.  They were mainly just named versions of the regular mobs, not rare elites like exist now.
---
I was outside stormwind for it.. lots of dreadlords, never knew about the 500 dragon tho near IF...
---
A HUGE amount of the bugs in the reddit thread were wrong and incorrect due to pserver experience.
---
Hulk Smash!
---
Basically spells (that includes player/NPC spells but also things like 'Equip' or 'Chance On Hit' effects on gear), skills and talent data are client side and reside inside DBC files with the vanilla clients, so we have accurate information for all patches regarding those.
---
This. It's easy to get close, maybe complete 70% of your set, then the odd few items you will take months to get. On my server the hardest to get items are: DFT and Badge of the Swarmguard, (DFT being far harder as warrs want it too), ony neck as it's also amazing for hunters (maybe bis?), Hungering cold because it's so rare and every fucker wants it. T3 rings are actually pretty easy to get but most people don't even wear it and just opt for something better started as the T3 set bonus you get at 8/9. Saph cloak is also very high demand but nowhere near as much as hungering cold or DFT.
---
It's for such boobs that people are wearing paladin T2 to this day ://
---
I didnt log in that day but I was there in beta aswell. RIP 
---
&gt; both times, it was the main guild leader
---
that's what I'm aspiring for, plus rank 14 and scarab lord. So, it quite applies to me.
---
&gt; Oddly I lose weight when I play too much.
---
Same here. But, for me, I generally tend to lose weight when I eat more. Like more often. When I'm working out or jogging, I'm obviously not eating. But when I'm playing, I'm always eating.
---
It was scrapped and eventually became the DLC Nova missions in SC2. They could not get the right feel on the engine they were using at the time. There were interviews about it. Good example of why they do not talk about things tho.
---
yes, I had to rent a non-extended and pay 4$ for each part for 48 hours, because they were not on netflix in my country.
---
I took the awkward wording to mean that they weren't addressing some of the bugs in the bug threads because, like several given examples, they weren't actual bugs.
---
Prepaid yes, you will be half leather. In raids you will be full tier set, maybe the odd piece of leather like belt or gloves in AQ40. But generally mail.
---
haha all in one spot XÐ
---
but, the mistake is like taking the wrong way
---
What level 50-60 is looking for a dire maul group in Westfall? 
---
It was never a bloody issue to begin with. 
---
I live in the US, and I've never heard a reference to deadmines as VC. It's always been DM.
---
Me and my gf are quitting our jobs. :)
---
I'd say he should hold a book or a flower in the other hand, not a second gun
---
Yes, posted several times in this thread.
---
I could be wrong but I think they did mention this at blizzcon?
---
Are we there yet?
---
A lot of people have BC memories that take the place of their vanilla memories (if they even played it).
---
Damn. That's awesome. Can I have your gf's number?  
---
&gt;DM = Deadmines and anybody that says VC is an uncultured heathen!
---
I'd give you plus, if not that racist comment against me.
---
Go back to your Orgrimmar where you belong!
---
More importantly they have the 1.12 *server*.  The client is a dumb terminal that shows what the server tells it to, mainly.
---
Never ever saw it called VC when it was sort of relevant. The first time I saw it as VC was on some shitty pserver years later. Was very confused for a minute, too. 
---
Of spelling!
---
There is a reason that hunter is the world record holding solo leveling class.
---
After mage, they also make the most gold solo, because they can solo a lot of dungeons including DM:T.
---
Its pretty tough in vanilla, arguably the worst class/spec combo iirc, then they made them OP to compensate in bc 
---
I bind mouse up, down and 3 as well as shift + up, down and 3.
---
Camera functions are relegated to alt + mouse wheel
---
Blizzard calls their support staff Community Managers so CMs won't work. How about DCVCDM?
---
Warlocks should only be using the first rank of Drain Soul because it's only useful to farm soul shards
---
If you are not in the min/maxing game there are some pretty decent (or at least good enough) hybrid specs that allow you to raidheal, pvp heal and aoe farm.  
---
I never heard Baron or Scarlet, for me it was always Live or Dead on EU
---
When you complete naxx lmk
---
Not everyone pays hunter
---
Well I'll tell you this. Everyone said that retail is bad since cata came out. But there is one amazing thing that I love both on Legion and BFA. Questing and the way story is told through quests. I immersed myself in Legion story so much I forgot about leveling and I kept on doing quests long after I dinged max level. And when I think about all the WoW expansions the story, the world,  lore, art, music and attention to detail is what made me love this game. I may not like the changes made to gameplay and game progression but i did found things I love about new expansions too. 
---
How would anyone know what level the dragon was? It would be ?? to everyone. I call bs on the lvl 500 part 
---
NA here too, Alliance. Played on Lightbringer and Ysondre when it opened. It was always VC. We would ridicule people for calling Deadmines DM
---
I was there, 3000 years ago.
---
Isnt level cap 255? As it uses uint8_t to store the level?
---
I love how people in this thread are being downvoted for sharing what their experience was in Vanilla. Nice one guys.
---
Decent morals which you don't seem to possess at all. 
---
Sorry to be argumentative, but this is not true. I am not questioning whether this is like this on private servers, but it wasn't like that in vanilla. I played vanilla, i haven't played any private servers.
---
Once classic is released and you see the same dynamics of people playing as played vanilla,  not the misrepresentative microcosm that exists on private servers, you will see the truth of how important communication is, and how much of it actually occurred in vanilla.
---
The majority of people who played then, and probably who will play in classic, had not read hundreds of forum posts, blogs and guides and hadn't watched hundreds of hours of youtube videos on min/maxing and strategies for everything from dungeon runs, to maxing professions to the most mundane of things. People were even stumped by how to max First Aid.
---
We didn't have millions of addons and guides and thottbot and alakhazam were not a patch on wowhead. Our hands were free.
---
Ye, 255 is a cap. 
---
ubrs/lbrs wasnt called DS for drakkisath or WT for wyrmtalak
---
stratholme living/undead wasnt called BN for balnazzar or RD for rivendare
---
dm east wasnt called AL for alzzin, neither was west called THD for torheldrin nor north KG for king gordok
---
I see no issue with loot being trade able with master looter though? In that case it would be up to the master looter not to let anyone who doesn't need an item roll/bid on it. If he/she then gives it to a guildie, so what? It's not abuse, and would only solve issues where the master looter actually miss clicked.
---
I do agree wholeheartedly on group loot though. That shit would encourage abuse to a scale where it would be easier to whitelist the people who didn't abuse it than blacklist the people that do.
---
relying on capital letters in a gaming chat is even worse than vc :P
---
As far I can tell they don't ask for money to access their content. 
---
I don't understand what the negative effect of master looter loot being tradeable?
---
We will prolly turn off our phones during the wow summer. :P
---
People rolling for items to then sell them on to other people.
---
Was there too, also I am quite surprised that no private server actually implemented this or something similar for its "last day" before switching off the servers
---
I was there! On my gnome warlock. It was glorious!
---
Hi, /u/MyWaterDishIsEmpty
---
&gt; I see no issue with loot being trade able with master looter though?
---
I roll on an item to win it. I win and then whisper the other people who rolled to bid for the item.
---
Get a second screen, get your addons straight, quit your job. Fill your freezer with pizza, tell all your friends you are moving to mongolia in the summer, they should enjoy their time with you now,  get rid of your gf asap since she will probably stalking you for a couple more weeks.  Oh and a good overall advice:  cover your plates you eat from with cling film and dump the food on too to prevent using multiple plates. Use  only plastic spoons to eat otherwise u will risk cutting the film.
---
In a master looter situation it will be up to the master looter or group to make a decision on if a person really needs an item. If it is abused, it will be abuse of goodwill of people, and not abuse of a system. Sure, there will be rough situations, but I think they will be rare and far apart enough that server rep will sort it out. If it was in a guild raid, shit like this would get you kicked out of the guild.
---
I feel it is worth it to make sure I don't lose a T2 set piece because my master looter miss clicked 1 in 100 times.
---
LF DM for deadmines
---
LF DM E/W/N/trib if dire maul or multiple dire mauls. Problem solved
---
If you build it..... they will come. 
---
two whole pickles, only used once
---
I have a crazy idea, hear me out. Maybe just use the full name for these 2 dungeons and avoid mass confusion by pressing 6-7 more buttons on your keyboard once?
---
Need/Greed is a bad system compared to personal loot but the point of Classic isn't to make Vanilla but improved.
---
I’m afraid to continue this conversation, I’m gonna have to decline and wait for 150k£
---
I was going to say this as well. Warlocks are basically a magic hunter. 
---
Never heard Strath East or West. It's always been UD or Live/Living. That's over 4 servers, US, EU and PServer.
---
Yes, mage.
---
Shadowfang at least has pally and warlock quests.
---
Something I've noticed, the alliance in general on private servers don't hit up leveling dungeons like the horde do.  Possibly an overlooked consideration when choosing factions.  Like the favorite ally dungeons just from a seat of the pants feeling are deadmines, black fathom deeps and uldaman.  They avoid gnomeragen because it's aids and getting a group together for wailing caverns, shadowfang or either of the razorfen are like pulling teeth.
---
But then you look at horde side and it's like yeah let's grind the shit out of wailing caverns, shadowfang and sm.  I never have issues getting a group for the others.  
---
Hunter for sure. After that a Lock I would say 
---
The examples given are not possible in Vanilla but made possible with Loot Trading.
---
Yeah. Missed opportunity imo
---
Yes, but it is up to the group in this case to make a decision on if a person is entitled to roll on an item or not. It would not be possible to abuse it in the way that was described in the original post with the warrior/rogue needing, because no half-decent master looter would let a warrior/rogue roll on a robe either way.
---
In general though, in which situations are you afraid of this happening? Master looter is pretty much only used in guild runs, as well as some ZG/AQ20 pugs either way. If this shit happens in a guild run, it is time to start pounding that /gkick. Is ZG/AQ20 pugs really that large of an usecase?
---
It's important and there is nothing else to talk about.
---
There was actually one in 2006 when Vanilla who frappsed him gameplay in BC pre-patch : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_tE2dbmyYjs&amp;t=183s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tE2dbmyYjs&amp;t=183s)
---
11/10, there's literally people in this thread not understanding the point/joke you're making. Nice. 
---
&gt; It is sad because the practice would ago away if everyone just grew a set of balls and said "No, fuck you".
---
I think it's maybe a bit rude to advertise a reserved run? People (like you, I am guessing) who want that one thing will see people spamming "LFM for dungeon, that one thing you want is reserved" and feel sad and excluded. Because there's a dungeon run on the dungeon they want, with the one thing they want, and they feel like they're being snubbed.
---
But at the same time, it just makes sense to try to organise runs so everyone wants something different. There's no point five people who all want the same trinket going on a run when they could just split up and go with other groups that do not all want it.
---
My guess is the *most* butthurt people are rogue and hunter and DPS-warrior-who-won't-tank players who are thinking "But if the tank always reserves the thing I want, and then stops running that dungeon when they get it, I'll *never* get that thing and it's not fair! Someone should make the tank run that dungeon with me and give me a 50/50 shot at the loot!".
---
To which I say, get a guild or make friends or roll a tank. Nobody owes you their time to gear you up.
---
NA vs EU: Electric WoWaloo 2
---
Night elf hunter if you wanna as safe as possible when soloing dungeons
---
Wow thank you for this information. Very nice of you. I am copying this post and saving it for later. You wouldn't happen to know of getting pre raid BiS for rogues is difficult is it? Like getting the gear necessary to get invited to raids.
---
&gt;it wasn't like that in vanilla. I played vanilla, i haven't played any private servers.
---
No, it wasn't. But not because vanilla is a different game, requiring more communication, but because MMO's were new to the average player. Things have changed. I am not arguing that the original 2005-2008 experience was not different than retail one. I am saying it wasn't because of the game, it was because of the playerbase and the relative freshness of MMOs in general.
---
You have this stereotype about private server players, how they are these tryhard hardcore raiders. This is also not true (and since you haven't played on pservers I have a bit more credibility here).
---
Sure if you go raiding you are more likely to get hardcore players. But running low level dungeons? You get average players. Some don't even like vanilla that much just don't like paying for retail.
---
But the average joes do not really need much communication really.
---
Just look at the gameplay. Does vanilla have mechanics that require communication? Not really. Every dungeon requires the same skills. CC the marked mob, hit the one with the skull. Drink when low on mana. Maybe talk about when to blow innervate when playing druids or switch roles every-now-and-then, but even that is rare given the fact that there are less true hybrid classes in the game.
---
None of the bosses or trash mobs have remarkable tactics. They do have flavor but nothing game breaking. For example some mobs in ZF put down a healing totem. Do you need to destroy it to succeed? No, its a flavor, you can tank and dps down the mob through the healing.
---
In my experience you can get shitty players in private servers as well, but vanilla dungeons aren't so hard that you will wipe them nowadays. You did wipe when you didn't have the common knowledge we have now. This knowledge does not come from guides simply from the majority of the players having years worth of playtime in general. (Not necessary on the same game even)
---
&gt;I was there. And i still remember this event. Everyone tried to fight back, no one succeeded
---

---
I do have a question...
---
You know Blizzard employees are reading these forums, I mean, you have to believe that, otherwise posting "NO CHANGES!" is pointless. Right?
---
Doesn't it defeat the purpose to admit that you are posting in bad faith and that it's "simply a bludgeon used to keep Blizzard on track"? Don't you think they are going to read that too?
---
I'm not criticising you for posting in bad faith, that's an argument for another time, I'm just questioning your tactics. Doesn't it defeat the purpose of exaggerating your #nochanges  zeal to admit in public that you are doing it?
---
&gt; I am hoping for a transmog addon for vanilla
---
Addons can't do that. You might as well hope for an addon that lets you fly or doubles your health.
---
Another thing I thought about as well that very much helped add suspense to the dungeons themselves was how you had to get quests for this dungeon you wanted to run in many different places. It gave you this feeling that this place you're about to enter is known by many and all of these characters from different cities all talk about this mysterious place but are yet to get what they need from within it. Will you answer their call and take on this challenge? Venture into strange lands that they have only heard whispers about?
---
Looking back; as annoying as running to all of these places to get quests was it did make the dungeon seem like part of the world where a lot of different people knew about its existence. 
---
That’s not true though. That’s what people think when their knowledge is limited and they are being told to think something.
---
Enhancement has their places in raids, but more as a windfury/grace of air buff bot for melees + nightfall use. It is a big boost.
---
PvP might not be as ‘graceful’ as old PvP montages, and they can certainly be very RNG dependant, but their sudden hits *do* hurt, and it makes them scary. 31/20/0 — while leaning more towards elemental, is a rather fun and wacky build in PvP that takes enemies by surprise.
---
I have not seen a single post on this subreddit of somebody not wanting to play with retail players. 
---
Where is it you've been seeing people with this mindset? 
---
Unfortunately there's that opposite feeling when you just fall short. 
---
Which faction did you play on? On my server horde used the terms live and undead while alliance denoted it by east and west. 
---
IIRC shadowform applies it's damage reduction before armour so if a warrior hit you for 1000 it would minus 20% from shadowform to 800 then minus 25% off 800 from inner fire to 600.
---
Never heard anyone refering Deadmines as VC before I saw it in this thread.
---
Ah yes so we both watched the video then.
---
1 Repair bill = 1 Respect.
---
https://i.imgur.com/hj7xwTN.mp4
---
It was a video on YouTube where it was discussed. Hirumandex (?) Made some sort of Q&amp;A where he answers to comments regarding classic world of warcraft. And a comment was basically describing a very toxic core community. And I do have the feeling that I see plenty of them in the forums too.
---
So I went here to this subreddit, where I expect a more diversed playerbase, to ask you guys about my thoughts.
---
Yes
---
When leveling, everyone needs leveling gear.
---
Anyone having issue with tanks rolling on leveling 2Hs, or priests rolling on spell damage shit should not waste a group slot in a dungeon. DPS are a dime a dozen, the run can't happen without healers and tanks.
---
ur missing out on a once in a lifetime deal here buddy
---
The majority of people who play Classic will be extremely helpful and eager to share their love of Classic with you. Even this sub can be a toxic shit hole at times, so just remember that, yes, there will be 2% assholes, but 98% people will be playing for the community

anything that isn't seal of the crusader or seal of righteousness. get ready to put auto attack to good use, and find a good show with a lot of episodes
---
I think for a lot of people scheduling will be the deciding factor as it is a long time away. For example if I have enough time when it comes out - less working hours, no gf etc. and if release is the end of summer (because I'm not wasting the nice weather inside tbh) I would choose warrior then level a Warlock alt, if I don't have the time I would just main a rogue.
---
Also some people's friends might still be undecided so levelling grouped vs solo would affect the decision too.
---
It’s not gonna be an issue. Ppl will be busy with more important things. Like lvling fishing. Nice ppl are nice ppl and you want to hang with them. Noone will care if they play retail, private servers or even Pokémon Go
---
There are toxic parts of every community. There are people in the classic community who hate retail players, and there are players in the retail community who hate classic players.

Here's my question to you OP  
---
Which of these two characters is being played by a retail player:  
---
[This one](https://i.imgur.com/QKhtLzp.png)  
---
or  
---
[this one?](https://i.imgur.com/4ii4oJ0.png)  
---
It's VC, at least it was on Arthas.
---
Sounds like something said by people are that incapable of forging the connections necessary to get gear tbh.
---
ah I see I thought the dwarven fear ward also just gave immunity to the casting priest, but you can put it on any target. neat! thanks
---
&gt;lol @ full BiS - it's a DPS ceiling test you moron
---
And that's why it's useless for determining whether you should ever use a ret paladin in a raid before you have Naxx on farm.
---
&gt;lol @ spamming holy water - you're supposed to in Naxx
---
Holy water scales better for you than for a rogue or warrior - meaning that your pre-Naxx DPS is going to take more of a hit by not using it then theirs. I'm not necessary just talking about Naxx here, since you will always have to find a guild to get through the earlier tiers and even later on, you will still be doing AQ40.
---
&gt;lol @ Mightstone - again it's a DPS ceiling test moron
---
And as such it is completely worthless for determining how much a ret actually does in a raid.
---
&gt;lol @ cheating Wrath of Cenarius uptime - you do realize that it is supposed to proc off of everything right?
---
Why don't you just let if proc on its own then? Source on it proccing off SoR?
---
&gt;lol @ Rallying cry + Warchief's Blessing - take another look at Salad Bakers' buffs moron:
---
Using a tactic that requires coordinating with the horde in order to get mind controlled and have a turn in happen in time for your raid is surely so common... How convenient that this happens to you before literally every raid, especially considering that your character is entirely built around benefiting from haste.
---
&gt;lol @ spamming enchanted pummelers - every single Feral Druid does so while either in Cat or Bear form in their raids
---
Here's the big one - if a feral druid doesn't spam pummelers all the time, his DPS doesn't go completely down the shitter thanks to powershifted shred. However, your character gets almost all his DPS boosted by haste. This means that if you take away your pummeler, you're doing roughly 40% less DPS.
---
Even if you decided to be useless on trash and just spammed pummeler on bosses, a Naxx clear with an average 2 minute boss kill would require 20 pummelers. And even if you managed to do the Gnomeregan run before the instance reset limitation timer (12 minutes - I doubt that considering you can't stealth past mobs), getting 20 pummelers would take on average 6 hours and 36 minutes.
---
You wrote under your video that without the Mightstone, you're pushing 1500 DPS. That means that even if we ignore all my previous arguments, you will be spending almost 7 hours before each raid in order to do 84% of a fury warrior's DPS only in Naxx, only on bosses and only if you always bring all buffs and consumables (including Warchief's Blessing from mind control and an endless supply of holy water - add this to your pre-raid farming time).
---
Your argument is utterly useless as to determining how much DPS rets actually do in raids.
---
&gt; It was a video on YouTube where it was discussed. Hirumandex (?) Made some sort of Q&amp;A where he answers to comments regarding classic world of warcraft.
---
Who?
---
That rarely happened though. You were more prone to /who Westfall and whisper each person at an appropriate level than to go into SW for a player. 
---
Maybe one member went to Redridge to look there but at that level you're most likely out questing rather than hanging around a city. 
---
You assume most raids in vanilla were optimized
---
Yep pretty much like. It's like having a TBC server with Isle of Quel'Danas badge gear out from day 1. It wouldnt make sense.
---
Frankly, there will be people like that. Tribalism is a thing and when you've seen what the Ultras of soccer clubs can do to each other if not separated... yikes. 
---
Don't worry about it being the majority, though. Chances are, the majority of players at the start will be Retail players checking it out. 
---
Just gotta go out and find people you like. The playerbase will be diverse, so I'm sure you'll find plenty. 
---
Call it VC and you don’t need all of these disclaimers. Problem solvedz
---
Hi, /u/GivingItMyBest
---
Shadow Form is not armor. It just reduces the damage you take. If you get hit for 100 damage after armor, shadow form reduce that damage by 15.
---
Don't listen to the above commenter. Paladin and Warlock talents are actually much more expensive than the other classes to account for the lack of a purchasable mount at 40.
---
That's why most guides (and my own experience leveling three paladins on private servers) recommend the following:
---
Don't waste gold while leveling on:
---
* Seal of the Crusader
---
* Exorcism
---
* Divine Protection ranks
---
* Redemption ranks
---
* Turn Undead
---
* Hammer of Justice ranks
---
* Lay on Hands ranks
---
* Seal of Justice
---
* Holy Wrath
---
* Divine Shield
---
* Blessing of Sacrifice
---
First one.
---
I’m from 2002 and can’t wait for the release.
---
The actual community of tryhards and know it all's like me, honestly don't mind beginners AT ALL. Like it's classic wow, I do NOT expect you to have played private servers for 4 years, or have been a hardcore player back 14 years ago.
---
I have no expectation of that at all. Obviously, I don't want bad players in my guild, but you can learn classic really quickly, and well just because you aren't in my guild, doesn't mean I don't wanna do dungeons, group quests or even pugs with you. You are more than welcome trust me, and the players like you, far far outnumber the players like me.
---
Both. Who the fuck plays a night elf
---
I’ve always played on EU and always used to call it VC...having said that, no one ever had a clue what I was talking about lmao
---
Let's make it clear once and for all:
---
EU players say DM as it's the abbreviation for the instance. This is how the rest of the game is played. 
---
NA player say VC as it's the abbreviation for the last boss of the instance. This is based on something something you get a quest for him, unlike all the other dungeons where you get a quest for the end boss...
---
The standard for dungeons is to use the abbreviation for the instance and not the end boss. If someone says "LFM VC" just bless his heart as he can't spell Wailing Caverns right. 
---
Maybe warrior. It's a pain in the arse but I like warriors and I'm going casual, enjoying the ride. It's also great when you get a nice weapon upgrade.
---
OP. I've played WoW since vanilla only missing MoP and BFA. I will play with you friend. 
---
I had an addon that did this in BC called 'DrDamage'. See it in use here: https://i.imgur.com/4hTEHWj.jpg
---
It had really good stats when you mouseover like crit%, spell damage, spell coefficients, effective cost, casts till oom, etc. It calculates it all on the fly too so it takes into account buffs/debuffs/talents
---
Don't know if I got his name right. He does plenty much about world of warcraft.
---
yes, but change to succubus when anchoring
---
I started playing wow when it first came out, all the way up to Wotlk, never heard it called VC, and I'm American.
---
When there was the event in MoP you could go to Deadmines and kill Van Cleef. That run was called VC.
---
Yeah never heard of him.
---
World Chat tho
---
&gt;Without legitimate reasons to be out in the world except artificial rng grinds
---
"artificial rng grinds"? Is that world quests? You also got to be out in the world to gather herbs, ore, meat, cloth, whatever. Or to get to instances. I honestly don't see how it's different from vanilla except that you spend more time out in the world due to world quests? And that you have way more flight masters and convenient teleports and stuff to get around with. 
---
It's also to promote wPvP which except for some flaws in player psychology has really flourished this expansion. 
---
No idea why are those people downvoting you. Those skills mentioned are completely useless while leveling, so I would dodge them even if I didnt have to. And having gold isnt great just for the gear, you can also use it to get even more gold. Early on, expensive mats will be cheap, so feel free to stockpile. Elemental fires, essence of water, powerful of frozen/shadow wrath items etc. 
---
you're fine as long as you're not one of those dual wielding clowns.
---
Why is everyone so complicated aboiut this? just change the trading possiblity to ONLY EPIC so greens and blues can never be traded. end of story
---
swap frostbolt to fireball &amp; profit?
---
Mage and hunter
---
If I go alliance, is Westfall a must? I’ve never leveled in the other zones because I feel like it’d be inefficient compared to running Westfall and getting all the Deadmines quests/chains/rewards/etc. I’d like to experience a different area. 
---
I plan on running the mines once or twice for the fun time plus maybe a drop or two, but I don’t want to level in Westfall primarily, (thus I’ll miss all the related quests and stuff??) am I going to hamstring myself?
---
Any class. Just pick the class you feel! best for you. Listen to your feelings not other players thoughts. Every player is different...
---
nah gotta scorch and lip, pyro to drop ignite stuff like that plus more moving around in aq
---
I personally feel you should be relying on your friends list and guild members to lay down the foundation for your groups.  There will also be addons and Discords for people who want an extra edge for group finding but that's up to the community to decide upon, not for Blizzard to implement.  Blowing on your megaphone to the whole world feels more cheap Korean MMO than an immersive RPG to me.
---
That was epic. I remember when some of the high-lvl players got rekt and everyone lost hope, it was a true apocalypse. 
---
Very well written. Couldn't agree with you more!
---
Itemization in classic is very straightforward yeah and I like that too, but simulations aren't just about minmaxing. It's just fun to play around with it from time to time without wanting to minmax.
---
4.20g profit per hour eyyyy
---
I played on US Kirin Tor (RP) in Vanilla, strictly Alliance, from 2004 onward.
---
I seem to remember something like LFG DM-VC or something to that effect being not-uncommon in tradechat. It used both, but I don't quite remember in what fashion it used them since it has been so long. But I definitely remember VC being a common abbreviation for Deadmines, as seeing it in here rang a very strong bell with me.
---
Dead mines was DM, dire maul was DiM
---
Can confirm this. I played wow on the America servers the first months of the games release, everyone called it VC there. When I then started playing on the EU servers, it was DM. 
---
It probably shouldn't though!
---
Mage is a great class for pvp whether it be world or pvp. I wouldn’t worry too much about t1 set pieces and bg pvp at the same time considering the fact you probably want fire spec for pvp but arcane frost hybrid for MC, BWL. I say prioritise raid prog until aq40 and beyond then jump into serious pvp if you’re still down. 
---
Have you thought about Shaman? They're pretty "in your face" and you won't have a problem getting an MC PUG spot as resto.
---
There are 55K people subbed here. You can't address them as one "community". They are *very* different.
---
Find people you'd want to play with and ignore the idiots. It works like that everywhere.
---
If you look at the instance abbreviation in the atlas addon it calls deadmines  VC, I always figured that's where it started, it never really bothered me which way people referred to it . 
---
By looking in Westfall you mean spamming trade chat right?
---
You won’t be called out for playing retail, but if you constantly fuck up you might get called a retailscrub or something similar. It’s a term of endearment, similar to how the people that started in wrath are Wrathbabbies.
---
RGBs?
---
Now I NEED this! 
---
Non native English speaker here. Can anybody explain me the meaning of “not soon tm”? Please! Thanks 
---
But then in pvp I would also heal, no? Seeing as the T1 set seems entirely focused on healing.
---
Darkshore has the benefit of not having to grind in between quests until at least level 18. It's less populated than Westfall as well.
---
He's got a good collection of Lore videos, some really cool stuff about the old gods and such.  Definitely some things a Classic fan could learn about.
---
They did it during the stress test/open beta.
---
The massacre was even worse
---
Thanks for your reply. I'm not sure raid prog until aq40 would really suit my casual playstyle :/
---
I think hunters your best bet. Mage is very gear dependent!
---
DM for deadmines and dire maul quickly devolves into tribute run and then everything else 
---
darkshore is better imo
---
DM = DeadMines. VC makes 0 sense and is ridiculous! Do people who defend that crap call MC "Rag" or BWL "Nef"?
---
DM = Deadmines
---
DM East/West/North = Dire Maul
---
Doh! I forgot about that.
---
Western plagelands, where dreams go to die. Can't wait.
---
I played on a US server during vanilla. Can confirm, no one called Deadmines VC.
---
That was the vanilla stat spread I just linked. The one shown in the video is the 3.9k armor version, from TBC.
---
Thank you Jesus
---
dual wielding while leveling is probably even worse than being prot specced.
---
For Horde 100% it's VC since we never ran it, but we did run DM
---
ho ho ho vailing caverns
---
I disagree about Exorcism, I always get it at 20 then grind the hell out of ghouls &amp; skellies in duskwood.
---
&gt;In a master looter situation it will be up to the master looter or group to make a decision on if a person really needs an item.
---
You are assuming everyone will show up to the raid  wearing their best item pieces for every slot. Someone intending to take advantage of the loot trading system obviously wont ever do that.
---
Would horde really run DM? I don't think "a hike" describes the path to get there.
---
I was never good at world pvp, but leveling in stranglegank with my first toon ever was one of my most memorable experiences. Booty Bay is amazing. 
---
The Venture Co areas are so cool too. 
---
Probably! Seems like the best choice, once again. Also looking into rogue...
---
I'm quite sure it's multiplicative and not additive. Which means. If you have 25% armor reduction you and tak let's say 100 dmg. It would get you down to 75 first and the 15% would reduce it further to 63.75 dmg. And not 60 like it would if it was additive. 
---
We called it "VC" pre-Dire Maul though.
---
If we call it that blizzard will eventually remove 8% of diremaul after a record high number of players finish the instance.
---
Mage is like the least gear dependent class in the game
---
It's generally considered good practice to have everything keybound not just abilities. Hotkeying items/gear, profession items/crafts, first aid etc. will quickly fill up your remaining hotkeys.
---
Obviously don't take it to such an extreme that you're hotkeying your Flask of the Titans... but yeah. You might be surprised to see how many keybindings some players really have.
---
It’s too bad these types of events aren’t more common. 
---
I'm almost certain this is based on location.
---
US seems to call it VC whereas EU prefer DM (because it's really easy to see that a lvl18 isn't looking for a Dire Maul group)
---
Needing on BoE items to make them souldbound would be a terrible idea to be honest.
---
Let's say Edgemasters's Handguards drop in a dungeon. Those are worth 1500 gold. Because they are tradable, the value on those gloves would be the same for every member in the group. Let's say you can farm roughly 50gold/hour on average. That means the gloves are worth 30 hours of playtime.
---
Does it seem fair to you that only the warrior tank get to roll on them (and thus SAVE 30 HOURS of playtime), while the rest of the party basically get cheated out of that gold which they could have used on crafting bloodvine set, devilsaur set, getting enchants or epicmount or whatever else they need?
---
Of course this is not fair.
---
It's all situational. While on paper warlocks should be able to beat anyone at high levels of gear, you have to add a human factor. You also have to consider gear choices by both players. For instance, having a shadow reflector to reflect death coil could cause the warlock to lose a fight. If a rogue manages to catch a warlock unaware, you could potentially stunlock them before they can sac, heal, ect if they aren't using a pvp trinket. 
---
There's always outplay possible in pvp, but being a warlock just reduces the likelihood of it happening to you.
---
I beg to differ in pvp hah
---
people do call it vc, but they're wrong, it's called dm
---
dire maul is dm _____
---
How so? 
---
Pretty sure that’s right 
---
SP and hit % are huge for dealing damage. You can argue that every class is gear dependent in that regard, but I’ve never seen a naked mage excel at pvp
---
Yes, because I'm totally going to pass a 4000 gold Teebu's Blazing Longsword to some random Night Elf Male rogue that is not in my guild.
---
BoE items have the exact same value to every member of the group, which is why you always press Need. Equipping the BoE item only means you saved the amount of time it would take you to farm the gold matching the items value, and it makes no sense that only one or two players in a group get to have priority on saving time farming.
---
Then any other warrior dpsing in your group is going to hate your fucking guts
---
Me too, when I started WoW in 2006 I was already older than many posting in this thread now, it sure is depressing.
---
As a Canadian always playing on US servers, I had only seen it referred to as VC during vanilla.
---
&gt;Milky mamaaa
---
#Thicc
---
The DPS are there to get items to help them dps, that 2h sword is not helping the tank hold more aggro nor is that spell damage hood keeping the healer from going oom.  Roll your fucking role or gtfo
---
Even with shadowform at 40, is smite, holy fire and wand still better for leveling? Or it doesn’t matter because I’ll just be wanting everything to death 
---
How to get kicked from your group 101
---
&gt;The community would figure out a way to deal with it and the community will move on.
---
This is just some naive logic. What will happen is that the "community" realizes that loot trading give a large enough advantage that you should always use it, which eventually leave to everyone who dont agree with it leaving the game. Thinking that the community will someone fix this issue themselves to the point where loot trading wont get abused is nothing short of a fantasy.
---
&gt;Holy fuck why is everyone so goddamn paranoid about this incredibly small change?
---
Because most of us arent gullible idiots.
---
Yeah I hope you would realize that hunters are a range class with melee abilities. Also thunderfury isn’t the best dps sword in game. Seems your knowledge of classic does not support your condescending tone. 
---
You're god damn right it was.
---
Deadmines was "           " because I literally had no idea it existed for over a year because I was horde.
---
That's like 1-2 hours of farming.
---
Try to read my post before you reply.
---
I was there, best fun i ever had while dying. :)
---
I dont play retail any more, i quit when they confirmed classic was coming. Trying to play retail when i knew classic would be coming seemed wrong somehow, lol.
---
Great information! Appreciate it
---
Or a char
---
For Shaman you can go 30/0/21, it turns you into a very bursty caster, you can also kite melee around with frost shock, or go enhancement if you want to respec for pvp/raids
---
Silvermoon EU - never ever heard "VC", Deadmines = DM
---
Dire Maul always in form of DM-East etc
---
OP 100% correct
---
Hey Alleria brother!
---
They won't.
---
&gt;If you have 100 spell power and find an item that grants 10 more that's a 10 per cent increase but if you already 200 spell it's only a 5% increase.
---
Cant think of it this way. You gotta see it in terms of how much it increases your true DPS. Not in percentage over the previous value.
---
Deadmines is only a a short swim from Grom'gol and Grom'gol is only a zeppelin ride away from Orgrimmar.
---
I saw it called VC 98% of the time.
---
Oh, I'm the condescending one.
---
As serious as Jim Carrey! 
---
Sorry, it was my intention to respond to OP and not your comment. My bad. You are 100% on point. 
---
there isnt that much outside of group content thats solo content.  dunno what it is youre trying to do
---
It was VC. No argument. 
---
DEADMINES IS DM, ANYTHING ELSE IS HERESY
---
Talents alone take care of hot problems in pvp.
---
‘Of the eagle’ greens are all a mage needs to get the job done. Can AOE farm some gold and buy the needed pieces from the AH.
---
Baron was a different run than just dead. Maybe that's why your confused. I do specifically remembering seeing live, dead, way more often than Baron.
---
Same
---
Glorious
---
No one that is looking for DM that is lvl 20 is doing Dire Maul. 
---
Fuck VC
---
It's also called STVietnam because it's a jungle zone. It's the hottest PvP leveling zone in the game and it's literally a jungle. 
---
Bonechewer US Alliance, Dragonmaw EU Horde. Can't name the PServers cos I'll get permabanned xD but not the most popular one
---
If I wanted to run all wings I'd still call it "DM full run" rather than just "DM" - SM already works the same way
---
Good shit
---
Hunter will probably be the best bang for your buck if you are pugging in PvP.
---
I can hope :)
---
16 fucking months?  Someone should murder these cock suckers for holding an ALREADY MADE GAME for this long
---
I'm 25 and never played vanilla, I started in TBC so i'm def excited to play classic in the summer!
---
Respec my authoritaaaiiii
---
Jay the bard has a great song for Classic. [Song Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60GseT2aGQg)
---
It's VC or you are a scrub.
---
10/10
---
I remember hearing VC way back when on NA. But I never understood why they called it that until it was explained to me and even then I thought that was goofy lol.
---
This is amazing. Thank you!
---
As an American always playing on US servers, I had only seen it referred to as VC in Burning Crusade twice. Of which I properly cussed the guy out.
---
yeah I'm excited for Classic too.  
---
Yup. If you want to look epic you gotta earn it.
---
Leveling dungeon groups will take literally anyone at any point anyways as long as you fit into the required dps/healer/3dps as long as there are not too many loot conflictions.  Sure you might blacklist that hunter that seems to be melee-only but it isnt worth the time to kick him 99% of the time.  I cant say in any game I have ever played have I asked people in the group what spec they are because while leveling it doesn't really matter besides measuring your ego. 
---
Raids probably won't care unless it is a specific talent that you are brought for (aka shadow priest better have shadoweaving).  The raids that do care will be top tier hardcore (ala private servers and some others) and will be in the minority by far.  The majority of guild leaders/officers have enough problems keeping a 40 man raid functioning without micromanaging who is what spec.  Lets be honest, if you played vanilla there are chances that for at least a week here or there you went a PvP spec without bothering to go back to your normal raid spec despite still being in the same raids, unless your raid spec was already pvp viable or it was really obvious (aka MT cant go MS arms without people noticing I think).
---
For me deadmines was always DM. Then dire maul came out and deadmines became DMVC. 
---

One of the best rogues vs one of the best warlocks
---
both have builds made to counter eachother
---
Sick duels
---
I think this might be one of the very few private server player posts that doesn't think the private server hivemind is going to dominate classic and make it a clone.  I agree with you.
---
Looks really amazing!
---
What I would change / add:
---
1. As someone already mentioned, alternative BiS would be very useful in some cases. 
---
2. I would add an option for Stage 1 / pre-raid BiS (doesn't make too much sense for the other stages) to compile a list. That list would show where to get the item (maybe with a link for further info) and be **sorted by the level you can get it**. So average level that a dungeon is done or level required to accept and do a quest. 
---
Just spend an extra 0.5 second typing the full word?
---
For what it's worth OP, if you're on my server, I'll tank for you.  
---
I'll help anyone who wants or needs it, and isn't too prideful to ask for it.  
---
DM dead mines simple. VC is not a dungeon. Imagine having to lfg NTS or lfg H. Makes no sense. Like with Maura and with scarlet monetary you state the wing after the name. DM North DM Full clear  etc.
---
I'm 32 and am so pumped for this
---
Are you American? I played on EU and never saw people call it "VC".
---
Much like I think NA realms say "PST" for "please send tell" instead of EU's "/w me" or similar
---
I cant fucking wait
---
Shit I remember groups of 20+ running dead mines as well. 
---
Back in the days there were no group limits on regular instances..
---
The video of videos
---
That shit isn’t going to happen don’t worry
---
SFK, Mara, UBRS, DM W?
---
Soloing dungeons? Lmfao

Probably you'll downvote me to hell but I don't see this becoming reality. Sorry to destroy your dreams.
---
This is the same monitor I used back in Vanilla. Good times.
---
I hope they don’t tbh.
---
"Factual from my personal experience" is also called anecdotal evidence, and, as you should kno, anecdotal evidence isn't real evidence. That's why it's wrong for you to claim "everyone in vanilla always called it VC, anyone using DM instead was a total noob". If you look through this thread, you'll see that there are tons of other people claiming that DM was always Deadmines.
---
Maybe next time, try and not speak in ultimates if all you have is anecdotal evidence. You could, for example, add a simple "on my server back then" and then you don't seem like an arrogant ass.
---
I’ve always done darkshore, then westfall. Works out really well 
---
Deadmines was always called DM until a new waves of noobs who never ran Deadmines started calling Dire Maul DM.
---
Yeah, I was being facetious 
---
Affliction/Demo Warlock: can solo easily with Voidwalker and fears
---
Beastmaster Hunter: can solo easily with pet. I think you can also send in your pet and then have it get aggro and then make your pet kite then as you solo a quest mob or grab an item they are guarding.
---
Frost Mage: particularly effective if you want to aoe farm mobs.
---
Ret Paladin: can solo a lot of mobs others would die from because you can stun and heal, lay on hands (which is like a 2nd life), and worst comes to worst you can bubble and run/hearth away.
---
Feral druid: very hearty, less likely to die with bear form, you have many heals, and you can also go caster form and kill any mob slowly but surely (assuming they are outdoors) with entangling roots. Also you can decide if you want to sneak up in cat form for the ambush bonus or you can pull in caster form with starfire and Moonfire and then shift when they get to you.
---
Not as good but doable: Holy/Disc Priest or Resto Shaman. You will be super slow to kill enemies, but you can solo elites because of your excellent healing, also crit heals increase your armor with talents. For Holy/Disc Priest you just use SW:P and wand and heal when needed. If your spirit is high enough your mana will regenerate enough by the time you need a heal that you can solo effectively. Also you can solo some elite groups with Holy Noval alone. For resto shaman you have stoneclaw totem, and mana spring totem and searing totem and autoattack with flametongue weapon (1hander and shield) and heal when necessary same thing. 
---
Rogue. I know they have survivability with blind and evasion and kicks. Also they can sneak around enemy camps, which is convenient. You can sneak around dungeons and even complete some quest objectives without a group which is nice.
---
Warrior...I had a hard time soloing with warrior the most because I hate how they don't have a heal. If you maybe were an herb/alchemy warrior that might be better because you have flasks and potions to increase your survivability.
---
As for races, honestly each one can work. They each have their own benefit in one way shape or form I think it is better for personal preference. 
---
"abused" LUL.
---
You really think the poor helpless GMs were being forced by players to do stuff that they weren't supposed to do? You got to be joking me.
---
Bop loot wasn't final in vanilla, it's a fact.

Back in the day, level ?? mobs were assumed to be level 500, since even on private servers when you set your level up to 255, these mobs still appeared to be level ??. Wasn't until later that we discovered "level ??" really just means "your level + 3".
---
Rip off of EQ sleeper. 
---
*braces for downvotes*
---
Are there items like this for all of the leather / tailoring items? I can imagine that there'll be a dearth of supply as the release wave goes through the different levels.
---
Soon tm is a joke on how the word "soon" for blizzard takes forever, to the point they trademark it because they use the word differently than everyone else.
---
Haha okay now I get it!! Thank you very much! 
---
ahaha i always thought pst was the sound you made to get someones attention, "psssssssssst"
---
American checking in, rarely saw it called VC, and when it was called that it always had to be asked by several people in chat what that person was talking about. 
---
Yup, thanks for agreeing - one of the things that made vanilla rough was that warrior tanks felt self-entitled and more important than everyone else. Shitty team attitude, but yeah they can get away with it alright!
---
Honestly the whole subject is fabricated to feed the trolls, there is nothing to discuss.
---
You just Shift+Click on the person's name in the chat and see their level/zone they're in. That will give all the answers you're looking for. 
---
Oh and btw if you tp decided to join the group ignoring the aforesaid AND despite not specified wing you're obligated to boost the plebs through DM :D

A real Rousseau here.

---
I never ran into this problem in vanilla. Most of the time, players mentioned the wing they were doing, like "DM West" or "Tribute Run." Rarely saw people recruiting for Deadmines outside of Westfall. 
---
I might be remembering wrong but on Archimonde server we called it VC. 
---
Lol
---
Alliance ran sfk, wc, and SM all the time and VC was a lot more accessible to the horde than sfk or SM was to the alliance
---
30/0/21 is the only good spec for shaman in pvp. you can heal in bgs with this spec, but other classes are better at it. still its awesome to have that option  and its crucial to use it when necessary. howevere they are ultimate tanky burst machine. (also dont listen to people claiming they only start being good with aq40 gear, thats utter bullshit)
---
overall a tier s pvp spec due to immense cc and burst potential, topped off by good healing capabilities and tankiness.
---
respec deep resto once a week for progression raiding and you will have the easiest time of any class finding a raidspot and also not have any competition on mail/leather caster gear. (despite your other shaman bros and the druid)
---
Standard corporate legal coverage when restructuring, doesn't really mean anything.
---
I would not worry about a bunch of \~30 year old oldschool players creating a conspiracy to exclude new players.
---
They just want a slice of nostalgia just like everyone else, and playing with new players is actually part of that nostalgia feeling.
---
How would I even manage to exclude people, a copy of someones ID for age verification and a pop quiz about vanilla before every group invite ? :)
---
On the topic of toxicity, with pretty much every online game I ever played its almost the same story.
---
Early WoW Vanilla, CS 1.5/1.6, Unreal Tournament, Red Faction if anyone remembers that, etc. the community was on average polite and helpfull.
---
Im talking about the competetive to atleast serious playerbase, not claiming a few immature players on public servers didnt exist.
---
But generally speaking, the older a game gets, the more toxic the community gets.
---
Classic is a rare mix between a really old and a new game, so I would probably guess the community at the beginning will be something in between too.
---
The mentality of the average gamer changed by a big margin though.
---
I dont think we will see many players who are happy with modern lootbox, season pass, dlc... infested games where you get a dopamine trigger every few seconds, to play until level 60.
---
Call me biased, but no way in hell will the average vanilla player from back in the day be the one ruining the gaming experience compared to the average csgo player you encounter in matchmaking nowadays.
---
It was VC 100% of the time since I started playing in 2005 on NA smolderthorn.
---
I thought it was a "Vailing Caverns" run when I first saw it =\
---
No way it was always UD and Live/Living
---
try it with 7.58 fps and good :P
---
*chuckles in horde*
---
Who plays fire mage for pvp at low gear levels?
---
I dont give a shit if and why I got downvoted.
---
Questing in Vanilla is the same exact thing. Doesnt matter if they have their pink-tainted glasses on, its still the same shit you do over and over again. Its the circle-jerk squad that says "QueStinG iS thE GamE", lol.
---
Gotta go fast

Nice meme but too many syllables sandwiched into those verses. I’d cut out some extra words so it fits the meter without having to speed up the speaking rate.
---
People were calling it VC before Dire Maul was even in the game. I'm pretty sure it was because people were looking to complete the quest. Also, being the first alliance dungeon, there wasn't an established understanding that you refer to the name of the dungeon when forming a group. 
---
Your name sounds familiar, I think I heard your interview
---
Bingo! :3
---
Nostalrius had a pretty damn memorable final day.
---
Yeah I don't think a lot of private server players realise "world chat" and "global chat" wasn't a thing.
---
Lmao how? People wanted to go to the deadlines and kill VanCleef. There wasn't a convention for dungeon naming or abbreviation at the time so people logically started saying "VC" since he was the last boss. It's sad you guys get so worked up and can't seem to understand it was called VC from literally day one on a ton of the biggest US servers. And on the other hand a few people called it DM on their servers, especially EU. Not hard to understand.
---
If they didn't want competition they could tank their own run. 
---
Hey, can you expand on how gaming cultures are different around the world in your experience?  I think this is really interesting. 
---
I stop spending my hard earned cash on live two years ago. PTR is where it is at. WoW is the same old thing: gear after gear, raids, pvp, quests etc. I'm not a video game nerd.
---
When I started the game (I was 13 at the time) I thought that you were MEANT to be carried through dungeons because that is what happened the first time I was in one. I asked in /1 for help and some lvl 60 did.
---
So I would pester lvl 60s for runs bc I wanted the hawt leather for  and I always said DM.
---
I do remember one guy ranting about dire maul once in about 100 whispers. 
---
Most people called it DM and elietists called it VC. I will happily fight in a war over this.
---
 One bubble of rested [XP](https://wow.gamepedia.com/XP) (5% of your current level) is earned for every 8 hours spent resting in an inn or city, or for every 32 hours spent logged off in another location. A maximum of 30 bubbles (150% of your current level) may be earned.  So 10 days IRL time for 1.5 levels worth of rested xp. It's probably worth to switch every now and then (especially at higher levels) if maximising efficiency if your goal, but don't go out of your leveling route to do so.
---
I played on multiple vanilla servers and it was always VC. 
---
Procure large amounts of some kind of amphetamine and favorite snackums. 
---
Clear your schedule. 
---
Profit. 
---
You are not alone
---
Too squishy. Sm/ruin I’ve had better experience with. 
---
Hunter/Warlock/Druid/Paladin in that order pretty much
---
did you experience gearscore? no one i know who has thinks it was anywhere close to just 'inspecting' someone
---
Why?
---
"grandpa, can i borrow your old pc over the summer?"
---
It's pretty much the exact opposite, all the +hit you need for pvp comes from talents and frost is about control and setting up shatters. Frost pvp is one of the least gear dependent specs in vanilla WoW.
---
"final solution" probably isn't the best phrase to use
---
Not true. There was a global Lookingforgroup chat at one point. Plus trade chat is a thing. 
---
It goes in corporate memos/quarterly announcements every time to legally cover your ass. Same reason when a company ipo’s the language they use is along the lines of “we may never be profitable”.
---
Every public company does this 
---
As for healing sets? Not really.
---
There is however the corehound belt and the cloak called hide of the wild, that when in the game, is the best you can use. Rest of your gear is gonna be dungeon gear or straight up +healing greens
---
I’d like to see hunter ranged and see how close/far from melee it is
---
Thank you please keep this up
---
Oh Lord, that's pretty boomer cringe. 
---
&gt; I'm not a video game nerd.
---
I play LOTRO on legendary server now. And maybe will hop into the last Travian server, when that path to pandora starts.
---
I played horde originally and Dire Maul was always referred to as DM, sometimes you’d specify the wing but most of the time we’d run all three since it was a bitch to get there. 
---
I switched to alliance and was so confused as to what VC was, because it was an Alliance-ism, at least on my server. 
---
SM you have quests, don't instantly outlevel your loot, and there's no analogous instance available if you're upper 30s.
---
My kids were all 3 born after 2004 and they're going to get to try the game a little, may even make them their own accounts if their grades stay up.
---
Autotune level: max. Enjoyed it anyway ;) 
---
if they don't change how pathing works from vanilla, or pservers for the that matter (mainly with ledges) then you can solo a very wide variety of dungeons as a hunter
---
It took me a long time to choose druid, but I've always enjoyed it post classic and never got to fully experience it in classic. So I'm biting the bullet and going druid. Seems like leveling won't be so bad and pvp is great, figuring I'll end up off tanking in raids and healing when needed
---
Oh I’m aware. I play with many people who Keuning everything. I’ve tried to play that way and find it unhelpful. As you suggest, things like flasks, food, my Hearthstone, etc. I’m ok clicking. The things I want hotkeyed are the things I use in combat. To each his own though obviously.
---
Pre-Raid isn't overall terrible to get, since some comes from quests and the rest comes from dungeons which you can run as much as you want, you're only blocked by the instance cap which you'll probably never hit because Classic dungeons take so darn long anyway. The hardest part will be getting your pre-raid BiS weapons, especially as Sword spec, the Dal'Rend set. They drop from a 10 man dungeon (UBRS) and are super low chance drops, especially the MH iirc. Sword Rogues want 'em, DW Fury Warriors want 'em, Hunters want 'em, all as pre-raid BiS (Though, Hunters have the option of a 2H from Dire Maul if it's there on release that's nearly as good, so hopefully a lot of them will opt for that instead!)  
---
The good news is though, is that you'll more than likely be well geared enough to venture into at LEAST MC or Ony well before you get your full pre-raid list, so long as you pick up appropriate gear for the BiS pieces you're missing. Heck, some of the original classic MC runs had raiders who weren't even level 60 yet, purely to fill up the 40 man roster! It wasn't common, but it happened.
---
There is a meme for this. The one that shows all different kinds of races skulls are the same until the last one which is a skull of a Neanderthal, and some text that says “people who called deadmines VC”. 
---
A lot of healing spells are down ranked for Mana efficiency
---
Soon (not tm)
---
Cam gets stuck on silly things and moving in and out when you run in tight spaces like wsg tunnel making click targeting and aoe/grenade targeting painful.
---
Yes, they are.
---
This video was amazing.  Ya'll are some of my favorite content creators. Love your interviews on countdown to classic. 
---
Tauren shaman for life!
---
I think for casual everything, druid is still strong at dungeons, pvp, and pve. Plus you can play any specific in pvp, not pve, where balance is not as good as offtank or healing. Druids are the best flag carriers and the gearing part is fun since they take bits and pieces from all over. Like a level 29 mace from gnomeregan is the best feral weapon in the game for druid. Get weird try druid!
---
/console gxvsync 1
---
The solution seems simple to me.. If Blizzard doesn't want to spend resources on GMs moving loot around that was accidentally handed to the wrong player in raid environments then change policy and say that GMs will no longer move loot.
---
If you accidentally give someone the wrong item or give it to the wrong person in the raid then too bad. Accept responsibility as being a butterfingers and don't let it happen again.
---
The few raid leaders/loot masters who are put off from this will be far less than the absolute rampant toxicity that will exist if loot trading stays. It completely changes the meta 
---
Or just be part of the superior faction and not have this issue
---
I wonder if it varied by realm? I almost exclusively saw it referred to as VC. And I had a bunch of characters in Westfall lol.
---
As long as we can all agree that WC does not stand for wood cutting we’re good.
---
This is ironic. 
---
Most good stuff is boe, I would suggest go skinning and herbalism and just have someone craft you the gear and potions you'll need for raiding
---
&gt; The things I want hotkeyed are the things I use in combat
---
Precisely! There are quite a few things though in Classic that you'll use during combat which fall outside of your class' innate abilities. Those are the things I am referring to.
---
Things like Goblin Sapper Charges, Furbolg Medicine Pouch, Free Action Potion or Healthstone to name a few. They're used somewhat infrequently, but clicking them is strictly speaking disadvantageous.
---
I agree 100% about hotkeying stuff like hearthstone. Seems a total waste of a button that could be used for something else.
---
You can’t blame them for being bad at trolling. They are not very smart and I’m just proud that this mouth breather can form complete sentences. 
---
Complete opposite experience for me. It was VC since day 1, (accnt creation nov 2004, large NA PvP server). Then played on Nost in like 2015 and was super confused by the people calling it DM instead of VC. I thought I was in a world chat. Nost was pretty heavily EU/Asian populated right? Were you horde by chance? And then played alliance on the private server?
---
It feels like OG alliance (from ~2004, super early 05) refer to it as VC, and people that came a little later, or rolled horde, called it DM.
---
Did you find that at a thrift store? Or kept it safe this whole time?
---
its never coming
---
I’m sure that’s possible. I server hopped a few times during Vanilla/BC, but only saw called VC on rare occasions.
---
Were you from one of the original launch servers? Or did you start playing later on maybe? Also were you horde? I'm thinking the biggest difference is OG alliance called it VC, whereas people who started a bit later and the horde probably referred to it as DM. /Shrug
---
Interesting. Either way with level context everyone should be able to figure it out. Lol
---
Shadowform is pretty great, the extra damage makes a huge difference and will always be quicker than using holy spells. 
---
From 40 your standard single mob grinding rotation will be PW:S -&gt; MB -&gt; SW:P -&gt; MF -&gt; Wand to death. In the later levels or against mobs with higher HP you may have to chuck in an extra MF. 
---
I heard shadow priests was the best 1v1 class in vanilla. I would love to play SP but I’m gonna go healing instead. SPs are really fun to play, pretty damn dominating. And it’s always fun to Mind Control players off cliffs or DoT them up, MC and watch as their health ticks down while they can’t do anything about it.
---
In case you are wondering, PST came from Everquest. In order to communicate you typed /tell “name”. People who played EQ brought it over to WoW in Vanilla and it kinda stuck.
---
I'm like somewhere in the half... have been like this for 10 years now
---
Exactly; no level 19 ever ended up in a Dire Maul group 
---
Thank you for those recommendations!
---
at least while leveling. You can shift in your mid-50s, and, while sitting at the city and crafting, you'll be accumulating blue XP, that matters at such levels.
---
Night Elf Druid.
---
There is **a lot** of running though as the zone is very long. And the closest city is Darnassus which has an awful layout with the only mailbox being near the bank.
---
Whats the programming reason behind using an unsigned 8 bit integer for this? Why not use a regular int. Or a float. Or a double. There might be a reason at some point you want to have a level higher than 255. Maybe not 2147483647.
---
As an American who role played a Canadian on US servers, I can confirm seeing it being called both VC and DM.
---
Skills &gt; Speccs
---
Fake CRT it doesn't have the lines from the refresh rate and shutter speed mismatch
---
Old game is running on current engine and tools. Addons will have to be rewritten to adhere to current standards.
---
The debate is wether or not to allow addons that came after vanilla, or stick with period specific addons only.
---
Well that's a long period,  but you can still finish it,  just find the motivation.  The second part is much more interesting than the first part of this book,  just give it a chance :) 
---
That's just frankly not true. The closest flight plan to VC for horde would be Grom'gol or Stonard, both still quite a distance from VC through some pretty rough territory at level 19-20.
---
Chill wind point is actually very close, just as close as UC, to Scarlet Monestary.
---
I went super hard in Vanilla and TBC and never fully took in the levelling experience. This time round I’ll also only have limited time to play due to kids etc. I think a lot of people are in the same boat. It seems pointless trying to rush to 60 and missing out on all the great content along the way.
---
With that said I’ll be rolling a Dwarf Paladin and really exploring everything the zones and quests have to offer. I also plan on levelling mining and eng at the same time. Sure it might take months to hit 60, but hopefully I’ll be able to help loads of people out along the way and have a really good understanding of the class when I finally get there.
---
Some items are going to be popular and farmed at release for a decent gold, but if saved could be worth a lot more later on as more and more people reach level cap and get to end game where the demand will spike for them.
---
Stuff like Elemental Fire (highest price at release), Elemental Earth, Black Lotus (becomes BoE at later patch), Ghost Mushroom, Grave Moss, Gromsblood, Firewater, Jujus,etc...
---
We don't know. They've said it's based on 7.3.5 but haven't said if they'll limit it to how it was (hopefully not for macros at least, was annoying requiring super macro scripts. 
---
I could not get into Stormrage. On the other hand illidan and Arthas are probably among my favorite books.
---
My parents made me stop playing classic in 06 in order to focus on my GCSE’s and instead bought me Oblivion on Xbox 360. I didn’t return until burning crusade, but played Oblivion constantly. 
---
Go figure on their logic.
---
Nightmares for me. I didn't see Org or Stormwind earlier than 2am without crashing.
---
Best times still.
---
Fire spec pvp with no gear? 
---
Same, I played on EU servers and it was always "Strat scarlet" or "Strat Baron". Never saw "strat ud" or "strat live" until I played on private servers. 
---
As you might have noticed from all the differing opinions here, there is no best class for being casual, all classes can be played casually/competitively, some require more work than others ( hybrids mostly) simply due to pve gear not having the desired stats for their dps specs.
---
Yeah unlike any other time in WoW, in order to PvP during Classic you need to do PvE as well as that is literally the only place to get gear better than dungeon blues.
---
You *can* get special PvP gear but that comes way later and requires you to have a certain rank and buy the gear with gold instead of honor points, if Blizzard is going to follow the original patch schedule that is.
---
So before that special PvP gear becomes available then you'll need to run raids to get decent gear so that you keep up with everyone else.
---
\&gt;Complaining about people using cell phones in modern day when you're getting ready to play the most addictive, time consuming mmo in the world, which includes you staying away from the real world for hours on end.

One or the other bud.
---
I unironically would like to get a CRT monitor again, these new screens have bad depth and color, and believe it or not but CRT's actually had better hz than most modern monitors have had for a while.
---
Nice. You installed the wrong client though 
---
All I could think about when I read that was 
---
["I was there... I was there three thousand years ago.."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7X1BCCH9a8&amp;t=2m16s)
---
Well, performance, memory usage. Even though the difference is extermely minimal if we are talking about 5 players in range, the difference could be higher if you are in city with 500 players loaded, 500 mobs etc. Also, dont use float if u dont need to, float are slower than ints, especially if you are doing math with them.
---
DME/DMN/DMW/tribute and DM for deadmines.
---
That's as of six months ago.
---
Same, and the zeppelin not loaded in to stv... just loading screen, then another loading screen back to org :D
---
Basically Classic will be using the modern engine "dumbed down" to the way it was back in 2004 when the game came out. Which means that addons will be using the modern engine as a base, so certain addons that worked back in 2004-2006 won't work and thus addons people use for private servers won't work which means that addon makes need to remake those old addons from scratch or just make new ones with a similar purpose.
---
And if you're in Westfal it just might be a deadmines group.
---
Right? Ive had the same experiences. Vanilla and wow in general brings out a special... type.. of person lol
---
Logic has no place here when their feelings get involved
---
That's awesome, haha. 
---
You can set up a shatter combo for big damage Crits in barely any good gear. You can also get hit called easily with the elemental precision talent in the frost tree. It’s very easy to excel in bad gear. I think rogue is another class that doesn’t need good gear.   Classes like warlock and warrior need gear to shine 
---
At level 45 when you can keep 5/5 Wand Specialization and get Shadowform, it's faster to level as shadow. You'll still be wanding everything to death, it's just that at level 45 it's worth being shadow spec to boost your mind blast and shadow word pain damage. Mind flay is still slightly less efficient than smite when considering wand dps and mana regen lost while casting even with shadowform, but its made up for by the boost to mind blast and shadow word pain damage.
---
Damn dude!
---
Oh my I forgot that hahaha
---
Size. Having a field in a databse take up 1 byte instead of 4 may not seem like that big of a deal, but when you have millions of player levels to store (maybe even more), that is going to pile up.
---
I have read only 4 books so far,  and the best one was prolly Rise of the Horde. Others were Of Blood and Honor,  Dawn of the Aspects and of course Stormrage. All great books! Orderer 4 more :) 
---
I can hear this picture
---
Exactly this. Noone knows (yet). They are building the Classic AddOn API based on the API that we have available now. API in this case loosely translates to "options available to developers to make use of".
---
Ultimately you're likely to expect the quality of AddOns we have today. User Interfaces like ElvUI and the likes are almost certainly going to exist. Tools that "automate things" are unlikely to happen. Personally I'm very curious for thinkgs like auction house manipulation. Honestly, I'd wish for the AH to not have an API at all - but that would be un-vanilla-like :\\
---
&gt; You were more prone to /who Westfall and whisper each person at an appropriate level than to go into SW for a player. 
---
Nah, you look for 18+ ppl and /w'd them, as you can reach everyone in Westfall with general.
---
But late night/early morning it takes shit tone of time to get the last tank or healer, so you would try find someone on trade chat as well.
---
I remember there was a quest for Brewfest where you had to ride a goat around Org and throw beer at targets on the ground. It was literally a slideshow for me. Thunderbluff and Undercity were my homes up until mid-TBC. 
---
I ran it as horse and knew it as VC
---
Loot trading will also incentivise certain greedy people in successful raiding guilds to run dungeons just to simply get rich quick from bribes because their presence will quickly get a lot of people interested in the run and thuse quick groups will form.
---
The geared guy will whisper anyone interested in a item his "fees" and if the guy is desperate for the item (things like Truestrike Shoulders and the Dal'rend set are always in demand) then he'll pay the guy quite happily. If the other interested guy then whispers he'll double his offer, well, all the better for the geared player right?
---
Soon it will become impossible to find a group without at least one well geared member from a raiding guild joining, they don't need anything from the run yet the go anway, taking up a slot for someone who needs it and is just there to simply make money.
---

Exept that i havent played since BC. Now waiting for it though, might have dipped into some undocumented place in the meanwhile.. cant wait for real deal though.
---
I think he just brought it down from the attic. :D
---
The global LFG i'm pretty sure was BC prepatch? Or BC itself? And Trade was all city, but not global.
---
It’s like playing on private servers now. What’s the point when you know classic is coming?
---
Gotta play at 15-45fps. #nochanges
---
Jesus. I kept two crts safe in a closet and they both died on me.

I feel like I can lower my shoulders a little bit now. Thank you.

---
Rested XP accumulates very slowly. It isn't really worth strategizing around rested xp when leveling characters unless you seriously don't care how long it takes the character to reach max level and don't enjoy playing it more than your other characters. It makes more sense just to play a character when you feel like it rather than waiting a week to play a character for a couple hours.
---
Play with a heater beside your pc to simulate overheating 
---
I made it to the point where Malfurion enters that druid grove with Brox. It's somewhere in the half, isn't it?
---
Exactly this. Also worth noting that at lower levels, rested XP is not worth nearly as much as it is at higher levels. If you're level 20 you'll burn through a full 1.5 levels of rested in an hour or so if you're efficient, but once you hit your 50s and each level starts taking several hours then it really impacts you that much more.
---
I just want to degauss it, I haven't degaussed a screen in years.
---
I've been listening to the audibooks on audible. Unfortunately they're a pretty new addition so they've only got the first couple. 
---
Hah, my last CRT monitor burst into flames when it was in my hands.
---
I'd argue otherwise. If you buff health and enrage timers then you've got to have a group that is well geared and competent at the fight to even have a chance.
---
That being said I think retuning raids is stupid. Huge amount of work that could be put towards new raid content. 
---
ELI5: An API is what allows us to "talk" with whatever is going on in WoW and make requests for specific information. Sometimes they change the way the calls or the answers work and the programmer needs to rewrite some code to manage that. 
---
It's really no big deal if Blizzard provides documentation and there's players willing to do it. There are some add-ons which might not work but most add-ons definitely will. 
---
I could not see underwater, just a total blue screen 
---
I don't use addons, apart from threat-meters.
---
You only need a ball mouse and you are good to go !
---
mmo's arent always about being hard for the individual player, its the time investment and investment in your friends guilds and teams that get you through the content. along with reputation on your server that can help you or block you from doing this. its a social experience just as much as it is a game, something that it seems retail forgot long ago.
---

I feel like horizontal content is fine. New dungeons for 1-60 leveling with comparable item levels, and new raids eventually with small item level increases. 
---
It would be great to eventually see new content that keeps players engaged without changing the underlying systems of classic. 
---
Raid progression is fine imo. But this wouldn’t happen for 2+ years post launch I’m sure.

---
If memory serves me correctly, mana return from seal/judgement of wisdom also generates 1 threat per mana returned (just like with over healing, over generation of mana does not count towards threat). So if you want to you probably could use judgement of wisdom and seal of wisdom if you really wanted. Or as you want to do, a mix and match of light and wisdom. Both will generate threat as long as missing mana and health are restored. 
---
[Yeah, the End of Beta Event was quite funny.](https://i.imgur.com/UiMN3b0.jpg)
---
Well, "requiring that the group knows" how to play with a Prot Pally tank doesn't have to be a wish list if you play with friends. You may not play with friends, but that doesn't mean I don't, so it's not a wish list?

Holy shit, people born in 2001 are adults now 
---
Right!  I guess this Deadmines/Dire Maul thing is a real touchy subject.

Just click the left-side, click somewhere outside the shell, type DELETE and press enter.

As soon as they introduce flying, the experience is gone.
---
Idk man. A good paladin or rogue will eat your shit.

A decent frost mage could probably lock you up pretty good too.
---
I played on a US server during vanilla. Can confirm, some people called Deadmines VC
---
Hope you're feeling better soon! 
---
144?
---
I never, ever heard about VC on live retail 2005-2006, and I played on Defias Brotherhood, Warsong, Twillight Hammer, Chromaggus, Boulderfist and Al'Akir. 
---
However, as soon as I hoped on Nostalrius, heard it quite alot, therefore, I either suspect is an American/Oceanic thing or just a new name that private servers players invented post vanilla.
---
Could be. I'm a day 1 player and people freaking out about it on Reddit is where I learned people even referred to deadmines as DM. It was always VC.
---
the /tell command was present in vanilla wow and is still in the game to this day.
---
I usually have a ton of alts resting and try to exploit it. But I'm an altoholic.
---
Pala prot tank on a ...server until and at 60 here.  
---
Theres a few ways to look at this, but this is how i do it and i have 0 down time and only have to drink after boss fights normally. The key is a fast weapon, (the faster the better),  
---
Style 1) Single target,  
---
Judge wisdom, SoR, no need for consecrate. Holy shield only if needed - you get double the JoW procs with SoR up. Threat is generated from party members wisdom procs. Extra SoR judgements provide back up agro burst if someone gets close to stealing the mob or its a caster. Fast weapon ensures you get enough wisdom procs to earn back your mana investment.  
---
Style 2) Single target if DPS are not patient / early bursting,  
---
 (Salvation the DPS with no brain / agro awareness) Judge Righteousness for Agro burst, SoW, mob is normally dead before i need to judge wisdom or snap agro back, then you have SoW up try to chain pull the next single target judging wisdom, and reverting to style 1 as you have time to gain agro as they finish previous mob  
---
Style 3) Groups,  
---
SoW up, Holy shield as i run in, pop consecrate, judge Widsom, SoW back up, with SoW and JoW you should be almost regenerating consecration mana spent (and generating a small amount of threat from everyone elses JoW procs).    
---
Rejudge wisdom as you target each mobs if you have enough times for the 3 procs needed to earn you mana back. Mana is normally full by the end of the fight consecrate + aura  + holy shield procs + wisdom procs generate agro on all the mobs meaning you have secure agro by the end of can focus on getting mana back without using abilities. Typically one consecrate is enough, but i can normally do 2 per group fight and still be full mana.  
---
Bosses vary depending on DPS and how confident you are with agro control.  
---
Main take away points,  
---
Typically judging and auto attacking with SoR is sufficient to hold agro on a single mob, with the dmg generated from Ret Aura + provs from Holy shield. Consecration on top of this is a mana burn and overkill so do not use.  
---
Consecration + SoW / JoW generates about the same agro as your single target rotation (download KTM and test it) but to all mobs attacking you but does burn more mana up front, the extended fight allows you to regain all your mana, a single mob dies to quickly to allow mana regeneration so it is inefficient.
---
Its a little bit of trial and error. Like holy shield and ret aura, consecration is a valuable tool. You just need to keep altering the combinations to get each group right.
---
once again, someone needs to point out that the Official Strategy Guide for the game published in 2004 called it VC. They specifically used the example, "LFM VC"

Emm...Brox was not in this book, only mentioned, because he is dead. Thura, Brox's daugther is in the book and is set out to kill Malfurion, though by his own plan to save him from Xavius.
---
&gt; Yes, because I'm totally going to pass a 4000 gold Teebu's Blazing Longsword to some random Night Elf Male rogue that is not in my guild.
---
Look, I get that you are incredibly selfish and believe that group play with strangers should revolve completely around your personal desires, but can you at least make a better attempt to conceal your anti-social behavior?
---
Thanks! Have too much time on me now, but also playing Warcraft 2 here, as laptop can easily run it. Need some Warcraft immersion and hype! Can't wait for Classic as most of people here.
---
If they don't add content, the game will die.
---
Should go as I say it.
---
No new xpac or levels
---
New content should give items that are situational and give certain perks
---
Follow OSRS model.
---
Maybe I should try it as well. What books do they have, not sure which ones were released first?
---
Damn, I had almost completely forgotten about having curved screens.
---
Imagine pvp with even better gear than Naxx, lol.
---
Although Fortnite gets a dismissive nasal chuckle anywhere you go. 
---
yes, it was only for a short period since tbc.
---
That’s my exact point... the IPOs (similar to what blizzard is doing here) use boilerplate language to say there may be issues and this may fail, buy at your own risk, so they can’t be sued by investors 
---
Nah, it's just my old CRT. I kept it this whole time.
---
Faster decay rate would not mess anything up.
---
As long as we first give us the historical authentic recreation of Vanilla they can do whatever they want. Personally I'm pretty hyped for TBC Classic ;)
---
Lucky man!
---
Play in a XP VM and don't forget to install Bonzi Buddy.
---
LOL this is seriously the shittiest forums of scrubs, people reading this, this is NOT a joke, 15 upvotes saying troll shadow priests have viability in PvP, jesus actual fuck.
---
How about new gear that enables more various specs?
---
Ah yes. I believe the strength of men failed that day.
---
They cany regardless, you have no idea what you're talking about man.  Barring fraud, investing IS at your own risk.  
---
This one goes up to 85hz only, even though in the specs it says it should achieve 120hz, but it doesn't :\\
---
Whether or not people are addicted to the game are not my concern. Bold of you to assume I'm going to fit the category automatically though.
---
Run XP natively on 15 year old hardware... 
---
Would JoW produce more threat than damage from JoR or is it more of the same but with the bonus of not having to worry so much about Mana issues during the pull?
---
You have those in Germany too ?
---
Blizzard doesn't have enough employees anymore to make any changes anyway.
---
I gotta say though, the loot trading makes me really nerveous.  
---
I'm playing vanilla constantly on p-servers and loot trading would change so much about the feels.  
---
Was the Classic wait to much for you so you got hospitalized? But don't despair the cure will soon be available!
---
Private servers overtune bosses and it seems to work just fine. They give them more HP and disable all world buffs inside the instance. The bosses are still quite easy they’re but not a complete shitshow like they will be in Classic. 
---
I'm not sure I'd want to connect a bare metal XP machine to the Internet nowadays. :D
---
Flying into Ironforge always felt like a power point presentation
---
You only need a couple dwarfs for any raid, plenty of non dwarfs will get raid spots. 
---
fire mage wtf? jesus this forum is literally incompetent lol.
---
Played hard PvP on nost for like 6 months and I can honestly say a mage never shot a pyroblast at me the entire time.
---
That’s true I suppose, OP af
---
Your reasoning for Tauren is probably my only complaint lol. 
---
Other than that I love the majestic bulls 
---
Had that happen to me with a 14 year old Akai TV a few years ago
---
45fps back then? What a beast of a machine.
---
TBC
---
Early in vanilla there were addons that revealed the true level of targets that were skull level to you. If you targeted a boss level creature with the addon it would show 500. Not sure if the the api the addon was using returned 500 for them or if the addon developer just returned 500 when receiving nil from the api.
---
this forum is actually braindead lol.
---
you heard right, they are absolutely unbeatable.  Such a stupidly large suite of tools.
---
We want to do this faster cause it’s so easy and boring. People did it in vanilla and they’ll do it now, not all guilds will require it and if you don’t wanna do it join one of them. All the guilds doing it will be faster than those not tho. 
---
Multiple pservers with healthy steady pop for 13 years says otherwise.
---
Yea it’d be nice to have like more “bis” items I guess so everyone not walking around with same shit. More preferential/ customizable items would be cool I think. 
---
You keep arguing my exact point
---
Although huntard comes back pretty often in the replies... \^\^ Shaman and mage sound promising too.
---
Thanks so much! Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Sounds like fun, so this is like a dps / heal hybrid?
---
It's VC. You don't use two acronyms for the same dungeon. Get's confusing. 
---
Not in my experience or the experience of others who currently play retail. All gear has the same 4 stats and the differences are just RNG, like diablo loot style. The only illusion of choice is which secondary stat you stack, but no one cares what the names of any gear are, no one farms older sub level dungeons for BiS pieces, no one cares about anything really. On Classiccast the other week Staysafe was even commenting on how he doesnt know what gear he is wearing and he has an active current character in BFA.
---
The only thing people know the names of are the "legendaries"... which arent very legendary anymore considering its some rng crap youre expected to farm in order to be viable... lmao
---
You’re right, you are all paranoid cynics who think the absolute worst out of people before you even know them, which clouds the fuck out of your judgement.
---
Give us TBC and Wrath. THEN consider adding content to the games. But until then, you love Vanilla, I think Vanilla with chocolate drizzle is pretty good, and cookie dough is even better.
---
No i dont.  You think some disclaimer absolves people from liability and it does not.  In fact, it doesnt matter.  Disclaimer or not, you cant sue a company you invested in.  Youre implying that without a disclaimer, they can be sued.  
---
Ah, all the memories blend together. 
---
I just meant with trade, it's not like you're looking locally in the zone of the instance 
---
I get what you're feeling, but the times have changed. If it's not in the game it's gonna be on discord, and that would be even less immersive. 
---
Fuck yhea!
---
I can confirm deadmines was called VC on US Frostmane. 
---
Corporations do this thing where they outline all of the possible risks to their business. Read the whole filing it will make more sense.
---
I'm still currently using the monitor I bought in 2005
---
'97 and have been waiting for classic for years.  
---
Makes sense, but WoW is a significantly different game to OSRS, and whilst situational/perks is an idea, I've still never seen a real suggestion on how this would be done. All well and good to suggest it, but I ask again: How? What items? What situations? 
---
yeh
---
Super helpful information, thanks! I had no idea that SoR returns double the amount of SoW, insane.. would it be 3 times with trash blade proc then? 
---
JoW is less threat but you get the mana return. You do get threat from players restoring their mana from JoW, but it's very little.
---
It appears to be specifically alliance NA.
---
Horde NA appear to call it DM like normal poeple who understand basic lingual concept such as context.
---
I recommend you go gathering profession as it’s quite hard to farm in resto, even if you can get proper feral gear.
---
So maybe it’s in there for a different reason but doesn’t change the fact this is standard CYA language in most financial memos/statements and shouldn’t be really looked into in this context
---
It actually was a thing, it just got patched out. Sitting actually does force a Crit in 1.12 it just doesn’t prove anything after ~1.10.
---
This is probably the most fair answer I've seen so far. With my initial question I was only really considering ways to 'lengthen' the vanilla wow lifetime, but this is perfectly reasonable too! And personally the only additional content that I think could work. 
---
That said, I would argue against adding raids with small ilvl increases. In vanilla, tactics are somewhat straightfoward compared to retail these days, so numbers/damage/gear checks were a bit progression gate for vanilla. If the gap was too small, I don't think it'd be very long before new raids were cleared.
---
I would also wonder: Would people still have the same drive to farm a raid for BiS, if the difference is so small? As if the difference is significant, then PVP bloating quickly takes over and only 1/2 raids would be possible. 
---
/r/bodyweightfitness
---
With a firewall blocking all inbound you're relatively safe.
---
I feel like flying would have worked if it were restricted to Outland only and the level cap wasn't raised to 70.
---
Me too! TBC is actually my favorite, despite its flaws, and that's the path I hope blizzard takes. But I know how passionate people are about vanilla and wanting to see it revived, so I was wondering how that dream might be realised. 
---
no weight, please. Weight is a number, just like DPS. Is it really the only thing that matters?
---
NO! By giving buffs, you boost the DPS of others, which gets you down on the list! And that's the health I'm talking about.
---
Surprised you know about num types but not memory management. 
---
8bits is the minimum length for a data type. 8bits can represent 1-256 (or 0-255). With the rate we're going, it would be over 20 years before the 8bit integer cap can be hit. 
---
Also WoW would never need that high of a level cap. 
---
I don't think it would be a huge problem amount of work. Blizzard now has access to tools making things like adjusting health and damage of bosses really easy. Otherwise they wouldn't have 4 raid difficulties and 25 dungeon difficulties on retail now. 
---
OMG yes lol perfect description
---
then it was another book I was reading
---
It was dishonest reporting of the person who put up that article. Here is the section of the filing. It's not a disclaimer, but a standard practice of outlining potential risks for investors.
---
[https://investor.activision.com/node/32301/html#da77001\_item\_1a.\_risk\_factors](https://investor.activision.com/node/32301/html#da77001_item_1a._risk_factors)
---
This shouldn't be read as a mea culpa on the restructuring it's a natural risk that they would outline in ancy case.
---
I just dont want to see MC being cleared easily with 25 experienced people. I think it should be tuned for at least being suited for a 2019 40man raidgroup so that ure forced to have that "grouping a full raid" experience. Ontop it would open a door for good groups to get geared even quicker if its too easy and way less people are needed to clear. Something you could take huge advantage of financially aswell.
---
Read like half of it and it’s somewhere in my bookshelf
---
Honestly it’s a quite boring book
---
yes, it was Warcraft book, Well of Eternity. The WOW-branded books aren't vanilla.
---
Interesting, but I think the niche would be too small to make any LARGE content out of it. Perhaps dungeons that are on the same ilvl as the originals, but offer specific perks to a playstyle. 
---
It wouldn't make vanilla LONGER but it would add a bit more to see. You'd also have to throw in some 'standard' items as well though, to give everyone an incentive to run it. 
---
&gt; If they don't add content, the game will die.
---
But private servers have been running for the past 10+ years and the game is not "dead".
---
I think the way you motivate people is green text. 
---
It might only be +2 stam/intelligence but if it has a cool green text passive or active, or set bonus people will want it. 
---
Also raid tier sets look cool and don’t forget the lore side of things. 
---
Slightly better gear doesn’t invalidate older gear IF it’s hard to get. 
---
Its when quest greens are better than raiding tier two that you have a problem. 
---
So long as they never implement catch up gear, they can implement new raids. 
---
I remember logging in on the final day of open beta to find Stormwind under siege. Giant dreadlords, infernals, and felhounds. Only have one screenshot unfortunately: [https://imgur.com/vrmoNPG](https://imgur.com/vrmoNPG)
---
Shhhh. It will die if they don’t do anything.
---
People just need to get creative if they want more of a challenge out of it. Set new boundaries on how many people you bring to the raid or use unoptimized specs. I mean if you think having 40 people its too easy and you don't like it then try to do it with 30 and then there's less people to divvy the loot out too. 
---
Druid
---
I forgot that was a thing 
---
At a higher level you actually go for specific pieces, because you have to balance those secondary stats and trinkets. Sure you don't know the name of the gear till then but it's still a thing.
---
probably 120 @ 320x200x16 &gt;.&lt;
---
I'd still at least put the WinXP PC inside its own VLAN and probably even use a whitelist for allowed outbound connections.
---
No, but people could be in Stormwind scouting a party for either.
---
&gt;I just dont want to see MC being cleared easily with 25 experienced people.
---
Why? It's a 15 year old game, expecting it to be super hard is futile.
---
Even so, nobody does MC with 25 people, why would you, when you can just take 40 and get it done that much faster? Most of the good loot is reserved or prio'd to certain classes anyway.
---
Man, part of me really misses the days of gaming before really "mainstream" internet as we know it today.  Rumors and legends like this, or Mew in Pokemon, or how to play as Shiek in Ocarina of Time were just fascinating.  Even if we all kinda knew they were probably BS, there was that element of mystery that was just so fun.
---
LOL as if shadow priests can't spam mana burn.  Just another easy kill class for an SPriest in 1v1.
---
Yeah, but it's different from the others. Most DPS/heal hybrids have moderate damage, good healing and solid sustain. On the other hand, this spec has insane burst, good healing but low sustain.
---
Master Vanilla Leatherworker here.
---
While it's tempting to look at cloth pieces and think "those must be better", i'd still recommend leatherworking for druid's for two main reasons: it helps you get to 60 faster, and it helps augment your non-resto gear creating abilities.
---
While leveling, crafted gear can be really quite good as most druid items are either str/agi or int/spi (although there are plenty of other weird itemisations along with that). Considering +heal/+spell is so hard to come by, just having raw stats for dungeon runs is almost always more than fine, just as having raw stats in animal form is perfectly fine.
---
So leatherworking benefits you more during leveling, that much is obvious. Once you hit 60, almost all of the gear that you will be getting from raids and dungeons will be healing gear due to the nature of druid itemization. Yes you could take up tailoring to try to mitigate this, or you could simply roll on cloth gear in dungeons and save yourself the effort.
---
Past that, being a leatherworker is great for creating nature and frost resist gear which can sometimes be hard to come by in the normal course of events, and for crafting things like Hide of the Wild which, for many people, will be the best healing cloak they ever get. My personal experience was that there weren't many artisan leatherworkers on my server, and as a result, i was able to charge very decent fees for crafting gear, and for just hitting the button when making gear for other people.
---
All in all, LW isn't the best profession by any stretch, but its a fun one to have.
---
I don't like the idea of loot trading at all, and I really hope its not in, but a warrior shouldn't be able to roll need on a cloth chest piece if they actually put it in.
---
You absolutely can.  A common lawsuit revolves around disclosure.  If you invest in a company and then it tanks, shareholders will try to sue claiming that they were misled by numerous filings or public statements.  Virtually every major corporate action involving investors and raising funds is open to litigation.
---
No flag ?
---
The OSRS model added half assed content that ruined and made obsolete half of the base content. 
---
Private servers continually reboot for fresh starts, that's how private servers keep the game "fresh." That's a path they could take but I find it unlikely as Blizzard probably doesn't want to wipe player progress.
---
Also don't pretend that we've had fully working classic servers for 10+ years. It wasn't even until relatively recently that private servers became more like emulators, for most of their lifespan they were playgrounds with vendors selling free tier sets on the streets. It's more like they've been running for the past 3+ years.
---
Loot trading in an organized Raid setting is far less damaging than in PuGs I agree with you there. I actually don’t mind that.
---
Except as everybody keeps pointing out, there is a large number of mechanical factors that trivialize MC. Sure player experience is a factor, but so are 1.12 talents, 1.10 itemization, and private server flawed resist mechanics. We're not expecting it to be super hard, but in the spirit of #nochanges, bringing the MC experirence back in line to what it was like when MC was the only raid available is a much better game and representation of actual vanilla than the pathetic joke it is right now.
---
because a guild can gear people faster if you take 2 groups of 20 each week, instead of 1 group of 40.  same with onyxia.   then ypure geared as fuck for BWL
---
Depends on group composition etc.  
---
JoR hits for say 150, with Imp righteous fury that 140% threat so 350 agro. You can cast it every 10 seconds.  
---
JoW, restores approx  50mana on hit (roughly).  Its 0.25 per threat point i beelive so each Mana proc is 13.75 threat. JoW is 50% proc rate i beleive. And agro only counts on targets with gain mana.  
---
1 Yourself  
---
2 Mage  
---
3 Hunter  
---
Assume healer isnt wanding and last dps is a rogue  
---
In those 10 seconds, you attack 6 times (weapon quicker than 2.0 speed) - assume you have SoR up so getting 12 hits. (or SoW which is effectily generating the same)  
---
Hunter attacks 6 times (auto attacks and abilities)  
---
Mage hits 4 frost bolts  
---
Thats 22 hits, 11 procs, 11  = 151 threat.  
---
But thats 151 threat to every enemy in the fight. So you tanking 3+ mobs = 450 threat generated.  
---
So on 1 mob assuming your judging SoR, on cooldown you have 0 regen, but generate an addition 350 threat per 10 seconds to 1 mob. Threat is reduced if not using on cd.  
---
You're doing a lot of work which we've hit on in the TC discord (yes, even Melee Hunter). Come join us.  
---
You may or we may have something neither of us have thought about when conducting ceiling and additional tests.
---
Sound like a great idea ! At least it make people do a "normal run" on the latest raid and later they can put it "on farm" with world buff again. 
---
Cool.
---
Yea bro, my buddy Kris said he would dedicate a month to WoW Classic.  He's never played before.  I'm jealous that he gets to experience it for the first time.  Such great memories! 
---
I think you have the work argument backwards. New raid content is a huge undertaking that also brings with it new itemization and how that would impact overall balance and progression in the game. Tuning MC and BWL in light of 1.12 itemization and mechanics and a more practiced encounter design that Blizzard demonstrated in ZG and beyond is a far simpler task.
---
Hanzo sword, 1.5 attack speed, 75dmg proc, great for mana return when tanking
---
VC = Deadmines because DM = Dire Maul
---
People who only poly pyro.
---
Always use protection ;)
---
AoE farming mages use all rank 1 spells to proc Clearcasting so that they can  then cast a free max rank Blizzard.
---
It will make it harder though. Right now bosses on private servers(granted they are not perfect but the closest we have playing classic with current tech) are getting killed before you even get to truely use the mechanics. I have yet to see rag phase 2, see lucifron truly curse down people, melees to have to reset on golemag
---
Sure, the mechanics of MC are easy, and with current interent, PC and addon etc. it is very easily done, but this does NOT mean that buffing values a bit more is just gonna make the raids boring and take forever.
---
Awesome and I also have hand of edward for 57 (mainly for solo aoe dungeons and pvp) would it be useful as a tank for that holy light aggro?
---
You got this all right until the end. 
---
Get Natures swiftness and your utility goes way up
---
This has to be more of an ally thing, right? I've been playing horde my entire WoW "career" and I have only seen a handful of people using "VC" when referring to Deadmines.
---
Existing vanilla addons that you use on private servers absolutely won't work.
---
Legion/BfA addons MIGHT work, and those that don't work can likely be fixed to work on Classic with a small amount of effort.
---
HOWEVER, Blizzard has said that they may limit the capabilities provided to Classic addons, so the intense addons as you call them may not be available.
---
That's pretty much all we can say until we get our hands on a beta Classic client.
---
It seems to be that VC was used on most American servers while EU servers used DM exclusively. 
---
Your point of vanilla.
---
If you like dnd and RPGs, and are looking for a video game to play, you should check out divinity: original sin 1 and 2.
---
i hated that event, i was busy leveling blacksmithing on a paladin to create this green axe for my hunter , didn't get it done in kharanos :(
---
Nice !
---
Ikr these casuals who have never even played on at least a 1.12 private server let alone vanilla itself always have to say something outlandish
---
Hunter no question.
---
Playing on private servers because I cant wait for WoW Classic and I find that the game makes me, you know, actually engage with it?
---
I need to read quest text, figure out where I am going and make choices about whether I advance towards my quest objective by managing encounters or retreating back to base if I forgot something or I didn't manage consumables correctly or if you forgot to actually pick up spells. The pace of the game also forces you to take in the details far better. 
---
You can honestly see that 90% of changes blizzard made to the game were without real understanding of what made the game work, and so the current WoW isn't a game where you are engaged as much as you are consuming mindlessly. I hope that developers of the live game can look at how classic is designed and realise that a game can be totally unbalanced, grindy and tedious but still be totally worthwhile because there is a reward structure in place that allows for it.
---
I wasn't a hardcore "no changes" kind of player at first, but now I am because I dont think we honestly know what made the original game better until we've all played it to death. Also, the current Blizzard is allowed to take absolutely credit for it doing well. They need to sit down and be taught a lesson, they need to shut up and take notes and see what works because there's a lot here that's been forgotten.
---
enhance is straight up shit compared to ele, only good for youtube compilations.
---
VC is pants on head retarded.
---
There are certain things that can't nor should be recreated (lag, bad framerate etc) but that doesn't mean that MC should be a glorified 5 man either.
---
I'm not going to DPS you retard
---
Often threat is split in AOE situations- like if you have 4 mobs on you and heal yourself for 100- it would generate 25 threat per mob rather than 100 per mob.  
---
Is that a crusader enchant? 
---
Yes.
---
I just don't know why people feel the need to say shit like
---
"troll shadow priest is underrated in PvP"
---
It's just so patently wrong, and they clearly have no idea what they're saying, so why even type that out and hit save?
---
People just love to give out bad info?  Are they purposely trying to be misleading?

You will have no problem finding twatish horde players to kill literally 24/7 if you roll alliance.

https://vanillafriends.com/
---
Yea, I mistakingly got involved in that other thread briefly. Who would have thought a game that gained millions of subscriptions over the first two years, spanning the entire globe, would have had different abbreviations used at various points in time.
---
My experience (NA) by late Vanilla was entirely VC, but I don’t know why anyone cares. Both abbreviations work fine and not once have I seen a lvl 60 run Deadmines by accident lol.
---
Himu has always been anti classic. If you ever watched his previous videos he has a bad attitude towards it. He only makes videos now regarding it because its free money with the hype levels classic is bringing. Plus more often than not he just regurgitates false information to reach his 10 minute mark.
---
You can still hear it in his voice that he hates. 
---
https://vanillafriends.com/ is set up for that purpose (well, not finding people on Retail), and already has a lot of entries. If you're looking to reconnect take a look. 
---
This is interesting. Is there a list of these BiS ore raid items and where to get them anywhere on the internet you can point me to? Thanks for all your help. 
---
That was the thing back in school. 
---
Best options so far: mage, hunter, druid and shaman. It seems like Druid could actually be a good option to do casual 5 mans and maybe eventually get that Feralheart raiment, which seems pretty good for pvp. Other option I like is the elemental / resto hybrid of shaman in battlegrounds with tier 1.
---
Thank you! :) I am — didn’t know this existed
---
Yeah what are people talking about? It was definitely sometimes VC and sometimes DM and people were arguing back then the same way were arguing right now. 
---
The way I see it, flying introduces the ease of mass killing lowbies, which in turn makes people want to rush to max level to have flying as well. It ruins the journey.
---
soo right, after seeing all the human, all the orc, all the night elf buildings,  it was suddenly like BOOM here's the undead town!  I also loved how it really contrasted the difference between the forsakens and their use of old human infrastructure and the scourge who erect ziggaruts etc.
---
It's okay for the game to die.
---
What if you have no frienda :/
---
Private servers in general, yes. But what individual server has lasted that long?
---
"in the spirit of #nochanges, change the game to un-blizzlike values to artificially increase difficulty"
---
:thonking:
---
You Are Not Prepared!
---
&gt; because a guild can gear people faster if you take 2 groups of 20 each week, instead of 1 group of 40.
---
Nobody does this outside of ultra-mega-tryhard guilds.
---
Too real bro
---
Does this strategy still work without the twink gear?
---
You can't compare a private server being run by a small group of people in their free time, to an official server being run by a multi-billion-dollar game dev.
---
Point is, people have been enjoying vanilla for over 10 years. The claim of "ohh it will DIE if we don't add new content!" is demonstrably false.
---
New raid content requires input/work from:
---
1) art team, for any new monster, texture or doodad designs
---
2) level building team to actually build the play space
---
3) Some sort of QA to validate the environment
---
4) Scripting team to actually code the boss fights
---
Whereas retuning MC requires
---
1) someone with solid math skills, that has the ability to type numbers into a box. 
---
Big difference in level of effort. The former requires months of cross team coordination. The later requires a dude. 
---
No at 40 you absolutely respec to shadow then to 45 put points back into wand and fill in disc to 60. Stack as much spirit as you can, front load your damage, wand for at least 5 seconds before your spirit tap procs. It's soooooooo easy.  You can even just bubble yourself, SWP, and do 3 mind flays, and wand to save mana from Mind Blast depending on which rank you have. Basically for me it was SWP, mind flay to about 40%, wand the rest of the way, and drink maybe every dozen or so mobs. Always take spirit over any other stat while leveling and obey the 5 sec rule. 
---
Classic demo had the same addon and macro API as Legion 7.3.5. I expect Classic release to be the same but with certain non-vanilla features like focus and castbars removed.
---
Addons from private servers won't be usable unless they get rewritten. Addons from retail will work for Classic with ease as long as it doesn't depend on a removed feature like castbars.
---
As long as they keep the permanent no change servers I don’t understand everyone’s issue with added content after 1.12. You can stay on your vanilla server, why would it bother you if they tried out something new on different servers? It could turn out awesome if they did it right. Worth a shot in my opinion
---
Degaussing was so satisfying.
---
When speed leveling/rushing a Rogue to 60 what skills can I skip/keep low level? I know I'll want the core abilities like SnD and what not, are there any I could skip to save money for a mount asap?
---
did you actually read that here lol?
---
Yep, this is how I roll as well, then hit Wetlands.
---
Yes lol
---
I'll take your word for it, since I've never done it myself. That runs counter to every other opinion I've heard about it though. Maybe staysafe and all the others I've read dont pve at a high level.
---
"Twink gear" ha ha, I'm wearing greens :D The only item that's noteworthy is Whirlwind Axe with crusader. And as you can see it wasn't even up while I cleaved those mobs down.
---
You tell me.
---
Why not just call it dm and dire
---
it'S been captured and will respawn in some time
---
Reminds me of the Hyjal mission in W3.
---
Thanks alot for your reply, I had no idea it would take so long for the full Exp! Thanks!
---
but troll shadow priest is underrated.

---
I will check it for sure ;-)
---
Lol sorry I didn't know you were wearing greens, I just saw the crusader and whirlwind. And crusader was always super expensive when I've played.
---
Why'd it stop after only 1 minute?
---
1999 here and I'm excited because I had a lot of fun playing in wotlk when I was younger. Now all I have fun doing is making money on the ah
---
No, i want the full shitty experience.
---
I feel old now.
---
Not really. If we assume 1 billion players/mobs etc, which is a highly exaggerated value, the total storage required is 4 GB. 
---
Something I miss in nearly every game: a ToDo list
---
It would allow me to create my own steps towards goals, like quests do. For example I want to craft a specific item, I would list the mats and every time I collect one it shows the progress, e.g. 2/12 scorbid scales.
---
Because often, I look up something in google but forget about it when I continue gamimg.
---
EU players are very strict.  They don't allow a lot of versatility in your spec or role and you always have to show up with pots... even if you've cleared it a million times. 
---
Americans are way more versatile and as long as you're not wiping constantly,  you're good. 
---
I'll be trying to raid as an elemental shaman which sucks dick early on so I'll probably go enhance and make friends with the warriors in my guild
---
"demonstrably" is a stretch, given that we have no example of what you're describing being the case. Many servers died by being shut down, having corruption scandals, etc, but many have also simply run their course of the content. The one thing we can't account for is competition with "fresh" servers, which I doubt will be a thing with official servers, but WoW is a themepark MMO and content is consumed. And even without doing everything in the game, when a player gets to the point where they realize the game is finite, many lose their motivation to play.
---
I'm not in favor of adding new content, by the way. I don't think it's a good solution. "Add more content" realistically just means staving off the inevitable, and not for particularly long. I don't mind Classic dying after it's had it's time, or otherwise being kept on life support with a minuscule userbase. Multiplayer games don't last forever. It's ok.
---
Make it open source and I'll help you out a bit if you want :)
---
I will be hell of fun, if they do something like that nowadays in beta, but instead of dieing all those [***theorycrafting***](https://www.google.ru/search?client=opera&amp;hs=ixr&amp;q=theorycrafting&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisyMCAtubgAhXBposKHTw8BSMQkeECCCkoAA) geeks raised by the pservers will be able to defeat or hold that event. And it will end in another epic 10 years beta (like 10 years AV). If I was in Blizz PR I'd tried something like that for hype-train, it works: [http://micetimes.asia/artificial-intelligence-is-out-of-control-in-the-game/](http://micetimes.asia/artificial-intelligence-is-out-of-control-in-the-game/)
---
I remember my AGP graphics card screaming for help back then. I still got about 30fps. But man my system was working
---
I'd love additional BG games.  I feel like that would be a good way of keeping some things fresh for a longer period without really compromising the core of classic too much. It's just applying your classic character in new ways. 
---
I think new items and item level/power would really change the character of classic in more dramatic ways by making things possible that are not really supposed to be possible, like faster MC runs or possible pvp balance changes. 
---
+1
---
&gt; "demonstrably" is a stretch, given that we have no example of what you're describing being the case.
---
Literally every single vanilla server over the past 10 years.
---
People still play the game. People still enjoy the game. Us two people talking about it right now has demonstrated that vanilla has not "died".
---
Then run MC with only 30 people, if you want to slow it down.
---
They will probably do what EQ did and start releasing different flavors of progression style servers. Having a TBC locked servers or WoTLK servers so people can choose what they want. 
---
The only issue with this is, on EQ anyway, is that when a new "flavor" is released, people tend to migrate and older servers start to become unviable. 
---
There are some progression servers that less than 20 or 30 people will be on in EQ at one time. 
---
WoW looked to EQ when it first came out to learn how to make major improvements to MMOs. They should do the same this time around too. 
---
Oh lord thats amazing. Too much time on WoW, so they have you the next most expansive game you can play for hundreds of hours. They should’ve given you Tetris or Sonic Boom.
---
the only Spriest less viable in PvP is night elf.  shadowguard is fine but melee isn't really a problem for Spriests, and it provides not a lot of resource trade vs another Spriest.
---
from experience on nost, I mostly lost to SUPER good frost mages,  SUPER good hunters and disgustingly geared rogues and of course the hardest matchup is another shadow priest, tbh really scary, but if you're alliance you worry less)
---
of my 1 on 1 world PvP fights, which were almost exclusively with frost mages(so many omg), the odd time an excellent and cunning hunter and sometimes another Spriest about 90% ended with me desperate praying/mana burn spamming and barely winning the attrition fight because of desperate prayer/feedback edging me out in the damage burst/manaburn spam... respectively. lmao....)
---
The thing with Spriest that I love is that when your opponent isn't top notch the fight is usually ludicrously easy because of dispel and how strong SW:P and Vamps are .  If you don't start the match's GCD instantly vs an spriest you're gonna have a bad time.
---
IMO making Spriest one of the easiest classes to world PvP with and one of the hardest classes to master dueling with.
---
What happened?
---
actually i totally did on my warrior tank and was kicked instantly after; to my sad confusion as a 12 yr old thinking i got my full deadmines group, whilst i got angry PM's stating "Dire Maul, NOT Dead Mines" coincidentally as a NA-W player my friend started us out on a Central EU server; I heard a mix of VC and DM, with VC being more popular as we went into TBC and Wrath. Sry for the wall haha
---
Demon souls is old.  But that game is still hard as fuck. 
---
I love it
---
Haha, wish that be the case, but sadly no. Hope it's not in August. :/
---
Woah hey there guy, just laughing at the fact that you mention DPS and then say youre rolling Paladin. Pull the stick out of your ass.
---
for shaman in PvP what you do, it's actually insane complex but i'll TRY to explain it.
---
Bind frost shock to like? 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and maybe even Shift 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 just in case?
---
Then like I THINK, I dunno if I'm explaining right, (someone correct me) but you CLICK the opponent with the right? (right?) right mouse button. and or hit 1 if you have melee there (wow! classic). 
---
This is the COMPLEX part, hit 2-9 and shift 1-7 as hard as you can bruv they dead.
---
Alternative route to certain victory -----&gt; (the pre-patched out edition baybay)  SPAM and i mean SPAM the lightning shield with literally zero mana cost and just in a circle not attacking, if your "health points" (the green % that goes straight back up bar thing) become low, simply spam any heal until green thing all green, LITEARALLY spam lightning shield that comes LITERALLY zero mana until they die of mortal boredom.
---
I miss real shaman boys.
---
I was there, beta events was best ever :D
---
In case you didn't know, there is already a vanilla addon called "TheoryCraft" that does everything you want and more, except display two sets of values at once. 
---
The part I find most useful is that it dynamically changes it's values based on your target's armor and resists, so for example I can see the normal damage of my Auto-Shot, and then target a boar to see how much damage I should expect to see after armor reduction.
---
Lol. Nooooooope. 
---
You still have to go on the Internet. 
---
Unless you copy over things like addons from a safe machine and *only* allow outbound to Battle.net from the XP box’s isolated vlan. 
---
Anything else and you’ll be compromised with a few minutes. Bad banner ad, etc, and you’re owned. 
---
:O but.. windfury procs windfury?
---
They could have given me a 3310 and I’d have played snake instead of studying. 
---
I loved Oblivion, played it through many times but never managed 100% cause it always bugged out
---
I guess that’s what I mean; any mix up was short lived. I think the “VC” became more popular TBC because if I remember right they tweaked the Van Cleef encounter at that point from its original iteration. 
---
I am the same. I will be rolling mage priest lock and hunter. The mage will get priority but an hour a day on an alt means after three months I should have one at 60 and three more in the 30’s
---
You have about 20 times too much fps, but other than that its perfect ;)
---
This is awesome. Enjoy an updoot good sir or madam. 
---
200 IQ imo.
---
Hi, /u/joedude
---
Hey thanks, I appreciate the response. Very interesting.  Seems as if American individualism vs European collectivism bleeds into gaming.  
---
Christie Golden it's great. Knaack is fucking awful.
---
1. Agree
---
2. Ain't nobody got time for that
---
3. No it wouldn't because no other dungeons have the same abbreviation.
---
4. People were calling it VC before Dire Maul even existed anyway
---
When you enter Mauraudon with the scepter you fall from a height into the water. My computer was too slow to load the water in time so I always died. 
---
I really like vanilla. 
---
But I played shaman for my entire wow career and ended when cata came out. 
---
I would really love dual spec.
---
Private servers provided the outline that many people coming back are "hardcore" players. 
---
I was lucky enough to be allowed to raid as enhance on vanilla and I miss my earthshaker and crown of rag look. 
---
Went to private and they only allow restoration... even in easy raids.
---
Took the wind out of my sails
---
The idea for not using an 8 bit integer for levels isn't that player levels may one day be above 255. My idea was, maybe one day you want to be able to make a player or mob have a stupid high level for testing, debugging, or maybe to make a mob that is supposed to be un-killable. 
---
It just seems weird to write yourself into that hole when designing that. Generally you'd want to make systems as scaleable. And at least attempt to design for unforeseen use cases. 
---
What I enjoyed about private server experience were prio runs for aq20 and zg.
---
It's fast, simple and worked great.
---
Are you playing with the blizzcon key? I'd like to play classic
---
dear god... shadowguard is that good because it works against ranged too. and hex of weakness is ur trumpcard vs other priests/palas.
---
you wrote a nice essay and its not all bullshit, but sadly most of it.
---
Well if you conveniently ignore, that class balance was not finished in 1.12, then yeah its only some math. And balancing raids before classes is plain stupid.
---
So they either need to balance both classes and raids or neither of those. And the minute they mention changes, they will get a healthy amount of reeeee from the nochange crowds... So we get a museum piece as originally was promised.
---
page up/page down
---
Haven't seen a single post like that. could you provide a link?
---
I guarantee you that no one will actually care if you play retail. That is just stupid talk from edgy kids. 
---
This was an easy one for Horde because we never ran that crap
---
Playing wow vanilla casually is not viable, and i didn't say how many people were addicted to it, i said it is the most addictive game, because it requires time, a really good amount of time.
---
I'm surprised nobody has said rogue.  They are really good in pug bgs because you can pick your fights and only engage when you want to.  Plus I think rogues look really cool in the vanilla armor.
---
You misinterpret my argument. I said the time to balance current content would be better put towards new content, not that new content would be easier than balancing old content. 
---
The only way you can really balance current content is by making every boss a gear check. 
---
I agree with this! I would love to see Rag phase 2 every time fighting him 
---
Yes. Compared to designing entirely new content. It’s just math. 
---
Not quite sure what you’re trying to get across though. I don’t agree that class balance has to be adjusted, in order to tune the raids. Those are two separate things. 
---
and what exactly does a tiny stun that procs after you cast do in a  ranged caster duel lol? extend my GCD by miliseconds one time?
---
Paladins? wtf is a paladin lol.
---
EVERY shadow priest mirror duel is a mana burn spam dude I don't honestly know if you've ever played an spriest lol.
---
Stormwind was *sometimes* navigable for me, but IF was out of the question.
---
It was all strat live/dead on my server.
---
Dwarf ret paladin with mining and engineering. This will be the first time that I havnt had a warrior main and hunter endgame alt. Trying a class I've never played! 
---
Can you explain to me ,or link me to a post on..., how the spirits tap thing works? 5 second rule. And I have to last hit to get spirit tap to proc correct 
---
You're deliberately avoiding the point of my post, which concerns an INDIVIDUAL SERVER, not vanilla private servers wholesale. 
---
respeccing once(twice due to returning to old spec) a week isnt all that easy of a feat for a casual player... thats a LOT of required income
---
I don't care for the sentiment of making the original game harder in order to appease the hardcore community. 
---
They've done this in other games and all it does is punish the casual crowd. Sometimes making it impossible to keep up.  A huge portion of this community is made up of adults, many with families, who will be playing casually. 
---
I think it would be a mistake to push them out of the game to appease a smaller percentage of hardcore raiders. 
---
Respeccing one a week is not casual.
---
Same! Starting to lose motivation on my mid-30's characters, dwarf warrior and NE druid
---
Simply put it means that your mana does not start regenerating until 5 seconds after your last cast. 
---
You want to be out of that range when spirit tap procs. 
---
When healing you want to heal in bursts and regen and so forth and use lowest rank heal. Stuff like that.
---
get out of here alliance scum!  Lok'tar Ogar!! See you in southshore. 
---
I like that idea as well.
---
Deadmines was always referred to as DM. 
---
Dire Maul has wings and NOBODY advertised to do all DM wings.
---
Thus DM = Deadmines and DM, DM:W, DM:N = Diremaul.
---
Oh hell yes. Pristine clarity. This counts as a historical photograph, basically.
---
i think you'd be surprised, and witihn those 40 ultra mega tryhards theres still a significant amount of shitters.  20 man onyxia after about 4 weeks of raiding is easily doable if you got pre bis and know what youre doing. especially with 1.12 talents
---
I find it really funny that you like "in your face" kind of play style and don't mention any melee class!
---
you get very little rested xp while logged into the game in a town
---
Individual server, multiple servers, it does not matter. There is clearly a demand for vanilla. Having everything be one server instead of multiple won't change that.
---
Nobody does full Diremaul runs.
---
Sm is my most ran dungeon also there’s like 9+ alliance quests there? 
---
Wc I’m pretty sure only leather wearers care to make the trek for. Rfk was for me ran far less than rfd but usually zone quests were just more fun in eastern kingdoms yea. 
---
Anything that got near the crossroads kinda forgot why we were in the barrens and there were better things to do :/ but I personally was more of a dungeon runner than most.
---
Only if they eventually release a WoD server as well. 
---
It's still an objectively fun game. I've been playing with a guild that I've been with on 5 different pservers over the last few years. We're basically just "hanging out" until classic, but the game is fun to play, so why not? 
---
You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved monitors. Curved. Monitors. 
---
You 100% can if they misrepresented or didn’t disclose the risks of their business. 
---
It won't make it difficult but at least players will have to be fully prepared to do it. Meaning pre raid gear + buff.
---
And who care about spending more time in Classic? Isn't it the game we are all waiting ? More time mean more fun with guildmates.
---
\+ vanilla IS time consuming
---
What are you saying feel so weird :(...
---
Most of these I can agree with but why not train divine shield?  One of the most iconic paladin abilities and a crucial defensive cooldown to avoid deaths. 
---
And *BUBBLE HEARTH*
---
Its not enough to just tune the raids, because if you dont have fine tuned classes then you will get class stacking with challenging raids. And class stacking sucks for everyone.
---
There were a series of class balance patches, mostly they dealt with one class at a time. For example they fixed the warlock in 1.6, and nerfed the rouges in 1.12, because they were OP, HOWEVER they were not finished by 1.12, as BC come earlier. Hunters desperately needed a fix, and honestly warriors should do less damage than the pure DPS rogues.
---
 And I haven't touched the shitshow that is hybrid balance.
---
So no, tuning a raid to become challenging is not some simple math, but complex gameplay effecting decision.
---
When you're playing on Horde side 99.9% of times you see "LFM DM" in LFG chat that means Dire Maul for sure.
---
Pally and lock skills are not more expensive. It's a misconception.
---
It absolutely matters, and you're ignoring not only everything I'm saying but everything we've gleaned from 10 years of vanilla servers. Why do servers die at all if there's a demand for vanilla? Vanilla is vanilla, so why would people leave the servers they've spent hundreds and hundreds of hours on? The reason why "fresh" servers are such a big deal is because the game simply does not last left on its own and it needs to be reset.
---
That was patched rather early into vanilla and most certainly won't be present in classics 1.12 build. 
---
That being said, enhancement is great fun to open world pvp with through the 10-35ish level range. Oneshotting people with good windfury crits 
---
They are not unbeatable. A SL Warlock beats Spriest, a good rogue with reflector can beat Spriest, and a skilled frost mage can beat Spriest, too. Furthermore, Spriests are so damn boring and mana consuming. 
---
&gt; Why do servers die at all if there's a demand for vanilla?
---
Corrupt admins screwing with shit and driving away players. Blizzard C&amp;D. Other, better servers launching.
---
There are a plethora of reasons why servers die, but "vanilla not popular, no new content!!!" is not one of them. Shoo.
---
"Many servers died by being shut down, having corruption scandals, etc, but many have also simply run their course of the content."
---
Because Divine Protection is more than enough. 
---
so saying something objectively wrong and then coming back snarkily about "watching the same video" and getting called out on it makes the other party smelly?  Lol and the other party are the ones with their "feelings involved" get real man.
---
What is progressive itemization?
---
Take me homeeeee! 😭
---
Better black levels, better color depth, better response time.
---
Generally they have worse refresh rates compared to modern gaming lcds, and usually aren't quite as sharp. Also they're a little harder on the eyes and have that awful high pitch whine.
---
I prefer the look on crts for gaming, but they're not better at everything(especially text). Also I think 4:3 is so much better than 16:9 but that's just preference. 
---
I could see it happening if Classic is a success, it depends on player count retention as to whether it'll be worth it.
---
Casual doesn't mean you are bad. Having less time to play will just make you take more time to reach everything. Harcdore will have clean everything while you will have still so much things to do ... no problems here...
---
As a casual you can't keep up average/hc players in a MMORPG... i don't care if someone who play more is "better", it's normal.
---
Else we'll have intensive catch up mechanics like BFA to let casuals feel powerfull with 30min of playtime/day but i doubt that's what you seek in Vanilla
---
Don’t forget to spin the little ball casing, remove the ball and scrape out the fluff for max performance!
---
dude, just stop, it hurts.
---
troll priest will win every manaburn showdown due to berserking and how u fail to see the benefit of a mini ms is beyond me.
---
also shadowguard doesnt only stun, it is very good scaling damage and speeds up shadow vulnerability stacks. also its not 1 chance, but 3 chances and u will usually have it precasted on you.
---
As others have said, it could be a server thing too. But yes I'm on US server. Idk why it's getting down voted either lol. Guess lots of DM people out there. But mannoroth US, starting from launch on alliance it was VC for a long time 
---
\&gt; Nobody in #nochange camp asked for OLD GRAPHICS. We asked for OLD MODELS. OLD SPELL EFFECTS. New graphics were not only expected (for fuck sake, we are in 2019) but also WELCOMED by everyone. New graphics won't change the GAMEPLAY. 
---
Then all these #nochanges youtubers must be a extremely small vocal minority. All of them I've watched videos of have bitched about the new graphic settings even when they all say they aren't going to use them.
---
\&gt;  At least you didn't told us that it's just nostalgia, and we will all quit 10 minutes after logging in. 
---
Nope. Me and my spouse played a bit on a private server. Was great fun. People acted better there than what I remember on retail vanilla. I assume the people that were there wanted vanilla wow and wanted to get the most out of it. Hopefully that same mentality carried over to retail. I fear it won't completely.
---
don't neglect the fact that blizzard will likely be releasing 'fresh' waves of servers over time.
---
Sform reduces damage taken as a whole.
---
The highest armor a priest can reach is 14k armor, if properly min-maxed and buffed. 
---
And yes, priests are capable of tanking a few raid bosses. Utilizing seasonal event buffs they can reach 16k health and 14.5k armor.
---
I think players shouldn't bridle themself to get the original experience. No one will do that if the game doesn't prevent them to :/
---
Why, rogues?
---
Common misconception. Actually it's better to be casting while spirit tap is active.
---
Spirit tap doubles your spirit for the duration and allows 50% of mana regen to continue while casting.
---
If you regen 10 mana per second from spirit normally outside the five second rule, then you regen 20 mana per second while spirit tap is up. Going from 10 mana per second to no regen when casting while spirit tap isn't active is the same as going from 20 to 10 mana per second regen when casting while spirit tap is active.
---
But not all priest regen is from spirit, they have a baseline mana regen of 13 per tick. So it's actually better to cast while spirit tap is up. Also at high levels if the priest is holy spec and has spiritual guidance then they get extra spell damage from having their spirit boosted by spirit tap.
---
You'd have to say you're passing on melee gear etc.
---
Well it's either "bridle yourself" or "change the game to be not true 1.12 anymore".
---
Pick your poison.
---
No. You don’t have to tune classes. Private servers tuned the raids and added a slight challenge. 
---
You’re basically just ranting at this point. Take care. 
---
lol berserking mattering wew this guy.
---
Blizzard is trying to make Classic feel as much like an old game as possible.  I don't think the "times have changed" line of thinking is what the majority want.
---
It's been some years since I've seen the Philosoraptor!
---
What makes this less squishy? The siphon life?
---
Adding content that was originally scrapped from vanilla could either be amazing or destroy the game, I'm kind of torn on that.   
---
What I think would greatly prolong the lifespan of classic without taking away from the experience is adding additional difficulties to dungeons and raids (without stronger gear, that would destroy the balance) and/or implementing a seasonal system like diablo (in parallel to normal servers obviously).   
---
I'd play the hell out of TBC servers, but I think the classic expierence should be preserved.   
---
The question is how far can you spread out the community without killing the game, when you are at a point where you have classic, tbc, wotlk and retail servers the world will start to feel as dead as in retail i'm afraid. 
---
That’s the real way to play classic 
---
I remember soloing 4 of the LBRS bosses as a hunter. A lot of fun
---
Classic for 2 to 2.5 years and then BC, and then wrath. 
---
I imagine the population sees the sharpest drop after wrath so I’m not sure what they’ll do then but we should see at least a 7 year content cycle if they have the first 2 expac
---
I doubt it. This suggestion has come up a bunch of times (ala "seasonal" realms) but they haven't suggested anything like this. It's understandeable when a private server dies and all of the characters are lost, but Blizzard can't do this, and the alternative is just keeping tons of backup dead servers running on later patches or merging/transferring characters, which is a scuffed, messy solution.
---
99% sure hunter and priest use tier 1 full set, (unless priests get that other robe)
---
I really hope that private servers wont be the benchmark for Classic wow.
---
only...
---
Tranny, wall, hate speach, rape, male privledge...
---
Well you are right, but they stated to use 1.12 as base but don't want to mess with data... As Vanilla players i think we should be happy to get Classic, but if Blizzard can give us even half of the experience in earlier raids it cool be good too ! I would like to progress slowly so i can enjoy playing a lot of time on Classic !
---
+10 armor during ult channel
---
Hunter is the only class that wears 8/8 tier 1/2/3 because the set bonuses are all good.
---
Other classes that come close are Prot Warrior, Rogue, Paladin, Priest, Resto Shamans. They tend to wear most of their tier items but still not 8/8 since there’s always better off pieces. 
---
Classes like Mage and Warlock don’t need to wear any tier gear at all until AQ because pre-bis blues are often much better than t1 and even t2. 
---
&gt; maybe.  
---
&gt; one day.  
---
You dont design around out there hypotheticals, especially because
---
&gt; mob unkillable
---
There's ways to legitimately do this (ie keep HP from hitting 0) without having an insanely high level.
---
&gt; write yourself into a hole
---
So why ever use 8bit? Why arent all numbers 64bit then? Because it's unnecessary, and adds extra-overhead; not something you want when youre writing an application that needs to not lag. 
---
Essentially, youre saying "forget CPU or RAM performance, because WHAT IF"
---
Bliizard would never even consider it unless 
---
1. There are a million players consistently playing Classic.
---
2. Retail numbers fall below Classic numbers.
---
New content means they need active devs creating content and they would also need a large support staff to address bugs and other problems.
---
&gt;if Blizzard can give us even half of the experience in earlier raids
---
Like I said, retail MC was only "hard" because players were new to the game and had awful-stat gear and awful talents. You can't really re-create that while still having 1.12.
---
Mage t1/t2 wasted too many stat points on spirit iirc. 8/8 t2 was fun if u had the set bonus tho.
---
If Classic is successful, the demand for it will be enormous after a couple of years. It's pretty much guaranteed to happen in that case. most people started during TBC/WotLK and they are still considered some of the best expansions to date (even though WotLK is a bit more controversial)
---
The point is, you never specified you're playing with friends in your original post which is what prompted me to make my reply. That's all there is to it.  
---
I won't be playing with strangers either, but I like to approach each scenario as the average player might.  
---
Good choice on not spoiling yourself. I know I wouldn't have the willpower lol.
---
Backstab, ambush, garrote, and expose armor. Probably rupture. Generally, if you're speed leveling, you're going Combat with swords, so no need for any skills that require you to be stealthed or behind a target or use daggers. Any abilities that you would use in longer, more drawn-out fights like rupture or expose armor will also have little value since you should be having short, quick fights.
---
Your mileage may vary if you're on a PvP realm. Generally in that case I like to have as many tools in my kit as possible.
---
I never saw the dragons but there were many lvl 500 elite massive infernals in the barrens and they had dozens of minor infernals following them around. This was during the final hour of the open beta.
---

---
I was thinking the exact same thing. Everyone acts like you have to roll Horde if you want PvP, so that probably means more people seeking open world PvP will be Horde.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Misrepresented, see fraud.
---
You can *try* to sue anyone.  But it wont go anywhere.  First, you're trying to sue a company, likely an LLC, that just went belly up.  Youll get pennies on the dollar because you cant go after the exeutives in most cases, see fraud again. Second, show me a single time that a bankrupt company was sued and lost, again barring fraud. 
---
but that would be sensible. are you insane?
---
sanity doesn't get you nearly as many upvotes.
---
i.e. your post
---
Right, but 12 Horde players killing the same 3 Alliance players, and vice versa, isn't really what I'm looking for. I want to be on the side that is outnumbered, so I'm just wondering if one side typically has more people searching for open world PvP.
---
If the mechanics of each boss are not visible or require attention when you kill them, then the bosses are undertuned. Simple as that.  
---
TBC: Flying and arenas.
---
WOTLK: Multiple raid difficulties, tons of catch up gear, dungeon finder, piss easy heroics.
---
No thanks.
---
Instead of buffing raids just wipe all buffs upon zoning into a raid instance.
---
I cant wait to get back to wow. Its going to be awesome once Classic releases. 
---
Thanks for the answer. To be honest i would be surprised if the journalists behind PC Gamer would be familiar with these sorts of practices :)
---
yeah the game should have zero depth and be easy.
---
Go play retail, that sounds more your style.
---
Honestly based on your comments you want Classic to be based on the version of Vanilla that you’ve built in your own imagination. 
---
Private servers are much more realistic benchmark than that. Since they actually exist and are what inspire Blizz to do Classic in the first place. 
---
You're correct, I'm looking for the side that looks for PvP more often so I can be on the opposite side that's outnumbered. In my experience (from playing WoW clones like ArcheAge) nobody cares about even numbers in open world PvP, so I just want to make sure that I'm on the side that has more opportunities to zerg bust.
---
R1 shocks in PVP as well for utility. 
---
Wow this actually brought back a rush of excitement for me. 
---
Right, but I'm trying to figure out which faction is generally outnumbered in the open world. I get that some servers have different experiences, but I'm guessing each faction generally attracts a certain type of player that would be more likely to be in the open world PvP zones regardless of total population.
---
Nobody ever ran the entirety of Dire Maul in one go.
---
DM = Dead Mines
---
DM + north east west = Dire Maul
---
also Dire Maul wasn't a release instance, Dead Mines was, it has dibs on being called DM.
---
If you play soulink as warlock you are scum.
---
God this just have me such and erection. Time to make a trial account and frollock through the fields of mulgore 
---
MC is probably just going to end up being an introductory easy raid like Wrath Naxx was and that's fine by me. The other raids will remain difficult. 
---
&gt; healthy steady pop for 13 years
---
[citation needed]
---
It’s like the computer equivalent of cracking your neck or back.
---
What server you on? been playin myself and its like when i started again
---
Are they any good ? I mean compared to wheel of time, eragon or such books.
---
Did someone say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Wind Seeker\]?
---
Truth be told, I don't think they really could do something in a good way without changing the base design. 
---
I mean, you can keep introducing new content with higher stats perpetually until you end up with numbers in the billions like retail did. You slowly trivialize old content, but technically, you do that from level 2 onward, so that can't be too big a deal. 
---
But then you have to ask yourself: What new content exactly? Only raids? Most people don't raid in the first place. You'll end up with a small elite getting more and more powerful while the rest doesn't actually get anything new and quit once they reached their respective goals. 
---
Give everyone some progression path in tandem? That can work to a degree, so long as you keep building on top of each other. Think of the T1.5 Set, which builds upon the T1 set and could be upgraded further via new dungeons. Or the PvP gear, which could be upgraded in a similar manner. 
---
However, as the progression spread between players increases, the idea of a "Fresh" server becomes more and more appealing to those not at the top and people might leave in droves once one comes along. Private or not. Naxx is already a bit of a sore point to some people. 
---
You can then hand out catch-up gear, but... then you might as well just start up TBC. Leveling the playing field again is part of the point of expansions. 
---
Alternatives? Horizontal Progression. Think synergies like converting other magic damage into shadow to synergize with shadow weaving, trading sustained DPS for burst or AoE and vice versa or even utility like trading stats for an active ability like leap of faith. These things can be an upgrade or a downgrade depending on the situation. 
---
That approach increases people's versatility more than their power and allows you to keep people on one power level for longer. Eventually, you'll run out of situational boni, at which point you'll need to let people grow in power directly again and start anew at the new power level, but you can achieve a large delay. 
---
The issue? The game isn't set up for it. If you set the power level below Naxx, Naxx gear will invalidate it. If you set it at Naxx? You're already deep into the vertical progression and you need to balance the effort to get it against Naxx. The worst of both worlds. Moreover, that sort of progression is often not deemed very satisfying. 
---
**TL;DR:** How to set up your MMO progression is not a trivial topic. If you want to go further with Classic, I only see two options: An overhauled Classic+ or TBC. 
---
It's not objectively wrong, that's the entire point. Read his post carefully  and you'll see what he means.
---
Shit, they're onto us.
---
I think that all druids (in my opinion) should take Enchanting and Skinning when leveling.
---
Skinning is the most profitable leveling profession, which allows you to make extra cash while you level by vendoring your skinning spoils.
---
You should take enchanting if you think that there is even the slightest chance of you tanking any PvE content. The reason is that the Smoking Heart of the Mountain trinket is a Best-in-slot item for druid tanks that is BOP and created by enchanting. It is relatively easy to craft and you can drop enchanting once you've crafted it.
---
From there you can adapt to what the server market seems to need (or what you want to work on). I've had success as both Herbalism/Alchemy and Skinning/Leatherworking at 60.
---
Solo you'll be fine, definitely slower than ret but as long as you have a nice backup dps weapon you can kill stuff pretty easily.
---
Holy pvp is amazing, good utility with blessings and hands and you're tankier than other healers.
---
For good gold farming you might want to find a nice dps friend to farm DM with and share the rewards.
---
Pick anything by Christie Golden and you can't go wrong. WoT was on average, just okay. Half of those books just dragged forever. Sanderson did a terrific job finishing it off though.
---
You can get most of the utility needed for healing with just 20 points in holy, certainly enough for 5 mans and causal raiding. So you could go holy/reckoning or holy/ret and be just fine.
---
On a resto druid I wouldn't be taking tailoring or leatherworking as a means to craft gear that I wear. There are simply far better pieces from dungeons which are roughly as simple to acquire.  
---
The fact is, no profession really has an impact on your singular player experience the same way Engineering does. That's all there is to it really.  
---
Are you saying you didn't run through STV to westfall to run DM?
---
it's a decent duelling spec, better vs certain 1v1 matchups than ele. But for group pvp, yes ele is better. 
---

While it wasn’t a scripted event, this video captures how special and sad the day was: https://youtu.be/v2RGL8j4yQ8
---
There are many other videos encompassing the end of Nost’s legacy that day, but this one is my favorite.
---
Want an easy way to MC harder?  Don't allow addons like deadly boss mobs. 
---
That a large amount in 2004. And why the hell would you waste space?
---
T1: Very good on warrior, rogue and hunter. With full set it is quite useful on shaman. It's a nice roleplay set for mage, warlock, paladin and druid ( I think druid can actually use it to improve thorns I think it is, then switch to smth else).
---
T2: Very good on warrior, rogue, hunter and shaman. Some good pieces on paladin, you can 2set combo on mage. I think you can use some as warlock too for reduce threat. Priest and druid definitely use pieces, I think 5set only though.
---
T2.5 (5set): Shoulder really good on fury warrior! Nice threat pieces and stuff for tank. Rogue set is very good. Hunter set is for pvp. Shaman set is OP as fuck for pvp. Mage/warlock has some good pieces. I don't recall the rest.
---
T3: Amazing on anyone I'm fairly sure. 
---
More like, "in the spirit of #nochanges, given that 1.12 mechanics and 1.10 itemization with MC as top-end content is already a massive change and strict by the numbers no-changes is not on the table, lets look at changing the balance of the zone to at least bring the EXPERIENCE back in line."
---
Highly doubt that. No other dungeon was abbreviated to the final boss unless it was a special run that slipped steps, so why would DM be different?
---
Dude, if you design any numbers with less than  2048 available bits, you are just bad at computers. Simple as that.
---
I'd prefer they go with the original expansion plans, similar to EQ:  Add new raid zones for high-level players.  A couple of raid zones taken from TBC would be an easy start. Increase the level cap only very slightly to move the hardcore raiders up into their own BGs with the XP for going over 60 only coming from the new raids.
---
1. Unless you're doing full clear?
---
2. So now instead of the information being available, I have to shift+click to find it?
---
3. Anyone who sees "VC" (and knows what deadmines is) knows the person is saying "deadmines."  Anyone who knows that "VC" commonly refers to deadmines and says "it doesn't mean deadmines" is just being obtuse on purpose.
---
If someone says "DM:E" or "DM:N" that conveys "Dire Maul" and the appropriate side.  If someone says "VC", you know exactly what they mean.  However, someone saying "DM" might mean deadmines, or all dire maul, or any of the diremaul instances.
---
So why cant people who want those servers have those servers if you get new servers every year? I dont care for flying but i had tons of fun doing 2v2 arenas. 
---
It's not about adding mechanics to make casuals feel powerful, it's about keeping the game balanced for casuals and hardcore raiders alike by sticking to the original raid difficulty. 
---
It's like if people get upset that others can get 60 in only 2 weeks, so they lower xp rate to where it takes those people who play 12 hours every day to take a minimum of 2 months to reach 60.  Yeah that seems good, but then if you *don't* play 12 hours a day, all of a sudden raiding almost isn't possible within a reasonable time frame.  Very few people will want to grind for 6 months or longer just to approach raiding level. 
---
What I'm saying is that you have to be careful trying to configure the game for the most hardcore players because it could end up alienating a vast number of regular players. 
---
So it might be a good time to start an alt by level 50+
---
A lot of people discount Druid Tier 2 but the 5 piece set is great when you have improved regrowth as it gives you a quicker heal with an almost guaranteed crit for sticky situations. The 8 piece is also great for giving a dramatic increase in healing efficiency due to the extra trick on regrowth. 
---
They certainly arent game breaking and could definitely be swapped out, but they just make some skills a lot better, thereby increasing the flexibility Druid is know for.
---
Also you flex in the capital city, you already know what it is.
---
Rested XP only becomes a big factor in leveling towards 60.  At lower levels, it's hardly worth the effort.
---
I would 100% play TBC and Wrath Server. I just don't know if i would want to be able to move my character along (like once im 60 move on to tbc) or just have them completely separate so people can choose how and what to play. 
---
Vhat a vonferful place
---
Don't listen to those retards who think #nochanges mean we should have exact same values for everything instead of trying to preserve the experience of the actual game. 
---
Right on, because from this perspective most any stat upgrade in the game could be labelled as having dimishing returns. But that's rather confusing.
---
It's notable that this effect applies to character development as a whole: a fresh level 60 in questing greens benefits a lot more, relatively speaking, from upgrading to an epic than someone who is in all epics but one slot and upgrades that last slot to epic too.
---
Yes exactly.
---
Sure the mechanics are easy as hell, but we deserve to actually see them. 
---
Why do you need to readjust camera view that often, I use numpad
---
I was on Arthas-US Alli from launch to tbc and it was alway DM...
---
People who call did VC were made fun of.
---
That seems like a good savings for a simple type change that will have no adverse effect on the game. 
---
Considering they released fresh servers during the original vanilla timeline I would be surprised if they didn't continue with that trend.  It's not a 'suggestion' it's in line with the vanilla philosophy.
---
Why not both?
---
I mean even without wbuffs raids are still easy as hell on private servers, no granted this is not guaranteed to be the experience on classic, if it is not, then no nerfing needed. 
---
As for worldbuffs, I very much like the way pservers has done it with removing world buffs for PROGRESSION, meaning the first month(completely up to change though), of the new raid world buffs are disabled. This allows a more natural progresion of the raids, but also gives you the chance to farm the raids quickly without too much worry. Honestly you will understand why people want to farm MC/BWL with wbuffs when you've done it for 6 months.
---
You can doubt me, but I was there and remember being confused too. BFD was my first dungeon and I didn’t actually run Deadmines until I was way over-leveled. I found it odd that we abbreviated it VC. 
---
For another reference, check out the BradyGames guide from 2004. In the section that goes over the abbreviations like LFG, WTB, WTS, etc... it lists VC as being an abbreviation for deadmines, that guide was released pre-Dire Maul And was based on late Beta. Paladin skills are all beta in that guide (old crusader strike etc)
---
What you think I just imaging was brought up countess times (and got downvoted...), so I'm rather in the no changes side now. And I would hate to see half-assed changes.
---
No, I rather on the no changes side, than having some half-assed changes. And class balance was brought up countless of times, but some half wits cant understand, that you dont change one variable without adjusting another.
---
It was an example to show that it does not, in fact, add up to anything significant. Read carefully - that is for 1 *billion* entries. It would save a couple megabytes in reality. I'm not saying there are no savings, I'm saying it just really never mattered. 
---
Oh man this takes me back. I remember getting a new desk (upgraded from some little wooden one that was made for fingerpainting or something) and a new monitor that looked just like this for my birthday. That same birthday, my buddy bought my WoW. Good memories.
---
The other warrior can go tank his own group. 
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Did you ever try leveling as the protection AoE spec? I've found mixed reviews on how well it works.
---
We're NOT asking for the bosses to be a gear check at all mate. We are asking that the bosses don't die so quickly that we don't get to experience the actual mechanics of the fight. If you do the mechanics correct, then congratz you killed the boss. That's how it should be. 
---
Different kind of fresh. WoW has never ran servers on different patches, excluding PTR.
---
I love setting Shift-MouseWheel for Zooming, and then setting regular Mousewheel to Target Closest/Previous Enemy - makes you able to quickly cyle through your TAB targets
---
All these fears are raid-wide fears(unless if you are absolute max ranges, far further than the dispell range). 
---
So yeah can't really dispell the warriors if you are already feared. 
---
So...in the spirit of #nochanges, let's make changes.
---
Nice.
---
Which boss mechanics do you think will be the most surprising to private server players if they actually have to be performed? In Molten Core only.  
---
I think Shazz honestly.  
---
Divine prot just isn't enough time to bubble hearth.  But yes I see the point.  Lowest rank is only like.. 6s though.  Kind of nice to have divine shield be twice as long, be able to do an autoattack + judgment (dont remember if you can still Judge while under divine protection).  
---
Fair to say that at least divine shield is at the top of that list as far as top priority to train after you get enough G.   =p
---
I personally have zero interest in TBC or WOTLK, but I don't see why they shouldn't add it for those who want it, if classic turns out to be a success. 
---
Everyone is on the dungeon because they are leveling up.
---
Because fun tends to be more subjective than objective.
---
Interesting. Didn't do the actual math on it, but it felt like less downtime doing 3 flays instead of a blast which still took 2 flays to get mob health down to wanding range. Spirit Tap also restores more mana while NOT casting than casting, right? If not, I'm way off, but the idea for me was to never OOM and keep grinding. If I was questing, I never ran out of mana anyway.  I'm probably more right than I am wrong. I mean, there's a fine line between exact math and being stupid and finishing off a mob with mind blast. :)
---
&gt; you get very little rested xp while logged into the game in a town
---
the same as while logged out in a town
---
Blizzard has an API (or Application Program Interface) which is used by addon developers to build their addons.  What addons are capable of doing is controlled by this API.  Over time, the API has changed, for a few reasons:
---
1. The interface of WoW itself has changed.  For example, the default menu items look completely different.  The game provides more information that addons no longer have to guess for.  
---
2. The game itself has changed.  What information is available to the player, what different abilities do, etc.  Things like LFG, new talent calculators, collections, achievements, etc. all come with the requirement for new API features or changes to the API to deal with that.
---
3. Some addons needed to be nerfed.  Healbot, in it's Vanilla form, was basically a 1-button macro that would heal everyone.  There was another addon called AVR, which was used for graffiti, but also completely trivialized most of the bosses in WotLK.  This addon was broken (although later the functionality was basically added in to the base game).
---
4. Sometimes Blizzard adds features that improve what you can do.  For example, the #showtooltip macro feature added in TBC.
---
Now, what the numbers mean (i.e. 1.12 and 7.3.5) is the patch number for which we're talking about.  Vanilla WoW ended with the 1.12 patch, and Classic WoW was built (at least initially) on the 7.3.5 patch.  The number is \[major version\].\[minor version\].\[patch\].  In the case of games it's usually \[expansion\].\[content release\].\[bug fixes\].  (And each number is it's own thing, where 1.10 is 9 versions later than 1.1).
---
So with regards to the API, you have a game that's changed for 6 expansions, to improve the API, to nerf overpowered addons, and just to deal with general improvements to the UI and changes to the game.  
---
**What does this mean for us?**
---
It means that addons built for 1.12 Vanilla servers won't work, because the API is different.
---
It also means that addons built for live probably won't work, because all of the content is different.
---
So new addons, or at least revised versions of the addons, are needed.
---
Warriors will usually not need fear dispels though...
---
Isn't riddles suppose to have an unanswered question?
---
Often groups did NOT run multiple DM wings. No other dungeon is named or abbreviated after the final boss of that dungeon.
---
DM - Deadmines
---
DM:E - Dire Maul East
---
DM:W - Dire Maul West
---
DM: N - Dire Maul North
---
VC - Viet Cong
---
It's not possible to eat every single fear because the CD on zerker is a bit longer than fear CD's. 
---
Is it drowning pool?
---
Used to take me so long to load into certain zones I'd warn people before porting that it takes me a while to load and to please not kick me.
---
Probably shazzrah yeah, I remember being in shit guilds on pservers were we did triangle tactic and had melees shoot bow the whole fight and stuff LOL nowadays it's just common to suicide on him.
---
If playing with friends is entirely within the realm of possibility, then it ain't a wish list!
---
Yeah, a bad guild I was in did the triangle as well and the first group he teleported to died lol. It was pretty instant.  
---
As someone who's played since nost:
---
I honestly don't think classic is gonna be some super amazing perfect thing at all. They have stated that they have 1.12 data, that doesn't include a lot of stuff, and by the latest dev post, they don't plan on getting everything right.
---
But that's really not why I am hyped about classic.
---
I am hyped about having an official PROPER game to play. I am hyped about not having to play on scummy private servers ran by russians, with drama and all that shit.
---
I am sure there's probably quite a few things that private servers get wrong, that we are really not sure about it, it will be nice to have that kind of confirmation that "this is legit". 
---
bwummmmmm
---
This still won’t stop me from saying deadlines?
---
First and foremost: permanence. If you leveled a character on retail, you know it will be there, no matter what. On a private server, anything can happen, even you don't count planned wipes. This alone as enough for me to dodge pservers. Whatever I do, I want it to stick around for a long time.
---
Either Hammerfall or Refuge Point depending on faction?
---
For Deadmines, yes you are looking locally in the zone. Not like you go to IF or Stormwind to find a group for the deadmines.
---
Which classes? :)
---
What's unfair about people rolling for gear they need? It's par for the course that some players get better drops in a dungeon than others. No need to whine about that.
---
What's next, are player losing loot priority for class books and T0 BoEs? And why stop there, why give priority for BoPs to people when there are enchanters around? 
---
Not to mention, this is an edge case of an edge case. If it happens and your warrior get's lucky, just enjoy being part of this 0.1% event instead of being salty about missing out on a 20% chance to steal 1500 gold. 
---
I'm in this boat too. Shutting it down goodd!
---
Hi, /u/Goldving
---
I'm excited to have actual trustworthy professionals working on the game. Not to insult private server developers who are honest and put a lot of hours into scripting, but there's been too many high profile developers who have been less than honest, leading to drama and server splits.
---
As a PVEr, I'm also looking forward to having populated PVE servers to play on, considering every private server project is either  entirely PVP, or has a low populated PVE realm that usually gets merged with a PVP realm when the population inevitably starts to stagger. It's not that I'm directly opposed to WPVP when I'm out and about, just that faction ratios tend to be heavily weighted, usually towards Horde which makes WPVP a bit unfun as an Alliance main.
---
I'm also hoping the community will be more...normal on official servers. While I had plenty of nice encounters when out questing on private servers, unmoderated world chats usually led to low-effort 4chan tier political 'discussion'.
---
Thank-you, yes. I'll adjust it.
---
Honestly I think 4:3 is a much better aspect ratio for general non-media computing, programming, and web browsing as well.
---
Too bad only Google has the balls to make a 3:2 laptop.
---
[Widescreen laptops are dumb](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/19/17027286/laptop-widescreen-aspect-ratio)
---
Cool people. That's who. Front flips ftw.
---
You’re savage 
---
I think it's a private server. Blizzard's one has "classic" in the logo. Also copyright is from 2004-2006. I could be wrong tho
---
No judgment at all, but are people actually going to be breaking out there CRT monitors for classic?
---
Pfft. Minimum of 15? Not all of us had supercomputers
---
So I plan on rolling an orc warrior for classic, I have just a few questions about it.
---
1. What is the defacto best leveling spec once vanilla comes out? I know the current way on private servers is fury but will that change?
---
2. What is the best gold farming method for a warrior in vanilla?
---
3. Are warriors truly the worst 1v1 class in the game even with gear?
---
"It's about the journey" :)
---
I'm looking forward to more moderation. There are jerks in retail too, but going online on a private server and seeing nazis every other time I look at world chat kills any motivation I have to invest time into the game.
---
World of Warcraft recruits antifa for Jewish coup on the United States, nigger case closed!
---
Good point! Rogue?
---
Nice ! Good feelings :)
---
Be able to copy characters over so I could still play classic and TBC.
---
I payed extra to have a flat screen crt. The thing could push 100hz. Such a beast. 
---
When leveling as prot, did you do the AoE shieldspike thing?
---
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR
---
LET THE BODIES HIT THE....  FLOOOOOOOOOR
---
checkerboard frame change to another kill
---
ending the video to the character standing on the corpse of the body, after that entirely blue screen with white text saying "thanks for watching my pvp video"
---
You forgot when they put arbitrary quotes from themselves about a spell they're using on a black background.
---
Truth be told I never liked rogues that much. But I might change my mind...
---
You’re right. Divine prot doesnt let u make any actions. 
---
Technically, doing that took away a clue. Oh well.
---
*Undead male walking animation*
---
Yep we won't have to worry about it getting shut down, and also won't have to worry about the population dying when a new server is released because there won't be any.
---
Our work will actually be worth something
---
Correct pathing so you can actually kite things properly. On Pservers everything just goes through objects..
---
&gt; I'm excited to have actual trustworthy professionals 
---
Now let's not give the makers of diablo immortal too much credit
---
Not having to deal with corrupt GMs that give their friends gear. US ping again instead of EU ping. Encounters that exactly match what they used to be.
---
They would end up splintering the community a ton.  I really enjoyed BC so odds are I'd move to the BC server.  However now the BC server is only half as big as classic was and the vanilla servers lost half their player base, possible very unevenly across servers.
---
Release WOTLK too?  Now a lot of the BC people are going to splinter off to WOTLK (and possibly some of the Vanilla people as well) and you've got more dead servers again.
---
Not even considering the mess that would be either people starting over in the new servers or finding a non-exploitable way to export your previous work into the new servers.
---
I think there would be tons of issues with release more nostalgia servers that would splinter that playerbase.
---
As much as I want to keep my characters, I would rather play on a fresh TBC server than one where everyone has 5k gold because of inflation and things like epic mount isn't an issue at all
---
Hey thanks for the gold!

Spirit Tap would contribute the same amount of mana regen whether you're casting or not if spirit were the only factor in mana regen, but due to priest's base mana regen it actually adds a little more mana regen while casting.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by downtime. In general you shouldn't be drinking as a priest while leveling. Should continuously kill mobs with the only downtime being running to the next mob. Using mind flay will make your mana last longer allowing you to spend more time casting, but doesn't do much more DPS than wanding (compared to smite and mind blast), and that's why it's bad. You want to use mana in bursts so that you regen more mana and kill the mob faster with high DPS spells like mind blast.
---
Nothing wrong with finishing a mob off with mind blast as long as it doesn't overkill it by much.
---
&gt;Holy Paladin
---
Holy paladin pre-raid BiS is better than every single T1 and T2 item. Unless you're too lazy to farm pre-raid items, you won't "wear mosts of your tier items" - in fact, you will wear none until T3.
---
I would argue that the reason we see it so much is because those generally asking for it are on the more min/max end of the spectrum and thus want it harder for them.
---
Though if its made harder it pushes out more and more players, basically allowing the min/maxers to become more and more powerful as others then can't get raid gear etc.
---
I should clarify I'm mostly referring to Brian Birmingham and co, maybe it's a bit optimistic of me but watching those guys at their Blizzcon panel always hypes me up for Classic and makes me feel they care about Classic as much as we do :)
---
Copy them over, although it remains to be seen if this would be profitable to Blizzard, seeing as the Vanilla/TBC and Wotlk community is largely the same. Vanilla on its own will last many years, but if TBC comes out, it may get too big a hit
---
Entirely depends on matchup and whether you use utility consumables. Best candidates are rogue, mage and druid, but others can do it too.
---
LFM A! (Uldaman)
---
They should do it, but also remove the mistakes that came with it, like:
---
1. Make flying extremely expensive or remove it entirely
---
2. Don't bring in LFG
---
3. Make the dungeons of wotlk heroic a lot harder.
---
That's just some I could think of at the top of my head
---
no, there is no matchup where you would rather be enhance.
---
I never really played rogues but it's not my style.  The best rogues wait outside combat a lot and wait for the right moment to either save teammates or finish off wounded enemies.  I like to play hybrids or healers typically so its not my style. 
---
We spent 40 minutes fighting a doomguard in the XR, all excited to see what it would drop.
---
It dropped 12c
---
TBC won't come out. They will soft reboot WoW with Microtransactions if Classic is a big success or sunset it for a MMO that also works on consoles. Think Destiny that is actually a MMO with the Starcraft IP. Basically what Project Titan (became Overwatch) was intended to be before they found out consoles had a CPU weaker than a Microwave in current gen. Every TBC private server fails because it actually is rose tinted glasses. All it has is raiding and really bad Arena that people get bored of quick. AV sucks, BG's are pointless, world pvp is pointless. The old world is pointless. In addition to all this you are never going to get people to reroll AGAIN in large numbers. You would end up with a playerbase of like 500 tryhard PVE raiders from the intiial 3000ish thinking they are relevant doing decade old content and dead servers. Just like every TBC private server. Half of those 500 players leave by Hyjal.
---
As far as moving to WOTLK, the new 8.1.5 Wintergrasp is also 40 on 40 instead of 120 on 120. I don't think they can even do Wintergrasp (or want to pay to fix it or pay the bandwidth) on the new server infrastructure and WOTLK would be way more popular than TBC because it has hard modes and better balanced arena for streamers. The non streamers and elitist jerk raiders are happier playing a game like Vanilla instead of a bad game made and designed around streaming and failed esports. We don't even know if Vanilla servers will work right or instead turn into a lagging/phased mess once they hit 40 on 40 numbers.
---
Why does Prot Warrior have such a slow time leveling?
---
Does this spec have any aoe at all?
---
So I used your spec guide and frontloaded damage and tried to finish off with a wand to get regen going then spirit tap would kick in, I'd probably let my mana go back near full and start on the next mob. Basically I wanted to stay at 50% mana in case there was an "oh shit" moment. Seemed to work pretty well. Also, I definitely noticed using less mana just doing SWP and 3 flays than doing blast, SWP, 2 flays.  For example, grinding ogres in Feralas. It was a smooth rotation that, unless I got an add I wasn't expecting, never resulting in drinking.  ...but of course I'd screw up and get adds.
---
Is this copypasta?
---
you're wrong. Vs mage, priest, lock and rogue, enhance generally do better in 1v1 duels. Vs warrior, paladin, druid and hunters, ele generally does better in 1v1 duels. In group pvp ele is far superior as you said. 
---
Shamans killing casters who have no idea what instant casts are
---
I figured it was a short for "post" for some reason lol, sure feel stupid rn :D
---
and before ppl ask why u would randomly skip one letter ppl abbreviate "ok" to "k" and "ye/yes" to "y" :P
---
I'm pretty sure Swifty deadass quoted himself in his own PvP video.
---
I just dropped by to say "I hope you get well soon and see you in Azeroth!"
---
He did indeed 
---
I'd always assumed they would do transfers, but the more one thinks about it, the more that independent servers kinda make sense.
---
You avoid the mad dash through the Dark Portal that brings Hellfire to its knees.
---
You avoid the sadness that is a whole bunch of BElf paladins and Dranai shaman leveling up alone.
---
You avoid the massive advantage that you give to people who've accumulated gear and wealth from a few years on vanilla. People love a fresh start, as demonstrated by so many F R E S H memes. 
---
You allow Classic to breath on its own and not have to take into consideration how any design choices or changes interact with TBC:Classic.
---
And what I'm sure everybody is most worried about, you avoid having server populations split in half overnight. Obviously TBC:Classic will have a huge negative influence on the population of Vanilla:Classic at launch, but after that many people might go back to playing both. However if they sublimed all of their characters to TBC then they'd have less motivation to come back to Classic.
---
Also not mine though I’m indulging the thought. Not really in your face, more like in your back. That leaves warriors which are a pain to level and need a pocket healer... 
---
in my head I saw this and immediately my mental DJ played the music for this screen..
---
better deathcoils, corruption, nightfall shadowbolts, and shadowburns. I've found conflag relying too much on casting the immolate which requires you to plant your feet and easily counterspelled.
---
Nah not a meme. TBC private server population is the meme. TBC is actually really, really bad outside raiding and it won't hold up with all the nerfs Blizzard will have applied due to patch. TBC 2 v 2 arena is a complete joke and the only bracket people did and will do again outside wannabe esport teams (which won't exist this time as they are in the modern game). TBC population would be dead in a month (just like on private servers). It simply doesn't hold up. WOTLK would be popular due to streamers and because people are simpletons and follow streamers and play what they tell them to. 
---
So perhaps it's a difference between ad revenue and direct revenue
---
This read like a plot synopsis of a foreign film. I loved it.
---
up until 40ish i found 2h much quicker as you dont have the gear / tools to make aoeing worthwhile and shield spikes are too expensive to put on lower lvl shields. once i hit 40 and get a good shield like from SM. I chuck a spike on it and do chain pulls so im always fighting 3 mobs until the area is dry.
---
3 minute intro tabbing over every single piece of gear they have equipped
---
One pretty cool way for adding "end-game" horizontal progression beyond 1.12 would be some new raids in the originally unfinished zones (grim batol, uldum, karazhan, hyjal etc.), that would not necessarily increase the item lvl / player power, but offer just new / different types of loot for classes instead. For example, tier sets for class specs that enable new playstyles such as actually enabling paladin tanking, oomkins etc. There's a lot of interesting stuff you could do with set bonus effects without essentially increasing the power gap to atrocious levels beyond naxxramas. This would both provide more content, and keep people interested in achieving new things for their old characters.
---
Engineering is nice in pve with sapper charges and such but it truly shines in pvp, all the tools like the reflector trinkets, grenades and boosts are essential if you care about high skill pvp.
---
Currently I'm on a private vanilla server, but I'm not sure if i'm allowed to share it on here. I'll pm you
---
Oh god the feelings inside me... While I wasn’t there on its last day online, I absolutely dearly miss Nostalrius 😥
---
There is no way that there wont be any new servers when people scream for them after a while.
---
Don't pretend that you don't know of our underground network with player lists circulating, and our add-ons to check each and every player we encounter for retail activity. OP is right, there will never be any interaction between his kind and ours. 
---
Oh yeah I was thinking about finishing off with mind blast in the context of holy spec smite -&gt; mind blast when off cd rotation. I still really recommend always opening with mind blast -&gt; SWP. But since mind flay lasts 3 seconds and uses mana at the start it creates a different situation where casting mind blast after it delays mana regen by 4.5 seconds. So it's possible that finishing a mob with mind blast rather than wanding after the last flay would be inefficient.
---
What? Did you even read what this is? 
---
Worst case we'll just migrate there.
---
Well they're not wrong in a sense that 99 percent of the case you don't care. It's only if you're looking for number 1 parses that you care basically
---
Yes, you're right.
---

If you're interested in healing at max level, next week I'm releasing a healer spreadsheet with separate sections for priests, druids, paladins, and shamans. The sheets include a variety of statistics such as the HPS and HPM of every rank of every healing spell dynamically calculated based on the fight length, gear, buffs, talents, set bonuses, etc the user has selected. Also calculates how much healing each spell rank would allow the healer to output if spammed till OOM during the fight. 
---
Stat weights are dynamically calculated based on the heal rank the user selects and complete dungeon/raid gear lists included in the spreadsheet are ordered from best to worst based on those weights by default. Though the user can also set their own custom stat weights to order gear by. I'm scheduled to talk about it and my priest leveling guide on the Countdown to Classic podcast on March 15th.
---
It's a really comprehensive sheet and in my post releasing it I'll talk about efficient healer playstyles and compare the performance of the healer classes. Stay tuned :)
---
There's also weird leveling mana cost things that happen with different spell ranks, so sometimes one minor rotation change made more sense than others...or seemed to...but yeah I did what you recommended and opened with blast, put the dot on, flayed to maybe 40% then wanded. It was fast and efficient and really my only regret was going for spirit/int items when a few times I had an item with just spirit on it with a great number. If I level another priest, I'll definitely not do that again.
---
Do you want to level prot? I think most people level fury or arms and tank as DPS until they get to the 50s. 
---
Yeah that's awesome, I think I want to try paladin next.
---
This. I like taking Riposte as a talent for leveling. I rush it after imp SS. Being able to disarm and do a ton of damage at the same time is nice.
---
I still have my entire system from vanilla.  It's slow, but it still works!  Though, booting into Windows XP with an internet connection probably isn't a good idea these days =P
---
"PST me"
---
It was a total lagfest by the end. I was in Crossroads when the infernals and the rest hit. Earlier my guild had gone on a world pvp jaunt to various Alliance towns including Lakeshire, not to any great effect as I was around level 32 I think and maybe there were a few in the 40s but most 20s and 30s. 
---
I was a warrior in beta but a total mmorpg noob so I had very little clue for much of it. Still, it was a good opportunity to get aquainted with the game before retail.  Except at the start of retail I blew it by rolling a warlock, getting to level 40 and then realising it wasn't for me and starting over with a shaman. It worked out in the end.
---
Moderation.
---
Tons of hacks go overlooked or unnoticed on pservers, especially when the offender is blowing a GM, mostly due to a lack of proper staff. Hell, tons of servers even sell cheats as microtransations. A bit ironic given the 'Blizzard store bad' attitude.
---
Chat channels are cesspools compared even to live. I'm all for someone dropping a well placed 'Bernie 2020' or 'lock her up' to get trade chat hot and bothered for an hour, but pservers feature just outright ludicrous people who honestly believe the ludicrous things they spout (holocaust denial, racism, etc) and it's rare that anything ever gets done about it. "The Nazis are only considered the bad guys because they lost" and "America was better when Blacks were obeying and not leading" wouldn't fly on an official server.
---
Aren't you the guy that complained about black bars while playing Apex Legends on that? Lol
---
Hmmm this may be a good name for a troll toon. 
---
Spirit is a godly stat for priest leveling for sure. Usually you can get enough int/stam from gear even while picking gear solely based on what has the highest spirit.
---
On March 3, 2009, after pouring five years into World of Warcraft, with a /played in the hundreds of hours across all my characters, I said my farewells to my guild mates and friends. My grades had suffered and my social life was in ruins--circumstances forced me to quit the game. So I journeyed back to my Tauren hometown of Thunder Bluff, gave away all my BOEs and gold to low-level characters, and ceremoniously jumped off the Bluffs to my death. 
---
The last 10 years have been interesting. I've lived in four continents, worked in war zones and office parks, made friends and made plans, bought property and invested in relationships.
---
But the whole time, I was thinking... "Boy, I'd trade it all for another 8-hour round of Patch 1.5.0 Alterac Valley!" 
---
The legendary Man-Slayer and Gnome-Eater, Lieutenant General Hideo shall soon return! 
---
In Vanilla we called it VC, this was just a thing, whether it makes sense or not, if you're advertising in Stormwind, you'd say VC. I didn't even know Deadmines was it's name until Cataclysm. 
---
Gank-bangs in the middle of WSG/AB. 1K crit to lens flare, swap to chasing low health enemy and [gap closer] [kill]
---
I honestly find it hard to believe they didn't keep all the that. How hard can it be for a company worth millions to back up some data? 
---
I don't mind some changes but if they gonna mess it up might as well leave everything as it was.
---
Then why do people not bring meme specs to raids? 1k is plenty for Naxx.
---
unregistered hypercam 2
---
It's fun to have fun.
---
Of course. Because this was an early game thing that either stuck around or didn't. For eu they started the game later so game knowledge would be a little higher. It was vc alliance side on Uther btw.
---
Upvotes to the left.
---
This right here. Plus an actual rpg experience that is not a menu based Diablo like msorpg (massive single player online).
---
I'll be extremely happy to see all that group/raid finder cancer go away. Classic can't come soon enough
---
Doesn't quite fit all your criteria, but [this was always my favourite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRgNOyCnbqg)
---
Replacing Classic is so bad an idea, it doesn't even merit a thought.
---
Now you're splitting hairs.
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
1. Best leveling will be 2H Arms when you can get Sweeping Strikes and it really takes off when you combine that with Mortal Strike. Arms is faster than Fury, especially if you have a swing timer and hamstring kite. Fury is faster on private servers because they abuse a /sit macro to force themselves being crit, which triggers some nice talent buffs in the Fury tree. Blizz has already said that they addressed thus sort of interaction around the time they fixed the Paladin reckoning bomb issue and that you wouldn't be able to do this on Classic servers, so Arms will be the way to go.
---
2. Most people will tell you that the best gold farming method will be to have an alt that can farm gold. Sometimes you can sell your services as a tank or if you get the UBRS key you can sell key services.
---
3. I think most 1v1s are usually decided by player skill rather than purely on class. There are ways to overcome any other class, but some will be more difficult than others.
---
TBC would fail just like it does on private. WOTLK would be a success just like it is on private. TBC private will fail so hard though that they won't do WOTLK. TBC is when the game got ruined. It was just propped up by a playerbase that was still leveling in the old world which had real MMO content and was that stuck in Kara. They viewed things past Kara with awe, because they never actually did them. The small vocal minority in TBC were the people who actually did Arena and completed Sunwell. They get bored on private servers because 2 v 2 Arena is all people do in TBC and it blows and nerfed raids with patched talents don't hold up, when it's the ONLY content with gear rewards that don't have any value because wpvp is dead and because someone can get better pvp gear playing a instanced minigame in a tiny fraction of the time.
---
In Vanilla you get gear in raids that lets you crush people in wpvp that is rampant or BG's, The gear actually has value outside the raid. TBC ruined WoW. Not WOTLK. WOTLK just added on to the horrible ideas and polished the turd that was TBC game design outside raids. WOTLK had Arena that was "ok". Wintergrasp kind of fixed AV that was now ruined and broken. Hard modes made the small vocal minority happy. Then Cata further tried to please that small vocal minority and people that didn't even want to play a MMO on the other end of the spectrum and the LARGE MIDDLE playerbase all left and never came back (outside the first month of any expansion). 
---
If you care about going super try hard every raider wants to have engineering with goblin sapper charges. Including the healers. It makes the run go by faster if everyone is using one on cd. Including on some trash in bwl  and even on mc.
---
For Pvp engineering is also a must no matter your role. Being able to deny a cc by throwing a made at a mage is really strong. Even if your a healer. Giving access to rocket boots is really strong for a priest due to their lack of mobility, rocket helm is a free sap for all classes.
---
Given how easy engineering is to level up. Every class should have it. It’s prob the same cost as buying your way to 300 first aid. But more useful.   Making the gadgets is the expensive part.
---
Yeh, I'm a Diablo vet. I'm fail to see the point in loot centric games though, well, to specify, I fail to see the point in games that's -only- about loot. It makes the game pointless to me.
---
Exactly. Similarly Preeminence. 
---
Various pservers exist which do somethings well and other things poorly. Fracturing the playerbase and leading to people bickering about who does it better, which server's accomplishments mean more. And whenever a new one opens up, some will inevitably want to jump ship.
---
Whatever Blizzard gets wrong, Classic is still going to be the king of the hill.
---
10 years ago I was eating potato waffles while raiding, now I've upgraded to Belgian waffles...so I guess you could say we both did pretty well for ourselves.
---
I'm American. We didnt call that shit VC. I played from 2005-2010. 
---
Any reason why you didn't just unsubscribe? Where you afraid to fall back into the adiction? 
---
Always DM for me, I guess it varied depending on server. Judging by private servers DM is a lot more common but still see VC quite a lot 
---
Or scorch builds, a lot of fire mages didnt even take pyro
---
What if he was going to say "nothing" 😓
---
Decreasing XP rate increases time needed. Increasing boss difficulty does not.
---
We had different experiences then. I never saw a single person call it VC in Vanilla. Must have been different from.server to server.
---
A tragedy, really.
---
Superb!!
---
Wow okay this changes everything! I never knew Guild Wars was like that. I think I'm gonna download it tonight actually and give it a shot. I'll definitely hit you up with any questions I have - you seem to have pretty good knowledge and opinions about the game. Thanks so much!
---
ELE SHAMAN
---
Unfortunately, collateral damage is unavoidable in war. 
---
No one does all of diremaul ever, never ever. It's not confusing at all. No one says DM ever and meaning Dire maul
---
That's completely different then. Either way I hope it procs the effect its just a little nuance thing that not everyone playing warrior knows.
---
Shitty nu metal and undead rogues
---
True, but time is just one example. Difficulty is difficulty, whether time-based or not. You don't want to lock out guilds from killing bosses who don't completely min-max specs, consumables, and have the most skilled players, just to try and make it difficult for the best of the best. In my opinion, anyways. 
---
My favorite class is pretty much a meme spec in PVE, and I have a more than full time job. So I'm probably biased compared to old pserver try-yards that are driving this conversation. 
---
Do you have a source for this? 
---
written in comic sans ofc
---
You played before it started to go downhill. Wrath was the last hood expansion.
---
Can't wait for Blizzard to do Classic TBC and watch it fail. Guess who will get canned? Guess who came on in TBC?
---
TBC was always where WoW died. 
---
\-It's when they tried to make a LFG system that was primitive and that Brack fully realized in WOTLK 
---
\-It's when the world died and wpvp died and the community died. Cross realm BG's was the end of vanilla and was probably done due to BG pvp gear being a lead in to Arena and destroyed the community even more
---
\-It's when raid gear lost a ton of value because world pvp was dead and because you could get better pvp gear in a minigame in a fraction of the time.
---
\-BG's became completely pointless and not fun due to healers having to be balanced around CC chains. You could literally win a BG with a resto druid and a warrior in resilience gear, laughing at how bad the pvp was. Things like stunherald were monumentally stupid. TBC was the worst balanced expansion in the history of WoW in PvP. 
---
\-It's when real organic content was replaced by awful dailies.
---
\-It's when classes lost all their identity due to trying to "balance" classes, which never works in a MMO. 1 v 1 is currently as bad as it's ever been in modern WoW because trinket variety and consumables and engineering no longer matter and hard counters are simply too hard. 
---
The only people lobbying for TBC is people who never got out of Kara and streamers who want to try to remain relevant thinking people will watch TBC Arena. They won't. TBC Arena is awful. TBC raids are also awful. Stream viewers would not watch things like Hyjal. It's the second worst raid Blizzard ever made and because it was so much longer than the worst, it would be the worst to watch.
---
Do you remember in which video he quotes himself?
---
&gt; Feral tanking is hard
---
Druids generate more threat than warriors and they have a very simplistic rotation. They also can't (and such don't have to) stance-dance. They also got a better pull skill which generates moderate threat as well.
---
Now I'm not saying druids are better tanks. As you've wrote earlier, they are squishier, but gameplay wise they are much much easier. 
---
Paladins have that self sac button to enable anyone with the cables to reez. But I have rarely see one use it at the right time and place. 
---
I thought DM stands for Dun Modr :)
---
This is the opposite of my experience. DM was deadmines until dire maul hit, then we swapped it over. It was less than a year, but I remember it vividly.
---
No one KNOW anything about macros in Classic yet.
---
I know he did in incredible warrior tricks 1 at 9:50 I'm not sure about other times 
---
Can't be vanilla, the res is too high.
---
It's a critique that sharding will necessarily require cross realm battlegrounds of course
---
Because in the case of BoE's, by stating you are the only person that get to roll, you are denying 4 other players the opportunity to improve your own gear. When the item is tradable, it has the exact same value to every member of the group as the item can be converted directly into a certain amount of currency. By needing and equipping the BoE, the person winning it will have saved the monetary value of the item instead of having to farm it and buy it on the auction house. It's not really a difficult concept.
---
What was the original comic?
---
&gt; I'm saying it just really never mattered.
---
This was being developed in 2004 when storage wasn't nearly as capacious as it is today. Developers were (and still are) always looking at ways to save on space. It did matter and still does. 
---
Instantly jumping off the zeppelin from Org into the water and swimming like a 1/4 of the distance was the way to go.
---
What happened to his hair? 
---
Just found a blank template
---
Protip: instead of relying on testes xp, you could just play twice as many hours a day.
---
Well that's hilarious. Thanks for your reply
---
&gt;Only terrible because it denies you the ability to sell it for gold.
---
No, it saves the player winning from having to spend 10 or more hours of playtime farming the gold for the item, thus denying the rest of the group a chance to exchange the item for upgrades of similar value. 
---
The entire group needing on BoE items is the only reasonable and fair way to handle loot in a party with random players you do not know from before. Trying to argue that this is somehow ninjalooting as completely backwards.
---
Haha thanks man!
---
Why not do what they did before where the server just progress into the next expansion? 
---
To be completely honest TBC is by far my favorite version of WoW due to the people I was raiding with but the thing to me is it’s really when the world started to feel smaller for lots of reasons not just “flying” so I’d be happy with seasonal Vanilla servers only.
---
Just my own view and opinion.
---
It do be like that
---
Paladins sure love engineering? Ranged damage, bubble death ray, rocket boots and net against kiting. It helps them at their biggest weaknesses. 
---
It’s disappointing how much goblin jumper cables don’t work and then it’s a long CD. 
---
I started a year ago, now im 60 and been raiding most of the last year, definetly not bored.
---
The only thing we proved here is that loot trading has no place in Classic.
---
Are you kidding me? LINKING PARK all the way... EVERY undead rogue pvp video has linkin park music
---
You can pass them around to other engineers and everyone can give it a go as a Druid if your rez is on cooldown.  Cables aren't soul bound and the cooldown is attached to the player, not the item.  Just an interesting interaction.
---
Lol I have had my Nostalrius characters for longer than Vanilla even existed. I started in 2015 and today 4 years laters I can still play on them to this day.
---
Your a warlock and you need to get up early to farm soul shards for your guild's Araithi Basin pvp day. But you forget to wake up early so once you you get to AB your GL tells you to go back and farm the damn shards.
---
First and foremost: actual Blizz-like server pop cap. I still enjoyed around the 4-5k, but when it starts to get to \~ 10k.. lessened feeling of community, more scumbags, way too much competition for quests and kills, too much ganking, visibility issues (stuff appearing only when in front of you). Hopefully we get to see the community feeling revived.
---
Druids absolutely get a lot of use out of Engineering in PvP. Check out [Azgaz's PvP videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EekNxwQ7izg) where he uses Engineering constantly whilst also shifting in and out of forms. 
---
PvE is a little different. If you're main tanking a dungeon or raid you're not going to shift out to get a benefit. However, the main thing you want from Engineering for dungeons/raids is goblin sapper charges, and since you're more likely to be an off-tank than main-tank for raids, and you can always use them on AoE pulls in dungeons then shift into bear, you'll find a use for them. 
---
Thinking the worst of everyone? Not even close. I do however have enough life experience to understand that plenty of people suck, and will take every advantage available to them at the expense of other people.
---
I cant fathom why you are so hell bent on defending a system that will let these people get an advantage by behaving in an antisocial manner. You are either too stupid to understand the ramifications of this system, or you are one of those who intend to take advantage of it.
---
Either way, loot trading was not a part of Vanilla, and thus is should not be part of Classic. It's actually not any more complicated than that.
---
What other professions offer any benefit in PvP or PvE? Thats the real issue. Even if the benefit of Engineering is relatively minor its still one of the few professions which have any impact. Often casters want tailoring as well, but most of the other professions dont really bring anything to the table except for the opportunity to make money. You can do that on another character.
---
Well that's 14 years ago for you man. Stuff like that wasn't nearly as common. 
---
MC is so easy that if you buff it a little bit that won't force players to min/max everything.
---
That game sucked ten glorious months of my life away.  I built up major agro in my spouse though so I had to go cold turkey.   I had cold shakes coming down from that adrenaline high. 
---
I obviously want to copy over my classic WoW character to the classic TBC servers. It's not as fun to not have your main character that you spent \~2 years on to progress further with, if you ask me.
---
I know some people prefer to re-level 1-70 on fresh servers but I don't support that idea when it comes to official servers.
---
Are you hitcapped?
---
Maybe don't call it "the final solution"
---
It's because of patch. On most private and on real vanilla a lot of this gear was delayed, itemization changed. So you want to look for a "diremaul" BIS list basically. It should be pretty accurate with what Classic will launch with.
---
What is this!? A screenshot for ANTS!? It needs to be at least.... 3 times bigger than this!
---
All great wow players are bald or balding. It must have been fake hair that fall off while punching the nab.
---
Possibly.
---
I will mention that both these lists are focusing on specifics to the private servers they pertain to taking into account how boss's defense and mechanics work too, where they both could be right in the proper context.
---
Don't take these lists as gospel, as Classic things will be a bit different -- and what will be available in stage 1 Classic compared to "MC / Ony" BiS lists in private server land will also vary.  
---
That would be because the ST questline is not out immediately with proper blizzlike progression, I believe it came out somewhere around BWL-1.8ish I'm not completely sure, anyway it wasn't out immediately on nostalrius the server you are reading the second guide for, so the poster obviously didn't include it. 
---
We don't know exactly how blizzard is going to do progressive stuff, there has definitely been talks about some things progressive like probably don't release naxx stuff immediately, but it's really just a question of how deep you go, and nostalrius went pretty deep. 
---
Unbreakable and Pat :) 
---
Zero interest to play TBC, its when my group all quit (about 15 of us).
---
So, pardon my French when I say Fuck TBC, I'd rather they do Vanilla + than go through each expansion.
---
Also, going through each expansion has a very real consequence of dividing up the player base into a too many sects that might cause some unforeseen server population issues.
---
You have alien hands
---
Engineering is pretty much mandatory if you care about being a decent player, not only for PvP but for PvE as well. Sapper charges, Teleporter: Gadgetzan, grenades to interrupt multiple raid mob/boss mechanics, battle chicken, reflectors, arcanite dragonling, rocket helm, MC cap, seaforium charges for tribute, arcane bombs for large scale pvp and the list goes on and on and on.
---
Whoa - do you know how much longer it takes to write that?!
---
Seriously though, it probably had to do with the generally accepted convention at the time of abbreviating most dungeons by 2 letters.
---
 On top of that running VC back in the day was a trek to get there as horde since there weren’t convenient flight paths and you didn’t get your mount until 40, so DM was just something that was done more frequently than VC so there wasn’t much confusion. 
---
It was probably the Cata revamp that really brought it up as VC vs DM. 
---
Yeh, I lost enjoy playing with people and intend to level through dungeons mainly with questing a little.
---
I read Prot is an awful way to level but think it's a bit exaggerated if I'm honest - but I know little about the class....
---
Hopefully they make the vanilla server into tbc servers. No reason to split the player base in two.
---
&gt;Its a Compaq s710.
---
My second ever monitor. Loved that thing. Was a hell of an upgrade from the original one I had. 
---
Don't forget "1337 rogues" with Blue screen white text killing afk or backpeddling players in BRM/Burning Steeps. 
---
&gt;It's when they tried to make a LFG system that was primitive and that Brack fully realized in WOTLK
---
How is that any worse than forcing 5000 players to spam the LFG channel. This will literally be a required addon in Classic most likely. Instead of frantically trying to read postings you can take your time reading them.
---
&gt;It's when the world died and wpvp died and the community died. 
---
This is objectively false. I spent literally 6 hours a day every day for almost the entirety of TBC doing world PvP. You couldn't go more than 25 feet without getting into a fight. 
---
&gt;Cross realm BG's was the end of vanilla and was probably done due to BG pvp gear being a lead in to Arena and destroyed the community even more
---
This was almost a requirement due to how bad the faction imbalance was getting on some servers. When you have a server that is 85% horde and 15% alliance, these things stop working.
---
&gt;It's when raid gear lost a ton of value because world pvp was dead and because you could get better pvp gear in a minigame in a fraction of the time.
---
This isn't true at all, in fact, most of the PvPers felt *forced* to do PvE to get the gear since a lot of the time it was itemized better. BiS PvP sets often included multiple PvE pieces, while the opposite was almost never true minus Guardian Druids (IIRC).
---
&gt;BG's became completely pointless and not fun due to healers having to be balanced around CC chains. You could literally win a BG with a resto druid and a warrior in resilience gear, laughing at how bad the pvp was. Things like stunherald were monumentally stupid. TBC was the worst balanced expansion in the history of WoW in PvP.
---
The balance wasn't perfect, but have you even played Vanilla? It is way worse, not even close actually. 
---
&gt;It's when real organic content was replaced by awful dailies.
---
I guess this is kind of a preference thing, I don't think dailies were *awful* until WotLK but you were never forced to do them in TBC - you could do all the same stuff you did in Vanilla to make money and get gear instead. 
---
&gt;PVE tryhards hijacked WoW and made it so time consuming that the game actually ruined peoples lives. Vanilla was never the hardcore game people try to make it out as when it comes to time consumption. TBC was. TBC ruined marriages and lives for very little reward. All you did was get a higher number on a dps meter/threat meter or heal meter in gear that didn't translate to other areas of the game (pvp).
---
I am not really sure what this means. They both were pretty time consuming. I guess TBC offered you more to do? Not really sure why people playing the game a different way has any effect on you or anyone else. The game got way more popular in TBC, people got way better at the game, and people cared way more about the game - therefor people played it more "hardcore."
---
Not everyone wants to go on into BC and wotlk, some would rather stay and enjoy vanilla, progress it till the end
---
I did that runs many times ;-) Still thats pretty uncommon for general horde playerbase.
---
Not 4/5's of the server being non-english.
---
Most of the current popular vanilla server is russian and chinese.  Makes getting groups or doing anything useful in AV a nightmare.
---
&gt;You do get threat from players restoring their mana from JoW
---
Pretty sure this is incorrect. Mana restored should only give threat per point of mana to the player who gained the mana. Having raid wide threat gains on a single player from a debuff would be insanely broken.
---
In game its still going to get like 150 fps :D
---
Dps druids can bomb when they powershift.
---
Anyway yeah engineering is amazing for PVP on all of the classes.
---
As for pve, it's not HUGE. It's still pretty good, but it's not typically mandatory. It's hard to properly use sappers while healing, and unless if you are a paladin, you probably won't get in range to sapper charge in a 40vs40. There's still quite a bit you do with it for PVE, but it's not nearly as useful as for dps or tanks.
---
So if you are a pve player that really wants to do real professions like enchanting and alchemy, then maybe you should look into healers :D
---
Ele shaman here.
---
Enh is trash, except in the rare case you have a elemental shaman with you where you can setup storm strike for them.
---
I never really sat down and thought about any of this, but I find myself agreeing with most of these points.
---
Such as? The only thing that I have seen lose relevance is the minigames that only really give cosmetics because people just don't do them anymore.
---
Played since launch Europe, always dm, seems to vary server to server
---
Threat gained from restoring mana should be personal. As in, if the hunter attack and gain mana through judgement of wisdom, that threat should be applied to the hunter, NOT to the Paladin that judged the seal.
---
WF is best for your rogue or warrior friends to wombo combo cloth to death.
---
Ever see a paladin cry? A warrior with WF is the gift that keeps on giving weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Would you mind sharing your Prot leveling build?
---
Boss defense and mechanics are probably not really going to change that much that a list like this would need change.
---
Anyway there's really no point at all using any of these spreadsheets or lists, because before classic comes out, we will have more information or even if we don't get info, people will find out faster than you'll hit 60, and the perfect gospel level prebis lists will be crafted. 
---
Flurry Axe with Fiery Blaze enchant  is best in slot for mana return. 1.5 speed, has the same proc Thrash blade does, and the Fiery Blaze enchant also triggers judgement of wisdom. If you want even more mana then put on a Shadow Oil on the axe as well since that also triggers JoW.
---
I guess if you have someone in the party who’s engineering is high enough to use them. I think you need to be somewhere around 150 if I remember correctly. If someone already leveled engineering that high they would most likely already have the cables themselves since they are not a very hard recipe to get.
---
I got banned on a pserver because some guy walked up to me and gave me 200 gold out the blue.
---
I can not even tell you how disgusting it felt to get permanently banned for RWT like that, with no appeal. 
---
For low gear pvp?
---
Back in the day my CRT monitor broke and I saw like 10 broken ones on a pallet at my school. Threw 3 of them in my trunk. Only 1 partially worked andthe green coloration burnt out. Played WoW all the time but I could never see my healthbar it always looked black.
---
Yes,
---
So these current patch based guides made in private servers are very good guides but will inevitably change come classic.
---
I got banned on a pserver because some guy walked up to me and gave me 200 gold out of the blue. What am I ganna do? Just not accept the trade?
---
I can not even tell you how disgusting it felt to get permanently banned for RWT like that, with no appeal.
---
Really turned me off of pservers after that.
---
So I am making a community with some IRL friends, but figured the more the better, so I'd post something here. I wouldn't mind making a guild if we got enough I suppose.
---
&lt;NA/Normal(PvE)&gt;
---
We plan to play Alliance, and we're CST/EST. It is more casual/social with light raiding. A lot more focused on leveling and dungeons and helping each other. Just wanna have a group of people that can be there for each other if someone wants to level togethr or needs help.
---
PM me if interested.
---
They could do a character copy where you can copy your character, all soulbound items and a limited amount of gold but with restrictions such as that you have be to level 60.
---
Warriors are tough to level but also have great parts of leveling.  The 30s are GREAT once you get whirlwind axe, and then at 40 you finally get your mount.  Can get instance groups easier than any class by knowing how to tank, and can get easy power spikes via new weapons or through the AH if you're desperate.  But yes, definitely a tough class to level. 
---
The problem is not that they dont have the data. They said they have a 1.12.1 server they can run with the client.
---
The real issue is that they are modifying the modern game to emulate Vanilla.  As we clearly saw in the Classic demo, this means they take the modern game and start removing and adding things until it behaves like 1.12.1 did. This means having to remake entire systems within the game from scratch such as Hunters having to train and feed their pets.
---
Inevitably this will lead to a lot of the underlying systems of the game being drastically different from the real game, which means not every quirk and gimmick of the old game will work the way it should in Classic.
---
It's because so many people started in TBC and still got the FUN leveling experience of Vanilla. A lot of people have great memories of TBC, but the actual expansion was bad. It's why it always fails on private servers (WOTLK is popular though). In addition the hardcore PVE crowd has a lot of people that never did real Sunwell. They are a small minority of the players but they want the notch in their belt and they were people that were often stuck in Kara or just learning. The problem is that they will never clear it. Blizzard will never re-release pre nerf content and do progressive talent patches so that accomplishment will never be real. It just ends up being boring and too easy, which is why get bored.
---
A lot of people also were mainly big on arena and that started in TBC. The problem is that the esport will no longer be there, 3 v 3 bracket will be dead and the 2 v 2 bracket is awful.
---
TBC is actually the rose tinted glasses expansion. It's what makes Brack's statement so hilarious. It's when he joined the WoW team.
---
You're beginning to see why people are complaining so much about BfA!! :(
---
Hi, /u/Synthex430
---
One of my favorite end zones in Vanilla.  
---
P.S.: Please consider this as self advertising, I am the author of this video.  
---
Thank you  
---
Shut up
---
It depends on the Class.
---
Warriors typically mix their T2 set with various offensive pieces to increase threat output while keeping at least the 5set bonus.
---
Hunters want to use their full T2. You also want at least one priest with 8/8 T2 for the bonus as well.
---
Druids also get a very good T2 set and it's not uncommon that they use most of it coupled with some additional offpieces ( Wild Growth Shoulders, Pure Though, Emp Legs, Corehound Belt)
---
Other classes again have their sets more tailored towards PvP, such as Paladins or Warlocks.
---
It was VC on both realms I played on (US). I was Horde though so that might have something to do with it. 
---
Pretty much this. You can go 3set for the extra aura range on some boss encounters and trash, otherwise you are better off wearing a mix of preraid and offpieces.
---
To be frank, I just don't like the PServer playerbase mentality. The community, the economy, the players -- it's all so fragile and rushed.
---
From my personal experiences, the majority of people playing on PServers now are, understandably, just what you'd expect. They've done it before -- maybe dozens of times. They know the ins and outs of the game and they're not interested in leveling again (and justifiably so). They speed through the leveling process and ignore littler things like grinding rep or cosmetics, exploring, and grouping up just for the hell of it. 
---
What bothers me the most is the lack of connection to a server or even your character -- they're entirely disposable if something better comes along. Players quit without a second thought. People you were racing to 60 just stop logging in one day, your friendslist slowly becomes grey, and your guild gets quiet. The few larger guilds that survive long term are constantly recruiting to keep a raid core and teeter on disbanding overnight in favor of FRESH. 
---
I know that classic can't last forever, but I hope that it can revitalize the player base with new blood and give long time players a sense of semi-permanence. I want to make friends (and enemies) that last years, not months. 
---
Picture or fake.
---
Ah so Ebon Mask is actually the better option then? Assume you have hit cap I guess. 
---
By that logic, I should be able to roll on all items. Vendoring or disenchanting them also allows me to improve my gear.
---
Good point. I suppose the list is balanced around ensuring hit cap is reached for yellow. 
---
Mr Fancypants Showoff here getting 45 fps.
---
Drama between the host and GM's or whatever that could end up with the entire server shutting down, GM's giving items and/or gold to friends or people that pay them real money, the threat of having Blizzard shutting down your server that you spent months on, performance (this is a maybe considering retail WoW can't even handle a 40man raid without lagging to hell, we will see though since it feels like they have a plan) and hopefully making an even better vanilla experience for the players by fixing things that not even private servers did/thought of (which the recent CM blue post talked about).
---
That's probably it.
---
I don't want them to change anything, at least at release, but I do want additional content that was planned but never finished similar to Old School Rune Scape.
---
I want the same 1.12 experience at launch for several months at least. Some time down the track it would be cool to see the Dragon Isles or Dalaran. No new level cap. No simplification. No dungeon finder etc. 
---
Maybe this makes me a heretic, but part of my vanilla experience was new content. There was no AQ, ZG, DM, NAXX etc when I started playing, there were no battlegrounds, but they came in time and it was always exciting when new content came. 
---
Plus all the forum post screen caps and everything else. 
---
Nobody's suggesting replacing classic. The question is do you give Classic players an option to move their characters over to TBC, maybe do a 1-time copy of their characters over to TBC, or do you just force everybody to reroll from lvl 1 on TBC:Classic servers.
---
Do you not see the irony in " Nobody owes you their time to gear you up" ? That is EXACTLY what loot res runs are.
---
Someone needs other players to come complete the dungeon (If you can solo it, then by all means - but so long as you are advertising in LFG, then you apparently need assistance), they need other players time and effort, their heals / dps / tanking - but refuse to give them an equal shot at items. 
---
It's literally telling people to spent their time to gear you up.
---
UD Rogue ofc, beginning with a slow-walk
---
It's sort of the final right, to leave the game fully your character must also perish. This way there is nothing to return to.
---
I do think 18ap is better than 1 hit yes(or in this case 36ap&gt;2hit), but I seriously have my doubts about the shadowpanther sheet. It values 1 crit at 20ap, and 1 hit at 15, which is completely off from my experience. 
---
No expansion was as good as vanilla. Throughout them all, I always wished to return to Azeroth.
---
I gave my stuff away and deleted my characters in 2010 instead of just unsubscribing because, even with my physical authenticator, Chinese hackers got into my account and tried botting my character.  I learned this from my friends who still played and from evidence once I logged back on with 10 days free sub time from a GM.  All my items were in my mailbox thanks to the nice GM.
---
Anyway, I think this is a common issue and people like myself would rather put the character to rest than have her desecrated.
---
Either copy or fresh. Definitely don't lose vanilla, and personally I wouldn't do a permanent move that deleted my char from vanilla.
---
Copy would most closely mimic how it was originally (i.e. most people starting at 60), and personally I'd like to play through to wotlk again, on one character (not have to redo rep grinds etc)
---
But copies potentially harsh for people with no interest in vanilla who want to start with TBC. 
---
Perhaps some realms with copies and some totally clean realms?
---
It's right in the title? :)
---
Personally I'd prefer copying my characters over but I can see the value in a completely separate server too.
---
Hunter or Mage. Simple and effective, not hard to gear. Both fun classes you won’t get bored with
---
Thanks!
---
This was in 2004, definitely VC on khadgar
---
Yeh I know :p but tbh warriors need a team in pvp
---
VC if you played in 2004, DM if you're a 2005+ scrub! 
---
That's a real cool story. You were basically color-blind while gaming on that.
---
Needs more Down with the sickness
---
Blizzcon panel or water cooler update introduced loot trading as a ”win win”. Which is how they tried to sell it.
---
We are actually not sure that is the case. It wasn't that easy during vanilla, and pservers aren't a completely reliable judge of how MC will be during classic. 
---
A tste of your own medicine, Mr. Freud!!
---
I can't take a picture right now but it is the HP Pavilion w1907.
---
Correct gnomish engineering icons:p
---
You are the princess?
---
Undead rogue ganking montage meanwhile Drowning Pool or any other oldschool YouTube music playing in the background.
---
I'm going to rewatch most of these videos before Classic to get me hyped even more.
---
Maybe easier as in having a smaller toolbox yeah, but they are very hard to gear and you have to be super careful with movement. They are easy offtanks, but maintanking with a druid is not easy imo.
---
The only way to do this is to make diffrent servers. One no changes and one with changes. Otherwise the uproar would be out of this world
---
Thanks for sharing. Kind of mixed feelings, both nostalgic and sad, since I was also in a very similar situation. My first main was a Tauren Warrior on EU Executus right from launch. As with anyone else, I 'quit' multiple times but the 'real one' was when I properly deleted my main during WOTLK. I had some cool gear and a full Glad set + merciless 2H sword from TBC. I deleted all that manually, then the character.
---
Later on  I came back and Blizz could not manage to retrieve the items manually deleted, so they gave me some one of a kind set of green gear, lol.
---
Anyway, I think this Summer lots of people including you and me will have the second chance of playing through this glorious world once more.
---
I plan on running an alliance rogue. I was thinking on running human but is the +5 on swords good for pvp as well? I plan on doing 60% pvp 40% pve. 
---
Not yet!  I'm also stuck between lock and mage, but with shaman added in. 
---
Shaman is probably slightly ahead of the others at the moment because Tauren shaman is my favorite class fantasy and my original main. But the ease of leveling and roles end game for warlock/mage are very attractive to me. 
---
There are so many mages out there though, they'll be overpopulated. Maybe I'll pick warlock as a compromise.  My only issue with them are the shards...bleh. 
---
Not just bombs but sappers are bae amazing for a warrior for snap threat, as well as certain bosses like Vicidious in AQ40 you can cheese with like 20+ sappers and make him only have one glob phase.
---
Same here, but I’m thinking about rolling a shaman just because I want to raid and I don’t know if I’ll be able to compete with the more dedicated warriors for a dps spot.  
---
Delete character, idiot player.
---
I believe shadowpanther was built during original wow.
---
While, Oto is built around private servers.
---
nope
---
even then, 2 ele shamans would still be better
---
Yeah, same reason you don't keep your cigarettes when you quit smoking.
---
Absolutely every single time this has been done on private servers, the remaining Vanilla server died immediately upon TBC release.
---
The population absolutely collapses.
---
This has happened every single time. A pserver that will not be named is undergoing this process right this moment and the same thing is happening, again.
---
How do people think TBC won't kill Vanilla again when it has in literally every single instance it was ever released?
---
:) yes I did an interview with C2C late last year and will do another one in the next few weeks
---
I too deleted my character and unsubbed during Wrath. The signs were there and I no longer enjoyed the game. Imo wotlk was a trash expansion, perhaps not as bad as the ones after it but still
---
I'm looking forward to raid bosses not having slightly incorrect resistance values.
---
You can go 20/31/0 or 30/21/0 and effectively heal, tank and farm (better with 31 in prot).
---
If you really want to pvp you could also go 25/26/0 and still do okay in all the above.
---
You use engineering in PvE for sapper charge and bombs.
---
This is why I think I'm going to try and wait until the second round of servers is opened up. I want to dodge the private server players, I want to dodge the streamers. I think I'll get a much better classic experience if I'm on a server where people haven't done it all so many times. 
---
&gt;And even if you managed to do the Gnomeregan run before the instance reset limitation timer (12 minutes - I doubt that considering you can't stealth past mobs), getting 20 pummelers would take on average 10 hours.
---
May I ask why you dont think a stealthclass can stealth past two packs of level 30 non elite gnomes? The boss that drop the pummeler is just inside the back entrance of the instance. You can easily do the dungeon 5 times per hour which on average yield you 2.5 pummelers.
---
Anyway, a class consumables being hard to farm is not really an argument against their viability. It just means whoever do decide to play that class have to be willing to put in the extra effort to compete.
---
I aim for this first,  
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxzZVhtI0zEo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxzZVhtI0zEo)  
---
Holy tree first then move into prot.  
---
Key talents are Spiritual Focus so you can heal whilst taking hit. Otherwise it falls flat on its face. I got reckoning and 1h for extra dmg and lvling speed  
---
Then finish off like this  
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxEuZVhtI0zEo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxEuZVhtI0zEo)  
---
Extra healing for those aoe pulls and tanking dungeons. I put the final 5 in improved SoR, but they could go in illumination, 5 in the ret tree for mana efficiency etc. I find this a good all round build for 60 for tanking 5mans and healing in pvp   
---
Master's Degree in Fungineering
---
I agree
---
Crying. 
---
In terms of efficiency for time spent, it's not a bad idea. However, this also means you'll be hitting max level long after most people (of the ones who actually will make it to max level) who started at launch do. I think if you're getting burnt out grind away on one class, it's a solid idea to switch to an alt for a bit. But I for one am going to try and get to max level as fast as I can, because I know for sure it's not going to be as fast as most people and I don't want to fall too far behind. That's just me though, and even though leveling is more fun in vanilla, for me the endgame is the goal.
---
Truth, sadly.
---
I don't think that'll be too big of a problem though I agree and will re-roll if a prominent streamer is identified on my server. With dozens of servers opening at once, I'm sure there will be a good spread of PServer immigrants, first timers, retail players, and OG vanilla vets.
---
Now you are just being difficult for the sake of not having to argue against what Im saying. The same logic obviously do not apply to BoP items as their value is inherently not tied to the monetary value of the shard they disenchant into.
---
A BoE that can be directly traded into 300g on the Auction House however very much do have the exact same value for every member of the group. Your error is thinking of the BoE in terms of how much stats they have when you should think of it in terms of worth. A stockade pauldrons dropping is NOT the Warrior prebis tank shoulders. What they are is 300 gold that dropped that the party get to roll for.
---
It makes absolutely no sense to say that just because I play a warrior, I am entitled to 300g over the rest of the party who also need to get items of similar monetary value (such as Bloodvine or Devilsaur set).
---
Aww. Need a hug? You can hug one of our ferrets if you like!

As an Australian who played with Canadians role playing as Americans who role played as Australians, I can confirm I had only seen it referred to as MD......
---
Its 100% going to be a Tuesday.
---
Planning to level a warlock/mage combo. Tailoring/Enchanting on one (pve, probably lock) and mining/engineering on other for PvP. I was an alch in vanilla, it's hard to give that one up! Might give up Enchanting and do tailoring/herbalism on the lock, and feed herbs to my mage who I can drop mining on for Alch once Engineering is sufficiently levelled.. hard to gauge what I want to do profession-wise!
---
Again, no idea what point you’re trying to make. Arguing that your made version of WoW also exists in the form of downvoted reddit comments doesn’t make it any more factual. 
---
You have yet to show any proof that class tuning has to happen in order to allow adjustments to the raids. 
---
Not sure why you’d call anyone a half wit, with all of that in mind. But baseless insults are common from people that can’t win an argument based on facts. So.....
---
Backups existed well before 14 years ago but someone replied that they do have a server. Makes sense. 14 years ago isn't even that long ago gaming wise.
---
Chief Tyrol?
---
Dalarna at its proper position would be cool. Just remove the barrier and let us enter!
---
Ah, I think we are talking at cross purposes. Thanks for clarifying. 
---
I never meant that vanilla is different from private servers in gameplay - yes there is a lot of guesswork on tuning and the actual values of a lot of things (and Blizz confirmed that the Nost guys had the actual scripting for Onyxia wrong). I just meant that people did communicate in vanilla, if they don't communicate in private servers, then they aren't the same.
---
The reasons for the communication are mostly as you have stated: game is new, lack of knowledge, etc. 
---
What I think is going to be underestimated is the people playing classic. A lot of people will be coming back to play who have not played for 10 years (most of my friends) and people who have never played WoW (my girl) and people who never played vanilla but play retail - all manner of people really.
---
These people are very different from those that play on private servers. Until a year ago I never even knew private servers were a thing. The people who play on them are by their very existence, more invested in the game and have been playing more than many of the people coming back. I still won't play on a private server because of a few reasons, but mainly because I want my return to vanilla to feel as fresh as possible, and I don't want to go and do all of these things and see them all on a private server first.
---
I don't have an impression that all private servers players are hardcore, but many are (as are many people who haven't played on one). What I do think, though, is that private server players will, just by the very nature of having played there, have more knowledge than many (most?) of the people who will be playing classic. There will be a lot of people, many of whom I intend to play with, that haven't been in these instances before and will definitely need some communication. I made a lot of friends in vanilla because of this communication that occurred in instances, and the open world. No one can say that people didn't communicate in vanilla - a run of any instance (including ragefire chasm) was full of people talking to each other. My memory isn't superlative, but I don't think I can remember a single dungeon run that was silent like retail play has been for the past 3 expansions.
---
WoW in itself isn't very hard. Last time i played retail (Legion) I ran a bunch of instances and I have no idea what was even happening. I could not tell you a single name of an instance, what happened in them, who the bosses or mobs were, what the gear was, what the mechanics were, where the instance even was. What I can say is that not one person said one word, ever, and not one person died. It was so simple and so easy that I lost interest in the first few weeks (this was just LFG, not speed runs or Mythic or whatever those were called).
---
I just think that a lot of people will be surprised when classic is released, and yes I think some private server players will be as well. 
---
Thanks for taking the time to post the way you do, it's refreshing to be able to have a proper discussion.
---
Not at all, I think a vast majority are in favor of more content once naxx has been finished. The question is only, when and what kind of content
---
Wat
---
Cattywampus
---
Reading all the threads in this sub, mostly.  I'm playing around with Overwatch, Apex, Red Dead 2, but I'm just so excited for Classic none of those other games are really doing it for me right now.
---
LOL, I am glad you enjoyed it.
---
Macros are up in the air. Vanilla had some crazy scripting like if statements and loops allowed, not to mention super macro. Legion certainly didn’t have any scripting in macros and that is what 2019 classic is forked from. I wonder how in depth they will try to emulate vanilla macros.
---
Hunter or Warlock no question about it. 
---
Disturbed, duh. Though this was back before Disturbed was Bro Rock, when they were still Nu Metal/goth Alt Metal.
---
Sorry, what edge does SMruin have over Nightflag regarding some of these? The 10% more DC damage = 10% more healing, ok I get that. But corruption and shadowburn are the same for both minus some damage on Nightflag, tho the latter would have higher dmg on immolate, and an extra instant button with conflag on those you do immolate
---
&gt;May I ask why you dont think a stealthclass can stealth past two packs of level 30 non elite gnomes?
---
We're talking about paladin though, not a stealth class.
---
&gt;Anyway, a class consumables being hard to farm is not really an argument against their viability. It just means whoever do decide to play that class have to be willing to put in the extra effort to compete.
---
Ten hours before every raid and that's assuming insane clear times and no wipes. Spending at least 20 hours a week farming and extra consumable is not feasible.
---
Sculpting sounds legit! It's always nice to do things IRL not just jump between different games. Ive been sort of off/on playing and switching between Netherwing (TBC private server) and Northdale. Basically just playing enough to satisfy my desire for play pre-cata WoW but not anywhere near enough to burn me out before Classic servers.
---
The wait is real.
---
Leveling dungeons are not so mechanically intensive that you need to be Prot to tank them  --  that's just overkill.  Your time to 60 will be a lot more efficient going Arms or Fury so that you aren't useless when it comes to killing mobs solo.  You will still be able to tank dungeons just fine by swapping into Defensive Stance and tossing on a shield.
---
This is awesome! Thanks for the info.
---
So, you'd go Ret to 40, then switch to Prot for 40 - 60?
---
Amazing personal story! I love this.
---
Playing though pillars of eternity again. And maybe divinity again after.
---
Geared character one shotting fresh 60s, displaying insane l33t skillz pwning newbs
---
Wrath was when they introduced LFR. 
---
I think that was their biggest mistake. It must have increased the subscriber numbers temporarily, but the long term outcome was disastrous.
---
I bought myself a Nintendo Switch and am enjoying the hell out of it!
---
How is Red Dead 2? I sadly do not have a console, but I have heard good things outside of the online.
---
iirc it doesnt work in pvp,
---
dwarf or gnome is better in pvp
---
maybe use their surname - Gigmagear or something.
---
I have only played Divinity: OS1, and gotten like half way through the second. How is PoE? From what i've seen there's lots and LOTS of text to get through.
---
Would you come back now, if you could restore all your chars and gear easily? 
---
Engineering is the best profession for any race, any combo, any type of server and any type of gameplay. That's Vanilla balance for you! 
---
Oh cool! What games have you enjoyed the most so far?
---
Anti Change crowd same people who don’t vax their kids..
---
When the day comes that they need more levels, they can make it a 16bit int or 32 if they want to, just like they did with the gold cap.
---
Until then it is unnecessary and wastes performance and storage for no benefit.
---
why are people so melodramatic over a video game lol 
---
Check out /r/warcraftlore if you’re into that!
---
I read many of these novels and the free short stories myself, they’re fun.
---
I started it yesterday afternoon and played quite a bit, I'm maybe ~10 hours in to it or so.  I'm enjoying it so far and trying to have fun with the various sidequests, hunting, etc rather than blaze through the story.  So far I get the sense that there will usually be pretty obvious "main story" missions to drive through to the endgame.  But they're given from different characters, so it's sort of a fun diverse approach to getting to know all the gang members.
---
No real interest from me on the online play, so can't comment on that!
---
A regular int for levels, which shouldn't only be positive, makes no sense at all. So unsigned is better. And 8bit was chosen as that is more than they needed, even now.
---
*"Ten hours before every raid and that's assuming insane clear times and no wipes. Spending at least 20 hours a week farming and extra consumable is not feasible."*
---
you must not play on any private servers lol
---
We should delete the idea of websites. But keep the internet infrastructure as is.
---
So many mysteries that would spread by word of mouth and no way to look everything up in massive databases!
---
Understandable, I never really care for the online in those styles of games too. I struggle with open world games though. Sometimes there's just TOO MUCH mundane stuff. 
---
Well, actually I started to dive into the warcraft world chronologically and wow classic is actually the next big step.
---
I read all the novels until including arthas. Right now I am playing warcraft 3 story and should be finished with the frozen throne in some weeks. The next step would be wow classic. :) I really can't wait, I seek to play it real slow and lore wise. 
---
I hear that.  It's heresy to say this on reddit, but I just *could not* get in to the Witcher 3.  I have no legitimate criticism of the game... it just didn't click with me, for whatever reason.
---
1. It's a BiS gear/setup test like Salad Bakers' naxx speed run u tool
---
2. GOOD raiders use Crystal/Sapper charges before Naxx on every 1min cd
---
3. Salad Bakers used buffs that are only available once a year...
---
4. Wrath of Cenarius procs off of EVERYTHING: Periodics
---
* **Current:** Proc once on initial cast
---
* **Correct:** Most likely proc once on initial cast
---
&gt;it can proc on any DoTs initial cast, but not on DoT ticks.  
---

---
&gt;this includes DoT's(one from the debuff landing but not from the ticks)

&gt;The ring has not yet proced of a DOT tick. Being an afflcition warlock I think I can say that it will not proc of a DOT tick, even COA.  
---

---
### Channeled Direct
---
* **Current:** Proc on each tick but not on initial cast
---
* **Correct:** Proc on each tick, unsure if initial cast should
---
&gt;yes on individual ticks.. meaning ive had it proc on the third missile and so on.  
---

---
### AoE Direct
---
* **Current:** Procs once on initial cast, even if no targets are hit. Procs once again on spell hit, regardless of how many targets are hit.
---
* **Correct:** Shouldn't proc on initial cast. Most likely should proc on every target.
---
&gt;it does proc often off aoes.. just about every other iae or blastwave of multiple targets..  
---
### AoE Channeled
---
* **Current:** Procs once on initial cast, even if no targets are hit. Procs again on every damage dealt.
---
* **Correct:** Shouldn't proc on initial cast. Unsure if it should proc on all damage dealt or only once per target.
---
&gt;procs A TON when I use AE on the trash mobs  
---
multiple proc chance while AoE'ing sevral targets  
---
&gt;\-it rocks for aoe'ing... the more targets you aoe, the more proc you'll see.  
---
1. Salad Bakers used BOTH Rallying Cry + Warchief's Blessing
---
2. Watch the other videos where he uses fast 1handed weapons with spell dmg offhand
---
3. Feral Druids farm and use multiple Crowd Pummelers per raid meaning that they farm Gnomer every week to fill their bags full of pummelers. I even sent your response to Holyfrog/Detectable who raids as Feral and this was his reponse to your stupidity: DetectableToday at 1:46 PM "And even if you managed to do the Gnomeregan run before the instance reset limitation timer" What an idiot Takes me literally 2min to get to the boss Then 20 seconds to kill him And another 2min to go back out and reset
---
4. It ain't my video genius - these were done by EXODIA
---
5. Your argument is utterly useless as to determining how much rets (or FERALS for that matter) actually consistently do in raids.

Weapon skill only helps if the target is higher level than you, so at 60, it does nothing in PvP.
---
I prefer Gnome myself.

I've heard it once or twice before because people are worried about population split. And with it being what happened in real life so it's most blizzlike.
---
I'd like them to do a poll down the track that needs 75% minimum agreement for post naxx content. I for one am in favour and even the staunch no changes crowd will likely change their mind once they've consumed the content.

Nothing against chinese people, but its hard to communicate, and there are so many

Downvotes to the right. That i, +1, +2, +3, left, -1, -2, -3, right. +3 and -3 are welp voters.
---
Same. I know people love it but I just couldn't get into it. The combat I think was the biggest put off for me as I'm used to more dark souls-esque combat. I've heard it's changed compared to what it was at release but I haven't felt the want to go back and try.
---
Youre going to fight a few thousand mobs while leveling, as Prot with a 1h/shield, youll probably take twice as long per mob and maybe even a little longer passed level 40. If you only plan on doing dungeons, it wont make a big difference, but youll probably do most dungeons 15+ times and, for me, id get tired of that pretty fast.
---
I hope you don't burn yourself out!
---
Unpopular on this subreddit, but I'm playing retail wow while waiting.  The game is fun to play for a bit.  I get on my warrior and tank some M+ or some normal raids and try to be the change I wish to see in the game.  I help people and treat them as if my social interactions mattered in the game.  I really enjoy tanking and recently I've been playing a holy priest too and I'm having fun trying to do the M+ mechanics from a different perspective.  I'm trying not to play it too much, so I don't burn out on it again so I'm playing some apex legends on the side to change things up.
---
Breath of the Wild is awesome, of course. Splatoon 2 is a fun competitive shooter that I can still get into now that I am a bit older. Doom is a blast, I tried playing it on my aging gaming PC a year or two ago and it wouldn't run, and the switch handles it beautifully. I played through Firewatch for the first time on my Switch and loved it. I am trying to get good at Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, but I still suck. And I had some fun inviting a friend over to play Mario Kart and Lovers in a Dangerous Sacetime the other night.
---
This system is reinvigorating my love of gaming. Before I got it, WoW private servers were really all that interested me, and I was getting burnt out with that. No other PC games were really calling to me.
---
Math, preparing for world record 1-60 Paladin speedrun.

Joana has the WR for hunter, and plans to beat his own WR by ~20 hours. I'll be the fastest Paladin.
---
And cause math and theorycrafting is fun.
---
Nothing is a must, but Westfall is an easier leveling zone with a lot less running time and a long lead-in to the main VC quest, as well as lead-ins to RRM and Duskwood. Youll have a fine time in Darkshore if you choose to go there
---
I couldn't even get to the end of the training mission in Witcher 3 (I think you had to chase a boy through the streets or something like that? Its been a minute but it was literally the mission teach you how to do the movement).  The movement style and controls were not intuitive at all and I was getting motion sick.  I returned the game even though I only paid like 10 dollars for it during a sale.
---
Monster Hunter World with my friends.
---
The problem you see is not that you can't/won't keep your characters, the problem is that you may not. I don't know how it works on pservers, but your current one can get a cease and desist order right now.
---
To expand, some functions in vanilla were really shit and you had to hack your way around multiple function calls and make inofficial libraries for certain things, for example there was no way to show spell icons. You had to have a third party library which was basically just a key/value pair for spellname and spellicon. The path to spell icons was added at some point to the Api, so this third party library was made redundant.
---
Also, some functions in Legion/bfa I assume are going to be disabled in classic, so something of a middleground is what we can assume.

Got a love it when almost no one actually reads your question and responds anyway. 
---
Theres very few abilities youll want to leave and generally, once youre 60 youll want all of them. Theres few exceptions, like Frost Nova, but hey, more damage is more damage. There a lot of really bad healers out there that dont buy new ranks of their Rez spell, though I always found it a good reason to dock them DKP. Dont be one of those people.
---
monkaW they're trying to split us apart
---
Definitely gnomes, the smaller Target is actually relevant especially when restealthing with vanish and the like, or physically hiding to get out of combat

Playing on a Pserver trying to figure out what to play. Leaning Troll Shaman this week. 
---
Ahhh man I had an enchancement shaman too during BC and a holy priest. How dope where the tier sets during BC as well for those classes or all of them for that matter! All suited each class so well!
---
Going to waterproof your pc and play while in the pool? ;P
---
How is Oxygen Not Included? Is it still on EA? Had my eye on it but been waiting for it to fully release.
---
Troll Shaman is what I am considering playing for a raiding main if I join a guild! Need more windfury totems!
---
What are you studying?

Playing vanilla on private server... trying to figure out what class I’m going to play when classic launches.  I’ve rerolled like 7 times already.

Waiting for that game to come back on sale so I can grab it! Thought it'll probably not go on sale again until Classic is already out haha!
---
Good luck! I will be keeping an eye out on the reddit on release to see if you get it :)
---
Of course :D
---
RPing on retail. Otherwise I'm just playing games that are on my list as when Classic is out, I won't be playing any other games for a while! That list includes Monster Hunter World, the Kingdom Hearts series and Breath of the Wild.
---
, he said, from an online forum dedicated to discussing the 10-years-later rebirth of said video game.
---
I enjoy things pre-Legion in retail, but not Legion or BFA. The biggest reason I struggle to play retail right now is because it's lonely af. I've tried joining guilds but it's pretty much raid and log off. No social or anything. Most of my friends have left or started acting the same so I ended up removing them off my friend's list.
---
I would love to level a non-loomed character and try and max as many reps as I can before classic, and farm mounts etc but... it's just so lonely! Nothing devotimates me more than having nobody to chat to or occasionally do things with (that aren't end game grinds!)
---
Struggling. Coping, but mostly struggling.
---
Very enjoyable &lt;3
---
I have a switch and also played through Mario Odyssey/ It was my first ever Mario game and was very fun! Also got about half way through Octopath traveller before I moved house. I like to sit on a comfy sofa and play but where I am living now we don't have one and can't afford to buy one, especially not just so I can play on the switch! My PC chair is comfy but... it's just not the same!
---
rogue uses evastion and then the enhancer can go afk. vs mage / lok you will die if you dont get a lucky wf proc and without nature's swiftness you die most of the time.
---
it's still fun though. ( i am playing shaman, elemental 99% of the time, and it's better in every situation. ofc you get the ocasional double-windfury-crit procs, it's an amazing feeling but it's rare)
---
In WotlK they moved it to Northrend. It wasn't there before \^\^
---
I can lend you a hand to help!
---
I honestly can't get myself to stop viewing and talking on reddit + official Classic forums. It's just the same crap day in and day out but I do it every day.  
---
Soon I will be returning to my in-game prep duties before Classic and hopefully posting less on here.  
---
Clearly going to play a druid I see ;P
---
&gt; world record 1-60 Paladin speedrun.
---
So you think you can beat the current 28 day record? Brave man.
---
I know how that feels, and I am in a similar boat myself, partly due to my current health issues. It's for that reason I have decided to try and teach myself some clay sculpting. I turn off my pc for an hour or 2 (longer if I get invested) and have a go. The clay I use doesn't dry out in the air so when I'm done I can just squash my creation down and try again next time if I am not happy with it, or I was just testing things.
---
Cheater obviously.  
---
bottombtch
---
Haha! What level do you get to when you reroll? I've picked mine because I want to be useful in group environments, hence resto shaman. Being a healer and bring very useful utility is the kind of role I enjoy.
---
So at release no mara/DM things like that? 
---
I've always enjoyed watching RP on servers, but have never joined in. I will admit, I miss the days where people would RP in /say. Now everyone just does it in party or whisper so I can't sit and watch it unfold anymore :&lt;
---
1. Hunter and Warrior (tanks) use all their T1 and T2. Priests and Rogues use most of their T1 and then all their T2. Druid uses most of their T2. Mage and Warlock use some of their T2. Shaman use the 3 piece bonus on T1 sometimes. Paladin will use T2 to AoE tank assuming your guild doesnt just use Warriors for it. Theres very few pieces of T2.5 that are good for any  of the classes in PvE, with the exception that Rogue set is very good. T3 is BiS PvE for all classes, except DPS warriors.
---
2. Part of the first question
---
3. Paladin, Shaman, Hunter, Rogue and Priest T1 are great PvP sets. The other T1 sets are pretty decent. All the full T2 sets, T2.5 and T3 are great PvP sets.
---
You are every time here :)  
---
Thank you &lt;3  
---
are you just gonna keep ranting about how TBC is the spawn of satan in every TBC/WOTLK thread lol? tbc servers have historically gone badly because they're never as properly scripted and developed as the vanilla/wotlk cores, and yet. people keep playing them. every time there's a faint glimmer of a good tbc server so many people come out of the woodwork to play this game that's apparently the worst thing since unsliced bread and you know it
---
ah yes, i want my pristine nochanges vanilla servers and i'll ALLOW you to have your tbc/wotlk servers, as long as they're changed to suit me personally
---
One thing I need is a comfier sofa! After purchasing my Switch I went out and bought a 49" 1080p TV, a 2.1 soundbar and a TV stand. The sofa I have is the cheapest one they sell at a Ikea and its essentially a padded brick. Definitely the weak point in my new entertainment center!
---
All the things I listed get 10% more damage and can be done while running. I don't like how static immolate makes you.
---
Then you input password and join position 1264 in the queue (132 minute wait).
---
"We" know all the best comps, gear, strats? We? The people on this subreddit? The people playing on private servers? The very small percentage of people who read guides and watch videos and have been doing for years and years?
---
You realise that these people, and I include myself seeing that I am here on this subreddit, are in NO way representative of the people that will be playing classic. The majority of people will not have read every guide on levelling and professions and read every boss strat.
---
I don't care if there are some guilds that clear MC and BWL and AQ within hours of them being released. This might be 1 in 100, the rest of us will be muddling along, enjoying questing and exploring and instances and then bumble into a raid and spend a week or two clearing, because people are in greens and no one even knows what the BiS pre-raid pieces are, let alone where to farm them.
---
And you know what, this will be perfectly fine for us. We'll laugh our asses off when we wipe because someone did something stupid. And we'll feel like we felt in vanilla.
---
The only people ruining the experience will be the people who are treating it like a job and trying to "beat" the game. And they aren't ruining it for the rest of us, just for themselves. They might not see it that way, and they may have different goals, but if they are looking forward to a vanilla experience, they won't be getting it, because they have researched and theorycrafted the hell out of a game. 
---
And for what? 
---
I mean if you are having fun then do you... but leveling as prot will be a lot slower than if you go dps and tank as dps with a sword and shield until you are high enough to make the swap.
---

---
ooc razzing was dumb, don't be an idiot
---
Private servers illuminate what has gone wrong with this game from the community side.
---
Everyone wants to be optimal, everyone is acting as if the *game* is some sort of job, where they stand in a assembly line and are suppose to perform their tasks perfectly, spec "correctly*, get the bis pre raid etc. It saps the fun and randomness out of the game.
---
..Its suppose to be an adventure, the end game in Classic was small portion of it, not the defining thing. If you are solely focused on end game min-max then Retail might be the game for you, since that is all it is about.
---
Its why i am against new content or "hardmodes" of raids. Because eventually the min-max/optimal/GOGOOGOGOG players will get bored and leave. The game is at its best when you are randomly leveling and you meet weird people along the way, get to know them and do stuff together. You come for the Elves and Orcs but you stay for the people.
---
I don’t think paly is that slow, it can’t be slower than rogue/ warrior can it? It’s just boring.
---
Haha! Hit me up when you get one and I'll come bring my switch too!
---
Your videos mean a lot to me man. Thank you!
---
Retro wow and make a 60 of each class and kit out in blues. See which one you keep going back to play.

Hunters all pick a few adds, aimed shot into multi/scatter and grenade, drag them to domo and FD.
---
Because that's with full BiS gear and full buffs and that
---
* No memespec player is going to get BiS items over the actual decent specs
---
* No memespec player is going to be a guild that's serious and good enough that they can clear Naxx fast enough that they don't lose their buffs/without losing their buffs.
---
* 99.9% of memespec players won't even get to Naxx let alone clear it.
---
The "1k dps" is in a vacuum, with every single buff in the game and without taking into account any mechanic/movement as well as the boss having 0 armor/resistances. That flows out the window when people don't have every single buff/consumeable in actual raids (outside of the 1-2 guilds that speedrun Naxx, which obviously won't bring suboptimal specs since they're speedrunning) and when you're not raiding in optimal conditions.
---
In theory, every single spec can hit over 1k dps. In practice, even 15/15 guilds won't get 1k+ dps on most fights.
---
Heck yeah! You can come kick my ass at Smash Bros!
---
Pat is an awesome dude but the video looking at all the high warlord gear with weather effects in Badlands or wherever it was fits the title perfectly. It was also super awesome at the time.
---
when i played back on khaz'goroth, people did say VC, because even though you think people would understand that dm = deadmines and dm/n/w/e = dire maul, you would STILL get questions asking, even though they can check level etc, "is this for dire maul or dead mines?".
---
I was gonna level on a p server but currently still cant make up my mind on what I'm gonna roll class/race/faction wise 😪 Was feeling nelf druid but idk.
---
While I agree with you semantically that people who freak out when you call Deadmines "DM" without taking two seconds to think of contextual clues (like what level is the person asking for groups?) are messed up in the head...
---
...was it really necessary to create another thread about this topic?  All it's going to do is just rub people the wrong way who disagree.  
---
I've never played so I doubt that would be the case haha. Always wanted to try though! I'd want to be a Bayonetta main cos she's dope af xD
---
I was on Alleria too!!
---
I played the heck out of Smash on the N64 back in the day, Captain Falcon was my main. Could kick all my friends butts except for this one kid who played Kirby. He and I were a good even match and boy did we have some epic battles. 
---
That was 20 years ago though, now I am awful at the game!
---
Well it's always good to test different classes and roles out if you can't decide. Write a little list of what role you would like to fulfil in the game. I.e. Be useful in group content outside of dps/hps numbers. If you want to mainly pvp? If you want some big numbers! It can help rule out some that wont fit with your overall aim for your main.
---
Why mages?
---
Obsessively checking r/classicwow and watching classic wow YouTube videos. That and frantically thinking and weighting the positives and negatives of the classes I'm choosing between. 
---
Sounds awesome! Sadly growing up I didn't have any friends who played video games. It wasn't cool, especially for a girl to be playing them. I grew up playing Tomb Raider and Spyro instead xD
---
I can actually remember playing on an old dell grey computer that got me to about 3fps whenever i would enter stormwind
---
If there was no level cap increase in TBC, then everyone in the zone would be level 60 and there would be no mass killing of "lowbies"
---
lots of people think their experience was the definitive one.
---
What did the "tm" all about when people write "soon tm"
---
There are nets dropped by Murlocks in Westfall that root for 10 seconds and dust from the elementals in Westfall that disorient for 20 seconds or so. 
---
Absolutely gorgeous please let us/me know when you get it up and running. I definitely would love to have it
---
As a horde player, this topic always makes me laugh.
---
What do your people call it?
---
It's not 2004 anymore, you can literally google "vanilla (class) guide" and get a super detailed guide for every aspect of every class. If you don't know how to play your class, you are the only one to blame.
---
The point I'm making is that the game is entirely figured out. It is not new and mysterious anymore. Every aspect of the game can be googled and read about. That is why MC will never be "hard" ever again, unless you get a raid of 40 people who have never played WoW ever before.
---
I've got it narrowed to 2 classes, Rogue or Druid. Slightly leaning toward rogue right now, but man rank 13 druids are godmode ya know?
---
I miss having friends that play video games. I don't have that anymore, luckily you don't need gamer friends now when you can play random people online! ...It's not the same though. :P
---
Wanna trade friend codes on the Switch? I don't know if we have any of the same games, and I have never done that before so I am not entirely sure how it works, but it would be fun to play with ya!
---
&gt; in a party with random players you do not know from before.
---
I would rather trust other players and be affirmed (or not) than to automatically distrust.
---
I'm exactly the kind of player you look forward to exploiting, I guess. You'll get that one drop and that's it.
---
Ironically No Autotune used at all! XD
---
Good choice, even though people like to meme on classic druids, they're really fun. Lots of utility. Be sure to pick up a warden staff!
---
We just did DM for Dire Maul since we had WC in barrens 😊
---
Browsing reddit, watching YouTube videos and digging around classic DB and looking at pre raid BIS lists since that's likely my gear cap 🤣 planning my bank alt and some twinks. 
---

Been playing a lot of online card games. Used to be hearthstone, but mtga has got me grabbed rn. I still log on to retail for raid night. Not too interested in private servers anymore. I was thinking about going back for netherwing but knowing that real classic is so soon makes me not want to put the time in for tbc attunements and grinding.
---
Aww :&lt; Here's a picture of our ferrets to help cheer you up! Aegwynn (polecat) Varok (albino left) and Lothar (albino right)!

Really big hits in the twink brackets.
---
Yeah, pre-raid blues will likely be my gear cap too! Sadly not got the time I used to for those raids!
---
I honestly forgot twinking was a thing. It'll be interesting to see that back in BGs.

I'd like to make a big list if possible.

I want them to change server pop size tbh.

Ease of travel. Always just a teleport away from a Moonwell anytime she needed to and could teleport to anyone she was selling transmutes to. She had a couple at 42, but not all of them, that way when she made a sale she could offer a port and get tips from that as well.
---
Funny you ask:  I just linked the video from my old vanilla server (Alleria) in a thread 10 minutes ago. (I was in the guild of the guy who created the video, no I'm not the guy who created it though...)
---

---
I'm playing a ret this time, so unless I level an alt I wont be raiding. I'm in it for the community and the old 5 man content. I spent most of my vanilla time being a newbie and trying dumb things on a survival hunter.
---
The real meta of this question is...  
---
What did we call Deadmines before anyone knew Dire Maul was coming?  
---
When Worlds Collide. I was in a guild with the guy and thought it was badass at the time.
---

---
Unfortunately I don't have the online on my switch (can't afford it, and also have no games for it). If I ever do though I will let you know!
---
Yeah I do miss having all the friends I did in WoW and stuff. Sometimes it's nice to just have a chat with somebody while you grind out levels. Or even go do something like Ulduar together just because and doing dumb stuff. An old friend of mine used to dual each other outside of instances with just our fists, and eventually with no armor on because I was in plate and she was in leather haha! Random people would run past and be awfully confused and sometimes come back and ask to join in.
---
Thank you!  Just kidding, I’m not suffering too bad.  I’m lvling a 41 undead holy priest on ND server to occupy my time and see what the healing scene is like in vanilla.  So far it’s fun!  I usually win every world pvp encounter and even survive ganks if my fear doesn’t resist
---
Ohhh, right the expert Ret paladin!  I googled it, I remember the show. I thought one of your best answers was about "speccing so that other players know how to play with you."  I saw your reck video, very cool.
---
I was thinking about trying a holy paladin - if I don't want to constantly respec, would I be able to at least kill mobs 1v1 with 31+ points in holy and rest in something else?  Main thing is without a shitton of drinking and eating, which I find really boring. Killing slow is fine, just don't want to be OOM and have some douschebag able to kill me without a fight  :)
---
I'd always enter in cat form just in case. This way I could survive the fall and then rez the priest/shaman.
---
&gt; Do you not see the irony in " Nobody owes you their time to gear you up" ?
---
&gt; When the entire premise of a res-loot run is that you are asking in LFG for other people to spend their time and effort to help you, but feel that you are the only one entitled to the loot?
---
But you aren't. If I organise a run with [One Handed Melee DPS Weapon] reserved, and a priest wants to come because the boss also drops [Offhand Thing With +Healing], are you saying I think the priest is not entitled to the loot?
---
&gt; It's a pretty simple concept, if I ask someone to come spend 2 hours in BRD with me, they are entitled to the fruits of their labor.
---
But if the only reason you are coming is [One Handed Melee DPS Weapon], I am telling you that I *do not* want you to come spend two hours in BRD with me. I want you to go start or join a different group to get what you want.
---
As long as the reserved loot is clearly advertised before you waste anyone's time, what is the problem? Nobody owes it to you to organise runs just for you.
---
Saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame.
---
I was also playing mtga, but I am not very good and I like to mess around and try new cards, but the way they match people up based on how many rare cards they have etc kinda kills that. I just put in 1 rare card to test it out and I'm put against people way out of my league!
---
While they're at it, have them change the vanilla mistakes, such as:
---
1. Respec fee
---
2. No summoning stones
---
3. Epic mount cost
---
See what I did there?
---
I was a holy paladin in vanilla and tbc xD I learnt my lesson... never leveling as holy ever again in that content....ever.
---
There is a decent amount of text to wade though, and it commits the great sin of throwing a lot of fantasy bullshit words all over like they expect you to already know these words like the characters would.. but once you get past that its enjoyable, and now that PoE2 had a turn based mode added in it's even better 
---
Deadmines was pretty much always called VC for the last boss. It got that nickname I think because of the chain quest everyone was trying to get done which ended with you having to kill Edwin Vancleef. Definitely one of the cooler chain quests early on. It’s going to suck trying to get the defias messenger quest done when classic comes out haha. 
---
The most retarded thing to do ever. Delete the character you have played more than 500 hours and if you ever want to come back, you have to start from scratch. 
---
No arguing there, the matchmaking is pretty scuffed.
---
Honestly, I think the opposite is true. I would think that most of the people looking forward to classic will be happy for anyone to play. And I think that the old-schoolers who are used to helping people and creating communities (ala what we did in vanilla) will be ambassadors for classic and go out of their way to make the play experience and enjoyable and smooth as they can for all comers.
---
We want classic to be successful so it not only continues for a long time, but so it sends a message to the MMO development community that the movement away from the original design paradigm of MMOs was a mistake.
---
There are other games that are being developed along these principles: Ashes of Creation and Pantheon. It remains to be seen if either of these stay the course and hold true, or dilute into the modern MMO market.
---
Classic MMOs aren't for everyone. They won't get 15 million players and make billions of dollars a year. They are a niche market, but there are niche markets for almost anything. The real shame, and the reason why we pushed so hard for classic, is that the developers destroyed the initial niche while telling us it never existed.
---
So if you are worried about the classic community being toxic and unwelcoming, I think you can rest easy. We actually have a lot riding on this so a lot of us will be doing all we can to make it succeed - which will be pretty easy, as it's not hard to be a nice person. 
---
I've leveled every class between vanilla and WoD to endgame except rogue and paladin and well stealth has zero appeal too me. I was going too throwback to my original duo of fury warrior and sv hunter but why not try a new 1-60 experience.
---
ND server?
---
Yeah being a healer has its perks out in the world for sure. Also has its downsides but eh, what doesn't? I'm glad you seem to be enjoying yourself though!
---
Ah ok. Thanks for letting me know! I've always wanted to try but being dyslexic, it being wordy has always put me off.
---
generally it was only possible at 640x480.
---
&gt; I think a vast majority are in favor of more content
---
[Citation needed]
---
It is, and it's a shame because it was very fun when I was playing against people as bad as me!
---
rogues come into it, but its not the only reason. Its mostly the best pet to buy time for backup.
---
Rogues are most likely to try to ninja. so succubus is great to break the stunlocks and buy time for reinforcements.
---
If multiple players come, your job isnt to kill them. its to die slow &amp; interrupt caps until your backup can get there. IMO succubus is best for that job.
---
If warrior and hunter is what you enjoy, go for it. Hpally will always be where my heart is and I will always end up back at it and leveling one, even if it's not my main for a particular tier or such.
---
If it's engineered well changing the items to meet whatever itemization/staging blizz decide to roll with will be super trivial/a non-issue. Sure, it doesn't provide any information above and beyond a spreadsheet, but I \*do\* think it's an objectively better UI/UX and if it's an easily-accessed online client it means people don't have to keep bookmarks to various spreadsheets around vs going to [www.bis-list.com](https://www.bis-list.com) or something
---
If I hate ret I'll level a warrior. I mained one from tbc too wod but was always prot. Hunter will likely be my first alt, the gold making possibility is great
---
I have interest in this proposal.

Huh? You're the one acting like Blizzard is too dumb to realise you are posting in bad faith even when you admit in a top-level comment that you are posting in bad faith. I mean, it's not like anyone who was paying attention didn't already know that #nochanges posters were mostly bad faith posters, and the rest were confused, but you've reduced the chance that Blizzard doesn't know to about 0%.
---
So what's the point of doing that? Or posting at all, now you have done it?
---
Damn u stupid
---
There’s been a number of treads on this subreddit discussing future content “in the spirit of classic” and it’s always been positively received 
---
Pretty much. Same way people said Baron run/Emperor run/Drakk run. It says a lot more about people who get upset when people say VC than anything about the people who say it.
---
This subreddit is a small fraction of the overall community.
---
That can be said of any community
---
It's a meme. They're saying that they actually plan for the news to come out soon as opposed to saying it will come out soon but taking a long time. I think it originated with Star wars battlefront 2 but I may be mistaken. 
---
Such a strange and barbaric people you are. 
---
I've been loving Defcamp and Melderon's videos. This was a great one I came across today. 
---
https://youtu.be/xACddNKUNtc
---
Well, they miss out on a fear/charm break. That's bad. And they miss out on Devouring Plague which is an "I win" button against classes that can't cleanse it, if they don't have a friend who can cleanse it, on a longish cooldown. So that's bad too. So undead clearly win some matchups.
---
But trolls have a spell that means every time you hit them there's a 10% chance of a three second stun. That's *huge*. And it works against spells, it works against ranged, you can't hurt a troll shadow priest without risking the stun proc.
---
Yeah I can see everyone having a hunter at least for gold making, that or a mage.
---
.....okay? Doesn't change what I said.
---
If a hunters pet kills a mob without yourself tagging it does it count as a kill Which you can loot?
---
Oh cool. Was not aware of this youtuber. Time to lose all the extra free time I had!
---
Do Resto Shamans need to stand in melee range in raids for totems or not? 
---
As far as I remember, no, you cannot loot the corpse or get XP. You have to hit the mob once at least.
---
yeah. Install it on both accounts, and you're set. Then use something like autohotkey for sending buttons to both windows.
---
Note: Using something like autohotkey to send a command to two windows at once is *not* against TOS. It's 100% legal. But using it with conditional statements, or pushing a sequence of buttons *is* against TOS. And will get you banned. Never setup a button that does more than one command to the wow interface. If you want to do a cast sequence, bake it into a macro in-game.
---
You said hundreds of hours....? If you were a tank in Naxx, it’s most definitely thousand. Probably a lie. 
---
You’re right 
---
DM is Deadmines. DM is Dire Maul. 
---
You find out the context with /who [playername].

Anyone who didn't do this is an ERP NELF Male Hunter. 
---
I don't really play any other games. I might start playing something co-op with my housemate. But I'm just waiting for WOW now and focusing on other IRL things. Like fitness and getting to know this girl I like a bit better.
---
Or a manual crowd pummeler, or say 50... Thanks for the reply man
---
Yes, I tried that, and some other custom resolutions with nvidia control center. Dunno why it doesn't work. Would've loved to play cs go/1.6 at 120hz
---
"What instance are we running?"
---
"DM"
---
"Like all of it what are you fucking mad?"
---
I mean, i did mention this in my post above, but people are stupid and ask anyway if dm = deadmines or diremaul so you can just label one differently to avoid any confusion.
---
That quest in Durotar that rewards the Sticky Glue.
---
I wish you the best of luck with the girl! Should totally get her into WoW... Hahaha! Just kidding... hahaaa... haaaaaaaaa... Yeah no do it.
---
&gt; But you aren't. If I organise a run with [One Handed Melee DPS Weapon] reserved, and a priest wants to come because the boss also drops [Offhand Thing With +Healing], are you saying I think the priest is not entitled to the loot?
---
That's a red herring. 
---
The priest never wanted your [1H DPS] loot, you are not excluding him, if it was a res run or not is irrelevant to him, and his presence is irrelevant to you in regards to your probability of getting the loot you wanted. 
---
The entire point of a res run is that you are planning to take people who *do* want the same loot as you, but you feel you are more entitled to it (exclusively) than them despite both of you putting in the same time and effort. 
---
If this were not the case (example: you brought a lock, mage, and ret - people who wouldn't need your 1h anyway) you wouldn't have needed to make reservations in the first place. The ONLY reason to make loot reservations is to deny others who do want it.
