It would be 80% to 120% as long of a leveling journey. It’s worth it if you enjoy dungeons. It’s also more worth it if you frequently have rested XP to burn, whether that’s because you’re leveling alts or just don’t play often.
---

---
At the end of the day, doing *nothing* but dungeoning will make your leveling speed a lot slower, but if you enjoy dungeons in Classic, it’s not time wasted.
---
---
---
&gt; Best thing about the dungeons is any items you get from bosses or quests make solo questing (or pvp) that much easier.
---
This is the part some ppl do not get about running dungeons.  There is a certain RoI for getting upgrades in dungeons, some of those pieces last a long time.  The last warrior I just leveled rocked the Raging Berserker's Helm from level 37 all the way until 60 when I got the Helm of the Executioner off Baron.
---
I know that Gnome is better for premade vs premade pvp.
---
But for overall world pvp duels etc i dont know what is superior.
---
But if u plan to do serious WSG gnome racial is better.
---
Well you're making the post in a Classic subreddit. I imagine most here would agree with you that the gameplay of Vanilla was superior or at least suitably different that it offers something they enjoy which isn't available in retail.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you want them to rediscover the benefits of rare gear drops or attunements or something I think it's much more compelling to make that argument directly to an audience that is served by retail atm. It has the benefit of isolating the specific game feature you're interested in (rather than needing to isolate which of the many deviations between retail and Classic is responsible). It also needs to pass the test of being acceptable to the current Retail audience -not the Classic audience.
---
In a perfect world the two games can exist *separately* and serve a wider audience more successfully. But either product being successful doesnt immediately suggest that transferring over elements from one to the other is the best route to further success.
---
I think a statement from someone that work(ed) at the company is all we need. Why would he lie? 
---
I did this just the other day for the first time. I was playing as my first warlock. We were going thru uldaman and it was near the beginning to the right where you can crawl over the rocks. 
---
Yeah the imp decide to take the long way around. 
---
Idk... maybe for RFC, WC and SFK, but past that, the dungeons can get a little sparse per level. For example, after SFK, there’s BFD 2 levels later, RFK 3 more later, and Gnomergan about 3 more after that. And those dungeons don’t give a level per run, probably closer to 50% without rested. 
---
I don’t mean to sniper in on one part of your post, I just don’t want people to think it’s *that* efficient past the first 20 levels. 
---
I swear Blizz had a thing for taunting Rogues with super uncommon dungeon daggers. I had horrible luck getting the tail spike one from WC, and only saw Torturing Poker drop twice in all of my vanilla SM Graveyard runs.
---
Depends on how you go about it.  For example, I'll run RFK once for the quests and hope I get a Corpsemaker.  If I don't get the weapon, I will then broadcast in chat that I'm looking for two ppl (a healer and DPS/tank) specifically to farm that one boss for that weapon.  2 less ppl to worry about rolling for it and you go straight to the boss and then reset.  Same thing for Hand of Justice, I bring one healer and one rogue who knows how to solo Lyceum and we go straight to the Emperor on each run, takes less than 30 mins a run this way.
---
Let's see if I remember correctly.
---
Get seal from mob drop. Talk to Dragonkin dude at the start. Get gems. Talk to Dragonkin again. Do some other shit for quest and then go to cave behind Ony. Get dragon to like 10% use the thing to MC dragon and flame the item. Go back to Dragonkin dude and profit.
---
3 sentences or a XX minute video?
---
Well your a warlock so you already have a one button class... Not sure where you are going to go from there lol.
---
They don't provoke a roll like a green item would. I guess you were running masterlooter in WC? Or making things up
---
Did you have to relearn jerking off or were you ambidextrous in regards to wanking it?
---
So when people in chat say hey come check out the 50 naked gnomes that are dancing over here, and I run all the way there and then poof no one's there. Sharding is terrible no matter what
---
lol I am just sitting here trying to think. If he thinks the lock is too complicated what do you even suggest. At least as far as pve goes. It don't get easier. As far as pvp your not pvping with one hand lol.
---
Dwarf is the bane of rogues and arms warriors. Its my favorite thing about being a dwarf actually because it's also a get out of jail free card for certain bosses.
---
I was so mad when they nerfed it in wotlk. I had so much fun in wintergrasp with it, DKs would try to gank me while I was mining, I pop stoneform and spike them down since without their diseases they had nothing 
---
You werent asking me, but i personally hated Priest wandbotting and Warrior was just... more difficult. I somewhat disliked Shaman because youre constantly mana starved.
---
I like Hunter most because its more my playstyle, the rest of the classes I think were all all right to level.
---
Dwarf for overall pvp hands down but gnome is better for premade vs premade so unless you're going to be in a serious pvp guild go dwarf
---
Sword of Omen from SM quest, Vanquisher Sword from RFD, and Thrash Blade from Mars quest.
---
I dont any guild, even hardcore ones, that have recruited based on race with the exception of Alliance priests.
---
There are some weird combos that might sway a decision if theyre really on the fence about you, but if you get a recommend it shouldnt make a difference.
---
Your character is using mail but you wear this cloth shoulders because it's the only one you found.
---
I'm a few days late but I figured I would chime in. Personally I will be playing a priest! At a glance I just really like the lore/fantasy of priest or cleric type heroes. Burn things with holy fire and all that.... But in terms of WoW classic there's a few reasons.
---
1. Being an anchor role within a dungeon/raid group is something I always enjoy. I'm definitely a fan of tanking but I like the idea of pulling off a last second heal or keeping everyone topped off throughout a long fight. To me I find value in keeping my groupmates alive and letting them continue to fight. Not to mention just the general utility of buffs, shackle undead, etc.
---
2. Spell downranking is tied along with that just because it turns a thoughtless dps rotation into more of a pick and choose play style for keeping the group alive. It becomes a game of mana efficiency vs player safety. Do I spam big heals to keep my group alive or do I space out some cheaper spells to save on mana? That to me is engaging. In my mind it will help keep the encounters a bit more interesting as the way the damage gets spread around will always be a bit differently.
---
3. Endless trolling opportunities with mind control..... It just seems so fun to throw some alliance player off a bridge or walk someone off the booty bay - ratchet boat. I'm not someone who's goal is to grief, I just like throwing the occasional troll around haha.
---
4. They also just look cool. Nice white robes, shiny staffs, surrounded by holy light. A well geared priest always just seems so important walking through main cities.
---
It's not worth it until 40 when you can get Blood Thirst.  The healing provided by dual wielding is nice.  I have not done any numbers on what I'm about to say, but I'll say it:  I feel it is faster to level up with a 1h/shield setup on a Warrior until 40.  Two-handers are god awful slow at killing things and you have to Hamstring kite in order to not eat/bandage after every third mob you kill.  Dual-wielding will also make you take a lot of damage as well and Hamstring kiting is not efficient.
---
My uncle owns blizzard and he says it'll be Summer.
---
NE Priest, go team up with a NE Hunter and gank some roads, you filthy beast!
---
Was he doing that under direction from Blizzard? I got the impression it was just a "rogue GM" when it happened
---
For one thing, this is a silly place to put this question. But it's very difficult for me to imagine retail substantially changing to become more "classic like." We've seen that the developers *have* made more recent changes, like re-introducing threat as a mechanic, and they've received luke-warm reactions. 
---
WoW today is more like an organized co-op game, with the random people you meet out of the world more like the random spirits you might see in Dark Souls. The (fairly fun) meat of the game is something you play for its own sake, and everything surrounding that core is either fluff, something to encourage you to keep playing the core, or something to waste time on while you wait for more core content. I think people who accuse retail WoW as being "casual" are missing the point of these changes. Everything in Classic WoW which has since been trivialized or removed was, at some point, decided to be fat that needed to be trimmed. When you compare what you're actually doing 90% of the time in classic (walking, repetitive grinding, waiting around) to what you do in raiding, this is a reasonable observation. The fact that retail wow gives players tons of different ways to get easy rewards is besides the point - the gear was ALWAYS meaningless numbers. The parts of the game which is most fun removed from any reward structure is PVP and raiding, and the game's incentives have all been re-designed to keep you doing these things more than any other activity. As different as it is in practice from the original iteration of classic WoW, this is not a bad way to design a game. People who play and enjoy retail WoW, or want to enjoy retail WoW, will not be made happy by the game trying to grab at random parts of the original game. They want retail to be better at what it is.
---
Honestly, if you want to play a game that's *like* classic WoW but not a rerelease of a 14 year old game, then what you want is a new MMO. Not retail.
---
To sell GFPP recipe?
---
There will always be people who will white knight retail in any way shape or form. I am here to tell you, retail is not cutting it, it is not successful and there is clearly something wrong with it, if you like it or not.  Just because it caters to somewhat an audience doesnt mean it is good at what its doing. Hell,  you could make the same argument for a game 5 people are playing. The mmo aspect is lost and thats what is most important and will be restored and a key factor for classic's success. 
---
I’ll update you on that
---
Oh, could you tell that addon name, pls?
---
Starting with your specific questions, Locks become incredibly powerful in PvP once they reach T2. Mages are as squishy as you remember, but like you said, have great outplay potential. They just gradually get better in terms of stam, but enemies DPS goes up about the same.
---
If you like fast forming groups you might consider Druid, however theyre the worst 1v1 class and you seem really interested in PvP. They are however very good at objectives in BGs, so it depends if you like that style.of PvP.
---
Shard farming isnt so bad if youre not worried about your epeen on dps meters, just stay ontop of it. Warlocks are pretty consistent on their gear curve.
---
Hunter is generally low popularity, so take that as you will if youre worried about facing them.
---
It's not worth it to PUG that run anyway.  Tank/healer/rogue can 3-man it easy if Rogue knows how to solo Lyceum.  Lyceum is hell for PUGs, and it makes no sense.  There are so many areas you can just hang out along that room that will allow you to drink and eat and take your time with that place, yet every PUG thinks you have blast through it with 3 mages AoE'ing everything in sight.  3 ppl can clear that place if they know where to stand between pillars and use those same pillars to LoS all the enemies to the group.  Never PUG a HoJ run.
---
I still remember the pair of cloth grey shoulders my hunter looted off a random mob in Ashenvale. 
---
I was so happy that day.
---
My dads god and says the world will end in 2,000 years. Thanks. 
---
You won’t be able to sit to proc Enrage in Classic. 
---
Just hamstring kite as best as you can but it’ll be pretty hard if pathing stays like it was in the demo. 
---
Just to add to the other answer, druid is probably the most unpopular class in the game, so its actually.fairly easy to get raid spots
---
Congratulations, you didn't need a video to figure it out.  Some ppl definitely need that video, and Tips, he needs the money lol.
---
Send pet, corruption, coa, imolate, life tap, drain life, drain soul, heathstone, shadow bolt, death coil, wand. There’s a lot of commonly used abilities going on here with a warlock. Warrior can be as simple as charge, rend, and heroic strike.
---
Not really, I played as keyboard only using WASD and numpad for years. It shouldn’t be too bad playing a caster with keyboard only but it’s definitely going to suck in PVP. 
---
Some context would be helpful pretty please. 
---
wrong color... First shoulders are gonna be grey, not blue
---
;-)
---
Its a myth that prejudice against ferals and such is a pserver construct. It was extremely present in Vanilla and was actually far more accepted in early classic pservers circa 2010.
---
Feral is a nearly viable OT/DPS spec, if you do get a guild as feral, theres no way you wont be doing OTing. Equally, youll never tank in raid as Feral if you dont DPS. As feral youll do both.
---
Finally, you can find a guild, yes, but youll need to find a new guild thats trying to build up its raiding core and quickly prove yourself as a good player. Alternatively, play another class and prove yourself then switch over to Feral. 
---
No one cares what worthless female streamers think.

No, that's not griefing. I'd add the aspect of harrasment into the definition of griefing.
---
If I tell you that something great happens if you give me your gold and I've the intention to just take it, I'm an "*assholes and intentionally hinder other people's ability to enjoy the game"* but I don't see any problem there.
---
WoW is not a "safespace" were people have the right to be treated fair.
---
edit: I'd never do this and wouldn't want to have ingame contact to players who do so, but I'd defend their right to do so.
---
Under rated PSA
---
Go arms and hs kite one mob while pooling rage so you can go dump sweeping strikes and ww on 2 mobs after that.  Repeat.
---
No sense going fury when /sit crit won't work.
---
Do players change their rotation depending on if they're attacking a clothie or an armoured mob?
---
If the latter, is it ever a good idea to open up with rend?
---
Thinking back to when I leveled a rogue, I definitely changed my rotation for clothie or armoured.
---
Prot Pally is great for dungeons. With a dedicated group they're the best for speed clears.
---
I'll be sure to tell all the hunters that get benched for Naxx because they only need 2 per raid that they should suck it up because they reached lvl 60 a day earlier than the warriors and it's perfectly balanced.
---
You have to level to 120 first
---
The mana regen
---
oh yeah. oh well.
---
Whenever I find grey shoulders or hats I mail them to low level members of my guild. Yes, you might say I'm a bit of a philanthropist.
---
Yea I mean I’m running around this arena thing where it’s constant damage. It’s just so different from paly where I neve go oom
---
Giving warriors a 1 in leveling is absurd if u check any kind of warrior guide you will know its far from a 1
---
Giving shamans a 8 in pvp higher then priests and warlocks
---
Have fun with your enh shaman when u notice u got screwd over by these guys saying its viable in pvp. I feel bad for the guys who listen to these guys and then spend 10+ /played on a class that is awful.
---
I wonder what kind of vanilla pvp experience you guys have.
---
When you hit 60 people were excited for you, most other levels nobody really cared.
---
Kinda unrelated, but one time I got kicked from a group for not rolling on one of those weapon boxes that gives grey shit tier weapons. 
---
I miss being invited into groups of people that I didn’t know and forming friendships 
---
And the LAN parties , Gawd I miss the LAN parties
---
I remember some friends helping me level up I was mid 20’s and they were all level +40 and were all at the guild leaders house and from 8 pm to 5 am they just helped me level and make sure I didn’t get over whelmed and aggro too many enemies 
---
Good times 
---
Try playing a warrior like that and you will be 60 after 4 years with about 100000x deaths on your tab. Warriors have to kite with their two hander to be effective.
---
Don't get me wrong locks have a high skill cap in pvp but in pve. You can macro everything too almost no buttons and allow your pet to handle the leg work.
---
I am not saying at high end game play it won't require two hands to play a lock. I am just saying you can play one with one hand easily and there aren't too many better options. 
---
A warrior may actually be the only class less playable then a druid with one hand lol.
---
This is the animation for female undead unarmed auto btw, it's actually really cool.
---
https://github.com/Orukxu/SpamThrottle
---
This. That was actually the name of my old guild, 'Good Times'.
---
People did use to do it yeah. I can remember groups offering to pay for someone to unlock in general, at least early on before most people had got their own keys done.
---
Not sure how much of a thing it will be in classic tho given everyone knows more about the quests and are likely to progress and level faster.
---
I don't agree with most things on that list.
---
Ha ha, jokes on you they've already monetized your interest with their disproportionately long title and link to video content.
---
Remember when people used to actually provide written summaries when they thought they had something valuable to say?
---
That’s Epic bro 
---
Look, just getting the damage of that spell was bothersome, every private server has different numbers for the damage.
---
It ain't even worth it to get D capped on private servers because half the gear that should have defense, doesn't. Private servers are balanced around that fact. 
---
In vanilla wow, it was EASY to get D capped before even touching raids, it was EXPECTED because it was NEEDED.
---
Any chance you can paste a summary table with the scores in this thread?
---
The best feeling in classic is clearing a pack and then the healer realizes he can't drink. "Guys I'm still in combat?"
---
Then a second later a conga line of troggs or whatever comes and just obliterates the group while everyone's like "WTF"
---
You have to BUY level 120 first. FTFY
---
You can get purples from quest items leveling 110-120 via titanforging. Could be other level brackets too but I know 110-120.
---
Guess you've never played elemental or resto in PvP. Sad you guys judge us so quickly. Have a good day
---
Lol I just grinded to rank 13 on my hybrid elemental healing shaman on a priv server.  They are good at pvp.  Purge and grounding totems make me 1v1 a mage easy.
---
ad block and all they got was a thumb down from me
---
If you want to that's your choice pal
---
don't you get a free 110 for buying legion? you'd probably get an epic from doing WQ in broken shore if those are still a thing 
---
Sure incoming 
---
&gt; retail is not cutting it, it is not successful and there is clearly something wrong with it, if you like it or not.  
---
Man, I wish I could make and sell a video game as "not successful" as retail WoW.
---
Oh Esfand, you tried so hard.

Had this happen with a frost mage. Best bet is to kick them. They make everyone feel awful and the attitude puts the entire group on edge.

Exactly, the amount of salt people have on this subreddit is incredible
---
Look at any of the large scale pvp battles in BFA. Insane lag, basically unplayable.
---
Russian private servers are literally better at hosting large scale battles than a multi billion dollar corperation....not joking
---
Streamers don't speak for me.
---
Well, at least he's asking the important questions.
---
The fact that you think Shaman have only Enhancement = more than you
---
Same with the helm tho.
---
Like our 1hr shaman guide? with provided spreadsheets and slides? Yeah we do that too
---
Summer is just around the corner!
---
Made a macro for that. That's how much I cared
---
Shaman are fine, but better than priests or locks? A single rating for PvP is difficult so maybe you are weighting between the different forms of PvP in a way I wouldn't.
---
Thanks for adding the summary table. That to me seems like an important component of a reddit post if you feel like you have something worthwhile to say rather than just an attempt to drive views to external content.
---
This is probably the worst list/ratings I have ever seen. The idea that the 4 healing classes are rated a 6,5,6,4 out of 10 in PVE when Healers are all that matters in vanilla past the MT is the funniest thing I've ever seen. You will be SPAMMED with whispers for guild invites if you heal. 
---
Some other hilarity. Mage at 6/10 leveling when you can easily spam quests to 20 because you don't have to save them/space them out to prevent grinding and then AOE level.  Lock at 6/10 PVE when there will be 16 debuffs and the spriest dmg debuff in at launch, so the statement you made about "Naxx" applies right away. Hunters at a 5/10 rating in PVP when they are fantastic at everything and probably the strongest dps class in AV/AB. Rogue at a 10/10 rating when they are arguably the worst BG class.
---
This list is obviously made by someone with very limited experience who listened to other content creators who only played one class/had limited experience and who have huge biases to make their own class look good. 
---
Delete it and try again. Skip the stupid scoring system because it's totally flawed and there are multiple types of PVP, do some actual research and just list the strengths and minuses . Also add in the fact that the pve classes you gave a high score like Mage, Rogue have to spend 100 gold a week to respec which you magically gave high PVP ratings to as if rogues raid as hemo/prep or mages as 17/0/34 and then don't punish heal hybrids  with the "hybrid tax myth" for having to do the same and some of those specs can get around that before AQ. Example 30/0/21 Shaman. A hybrid Druid heal spec or that a paladin PVP heal spec is fine for PVE and you will save a ton of money if you just want to heal. Hunters which you gave a 3/10 in PVE can raid and PVP as the same spec for most of vanilla and save a 100 gold a week.
---
About the only thing right in the entire video as far as score is mages probably have the all around best quality of life and that's mainly due to food/water. The idea that Paladins who you have at the other end of the spectrum along with shamans have it super bad or something is hilarious. Both classes have completely faceroll leveling specs. Shaman gets another hearth and faster movement at 20. Paladin gets a free mount. Now if you want to claim Paladin leveling is super boring if you only grind mobs when we have quest guides like James where you don't even have to grind if you do a few instances on the way to cap? Go ahead. Yeah it's boring. It's not "hard" though and the class is not bad at it. 
---
There are no bad classes in vanilla. The only thing close is that you don't want a A LOT of  resto druids in content due to hot's not stacking. This is something to worry about on Alliance. Not on Horde because people don't want to be cows unless they are feral and if they are feral then the hot thing doesn't apply anyways.
---
What did he say?
---
iirc there was an AutoGrats addon
---
Your last paragraph in your tirade. Exactly our point. Took you a while to get there.
---
yeah no problem. Just want to provide something for the community. I regret it more and more every time I post to this reddit
---
This data is telling in a different way. According to it you could buff a Paladin's leveling, PvP, *and* PvE capabilities and it would still not be better than Rogue or Mage at any of them.
---
If you make some [stat triangles](https://i.imgur.com/9Jelo04.png) I am going to look for direct upgrades.
---
No.
---
Absolutely Not
---
Thank you for publicizing your vote.
---
Yeah but eBay links of 750 seems like too much to be realistic. My googlefu is weak
---
That's why I am tempted to play on US servers, yes there is a timezone difference but at least I will be able to communicate with everyone.
---
yeah it makes no sense and i actually selected the wrong answer because of that 
---
Dwarf is the way to go for PvP. Dwarf removes devouring plague which is very strong and you will actually have a chance against undead shadow priests, it lets you restealth with rogue, warrior or feral bleeds and hunter poisons. It wins you a lot of rogue, rogue mirrors due to blind. The human racial is easily beaten by just vanishing while stealthed and you don't have to face that anyways.
---
Gnome is mediocre for rogue because imp sprint removes what the gnome racial does in the leveling/pve or dagger pvp spec and so does vanishes which you will have two of with prep. Add to that you have consumables.
---
Gnome is very good for warrior. Dwarf is good to, but Gnome is better..
---
If that was the point then you would have skipped the idiotic scoring system that is completely biased, laughable and gives people the wrong impression.
---
Watching your stats go up with each level. Seems like such a little thing, but I miss it.
---
Guild banks lead to someone ninjas the bank which leads to massive guild drama and then the guild collapses.
---
Been there, seen it happen and didn't enjoy it.
---
Wailing Caverns for Horde leather wearers. Really all Horde. 
---
And lose out on ad revenue? Never. 
---
Obviously, our opinions are at odds. 
---
You didn't look very hard
---
Thanks, will take a look at the video when I have time. 
---
That’s what that Imp spell that makes them unattackable is for (I think it’s called Phase Shift?). It still freaks me out when I see an imp running at mach speed through all the MC trash when we jump down after the first pack. 
---
Interesting. Any idea on how to make these. Perhaps within MS Office? I also use R
---
Thanks for uploading
---
It sells. I've sold two BlizzCon codes from 2015 and 2017. The older the code/items the value is obviously higher, but the market is probably shrinking for these items along with retail. 
---
Rogue's best matchup is warrior.
---
Dwarf is good for fighting rogues, warriors, and bad hunters (who don't instant flare/volley vanish)
---
Gnome is good for fighting mages (frostbite, nova), druids (nature's grasp, feral charge), warriors (hamstring and Imp. hamstring), shaman (frost shock), and whenever somebody engineering nets you or other more niche slows/roots.
---
Heavily prefer gnome personally.
---
When I found grey shoulders I always put them on the AH for like 10 silver. Let someone get them and strut. 
---
I 100% agree with you man :) when creating content was the actual passion, not growing a following.
---
Please tell me you've seen Jimmy the World of Warcraft story? :)
---
I could have sworn it was on but I guess not :) 
---
word.
---
This is one of the 3 reasons I've decided not too main a warrior this time around. I want to be the mindless dps instead of the guy trying to tell the people how the dungeon works.
---
I just meant, if you make something that is functionally a stat triangle (which you did) I'm going to look for direct upgrades (which I did).
---
Conversely, the lack of guild banks and reliance on a banking alt leads to one or two people mismanaging hundreds to thousands in guild resources or they quit playing without notice and now it's all gone, which also happens to lead to guild drama. 
---
who are these girls? never seen them before in my life
---
It has no views anyways and you are a small channel. Take the advice and do it again without the scoring, which you can edit out. Just list the strengths and minuses. Separate pvp with wpvp and structured pvp. Add in the cost of respecing and what classes can save some money. Fix the errors like Locks and Naxx when Classic has 16 debuffs in MC. I am not the one trying to grow my channel. You are. Videos that people know are WRONG aren't going to help you do that. I mean I can make a accurate vid if you want. I have videos with 500k views on my channel and don't even care about it. Obviously YOU care about this and maybe you want to make a career out of it.
---
Most people just want to know what spec they have to be to raid, what is viable, can they get away with one spec, what excels at wpvp, PVP (separate because some people do not care about the other one), what classes are better for social players and might be a better character for someone that is shy or likes to play a lone a lot. Make that video and do it well and you might get 500 k views. I can even tell you what that will make you. Like 400 bucks. Buy a new GPU with it or something.
---
Not in original classic so...no
---
I appreciate your input but money is not why I do this..j have a career and a job. Just like making content man. We are not agreeing on things and that's ok. I appreciate the feedback though!
---
Rushmore killed me
---
I didn’t like it when people just made macros and auto Gratz replies. Just like retail wow. It’s automated. It’s easy. It’s individual. 
---
Bring on CLASSIC ye mad bastards !!!
---
Well im gonna take a week off work for launch and then from there i have to raid 3 nights a week on Retail :/ so might be able to squeeze classic into the other 4 nights if i dont want to go out and do anything. 
---
the only saving grace is both me and my partner are massive classic fans so we can spend time together playing haha. 
---
I’m gonna day no, but I’m not mad if they’re added. We already know they’re cutting down substantially on GM staff. I’d rather more of the available GMs be utilized towards handling reports, so we don’t have an automated system. Without guild banks, there is an expectation for people to break the terms of service. So I’m with everyone else saying no, but as a community, I don’t think guild banks should be a hill we die on. Loot trading, right click reporting, and strong servers that can handle a Vanilla community are what’s important.
---
As usual I watched it and enjoyed some of the insight. I'm planning to main a lolret this time around so not much applies to me but you guys atleast offer some reasoning behind your opinions so I find it more enjoyable too watch then the lolthatclasssucks crowd
---
Just get a Logitech G600 and you'll be fine. 
---
Whenever a friend or guildmate hits level 60, I’m honestly really happy for them. The spam of “GRAAAAAATS!!!” Is entirely genuine. That’s 150-300 hours spent on a journey, and every level on the way is cause for celebration, but the final ding calls for some whiskey.
---
Me too man... I'm starting to go crazy. Can't play any other game and have to be productive. 
---
As a priest? RFC is a big boost XP-wise and it's quick. Plus the main quest gives you the staff of Orgrimmar, which will last you for a long time.
---
I have to recommend Shadowfang Keep. If you're lucky enough to get the Robe of Arugal that will also last you a long time.
---
I'd also recommend Blackfathom Deeps, if you can do it early in your early 20s the Gravestone Scepter wand will out DPS any of your spells without spending mana. It'll until your mid-late 30s and even the upgrades will be marginal.
---
I'd do all of them though because frankly dungeons are a great way to meet people and its lots of fun. The important thing is to get all the pre-quests so you get good xp.
---
It’s weird to think, honesty. If Blizzcon 2018 and Classic are on a timeline, we’re probably smack in the middle. I can’t wait for a release date so I can quit private servers without knowing there’s still 6 months to go.
---
Especially the 6-line macros chock full of target icons, that drown out everybody else’s comments.
---
In what way are people expected to break terms of service without guild banks?
---
I feel that if private servers can consistently host back alley servers in Russia that can hold 15k players without crashing that a 30 billion dollar company can match if not exceed that expectation?  I know it would be difficult in current game with amount of content and people spread across it etc. but are they really going to crash with 10k server pop?  Surely they can prepare?
---
&gt; Well it doesn't work like that.
---
Anymore.... Which is why you guys keep arguing past each other on this. One side is arguing with old footage before the way it works was changed, while the other side is arguing how it works currently and will continue to work in classic...
---
You're suggesting sharding, literally... only way worse.
---
you want 'burning legion 1-10' under burning legion, with no cross between 1-10 for a period of time.
---
How about everyone on burning legion can play with everyone on burning legion, without having to pick a subserver to exclude themselves from 90% of burning legion until burning legion is merged with burning legion?
---
Cause that's how sharding works.
---
It's dynamic, not static. 500 burning legion people in Goldshire? separate them for an hour, the ones that move on to westfall play with those that move to westfall, the ones that stay in elwynn stay with those in elwynn.
---
Your suggestion means that the 1 that happens to join the poopsock subserver is the 1 left in Elwynn while the 99 poopsockers move onto Westfall.
---
Or Blizz can do their thing and keep the 99 other people in your area mostly with you in your area.
---
Sorry, haven’t played since vanilla. People don’t do that anymore!?! That was the best! 
---
I’m shocked to learn this. What’s the world coming to...
---
&gt; The community here fails to see that it hasn't been a problem on retail, **and retail has the biggest world first races ever due to streaming.**
---
This should have really been the wakeup call... But people love to panic around here so..
---
A stone cannot bleed.
---
In most guilds, there are multiple people who have the account information for the guild’s bankalt. Especially in a serious raiding guild, you generally let a couple of the highest officers have info, so if the owner isn’t on, it’s not an issue.
---
It’s not like anybodies told to break TOS at gunpoint, but the high frequency of people breaking it was a reason leading to guild bank’s creation.
---
I swear I remember using a guild bank but they were introduced after I quit. I guess the officers had banking alts and updated our site with screen captures.
---
&gt; that can hold 15k players without crashing
---

Get a swing timer addon like quartz for slam (it's also nice to have for MS since you know when a big autoswing is coming).  You slam in between the autoswings so you lose no dmg. Googled a quick guide for ya. A bigger deal on horde in PVE in 1.12, but since you are leveling with slam you might as well do it and not clip a lot of dmg. This is how all warriors dps'd before the AQ patch in real vanilla, but the AQ patch made one handers really good. If you want Ashkandi you may as well learn to dps right as well. :)

When you go MS the key is using sweeping strikes with whirlwind on more than one target. It's also good training for stance dancing/pvp. Don't sit there in berserker. Only go into it to whirlwind, then go back. Like I said it's good training and will form the muscle memory you need.

Here is the pvp spec/arms leveling spec.

Where is "the day it came out" option?
---
What really irks me about the sharding situation is that its a problem partly of their own making. The choice to enable Retail players access to Classic for 'free' (no additional box cost or monthly fee) will greatly exacerbate the short term tourist phenomenon in my view.
---
My preferred solution would have been to launch Classic with a 'box' purchase option that would have functioned as a sort of early access fee. Within a month current retail players could have been given 'free' access based on their existing subscription. Staggering the launch population in this way would go a long way toward reducing the need for sharding.
---
&gt;You won’t be able to sit to proc Enrage in Classic.
---
Why not?
---
Launches will always suck, we just have to deal with it. They will certainly not build anything like this when they already have the technology for sharding.
---
Guild banks weren't added until 2.3 (Z.A.) so they weren't even BC launch items.

i had the fang set on my shaman, swapped it at 40 for full scarlet set.

I wouldn't worry about it. In my experience most hunters clip their autoshots and don't have a autoshot timer, can't kite or trap and because they don't have the shot timer also screw up movement and lose their autoshot. Learn to do that and you are considered a god. Hunter is actually one of the safest classes to get a spot on if you are dedicated and use consumables. It's the only ranged class that can be played really badly due to having a rotation that is a little complicated. It's not like mages can mess up pressing frostbolt and then fireball in raids. :)
---
No offense to any mages. They have a very high cap in pvp and if decursive is broken you might actually have to mouse over decurse stuff which should be interesting on some encounters. Seeing the framework is the same as the modern game, decursive might not even be able to work or function like it did.
---
Work on that hunter and perfect it. You will get that raid spot and you will make clothies cry in bg's :)
---
Retail is dead, it’s too far gone.

&gt; couldn't stop 10 paladins who all have blessing of freedom

And if those're all somehow still on CD/purged away.. Nothing like a lil F.A.P can't solve.

they're not wrong
---
Key service is 10g on every private server I’ve played on, and usually it’s just one guy paying for it or in some cases a guild will come open it for free if you warlock summon him. 
---
That's true, but obviously it's apart of their business feasibility/marketing strategy and at the end of the day if they don't make money from stuff they won't do it.
---
Skip Hillsbrad? Man, that's where you learn to hate the alliance! Dadgum invisible NE hunters one shottin ya in the back, all those rogues in the apple orchard...

Fun fun!

You literally may as well have t3 at that point. It’s over. You’ve won.
---
It's the same as Reckoning, the only reason it worked by /sit spamming in Vanilla was because the server was lagging enough that it would recognize you'd be sitting, force the crit, then notice you weren't sitting while being crit and you'd gain a stack of Reckoning. You could only force reckoning stacks from getting crit by melee abilities (and autoshot).
---
&gt; [Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit. However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141810/http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm)
---
You were never supposed to be able to get Reck stacks off of NPCs.
---
this is change i could get behind. Bank alts are just annoying 
---
I mean that's a pretty big outlier lol. In all the years I played wow that never happened to my guild, but we all knew and trusted eachother and had gamed together for a lot of years 
---
/roll is a thing
---
Unless you mean SM Armory, chests always have greens+
---
I remember people having the puposefully insincere grats macros. Like "Congratulations on your Level Up/Item Drop/Achievement/or other notable accomplishment." Some dude in my guild had that and it always pissed me off when he used it. 
---
Cruel barb was OP. Dual wielded them until 34 &amp; 39.
---
Your "akshually" is rejected. Why would he refer to it as a "need" roll? Do you really believe his WC group had the loot set to master looter or Free for All?
---
I remember seeing somebody in a guild like "WoW Ruined My Life" and thinking it was entirely plausible that the guild name was accurate. WoW was fucking addicting. 
---
Honestly I always run them at least once for the quests. If my friends play I'll probably end up running them multiple times.
---
Absolutley worth it for quest items and dungeon drops.
---
What’s akshually? And it is possible, although unlikely.
---
I simultaneously can't wait, and wish I had more time. I really want to play but I also still haven't decided what I'm going to play/ what professions I'll take etc

Im a dirty min maxer, and pvp enthusiast so I really need to make the right call

I did some math and if Classic drops on the last day of Summer 2019 (September 23rd) then we're about 1/3rd of the way there. If it drops in July, we're over halfway.

Ah, I should have guessed it was a meme. Thanks for showing me.
---
People level up like once every 10 minutes now. The world record for levelling from 1 to 100 is under 3 hours. 
---
I would be interested in this information as well.
---
Always felt great getting those shoulders, atleast the empty ring and trinket slots aren't visible too everyone you walk past. Always feels like your toon is half naked without shoulders. 
---
Not about crashing. Its about having people fighting over spawns, preventing people from leveling.
---
Not a chest. A weapon box. Similar to the random food/engineering junk boxes you will encounter. You're lucky if there's a piece of wool and a grey two hander in it.
---
Since we're just wish listing solutions, the simple fix would be how neverwinter does it. Several instances of the same zone running concurrently with the ability to travel between them. Goes like this: 50 people log into dun morogh and they are in instance 1, the next 50 people go into instance 2, etc. Everytime someone leaves one instance the next person to log in will take their place. You can switch which instance of the zone you're in via a dropdown menu on the minimap. Kinda like sharding but with player control.
---
You don't have ww at 31
---
Unless you are going to kill something before rend expires, yo always open with rend.  It's just the best damage per rage, which is the biggest limiting factor for warrior time to kill.
---
I hit 120 today and silence :( I am in a large active guild and it is so impersonal.
---
swe?
---
I'm pretty sure you open with rend and use whirlwind until execute.  It's expensive but does more damage/rage than heroic strike if you are using a level appropriate 2h weapon, which you are.  WW also doesn't reset your swing timer like slam.
---
Hunters aren't bad. They just tend to be ignored when people talking about min maxing since they objectivily are lowest dpser late late game. What I would like to see more of is how they match up vs other dps classes att around MC/ZG/BWL timeframe.
---
I’ll never forget my first maxed character. It was level 80. I dinged while questing in northrend, storm peaks. I wrote to my guildies and they were all happy for me. It was a great experience. 
---
I also wrote it in zone chat and thanked everyone. I’ll never forget that a rogue named havöc told me to “stfu and die” 
---
Based on that answer, if I wanted to level as a fury warrior, should my first 3 points go into improved rend? Or is delaying everything in the fury tree by 3 levels a terrible idea?
---
10k people on a server isn't vanilla. No changes.
---
This. Gbanks are a security feature as much as a QOL thing. They were created as a response to rampant and casual password sharing.
---
I imagine doing that nowadays you'll might just get your account automatically locked for ip jumping.
---
#nochanges
---
Honestly asking the community about things that should or shouldn't be in classic is silly imho. You're going to get this weird mixture of classic and retail which defeats the purpose of resurrecting classic.
---
Hunter, maybe a paladin.
---
Type up a few macros and you will be fine
---
hunter with dft LOL
---
And every day the estimates get closer! Still hard to believe there’s no word about a beta.
---
Ah, yes that's entirely possible. I have no idea how it used to work and it shouldn't really matter either to be honest.
---
Lol I was just about to say... I think Staysafe or Tipsout tied to verbalize this exact idea at Blizzcon during an impromptu Classicast and even Esfand had to quickly point out that it's essentially a worse sharding.
---
For those of you who didn't play classic the first time around, allow me to explain. People used to talk to each other in game.
---
Blizzard's "betas" tend to pretty much be "The game is complete and we just need to stress test and gauge interest to determine server capacity." 
---
I think we will definitely see an open, no-sub-required beta about 1 month before the planned release. The Overwatch beta only had a 2 week gap between the "beta" and launch. 
---
Because dodge is the most important raiding stat for DPS?
---
&gt; I feel that if private servers can consistently host back alley servers in Russia that can hold 15k players without crashing that a 30 billion dollar company can match if not exceed that expectation?
---
Read the 80 page N--------s developer post-mortem for all the ways in which at least that very popular server hacked the code and modified spawn-rates, caps, graphics downgrades, and other gameplay changes to ensure smooth launches.
---
I’m not sure. There’s plenty of people that play at their house, or perhaps on a friends or family members computer. Not to mention Internet cafes. I’m not sure on the details, but that seems like another kind of automation that hinders regular people, in addition to its desired effect.
---
I like where you're coming from - which is to say #NoSharding. 
---
But I think your idea is somewhat over-engineering the solution. I think the way to address the issue of server load and 'Classic WoW Tourists' at launch is actually a combination of a number of simple things:
---
\- Realm online population caps plus login queues (exactly as it was in vanilla) in combination with realm account population caps (I'm trying to draw the distinction between the number of players on a server vs the number of players logged in at any given moment. Both should be capped.)
---
\- instanced starter zones during a short pre-determined period at launch, e.g. 1 week or 1 month. This would be to allow the realm population caps to temporarily exceed the pop caps that will be enforced on the servers longer-term. At the end of that pre-determined period, the instancing would be removed, and server online pop caps reduced to the \~2500 concurrent players we had back in 2005. Instancing the starter zones will address the population issue, as well as server stability, and monster and quest item respawn times.  
---
\- use of server mergers or splits as necessary some time down the track (exactly as it was in vanilla). Blizzard could go an extra step here and assign servers to 'clusters' that are future population merger candidates - but I think even this is over-engineering things. Mergers should be based on active server population and faction balance. 
---
I do not think instancing is perfect as a solution by any means. One really important thing that is lost by instancing is the feeling that Azeroth is one enormous world. The fact that having an instance would mean that you wouldn't be able to run from the Valley of Trials to Orgrimmar without passing through a load screen portal is most definitely not a good thing - but I think is preferable to the plausible alternatives yet still offering a practical solution to the temporary high population issue. 
---
Regarding server mergers and splits, there are a number of important principles that I want to see Blizzard applying when offering these:
---
\- total population (in terms of offline player count)
---
\- online population (nowadays they should be able to look at account login histories and work out roughly how much a person will play into the future)
---
\- Faction balance. Ideally faction balance will be within 55-45 or narrower, but these things can't be forced
---
In choosing which low population servers to merge together, blizzard must pay attention to what the faction balance will look like after the merger. Healthy vanilla did not have horde:alliance ratios beyond 2:1 either way (and even then, 2:1 was pretty extreme). 
---
In managing high server population and offering realm transfers away, blizzard should ONLY offer transfers to characters on the faction that has more players, and the destination realms limited to a very short list of ones that need more of that faction. 
---
Paid realm transfers where the player can choose their destination must NOT be widely available. 
---
dude you cant ignore improved reankh
---
Well the way I envision wouldn't likely affect feasibility so much as optics. The idea that the box cost would be a one-time fee to stagger launch population would still allow them to soon after relax it to the same economic model as they currently plan, shared sub 'free' for current retail users. They's only have the 'problem' of reporting the revenue for a purely Classic product (incidentally this is another reason I like the box cost - a way for the Classic fans to demonstrate their willingness to vote with their dollar).
---
I get why they want to go down the route of using Classic as basically a retail retention tool, but it's frustrating when that choice is also a big reason for the 'necessity' of sharding.
---
I also understand why an extra charge will be unpopular among some of even the most diehard Classic fans. But for someone willing to pay for the best Classic experience possible it's annoying.
---
can you brief me on what he said? I'm also a little worried about it.
---
\&gt;  if private servers can consistently host back alley servers in Russia that can hold 15k players without crashing that a 30 billion dollar company can match if not exceed that expectation? 
---
As I understand it, the limitation isn't technical, but one of gameplay. If population is too high, it becomes very hard to find monsters to kill and gathering quest items that despawn after being collected becomes fucked up. So even if Blizzard can have a server with a concurrent online population of 100,000, we probably don't actually want that unless they also make some changes to mob and item respawn timers - which then can lead to other problems down the track. 
---
&gt; Retail is successful monetarily because of the cash shop and various services.
---
This is 100% untrue. Retail is successful because of the $15 monthly subscription.
---
Buying the few bad mounts and pets and wanting to transfer servers once in a blue moon does not give you the profits necessary to develop an expansion. Like, at all. Like what the fuck does this sub smoke all the time?
---
I actually hated that people did this.  Not once did I ever say "grats" to anyone and not once did I ever want someone to tell me "congrats"  
---
It's an mmorpg, levels happen.
---
I know it triggers when you're in different continents, like if you go to China... I'm not sure if logging in from east to west of USA within an hour would do it or not.
---
Yep, the delusion in the Classic community is insane.

I recommend getting to storm wind and questing in Elwynn forest, west fall and red ridge mountains, then eventually dusk wood.
---
I was leveling on a private server about a year or two ago and I killed things noticeable faster while dual wielding than using a 2hander.  Could have just been the specific weapons I had
---
A one month still worries me. I doubt they’ll want the entire world open at once, rather specific zones/dungeons. I’m not one to be a doomsayers, but the demo was only in November and there was a fair bit that needed work in that.
---
It stands to reason that there doesn’t need to be a full cycle like with most expansions, but I’d bet the game would release with many bugs after a 1 month beta. 
---
Also, I bet they have a lot of stress testing to do. Especially considering this is the first kind of open-ended server population in WoW since they implemented sharding, and the modern infrastructure doesn’t handle any high number of people very well. 
---
I always used it as kind of a “yay for me, but also, I’m this level now, so if any of you want to a dungeon or specific quest, you know what I am now”. Like, Ding 22! Oh sweet! Hey you heal right? Wanna make an SFK grp?
---
I will never see it as black and white as the “#nochanges” fanatics are. What’s even classic, the first update to the game? Or just pre xpac? Is naxx really classic at this point since so many changes occurred before it? 
---
The world isn’t black and white and neither is world of Warcraft. Some things are gonna be different. And that’s okay.(we’ve already seen changes) Gbanks will in no way change the core aspect of the game. It’s not like adding transmog or group finder. Gbanks on characters or an actual gbank? How the f is that different? Ninjas? The people that account share could ninja. There is no difference when either way you have a guild bank. 
---
That's a tough question.  If you want to level as fury, you should just go for it.  Improved rend is a very marginal improvement that you take in the path to mortal strike because there's no better option.  Rend would have to be 9% of your total damage without talents to outweigh points in malice, which I don't think it is.
---
And an amazing belt
---
You can if you find a guild that isn't a bunch of tryhards. No one cares if you raid in your PvP spec unless you're deep into end game 
---
Raid in your PvP spec. Unless you're in a tryhard progressive guild no one will give a shit. 
---
Most of the “hardcore” guild will be guilds from retail or possibly old groups getting together for classic. They will have existing relationships which will be how they will be the most organized. 
---
That being said, they will need people to fill ranks since the raids are larger. Searching the forums is okay or trying to start conversations with people could be a start but honestly the best way would be to power it to 60asap and then get attuned before others. If you commit yourself and get ahead of the pack then you should have no time finding a guild on the forums once you hit 45+ and show them that you are serious. 
---
It was part of vanilla. That's how it's different. You're right, it's not a game breaking change but I still see it as "was it in vanilla"? If it wasn't, then leave it out. That was part of the experience, even as something small and trivial of having to run to an NPC to repair armour then run back to the dungeon. That was the vanilla experience. Simple.
---
I just can’t lol

I definitely want to stay in Darkshore for 12-20. Just because of the memories it brings. Maybe I’ll hit up red ridge after darkshore

i think this is the best reply, p servers were fun in their own way but i'm happy with no changes and low pop cap.
---
I think about classic every single day. I was at work and it was all I could think about. Today specifically I thought about the very first time I booted up the game in 2006, I actually cried. 
---
Words cannot even say how excited I am. 
---
By Malice I take it you meant Cruelty.
---
I definitely understand where you're coming from and i think there is no simple fix.  Personally I wouldn't really enjoy the form of sharding described above, although a better alternative than blizzard sharding.  I don't like the idea of someone being able to potentially change shards to collect black lotus spawns on timers across all shards, or kill rares on timers on all shards etc.  I also don't like the idea of someone being able to simply switch shards when fighting for spawn points or to dodge someone who revenge killed them with their friends after being camped for an hour or something of the like.
---
I love the wetlands, not sure why but something about that zone makes me hit it regardless of what race I'm leveling!
---
Doing ALL the quests in Silverpine Forest.
---
Unlike modern WoW where the Dark Lady and every major character from the lore follow YOU around and fly you all across the zone, Vanilla leaves you alone to experience the forest rather than have it experience you.
---
Go take a peak at blizzard earning reports and the trend across the industry. They aren’t making free games with cash shops for fun. It’s because cash shops make money. Get out of here with this 
---
How do you know you have played too much WoW? When your microwave dings and you say "grats!"
---
Mounts that repair is a way bigger change than switching guild banks from someone’s character to a different guild bank. It’s still a guild bank.
---
Blizzard should run classic wow just like runescape did old school to be extremely successful in the long run, it’ll be successful regardless but could have a bright future if done correctly. As of right now we have 2 years, maybe, of content. but if they add more dungeons, finish incompleted zones, and add other raids(same level items as naxx, just different) the game would go long term with never changing the core gameplay/community But it’s all opinions I guess... 
---
Lmao , so true ! 
---
Difficulty builds community 
---
Not okay
---
That literally happens in the game right now, what dead ass guilds are you in? 
---
Ignite is a mage talent in the fire tree which, at 5/5, puts a dot on a target you crit with a fire spell that inflicts 40% of the spell's damage over 4 seconds, with two ticks.  So if you crit for 1000 damage, the Ignite dot would be for 400 damage, so 200 damage per tick.
---
If you crit again before the ignite completed, any remaining damage would be rolled into the new ignite.  So lets say you crit for 1000, then crit again for another 1000 after only one tick of your ignite.  There would be 200 damage remaining, so instead of your new ignite doing 400 damage it would instead do 600 damage.  Pretty simple.
---
 The thing is, in Classic the debuff slots worked differently.  There were several iterations over the life of Classic, but the one that's relevant is that for a certain time period late in Classic identical debuffs would be consolidated into one stack that would take up a single available debuff slot on the monster.
---
An unintended consequence of this consolidation where Ignite is concerned is that if you crit while you had an Ignite dot on a monster, it wouldn't just refresh your Ignite dot, it would refresh **every** Ignite dot in the stack and your remaining ticks would be added to every stack instead of just yours.  That created a huge geometric damage multiplier where the more fire mages you had in the raid the exponentially higher damage each mage would do, since they were all benefiting from every mage's Ignite dot.
---
Blizzard fixed that bug pretty quickly so rolled ticks only got applied to that mage's Ignite dot, but the consolidated Ignite dots were still bugged in that the mage with the initial Ignite dot got credited on the DPS meter for the collective damage of all the Ignites.  This skewed the DPS meters and is why individual fire mage parses could be so much higher than any other class. 
---
Weird schedule out of curiosity what do you work as
---
YES that's the one. I'd love to see it again :(
---
Absolutely

/g Hi guys, will you still be playing in two months when this isn’t “Fresh”?
---
Guild: idk maybe = /gquit

Guild: what do you mean by fresh? = the right guild 
---
Paladin, judgement is barely useful so you can use a seal and autoattack. Click to heal when you accidentally pull four mobs and kill them all over ten slow minutes.

As someone who usually plays healers, I agree. In fact, on a private server recently, this was happening to my group (not the voidwalker part, but warlock going crazy, pulling stuff on his own, not focusing fire, doing that thing we're he used his own health to refill Mana and not drinking and getting pissed I wouldn't heal him Everytime). And that is exactly what I did; I just started ignoring his health bar and focused on everyone else instead.
---
 As a healer, the tank is your bro; he comes first. Period. End of story.
---
Hmm, few years ago, when i was boring, i just browse all npc models and most of building models. 
---
I remember there that are human models from caverns of time tbc, and also discover unique black orc model, you can meet him in cave near orgri.
---
Also warsong bg building but with textured like humans buildings, gray stone and torches. 
---
retardus
---
Unless it was really early on and you were on the high end of a server’s population. Or at the very least one of the higher level players in your guild, with none being 60. 
---
yes you fucktard
---
For the most part, either 30/0/21 or 31/0/20 ele shaman is fine to heal in, but if your guild is trying to do the last few bosses in AQ40, or  trying to get a foothold in naxx, I would definitely recommend speccing resto.  The extra mana from improved healing stream and mana tide can make a difference when running dry on heals.
---
Wowhead. 
---
It was done to be funny, that obvious. You have a narrow sense of humour if you dont find it funny. (thats a sign of autism)
---
Nothing of value. It's mostly a bit of circlejerking and finding out what Ythisens thinks on certain topics related to Vanilla. Classicast be runnin dry of content.
---
Tirisfal Glades and Silverpine are definitely my favorite leveling zones.  I started so many Forsaken alts.
---
Would love to see dps for various meme specs, BM and even melee hunter.
---
Hunters can do good dps, but only on early stages. 
---
Terrible is an overstatement. Not saying it’s good but it is being overblown. Most people won’t notice sharding. What people see in retail and think is sharding is most often phasing.
---
If you're actually serious about going in hardcore in Classic, all those guilds have either in the past or are currently raiding private servers practicing their speed runs/levelling routes/raid comps. If you want to join them you should hop on the private servers and do the same. All these &lt;Server 1st HARDCORE US East&gt; spam guilds now currently recruiting for their discord channels are basically for the lolz. Most of them will fall apart before the game comes out, or shortly after and are run by people with no experience.
---
Completely agree with you there. I really do hope they make the best of this.
---
"Otherwise I'll get bored."
---
Chick won't make it to 60, much less stick around long enough to look forward to changes.
---
Pro tip: streamers have a very low game acknowledge, don't listen them.  
---
Thats great, hah. Does black lotus only grow in AV or sumn?
---
Shoulders and your first long cape, oh baby! 
---
ashenvale at launch is the best zone because its hardcore pvp asap
---
10 days to 60 /played is a fairly safe number for most people. That's 240 hours. Let's say you play 3 hours a day weekdays and then 5 hours a day on the weekend, so you have 25 hours a week of playing (for reference in Australia you can qualify as a full time employee if you do 30 hours/week...). So at that speed it would take you over 9.5 weeks to get to 60, which is a bit over 2 months.
---
Badlands. I love the atmosphere of the place, and this is coming from someone who plays alliance (we got kinda screwed in that zone). 
---
in vanilla it also removes blind, which i think most here dont realise.  dorf rogue is top tier
---
yeh and if majority of classic players are bfa tourists then who controls that 75%? ;)
---
* Talents
---
Nobody runs 5/5 imp Hunter's Mark and nobody will *not* pick 3/3 Hawk Eye. No clue why you'd want to have 37 yards instead of 41 to use.
---
* Prebis
---
1.10 itemization but whatevs, we can't know what Blizzard is actually going to do. No clue wtf you're doing with Ancient Bone Bow though, it's hot garbage and you should be using Strath or AV xbows. Also devilsaur set&gt;those random blues. If you wanted to be really nitpicky you'd grab the ST chest "of attack power" instead of Cadaverous armor too.
---
* BWL
---
12* hit. No reason to be using Accuria when you can be using QSR. You also aren't realistically getting neither Accuria or DFT until AQ launches, and by the time ZG hits, accuria is completley useless. DFT is such a joke for hunters, it's literally *8 AP* more than the DM class trinket.
---
i never skip deadmines, stockades, sm, zul farrak, sunken temple, and i always try to do a full maraudon run.   would like to do the razorfen dungeons this time around though
---
Here is my Naxx geared mage from Vanilla [Kithkaid](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/draka/Kithkaid).  I started playing in December of 2004 and quit the day BC game out (which is why that mage is still level 60).  I got back into WoW a couple of years later, playing off and on for a couple years at a time.  I most recently quit in 2015.
---
I loved playing this mage, both PvE and PvP.  I was a full time raider so most of my PvP experience was rolling with my guildmates after raids and usually roflstomping poor horde that were less organized and WAY less geared.  Here are a couple of screenshots of what that resulted in:
---
[Warsong Gulch](https://imgur.com/TfIGeMz)
---
[Arathi Basin](https://imgur.com/gyflvKo)
---
I don't remember my exact build during Naxxramas, but I know I had Arcane Power so I was either 20/31 fire/arcane or 17/31/3 fire/arcane/frost.  In PvP I was generally a 3-minute mage, running with ToEP + ZHC for maximum cheese.  In WSG that meant my job was to kill douchebag warrior/druid flag runners with 2-3 pocket healers with them; they can't heal through the damage if the flag runner gets instantaneously one or two-shot.  
---
I'd also PvP in full t2 purely for the luls; that 8-piece proc was the most fun thing in the world when it would chain proc; I remember one time in AB me and my guild leader (a priest) were running up to assault the LM.  There were like 5 horde guarding it and we were hoping to just harass them until reinforcements arrived, but I got like 7 procs in a row and killed 3 of them before they knew what was happening.  We quickly finished the other two off, and my guild leader deadpanned over vent, "Just head straight for the farm; Kithkaid just killed everyone at the LM so we don't need help".  It was glorious.
---
As far as 1v1 vs individual classes, having Naxx gear really upped your damage, but not much for your survivability.  It's as u/NorthTheMage said; the later tier gear had only very marginal increases in raw stats but huge increases in damage.  So that meant getting the opener was even more crucial if you were going up against someone with similar gear levels since your relative survivability was lower than if you were both in fresh 60s gear.  I almost felt like I was playing more rogue-like where I was doing everything I could in order to set up my opener.  If you were a frost mage you had more tools in your survivability kit, but as a fire mage it was very much get the opener and live, don't get your opener and die.  
---
Solo PvE in the world was a lot of fun.  I did enough burst damage that I could pretty much kill any elite mob out there with the exception of the southern Blasted Lands elites.  Since I was an herbalist, it made collecting Black Lotus much easier since many of the spawns were in locations that were full of elites.  I also didn't have much to fear from the opposite faction since I out-geared almost everyone.  Most of the time if someone was foolish enough to attack me I didn't have to worry about strategy; I just needed to get off a single fireball and then finish them off with an immediate fire blast.   
---
Running dungeons was a lot of fun too.  I could often face tank dungeon mobs long enough to kill them and would get a chuckle when the tank freaked out when I pulled aggro (which would happen often) but then kill the mob before the tank could get aggro back.  
---
I had an absolute blast with my mage.  I'm agonizing whether or not I want to main a mage when the Classic servers come out, because I'll want to get just as geared as I was back in Vanilla, which ended up burning me out.       
---
I'd love to know what that whole vid was about. Esfand seemed to be trolling them a little there.
---
10 days is on the slow side though. On private servers most people get to 60 under 8 days. And I’m confident that Classic leveling will be significantly faster than on private servers. 
---
Yes he does 
---
Thanks for all the feedback. You guys are awesome. &lt;3
---
Is that so? Because most private servers have dynamic respawns, and shared quest items, and persistent world quest items, and increased bag drop rates, and /sit talents procs, and frontstabbing and more that increase levelling speed. Under 8 is definitely possible if you only do the dungeons once when you have all the quests, and never spend time screwing around with professions, and don't spend time pvp'ing etc etc. I think 10 days is pretty safe for people that aren't actually racing to 60 but are trying to get their efficiently.

10-30 you should be able to manage 3 levels a day, down to 1 by 30.
---
The 30-33 example you gave should take about 9 hours, you've got time to spare in your 5 day work week example. 2-3 hours a level in your 30s is a fair pace.
---
-----------------
---
Some people don't like my XPH math, but I've done a ton of research around quest XP / mob XP etc level by level, and the formula ----- xph = 1500+(clevel*500) ----- tracks really well as an estimate for what to expect at any given time for a 155 hour play-through ( *700 for poopsock 113 hour, *300 for casual 244 hour, above is *400 190 hour)
---
incoming 'ur math dumb'
---
Here are the tactics. 
---
STV - big open space, a lot of pvp, a lot of quests. This is the place where the game actually starts for me, I usually go here at 33 to do the first camp quests and going back around ~37 and again on ~43. 
---
How so?
---
He's built his channel on other peoples knowledge and has barely, at least before he started his channel, played any vanilla himself.
---
Yeah probably.
---
If you are in a guild that provide this for the MT yes, it would indeed make it easier but it would still be the hardest and most demanding role in the guild except for raid leader (unless you are both, which is quite common considering tanks are the ones to plan pulls and keep the pace of the raid).
---
Can you use stoneform while you're currently blinded, or do you have to predict it?  
---
&gt; Under 8 is definitely possible **if you only do the dungeons once when you have all the quests, and never spend time screwing around with professions, and don't spend time pvp'ing or getting keys or rep etc etc.** I think 10 days is pretty safe for people that aren't actually racing to 60 but are trying to get their efficiently.
---
You just described "not racing but trying to get there efficiently" as the 8 day example, then say 10 days is more fair for those "not racing but trying to get there efficiently" :P
---
I think 10 days is the "let's get to 60 and dick around here and there" speed. 8 days is the fair 'dungeons when you have quests, not screwing around with professions, no pvp / rep' speed.
---
He enjoys, plays and creates content based on vanilla wow. He is the perfect fit for a podcast based on vanilla wow.
---
&gt; Most of the “hardcore” guild will be guilds from retail or possibly old groups getting together for classic. They will have existing relationships which will be how they will be the most organized.
---
Leaving out a big group of folks there pal.  
---
I really wanted a separate subscription even if it was the same price as retail my reason being less trolls from retail and also if classic players were paying a full sub it would likely give us more GM support and better server maintenance exc. 
---
You should go Arms from lvl10.  Overpower is overpowered ;-)
---
People still talk to each other
---
Yes, you can use it while blinded. Dwarf is best choice to face rogues.
---
&gt; You would be spamming grats all day long.
---
For 3 hours
---
Probably #G4m3rGiRLs who dont know shit about vanilla and probably wasnt even old enough to have played it to appreciate what a masterpiece it really was.
---
If basic strawman in reddit sub can understand the correlation between new subscriptions and release of Classic (when it happens) i don't think shareholders wouldn't be able to figure it out also. This is not rocket science.
---
Me too man... me too
---
Extreme overpopulation and constant pvp ganking makes leveling on private servers a far bigger challenge than it ever was in vanilla. I’m positive that Classic leveling will be easy because of the newer client. Everything will feel much smoother and more streamlined. Things like pre-queuing spells will be in the game which helps a lot. Getting to 60 in Classic won’t take more than 6-7 days for the average person and the fast guys will do it under 5. 
---
I would use it in it's final form.  
---
For 4y raiding on a private server, where I had enough DKP to buy the entire raid loot, I never got the DFT. I know it doesn't give that much for hunters, but I do pvp a lot vs rogues and I wanted that 1% dodge chance. Just got bored to have the same 2 trinkets for ages (got the AQ too but they are on use and not always helpful).
---
Hunters are more like support class - they give aura, can trap/kite and do tranq shots. They are like the shadow priests but for melees.
---
If you want to meet people and make a name for yourself, then everything is worth.
---
No time is wasted. I skip just dungeons if I don't like them. 
---
UR MATH DUMB  
---
Thanks for this information. It'll be helpful for my schedule for sure.  
---
That's amazing.  
---
&gt;He enjoys, plays 
---
Does he? Has he? 
---
Either way, we're not going to come to an agreement. Good day.
---
Just keep in mind that paladin is probably the most boring to level class. Killing anything solo takes pretty long time, especially if you are prot or holy. I would also recommend picking engineering, since it makes pulling and soloing in general little bit more bearable (also a necessity if you PvP) .  
---
6-7 days on average??? Yeah, nah. You realize 6 is basically world record pace right?
---
I plan to play for 3h each day may be 5-6 during the weekends. I think if you hurry to get 60 on vanilla, you are missing 70% of the game. The early game is way better than any xpac.
---
I will just wait until it really starts. Which means when we get an actual release date. I think this is when guilds really start to recruit.
---
I will look in official classic forums then. 
---
The only time I was excited for someone who leveled up was when they hit 60.
---
I work at a grocery store.
---
woot
---
Definitely interested. Playing Hunter most likely - as it was my main back in these days and I wish to fully capitalize on nostalgia. I played hunter at a very high level in these early expansions 
---
plus it should only last for the first 2 weeks or so
---
I tried once to buff my pet on max - aq20 set+ dungeon2 set and they decided to give me different jobs like - pulling a mob to the tank, trap and everything else just to not be able to dps. 
---
Melee hunter has only  1 real skill - raptor strike, the mongoose is a bit rare and it doesn't scale with the weapon as far as I remember. But with eye of nerub you can crit for 2k+ dmg with raptor on clothers.
---
I think he should try survival with bis gear while trying to max the agility from items. there should be more than 35% crit chance and a lot of ap. Especially if he is ally.
---
No 5 days is world record pace, 6-7 is fast, and 10 is you not trying to be efficient. 
---
I mean, you can just blast through it with 1 mage AoEing everything in sight, and it takes 2 minutes, tops.
---
Definitely interested in this. The raid times are great with my work schedule too. I’ll be playing Hunter and doing it well :) 
---
&gt; but running it 5+ times
---
Hah. More like 15+.
---
Also best ally choice AS a rogue
---
Its just gonna delay a problem till later lvls... doesnt help much
---
You may understand the meaning of Taz in the days to come.. 
---
&gt;  Server lag on the healer so group/raid wipes. Ditto for the tank. Disconnect of internet. Loss of power in the players location
---
All those 'issues' is part of it. They exist in every other 'hardcore' setting in other games. You deal with it, if you dont have a stable connection then you dont play hardcore.
---
What class ? Its completely different for a priest vs a hunter etc.
---
It's all about the experience, man!
---
Even the later levels can be done in 3-4 hours/lvl granted you gotta be pumping out some serious Xp. 50+ is where 5-6 hours/lvl is more expected while still pumping out serious xph.
---
So theoretically a level a day in 3 hours bursts is completely doable (tougher post 40 even moreso post 50).
---
i hated when everyone spammed each level on every alt, I celebrated 2 ding only: 40 and 60
---
not to mention 2/3 of the hosts are insufferable. 
---
Gz!!
---
/r/gatekeeping 
---
pull with bow, rend, auto attack to death
---
Duskwood and Dustwallow have some pretty sweet quest chains in them with some nice story + lore.
---
True, but infinitely easier to find a Rogue who wants to do Emp runs, than a Mage.
---
I love hitting 41-42 because I can get go right through the chicken zones.
---
Hinterlands, Tanaris, Feralas. Idk what it is about these 3 zones but I always love them and get an easy 5+ levels out of it, and if I hit 48 or 49 can go right on into un'goro.
---
 Aside from the 10-20 leveling experience this has to be my favorite leveling timeframe, which is much needed for me because I loathe the 25-39 parts :c
---
Like, all day long!
---
That's a fitting self portrait you've got there
---
You mean you dont like the short torn up half rug looking ones
---
Oh shut up. I'm still thinking about the typo.
---
aren’t you just a bundle of sunshine
---
it's basically dwarf if you want to have an edge for other rogues/warriors, and gnome if you want an edge vs mages and some other slows, but mainly mages.
---
Yeah i guess your right😬 thought id give it a try while waiting haha
---
Thank you! Will keep an eye on that
---
I'm a big fan of the Barrens.  Wich helps alot with not getting burned out leveling.
---
Would be awesome! Guess we will have to wait and see! Maybe i can join you one day
---
It's going to be so funny watching level 30 warriors begging for help for their charm quests again. You don't even need WW axe, it's more of a thing someone would get for leveling their alt.
---
Well now yea..
---
past lvl 40, i did about one level per day, was playing 4 hour every night.
---
Hey just an update, it seems doable and rather easy.  I ended up getting a ton of work I have to end up doing by the end of the week, but should have some time in the next couple of days to mess around with this.  I will just PM you when I get a chance.
---
Well I presume people will quit after the hype so it won't be as crowded
---
Wowprogress.Com search for your realm. Look at the progress they are at. Click on every link to see what classes they are looking for.
---
Apply.
---
I replied to OP as well, I got a ton of work I need to finish before the end of the week, but I poked around a bit and this seems doable.  I will try to come up with something during my breaks here in the next couple of days.
---
I have nightmares about my friends that they don't like it. And I'll be alone again..
---
Making things up?! Where are we, reddit? 
---
Bullshit. In private server 4th week in AQ, we clear AQ/BWL/MC every week. Still doing even onys on some days (and we did 4-5 onyxias per reset for a while). Hopefully now with world buffs all in single raid, 3h 15m scheduled raid time, with running around going to be close.
---
They weren’t happy/celebrating they just said it to not be rude
---
Streamers are a cancer - Change my mind
---
In Everquest Project 1999 it's still like that.
---
But the levels there also take *even longer*.
---
wow, we actually did it!
---
If you're guild needs 3 raid nights prior to AQ, it's probably good to look for another guild (excluding ZG and bonus onyxias)
---
&gt;Oh you're a vegan.
---
????? How pathethic does someone have to be to sit and dig through my post history? I imagine you sitting there for hours clicking through every post I made angrily until you realize I made some posts on a vegan subreddit a long time ago, and then actually thinking this is somehow insulting to bring up? 
---
I am amazed you would stoop this low honestly. Happy meat eater by the way. Not that I see how this has ANY relevance to the topic, but again, I can easily see how it's easier to try and dig up something old from the past to insult me about than to actually admit you were wrong.
---
&gt; But no, you think that by not being clear in your phrasing you are right and other people are wrong and that gives you clear reign to be a complete and utter piece of human shit. 
---
I was crystal clear in my phrasing. How is my fault you are incapable of understanding basic English?
---
Here is the original post btw:
---
&gt; Shadowmeld cant break target in classic, it can only be used out of combat. Fake news. 
---
To which I responded:
---
&gt; Shadowmeld DOES break target. That's an absolute fact. 
---
And yet somehow people start bringing shadowmeld not being usable in combat into this when the word combat was never used while downvoting my post. You were simply 100% WRONG and I am terribly sorry you are such an emotional cripple that you get legit upset over this when it could easily have been solved by actually reading the posts instead of just responding without thinking.
---
As for me being a piece of shit? I will never be nice to morons. If you want to troll and write nonsense and lies on the Internet, then dont expect people to treat you nice at the same time.
---
He literally said he hasnt played WoW in forever. I will donate my left testicle if a guy like this hits 60 faster than 10 days played. 
---
Fuck off you piece of shit. Dont have to downvote every fucking post.
---
I think I’m gonna roll shaman or pally depending on what faction my friends wanna go.
---
Can pallies tank dungeons? Can shamans? I keep seeing people say shamans can but I’m not sure if it’s a meme. Pretty sure if I tried to actually push for that ingame party would just laugh
---
And yeah I know I’ll be healing raids. I’m fine healing dungeons too. Just curious what’s on the menu for them really. 
---

Extreme overpopulation is compensated with dynamic respawns and once you are on 5 days pace, you wont have any trouble with world PvP ganking since you will be virtually alone. Shared quest items have been present only on 1 pserver recently afaik and wtf are persistent world quest items? Sorry but pretty much all your argumentation seems stupid to me. An average regular dude coming back to classic after years of not playing and working a job will totally have around 10 days played. There is literally no way someone like that has 6-7 days without practice beforehand.
---
yes, because low m+ are the only content in retail. its not like high m+ or mythic dungeons requires voice chat. its not like there are still decent people playing the game with an active guild chat or teamspeak/discord.
---
Everyone is an npc/bot right now and no one talks at all. 
---
i dont recall leveling this area pre cata. What was the story back then in this zone? its currently undercity vs gilneas
---
currently? wowprogress. But there is nothing set up for vanilla right now, obviously, since there is no classic raid yet.
---
I would follow forums and ingame announcements from guilds who try to hardcore raid in vanilla. 
---
There should be guilds closer to release who are looking for members.
---
Due to the nature of the threat and  mechanics in ony it's not unheard of for a skilled hunter to occasionally top dps in that fight or raid. In the other early 40 mans you're usually looking at about number 5-10ish in dps for the better ones, subject to how much kiting they have to do.
---
I love when people post alternatives to sharding, only to convolute the idea of sharding so much.
---
Like you know you could just stick with sharding and not have come up with a weirder subset of sharding.
---
I agree and that's why I said 'even with'.
---
My job is Mon - Fri &amp; usually takes up from 5:30am to 5pm. I stream Mon/Thu/Sun for 2 - 3 hours so can guarantee at least that play time as my minimum.
---
I'll probably get a laptop so I can play a little whilst relaxing with my SO whilst she reads or watches something on Netflix that I'm not fussed about.
---
Tue &amp; Wed are usually 'date' nights that we reserve for dinner out or a cinema visit.
---
So I might be able to get 8 hours play time on average per week! Though my SO has been OK with switching things around in the past so I can raid a couple nights a week.
---
I can't wait to marry her!
---
tbh it was kind of annoying in WoW.   Guild chat spamming with dings every 15 minutes.
---
It came from Everquest where it took like a fucking week or more to gain one level.  9 times out of 10 the Ding scared the shit out of you since watching your exp bar would drive you insane.
---
Poisons and diseases as well as bleeds.
---
100% they did and i wouldn't party with no-shoulder's. it was bad mojo.
---
Having a chip on your shoulder incarnated.
---
Yikes
---
I loved when people exaggerated the GZ by spamming and sending you gold and whatnot. at level 13... :D
---
Your character from back then is what I aspire to become 
---
LOG OUUUUUUUUUUUT
---
I remember when I hit 60 the otherwise aloof 60s in my guild (were still nice enough to run me through things sometimes) sent me some whispers to the effect of, "congrats. Now let's get you ready for some raids/pvp etc". Then then shot me group invites. Cool feeling.
---
This is about right for me now too.
---
As well as that, I remember the very moment my reaction to saying ding went from "gz!" To absolute distain for this little fuck thinking he's special because he did what everyone else can do 40 times a say with little effort.
---
I miss not being angry with the world.
---
I dunno I don’t see how much it cuts down on 3rd party selling. Still tons of sites, still tons of ads, still servers with huge gold selling ad problems. The only difference I notice now is you get more bang for your buck.
---
Haven’t looked for any numbers but it’s still there, available, and even more worth it if you were already buying illegally. You can now spend the same $20 on a 3rd party site then buy a token and still have gold left.
---
I do get the benefits over 3rd party though. Less damage to the economy and game health in general. Although you still don’t know how the person got the gold they bought the token with so it could still be obtained through nefarious means.
---
50/50 on whether tokens have me leaving. Don’t like the p2w aspect but it is going to happen regardless. There will be 3rd party sites and it will be traded often.
---
I too wish we could be in a world where no one wants to buy gold.
---
This is from an early Alpha build, the first character creation screen.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ywDc9w9.jpg
---
STV a winner.I like Tanaris, it just felt so isolated and unexplored, edge of the world type feeling where drifters end up. Plague Lands had strong lore that I enjoyed. Zones like Swamp of Sorrows felt mysterious.
---
Tfw the comments in here takes this way, way too seriously.
---
40 was worth celebrating imo
---
Put that /s away lol
---
Two questions: 
---
How would Orc-Shaman do at pushing R13/14? Are they viable/good at PvP/WPvP?
---
Second, if I was to level a rogue on a PvP server with a friend what build should I go? Should I do a backstab build since they would be able to hold aggro? What about combat swords? Should I do one then respec to the other?
---
Yes and no. More zones open up after a bit. So rather than everyone on one faction in 3, it’s everyone in 5 or 6. Also people level at various speeds. It works itself out on pservers decently enough no reason to think sharding will make the clusterfuck occur later.
---
Probably prevent the clusterfuck from happening at all only at the cost of possibly seeing people disappear or missing out on 50 naked people doing stuff in gold shire.
---
Point is more that strangers used to actually communicate before, whereas today most interaction between players are almost exclusively between close friends/guildies and using 3rd party software. But yes of course there’s still communication in game, just not near like it was before.
---
Ashenvale is one of my favourites and a great follow-on from Darkshore. After that maybe jump back over to TEK for a while and get your fill of wetlands and duskwood!
---
didn't this guy get esfand banned from twitch LMAO
---
Kinda this iirc. Slam is good for against casters when pummel is down at least.
---
Dang I forgot about this. I played in a tight-knit guild all BC and WotLK and I remember the slew of Gratz every ding.
---
Not really. If your fishing skill isn't high enough for a particular zone, you can't even cast a line there. You literally can't fish AT ALL.
---
Your wife leveling with you could be trouble. If you don't want to leave her behind she needs to play just as much as you and if you aren't starting your own guild you'll be in a foot race against the other warriors to get to 60. Mind you, she could be a great help with your speed if she's willing to play as much as needed for you to reach your goal.
---
Yeah I know all that other shit. Just wanted to know if it could be used *during* the blind.  
---
Which is awesome that it does.  
---
These are the stories and adventures I miss so much
---
My goals in vanilla as a trial-account player were; get shoulders, get a long cape, get a helmet, get one gold and get a mount (didnt know the lvl cap was 20) all before my 10 days were up
---
Ah
---
Talking about retail but thanks 
---
That's the point, yes. You can't compare the mage who has ignite and is being fed 40% of the crit dmg of every other mage in the raid to another class. Because it's not really one person's dps, it's (this guy's damage)+(every other mage's crit damage)*0.4. 
---
I'm not sure if you thought I was agreeing with him, but I wasn't. Just pointing out that looking at the top mage in a raid isn't representative of his own, individual dps. 
---
Fingers' crossed someone figures out a way to parse this to assign ignite damage on the right people based on their crits, though. That way we'll get accurate damage counts for mages.
---
You should be able to just add tags which represent the group content you are interested in and then anyone who wants to find you can just browse players by tag and whisper them. It adds some convenience without adding any gamebreaking changes like phasing, crossrealm, teleports, automatic group join etc etc.
---
One of them, the Warden Staff, has a minimum level of 43 and is literally the best tanking weapon for a druid. Maybe Naxx has something better, but definitely the best weapon until then.
---
It's the small things that makes vanilla great
---
but 50 DKP minus for wipe on Onyxia, is not that unheard of....
---
That's really sad man. F for Thrall's misery
---
I didn't know 13 year olds are browsing this sub too. 
---
 Priest leveling is like 60 levels of wanding more than anything else. And that is still arguably a good healer leveling experience as priest is very consistent and has little down time. 
---
Regarding healers, all of them are viable and used. Shamans are very highly demanded because you pretty much want 1 shaman for every group in raid. The leveling is also decent and pretty fun with windfury, ghost wolf and all the utility. 
---
Druids have probably the best leveling experience out of the healers, but they lack ress for 5 mans and they are not as strong at 60 as other healers. You also bring a lot less of them to raids than shamans/priest.
---
If you like shaman, feel free to go for it. You will be needed and people will love you for the totems. And chain heal in raids is pretty broken 
---
He's just the messenger.
---
It's his job to relay information and let the community know what the higher ups are doing. I don't think its fair to blame him for that.
---
Yeah so, back in classic wasn't group healing the only way to heal? What I mean is you only got to heal five people. There was no true raid heal. I don't even think there was aoe healing, right? So did chain heal actually work? When you say it's broken I don't know if you were saying that seriously or meaning it was overpowered.
---
Teldrassil, Westfall, Ashenvale, STV are my favorites. I hate Darkshore, can't quest in Redridge due to ganking (I think it shouldn't be a contested zone, there is really no horde quest there so only gankers go there)
---
I personally find shaman to be the most fun healer. Lots of utility cause totems, alot of viable spells, downranking for mana efficiency and pretty easy leveling as ele/enh spec. 
---
I really hate darkshore. Too linear, you have to constantly go from south to north and back when partying up, everything is grey and blend, every quest is about corruption and sickness. Only interesting bits are the carcasses of huge creatures washed ashore and the Tower or Althanaxx or whatever.
---
Yeah but wasn't he the one who blew the whistle on esfand streaming pservers?
---
I don't remember specifically for chain heal but there was no healing class that didn't almost 100% have to be specced for healing or want great at healing in vanilla. 
---
Chain heal benefits hugely from +healing and Rank 1 was pretty cheap. Combine with some mana/5sec gear and you could just spam it endlessly. Toss in 3 pieces of Tier 2 gear and you buffed the amount it healed to secondary targets by 5%. It was the only true group heal in the game (can't remember if it bounced outside your group. I'm guessing it didn't, but if it did, it was even better). 
---
&gt; and then pay 50g to switch specs when I hit max level
---
It will cost you 1g to respec.
---
If you’re “looking at numbers 5-10” that means you are only beating players performing below what they should be.
---
I don't think the movie shows anyone being banned, just not able to spreak untill the review is done. 
---
And i think it has always worked like that, we as a guild tried it out when this system was introduced and even reporting someone with a full 40 man guild only disconnected them and after login they couldn't speak for a while. We could never force a (insta) ban out of it.
---
The only aoe heals are priest's prayer of healing and chain heal pretty much, and they only work for your group. But you can use chain heal on someone in a different group unlike prayer of healing, so that makes it a lot more useful. It is really powerful for raid healing, which shamans are usually used for.
---
Really? Why do I remember it being 50 g? Did it get more expensive each time you respecced?
---
Literally answers your question
---
Westfall
---
There will usually be one hunter with Imp. Hunters Mark per raid, much like a Mage with Winter's Chill .
---
It's super min-maxy but it's free DPS for everyone.
---
DPS that Hunters sorely need. :D
---
&gt;I mean I guess I could level up as shadow and then pay 50g to switch specs when I hit max level
---
Apart from the initial respec, the price goes up in increments of five. The first one costs 1g, the next one costs five, then ten, then fifteen and so on. The cap is 50 gold.
---
&gt;Oh, but wait, can't do Shadow until 40, right?
---
Not sure what you're getting at. Shadow Form is a 31 point ability which means it only becomes available at level 40 yes. Is a Shadow Priest not a Shadow Priest unless it has unlocked Shadow Form? What about the other 30 points you invested in Shadow, do they not count?
---
I don't see the problem. You have a perfectly good leveling spec in Shadow, how does that make leveling a Priest 'so frustrating'?
---
You can't. 
---
55 levels of wanding ACKSHUALLY.  
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=11287 is the earliest wand in the game.
---
yea but what about them blacksmithing green shoulders
---
rough bronze for life
---
&gt; Making false reports in retail and getting your account banned isn't a big deal. 
---
Kind of a big statement, i think for a lot of ppl it will be more devastating to loose a retail account that are up to 14 years old. With all kinds of characters and the memories created with those characters attached than loosing a classic account. Ppl won't have classics accounts with "hundreds of days" played for a while, even for the most hardcore players it will take up close to a year to get a 100 days played on a account. 
---
Also catching up in Classic probably won't be that hard, guilds in Vanilla helped rerollers catch up very fast in Vanilla already back in the day. For example, i mained a warrior up to BWL, then my guild partly fell apart, i went to another guild where i had friends, had to reroll if i wanted to keep progress raiding because they were full on warriors, leveled a alt Lock, made that main and that was geared up to the level of where my warrior was previously in a few resets. Not a big deal at all. Now 14 years later that lock is still my main, and it would be really devastating if that account ever would get a ban.  
---
You sadistic bastard.
---
I'm into it.
---
Yeah I think it went 1g,5,10,25,50g max
---
I used to also be worried about finding the right guild.  Now I think I am just going to level to 60 fast and figure it out there.  I will probably find a guild while leveling up or after I hit 60 and start gearing up.  Most guilds will have spots open up as people are unable to play/level as expected.  Gives me a bit more freedom and the only concern is a matching raiding schedule.
---
You don't need to get hostile I'm just talking here. First of all I never leveled as a shadow priest so I don't know what it's like or how useful it is without the actual Shadow form. Back in the day when I leveled my priest, I leveled it as holy. It was a new experience and I remember running out of mana a lot. So it seemed like you were mostly just killing things with a wand which was pretty boring. And if I put Talent into Shadow, does that preclude me from healing in dungeons? That's why I'm asking the community. But if you think you have all the answers and I'm annoying you just for asking then maybe you should leave this thread.
---
&gt; So what is the solution? Require human review for the mute aspect. It's really that simple. 
---
Does that really work though, as much as i'd like that to work, i also want gold selling spammers or for example toxic ppl in chat calling out for example racial slurs instantly silenced and not only when a GM reviews the report maybe a hour or 2 after the fact and the spamming already stopped. 
---
2 nights should be more than enough to clear the first two tiers while they’re current content. “Optimal” depends on if you mean time commitment/Efficiency ratio, like beating the raid with 75% of the time investment, or just being chronologically sooner, like beating the raid a week or two earlier on 3 nights than on 2.
---
Once they’re on farm they only take one night anyway. 
---
It removes all current bleed and poison effects, and makes you immune to them. Dwarf and Gnome are both good choices for Rogue. The choice comes down to your preference really.
---
Dwarf is at its strongest in Rogue vs. Rogue. Whether that's a 1v1, point defense in AB or flag defense in WSG being able to break out of blind can secure the win. It's also kinda useful if you need to restealth in Rogue vs. Warrior but you can deadzone Warriors so the bleed dispel isn't as useful as the blind dispel.  
---
Gnome is better equipped for dealing with stuff like Frost Nova, Hamstring, Frost Shock and Entangling Roots.
---
I prefer Gnome.
---
the first skill change costs nothing. and its developing to 50g. so the 2nd time cost 1g the 3rd time 5g... (dont know the exact numbers)
---
I’d recommend hunter. It is very dynamic and feels the most suited to open world play, has lots of solo play RPG mechanics and is just soooo smooth to level. You get lots of utility and flavour abilities, same as the other classes being recommended.
---
I always just post in world something like /6 LF guild with funny name
---
When you're a hunter and and just hit level 40:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/cGtnBnz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cGtnBnz.jpg)
---
Yeah I was about to need on a piece I need but a skeleton hand reached over from the side of the screen and pressed PASS
---
Or alternatively back in vanilla when other classes were usually threat capped or worrying about it while you just kept FDing and chugging away carefree.
---
Do you  know any examples of these macros? I'm leveling a lock right now
---
I can't see how that would ever be a great feeling. Joining one of those "everyone is welcome" guild was a great way to spam your chat channel with that pointless shit.
---
there is no way to fix retail.
---
I might have tl;dr'd it, but why does it take 10 minutes to hit level 2? It's like 7 kills. 
---
ok
---
I remember in wrath you didn't even need one arm - your face was all it took.
---
it will 100% happen and there is nothing you will be able to do about.
---
Såklart
---
So how is wow making more revenue than back in the day with only a fraction of the subscribers?
---
Eh couldn't that just as easily be the computer of whoever is recording that?
---
No one will be intolerant of you playing UD warrior. It’s not even an RP question, it’s just not a big enough deal for people to take it into account for guild or group recruitment at all.
---
I have so many great memories being in Ashenvale. Just sayin.
---
Hey guys, 
---
i really want to play Ele Shaman for Wpvp and battlegrounds. I can heal in raids. 
---
How is the gearing as Ele? Is it really that bad like everyone says?  Will i get first available in AQ40?
---
Do someone have a Pre raid bis ele pvp list ?
---
Beginner as a hunter.. oh all those pet ninja pulls in dungeons
---
After 1 Months in this sub, reading pretty much every post regarding class choice, im certain that i will play Rogue.   
---
Switched from Mage, to priest, to wl, to druid. Leveld everything to the 30s.  
---
I tried to avoid rogue bc i read everywhere they are overplayed, which might be true but the fun of stealthing around the world makes up for that. Who cares if i dont find a dungeon group instantly.   
---
My advice is, like 10000 other post say, play what u think is cool and fun. 
---
All healers regardless of spec can heal through dungeons while leveling. A very common piece of advice is to keep a full set of int gear stashed away in your bank for the occasion. Blizzard intentionally overtuned every healing class' spells so that they could level in DPS spec and not have to worry about respecs. No healer needs to respec until they ding level 60.
---
When it comes to leveling as a Priest, it is what it is. Look at it this way, you get to watch lots of good shows on Netflix or whatever while you're dotting something up and wanding it to death.
---
To be honest I prefer leveling as Priest to all the other healers because it's so relaxed. Open with mind blast, dot the mob and turn on your wand. As you get low on HP cast Renew and resume wanding.   
---
It's not the fastest, but it's a very steady and comfortable ride to the finish line. Plus they're the only healer that gets to level as ranged from 1 to 60.
---
Hong Kong, Singapore, West Australia, should be enough players in that time zone. 
---
I mean, I think it can pretty much be entirely chocked up to the fact that in retail WoW the world exists mostly to spring people to endgame, which is where all of the communication happens. Don't get me wrong. I think that's a bad thing, because why have a world if people aren't going to use it? Still, I also think the WoW community isn't a skeleton of what it once was like a lot of people suggest.
---
It just exists in a different, more concentrated place now.
---
Ah.. i remember the sharks in the water between the Durotar starter zone and Ratchet. i had started a Shaman and was lost getting that water totem, dropped in the water and was killed a few times while swimming towards ratchett but had no idea what was happening at first (zoom).
---
Same time as western Australia, maybe you could find an perth based oce guild if you can handle the latency?
---
that gnome mages...
---
Ah... and all the pathing issues pets had as well ... i cant wait for that growl either! And then after all those wipes ... he rolls NEED on my cloth shoulders as it has INT!
---
... auto-grats :D
---
Chat-tweaks continued plugin fort ElvUI has that as well .. you can put in your life story as a response to ding or achievement etc.
---
Yes, everyone who doesn't take pleasure in ruining other people's fun is autistic...
---
Or ask genuine questions in /general. Like "how can i quit my guild" :D
---
Well we're talking about the average raid that can smash content out in a night and the best hunter with all consumes.
---
I am thinking about playing on chinese servers because I want to avoid high latency. I still have the hope that there might be some English speaking guilds on some of these servers? 
---
If HK has own servers that would definitely work as well. 
---
Is there any information on what region will get a server or who has to share servers?
---
Keep me posted :) 
---
Well, it still happened in my guild for the first few that reach max-level, but after a few weeks any new max-level is an alt so it stops there.
---
Or the "2004 beta" option?
---
My kind of discussion, comparing an elite player to plebs, thereby concluding that "hunters do pretty good DPS, look at how I rank". 
---
Definitely a yes because I want bank logs. I want transparency in the guild I join even if it's a dad guild. Without guild banks you really don't know what the officers are doing. That being said I just want the basic version.  No levels or any of that. 
---
[Found this gem on Wowhead](https://i.imgur.com/BKqoY9K.png)
---
Sharding - depends. If it's as hard as retail, or if it breaks AQ event - then go private servers.
---
Cash shop - as long as it's not ingame, or can be hidden with addons. And, as long as it doesn't contain mounts, transmogs, cosmetics, or anything vanilla-breaking. I don't care about faction changes or renames, as long as it'S cooldowned. But better not.
---
Transmogs - will live with them, as long as they come AFTER AQ, and let us use white/cloth appearances too.
---
Easier to get an epic now then a green item in vanilla.
---
Wrong armor type, getting mail shoulders on your mage...
---
Yes, was :(
---
Teldrassil, nostalgia.
---
Darkshore, nostalgia - actually used to hate it.
---
Ashenvale - loved it, until patch 4.0.3a.
---
Elwynn forest, nostalgia.
---
Duskwood, idk, seems to be the zone that most influenced my life. It is where I killed my first hordie (and he was level 60), it is where I hated getting close to that "Forlorn Rowe", which caused the damn fog that made me see nothing. It is where I did some warlock quests too. It is where I killed a level 32 mob, being 27. It is where I was farming that skeletons, hoping for a chest respawn. So many memories from there.
---
Stranglethorn Vale - not only nostalgic about arema naster and PVP, but also, well, \[1. General - Stranglethorn Vale\] WTS pages 21, 28 or trade for 3  
---
good quests there.
---
”They prolly cant even state the exact original proc rate for Ironfoe, smh”
---
Only if you get the key early. 
---
I'm torn between 3 classes atm.. Warrior, Rogue or Warlock
---
Leaning more towards maining a warrior, but I fear gold farming solo will be slow AF.
---
Thus debating if I should level either a rogue for pick-pocket runs (and ofcourse occasional stunlock gank) or a Warlock for DM runs first...
---
Decisions decisions...
---
Also torn between ally or horde..
---
Horde have shamans i.e windfury totems, while ally got paladins and blessing of kings..
---
Only thing I am certain of is that I will play on a PvP server.
---
this is a good build for indead healing and tanking, i would personaly tune the build so that you got the following build: 
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVGtIMzxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVGtIMzxo)
---
With this build you switch the lay on hand improvement to the PvP improvement in the holy tree, imo better for PvP healing. In the prot tree i switched the def improvement skills (lower skill = more crit = redoubt and reck procs) to the 3% hit (y cant get agro if y dont hit things) and the decrease in cd for hammer of justice (imo beter for pvp aswell).
---
but thit is only if you plan on doing some PvP healing aswell. else take the build listed by mutirana\_baklava
---
and you don´t have Mail gear for all slots yet
---
Those are not epics. Most players in retail wear greens and blues that all had a purple paint job. 
---
Yes for us old farts it's obviously a huge difference since we've put potentially 14 years into our account. Bur for the teens that started recently I bet it's as throwaway as a Destiny 2 account.
---
Duskwood - the best zone for Alliance while leveling.
---
Stitches, Mor'Ladim ... the ambiance.
---
If I understand correctly
---
He seemed to imply that he knows pserv shortcuts or “exploits” will be dealt with, such as OP dire maul farms, sit macros, and entirely new engine-based exploits
---
We both play the same amount of time. Shes a better player than i am.
---
Exactly, just follow where your leveling points you to and enjoy those dungeons.
---
Can't dispel CoT, counterspell locks ALL interaction including bubble, having to heal through MS effects. Zero mobility, zero damage. Sounds like an absurdly good setup indeed. 
---
I'm going to be playing alliance. I'd prefer playing human because of their rep bonus and looks.
---
Atm I'm thinking about playing a warrior or warlock. Hunter or rogue comes after that. 
---
I played a warrior in vanilla and looooved it, got to rank 11 and cleared two wings in Naxx. However, that was a different time and I could play for 10 hours a day if I wanted to. After reading a lot on this subreddit I really want to reconsider rolling a warrior first. 
---
**WARRIOR**
---
Cons:
---
* - It is time consuming to level
---
* - Performs best in PVE with good itemization and consumables
---
* - Need to invest a lot of time to gear up
---
* - Invest a lot of gold in consumables
---
* - Gold for respec between tanking 5 man and raiding
---
* - Not the best for farming
---
* - A lot of warriors all around
---
Pros:
---
- FUN TO PLAY!!
---
- Have pocket healer / partner to level with
---
- Easy to find groups if I'm willing to tank
---
- Performs great in PVE and PVP if I invest the time
---
**WARLOCK**
---
- Soul shard farming, ugh
---
- I suck at playing a caster in all games
---
- Pet management, warlock pets seem like a hazzle. 
---
- Alliance lock is like shooting yourself in the foot in PVP.
---
- Easy to level
---
- New for me to play
---
- Not many warlocks around
---
- Performs great in PVE and PVP (depends on the patch/content)
---
**HUNTER**
---
- Scale badly and being the autist I am I like numbers. 
---
- Huntard stigma
---
- Not really sought after in 5 mans? Am I going to be useful after BWL?
---
- Fun in PVP
---
**ROGUE**
---
* Overpopulated
---
* Harder to find groups
---
* Limited to DPS and not all that much group utility apart from CC. 
---
* Scale good in PVE and PVP 
---
* Fun in all PVP
---
* I am a horrible person so I like to troll and gank. 
---
All 4 of them :D i remember you spend a lot of time there from 28-ish-&gt;40 even running several quests.
---
I am so proud of this community 
---
We have literally no idea how many subscribers there are 
---
Dwarf Rogue is what I'm fairly set on. 
---
2nd time is like 10s
---
I would bet my left nut that the vast majority of players take more than 10 days on their first toon
---
Dam..so close.. I don't get off work until 10PM PST. The search continues.
---
&gt;and half of your group will leave after the first wipe
---
I think this will be for most instances at start - this is how it goes in retail nowadays. once people get it that it takes a lot of time to form a group and travel to an instance, the people still trying for it will prove to be more persistent and last longer (at least that is my hope). There is no 20 minute instance experience in vanilla - with luck it takes that much time to form a group, let alone travel to the instance and then run it.
---
Yeah slam kinda sucks for levelling ngl 
---
How many times are you planing on respecing on your way to lvl 60? if you have a spec in mind to lvl with and you keep that, then at 60 you respec to a pure healing spec, it will only cost you 1 g max. maybe even less
---
I cry at the time spend to level yet another weapon skill ....
---
That staff is no joke either. 7 spirit, 7 intellect, 7 stamina. 20dps
---
Its good both as a stat stick and as something to hit people with.
---
I would take the crit first every time pretty much. All the points give you like 1-2 damage per tick at lvl 10-13. You will want to take imp rend after this though because you’ll be wanting deep wounds, impale etc most of the time
---
Duskwood has some of the most memorable quests IMO, spawning stiches and legend of Stalvan are just memorable quests.
---
I’m in considering the exact same race and classes. I’m leaning more towards warlock and rogue because I probably won’t have enough time to play hardcore and just want to have a really fun time leveling. I’m assuming rouge would be really fun in open world pvp but warlocks will have an easier time getting into dungeons. 
---
&gt;Dungeons are great if you have a pre-made group
---
In a way almost all groups will be pre-made. You stand in IF trying to form up a group then travel towards the dungeon (alliance side that is).
---
It still has a chance to fall apart even travelling there, or at start if some drama occurs (mommy in the old days, wife today yells "DINNER IS READY")
---
We’re raiding Friday and Saturday from 9-12 PST. Horde. Hit me up if you’re interested
---
AaaaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ACCURATE
---
..what?
---
Ye, cap is 50. 
---
Well, i think you can use the "summoning stone" at every instance to form a group in vanilla - but it would require people to actually be there to form up (takes away the travel time though).
---
Probably with a serious overlap into /r/justneckbeardthings and /r/incels 
---
I have levelled more characters than I can remember on private realms its WELL over 50 to max level, could even be over 100.  I would agree with your sentiment that 10 days is a pretty good target for someone wanting to level and dungeon crawl and level prof's.  If you skip the dungeon crawl side and the prof's that is where a HUGE time saving comes in.  I would say even now my average character is around 7-8 days, and if I really tried to push it and played an optimal class like mage hunter or lock I could push for somewhere in the 6 days range.
---
For a private realms vet, sub 7 days is the target, for someone with a little experience and optimizing they could possibly match that.  For someone that hasnt touched the original Azeroth for many years I think under 10 day would be a good target, with many people taking much longer than that.
---
Private realms STILL have the odd few quests with TBC exp values, not to mention some realms respawn timers vary or are dynamic.  Even with sharding tech I expect early zones to be very busy for many weeks and these claims of 5 days played will fade for all but maybe 2% of the players.
---
Worst is to accidently have them sold by your auto-sell-grey-items addon.
---
This is probably the most funny meme on this sub in months. 
---
Would have even better if there were more pulled orcs in every picture :D
---
Define the words “back in the day.”
---
Also, what is the exact fraction difference?
---
Stv
---
Feralas
---
Tanaris
---
Felwood cos of how comically horrid the zone is.
---
Nice! Unfortunately I wasn't that good so I didn't get that high, but boy was it fun!
---
Well, that's a solution. Better than losing your name completely.
---
Well, the most remarkable thing is the level 25 aggressive elites roaming around in the level 10-20 zone  :D
---
Hinterlands for me, couldnt advance in tanaris, feralas etc. And got sent there I was so happy 
---
Peaceful, lots of quests in the appropriate range a safe place (troll village) everything you need.
---
Got 4 level there with jintha alor and after Mopped up previous zones and moved to ungoro 
---
To administer a ban for a false report, someone would need to review every false report. This is doubling down on the already not happening manual reviews for the reported person, hence the right klick report function. Twice unlikely to happen. 
---
"you guys"
---
I didn't play WoW in forever and leveled a toon just in 10 days on a server with lower xp-rates for mobs and hardly anyone online to group. No ganks though (PvE)
---
However, this was without leveling up cooking,fishing, only having gathering profs, a second hearth stone and not going /afk often.
---
just play on NA server, instead of EU. Unless you're in West America, then... learn Chinese :Ð
---
Quest completionists will lose a lot of time trying to do all the quests. That will add a day of running time probably.
---
Rogue! I‘ve talked my wife into picking a dwarf priest so finding a group/Raid shouldn‘t be that hard.
---
Level a toon on a ps to plan your leveling route ahead of time. It should shave off days of /played to 60. Last time I did that it took me 6.5 days /played. The time before that - 8 days.
---
'Best hunter in that given raid', sorry for lack of clarification.
---
The slippery slope fallacy is called a fallacy for a reason 
---
Dream and daydream.
---
BTW, I used to have nightmares about WOW back then. Nightmares that my graphics card breaks. And... it happened later on.
---
And I've been having dreams about WOW classic... extremely positive ones. Never ever had a nightmare.
---
So... trust the Prophet, Classic won't be fucked up.
---
The math is sound, however, Quest availability is a serious factor. When you enter a new zone/quest hub, you will level in 3 hours if you're 40+, but when you hit a dead end and travel all over the world or need to find groups for elite quests, it can easily make a 2h difference.
---
Or if you spend time to learn new pet skills as a hunter etc.
---
Because the expansions were terrible 
---
Are you a prophet?
---
&gt;disintegrate 
---
reoriginate\*
---
I'll send give you the list (again) as you made the same mistake last time, and also then asked me for a list, which i made and sent you.

---
I can't say my favorite, but i can say the one i hate above all : fucking ashenvale.
---
Literally
---
Even if so, it was his job. No hard feelings. 
---
And you roll on the +15stam +6str mail shoulders from Herod, because MAIL!
---
Eh. I think you might just take WoW a bit too seriously, mate :/
---
Now you're ready to fight warriors for gear.
---
Until 40, when you see us reequip from our bags a new full set of plate.
---
Kept me sane during leveling
---
Ashbringer seemed like a legit thing when the scarlet priest tells you there it can be purified by a blacksmith. 
---
Was talking about welfare epics that are in fact uncommons and maybe rares that are handed out as epics. 
---
Everybody seems to downright hate Ashenvale above most other zones but I don't really see why. Could you enlighten me?
---
Should have called them challenges
---
Their is several vid about that, you can reach lvl 5 without fighting. Tbh i've tried it on pserver and i don't think it save you anytime at launch, especially since you'll be missing the first items from quests.
---
&gt;I was IN the game
---
haha I recall having a dream where I was visiting some exotic country, something that I associate with prehistorical Europe. Most likely Ireland, Iran or India. And I remember entering some maze, as soon as I got close, the weather and skybox changed over few seconds, just like it does when changing zones in WOW, and it was a heavy storm, with trees flying over like in Darkshore.
---
And, the maze wasn't tall - my head was above the walls, so I could generally see it from above. Because it was "normal" mode, on "heroic", the walls would be covering my vision.
---
Then, I remember stopping at some kiosk, like ice cream kiosk in tourist maze, but instead of ice cream, they had spells and armor. And, funny thing, each armor had versions for "female" and "male" - it didn't auto-adjust when you equipped it, it was just 2 pieces lying on each shelf.
---
Later on, as soon as I approached the exit of the kiosk (which was non-PVP area), I saw like 5 big, fat guys with guns, laughing at me. And, the kiosk area had different floor than the maze area - as soon as I stepped out of the kiosk area, the guys with guns shot me down, and I woke up.
---
Then, I felt asleep again, and I was a ghost on some graveyard, and everything was black-white. I pulled my phone, opened google maps, and saw where I am and where is my corpse. And, google maps was the only thing that had colors. I walked to the kiosk, then I resurrected - everything started to become colorful, isntead of black-white, but the guys were still there, waiting for me to step out of the non-PVP area again. But then, 5 tall and slim guys came with dogs and bows, and sent their dogs to attack the guys with guns, then shot them down with bows. Then, the guys with guns respawned, and a huge world PVP battle started. It was going and going like for hours, and I was low-level so I was just watching from the kiosk. But, after some time, I got bored, so I decided to logout. I sat on the floor, waited 10 seconds, and woke up.
---
Not not okay.
---
(Free karma)
---
Which is exactly what happens if you care to watch the clip and hear Caden explain it. The squelch (chat ban) is in place until a manual review can be made to detetmine the validity of the reports. 
---
Fair enough, it really depends on how much you fuck around while leveling, but it's still around 10 days. My first vanilla pserver 60 was 12 days played and that's after playing tbc/wotlk pservers for years before that without a serious break. I did a lot of side pvp and fun stuff so that made it a lot slower, but imo the difference between 8 and 10 days is pretty significant.
---
Well, 240 hrs / played the average for people who are not speed-levelers, but still prioritize leveling above anything else (professions, dungeon runs, farming).
---
And that is NOT most people.
---
Most people will take their time experiencing the game, and that includes professions and dungeons runs. These 2 activities only add around 30% to /played, without gaining any XP during this time. The traveling time to a city (with trainers and anvil/forge), the time spent forming a group and traveling to a dungeon are quite extensive in Vanilla.
---
I would argue that a casual player, that wants to level, skill up professions (not adding Fishing, which is a HUGE time sink), run dungeons, you are looking at probably 300-320 hours / played.
---
Most people will take around 3 months before hitting lvl 60, which is not a bad thing. It is actually what most people should do in Classic, because those 3 months will provide much more fun and content compared to everything that comes after lvl 60.
---
You mean, something like this? 
---
https://github.com/MOUZU/Talentsaver
---
;P
---
stopping the worgen threat, helping to figure out a new plague.  really fucking cool cause in southshore on alliance side theres the quest 'hints of a new plague' questline that gets involved with it too
---
Paladin ofc, T2 and T3 look insanely good 
---
i did 59-60 twice in under 3 hours bruh
---
For somes it's the first contact with being ganked, but i don't mind the pvp.
---
Mostly it's the layout of the zone. All the quests spot are separated by huge mountain you can't cross, making you walk around those and loose a bunch of time.
---
Also, i have bad memory of 2 quest there with ridiculously low drop rate (one on slime with a chest drop, other for a key on a tree)
---
True. I will really have to learn skipping quests that are not worth it and sometimes just grinding shit out instead of traveling all over the world all the time to find quests I could do.
---
No. 
---
So why do we have right click reporting then? It does not seem to reduce any workload if they review every single report like they claim anyways.
---
I am sorry, but I will never take some twitch chicks seriously.
---
Careful with the word "realistic". 1-2years ago, MC buffing was not realistic. But today, it is.
---
Wow that dwarf is racist
---
Can I just say we should all be thankful that they didn't go with that helm model?
---
From what i've gathered, you're supposed to auto between each slam , and you need the points in it to be able to it effienctly. 
---
A hardcore min-max melee hunter can hold their weight against other dpser's.
---
Ah gotchu! And true. I can’t see why everything has to be «epic». It nullifies the meaning of the word conpletely
---
Another week rolls by without me being closer to picking a main I am a PVP player who will be raiding for BIS gear or close to it, and will hopefully be squaring off against other players of the same mindset. (Insert but bro you don't have to do raids to pvp!) This means that I will be spending a ton of time in raids so raiding viability is a must even though my ultimate focus is premade pvp. Leveling speed and difficulty are irrelevant to me.
---
I have narrowed it down to War, Mage, Warlock, Rogue, (and hunter isn't completely ruled out but very close).
---
First let me say I am not new to the series or vanilla, generic tips like Hunters are the fastest levelers! aren't very beneficial to me. With that out of the way here are some thoughts going through my head with + and cons to each class.
---
Warrior (the king of vanilla)
---
Pros+
---
Wrecking balls in group pvp with support, Kinda interesting pve rotation, High mobility, huge crits, plate armor, excellent cooldowns, dps/tanking/oting possibilities in raids 
---
Cons-
---
Need tons of consumables to be even remotely viable in 1v1s or without a pocket healer, terrible farming (how do you support your FAP addiction?), Tougher time getting loot because of competition, respec between pvp/pve
---
(Insert generic slow hard leveling that has been beaten to death here)
---
------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Mage (QOL king)
---
Fantastic farming options, Portals, blink, reliable CC, great cooldowns, roots, silence (a real swiss army knife here folks)
---
Cons- god awful PVE rotation, seriously this is nearly the only reason I don't want to play mage or lock, who wants to press one button for 2 years in raids.
---
Warlock (badger, badger, mushroom?)
---
Pros+ Good farming mara/DM, tanky in pvp, less popular than mages, great at nearly every aspect of pvp, in nearly spec, summons, pets, fantastic cc in pvp, free mount is sorta nice
---
Same as mage brutally boring PVE rotation, soul shards
---
Rogue (Scissors)
---
Pros+ Less boring pve rotation, you at least need to move and hit a few buttons, great in WPVP, decent farming (pickpocket), great early game
---
Cons- Seems like they fall off pretty hard in AQ/naxx in pvp(which might not be a big deal for some folks but it is for me), Very CD reliant, loot competition, not so great CC in dungeons, Limited BG potential (usually guarding a flag in ab/wsg)
---
Hunter (I need that)
---
Pros+ great early game, somewhat interesting rotation in pve, great farming
---
Cons- 
---
Arrows, pet food, pet happiness, deadzone, low dps later on, CC is difficult to use, after BWL you don't get a weapon upgrade till KT, seem weaker in general near lategame pvp.
---
Sorry for anyone who suffered through reading this, its just kind of a collection of thoughts going through my head leading up to classic wow, if you have any interesting insights on endgame pvp/pve please feel free to throw them on the pile so I can be more indecisive.
---
I’m sure it could be but I doubt that’s the case, it’s pretty well documented that large scale pvp is a mess right now. There is a pvp brawl of South Shore vs Terran Mill which is also 40v40 that lags like crazy and there are videos of streamers trying to do big raids on capital cities that basically result in slide shows. 
---
I spent more time than I'd like to admit killing those sharks on my warlock for whatever reason.
---
It looked fine as they ran in, it wa sonce spells started that it all lagged out. There are loads of videos out there regarding this issue. 
---
After all those years there was at leas 1 time when you unequipped your shoulders without a reason and breathe a sigh of relief like you were the one wearing those. 
---
You are doing it wrong. Holy priest is incredible smooth to lvl with no downtime. You rotate through your highest damage skills and 90% just shoot with your wand. 
---
And respec doesn't start at 50g.
---
If lvling is the only thing holding you back, it's really a non issue. Only druid lvls faster.
---
I've had it both ways so I suppose it depends on the mood of the group at the time. Sometimes people are willing to take it slow and RP, other times they just want to keep pace because it's their nth run of the same dungeon. Post boss kills and at the end of the dungeon/while waiting for group members to arrive are good times to engage.
---
Ill admit I haven't researched it much. If this is the case I hope it isn't as noticeable on classic as that video makes it seem. 
---
Fair enough. Ill admit I have not researched it I just really hope AV does not look this bad on classic
---
Shimmering flats, un'goro crate, Barrens and stv. 
---
The best zones. 
---
Not using Doomshot either. Whether you think it's worthwhile, I can tell you that tryhard Hunters always show to raid with Doomshot.
---
How to get PTSD in Classic
---
In the beginning 2 days will be enough. Later on you need at least 3. Naxx and aq have tons of trash.
---
Getting to cthun takes forever. 
---
thats clearly lag and not an fps problem. plenty of proof floating around that modern wow isnt built for large scale pvp anymore
---
That makes me sad. World PvP around World boss and cities was some of my favorite memories.
---
Any older mmo had guild banks.
---
That classic never had one was always critizised by me even back in 2005.
---
Blows my mind that this was implemented so late. It's a core feature for any mmo. 
---
However since it wasn't available I would say no. But I would be okay if they did, since you are basically forced to break the tos. 
---
This week I'm stuck between a Priest and a Mage. 
---
To sum it up, it basically comes down to desirability vs quality of life. 
---
Mages represent the quality of life aspect I want in a character. Ports, farming, blink, CC, food/water.  I also mained a wizard through many years of Everquest progression servers/live servers and played a mage to the 30s during vanilla.  Playing a wizard in Everquest was a hard life a lot of times and I think it would be nice to have such an enjoyable time on a WoW mage to 60. 
---
My main issue with the mage though is that it's literally going to be one of, if not the most populated class. I don't want my enjoyable time to turn into a frustrating time by not being able to find groups for dungeons, which I think will be very important for classic during the first few months because of the extreme populations in leveling open world zones.  We will most likely have to compete for quest mobs and spots, and honestly in that situation AE farming will probably not be viable because you'll either have your mobs taken by your own faction - or constantly ganked during pulls (I'll be pvp, but perhaps this could change). 
---
A priest would be a good remedy to that problem I foresee on a mage because of its much lower population and high desirability.  My main issue with a priest is, while I don't necessarily mind healing as a role too much, I don't know how much I'll enjoy it in the long run.  Plus, some people say they can't farm hardly at all, but the last what should I play Wednesday, others informed me otherwise. 
---
My list has narrowed and changed since last week, and probably will do the same again many times over. 
---
What do you all think?
---
You can have the best PVP spec and someone with a PVE spec will still outrank you if they play 30min more each day. 
---
Also the obligatory whalecum when people joined the guild.
---
&gt;Players attending a raid are not permitted to share DPS or healing meters in raid and/or guild chat. Our goal is to clear content as a team and not have people fighting over first spots.
---
This philosophy is fantastic and I am very interested in your guild. I have marked your post to look over tonight and might pop on Discord for a casual chat. 
---
More than half. They developed the 1-59 content for years and then made Molten Core in a week. Imagine that in a pie chart. 
---
NEVER EVER AGAIN! when i dinged 60 on my rogue.... then i lvl'd a mage... :)
---
I have in the last couple of months dreamed about launch day a couple of times. I'm not ingame myself im literaly sitting in front of the PC creating my first char and logging into elwyn forest, accepting some quests, kill some wolves etc. Pure bliss.
---
Although the last one ended badly where I grouped up with someone for the kobolds and then he got sharded into another instance. I woke up with a cold sweat.
---
My bro and I did a war-priest leveling almost exclusively through dungeons. Pretty fun. Ended up doing it in TBC again with pal-sham. If you want to learn how to tank or heal, you'll learn a lot.
---
Hi, /u/skob17
---
Play enha shaman instead.
---
I see a lot of people mentioning that the war always pulls. When I played vanilla it was customary for a hunter to pull. Was that just my server? I almost never see it mentioned.
---
You think there will still be *that* many tourists a year and a half after Classic comes out?
---
I don’t think there are summoning stones in Vanilla. But honestly, I don’t think that’s a big deal. I just mean it would be nice to have a mechanism outside chat to form groups. But only to form groups — not to cross-servers or transport you to the location. I don’t see why we can’t use the custom LFG feature like we do now for m+.
---
The problem with ele is that you don't get "good" ele gear until AQ40, and you will almost certainly have to respec to pure resto to be in a guild that is clearing AQ40 (until of course the raid has enough gear to steamroll it). 
---
Looks like that room in Utgarde Pinnacle with the taxidermy that comes to life. 
---
Two questions:
---
How would Orc-Shaman do at pushing R13/14? How viable/good are they at PvP/WPvP?
---
I used to have my hearthstone set to Tarren Mill, and would watch on world defense channel to see if it was under attack, dropping whatever I was doing to go straight there to fight whoever was attacking it.
---
I'd see the same names over and over again, fun times. :D
---
It's so that people won't continue to plague the community until the manual review is done, that's all.
---
I feel your pain. Wow is a great game, but when you run into people like that it can really ruin the fun for days.
---
Yeah but with pre-made group I mean going with at least 2 friends, or 1 friend that plays tank when you play healer so you basically control the group.
---
Standing around looking for people while leveling on launch will cost you a lot of time
---
Lets go for 200!
---
You say "tfw" and yet I see no face.
---
Shaman’s level faster too (Ghost Wolf) and Paladins get a free mount, which in turn means they level faster as gold becomes far less of an issue.
---
That said, I think too much emphasis is put on leveling speed. It’s a one-time thing you have to power through.
---
Quoting from Blizzard:
---
Global Play Regions
---
Americas:for players in North America, Latin America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand.
---
Europe: for players in the European Union, Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa, and the Middle East.
---
Asia: for players in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.
---
Therefore it sounds like the Asia server is the one you are after. Although I have never played on this server, it sounds very likely English is the common language on this server and every individual community speaks their own language (similar to Russian community on EU)
---
The China server you mentioned is a separate thing that isn’t operated by Blizzard directly. Also you won’t get away with it without speaking good mandarin. 
---
Those stones were around in vanilla, not for summoning but for creating a group - and you obviously had to be near the stone (i.e. close to the entrance) to click it - so in theory a fast grouping method even though i never saw it used.
---
I honestly have no recollection of that, haha. But fair enough.
---
Id have to recommend human if your playing alliance. Gnome racial is insanely powerful in Pvp.    Your most fun matchup in pvp would be mage. It is all a game of chess, and if you go imp sprint, with gnome racial, you would be able to stay on top of the mage most of the time. However there is an item called spider silk belt. It gives you the gnome racial on a 30 min cd ( I’m not sure about the cd off the top of my head). Given the fact that humans get given swords more than gnomes due to their racial, it gives them a better chance on getting better weapons. On top of the fact that humans have perception which in combination of cat eye goggles, gives you a huge advantage in your primary role in bgs, which is defending flags in either wag, av, or ab. 
---
Given enough practice you can time your perception racial to catch enemy fcs out of stealth for a free kill given they don’t use trinket. If they do you force them to use a cd because you found them in stealth.  This will make it easier for your team to kill the fc because they are lacking on a cd.
---
In my opinion/ experience, I’d have to say human for alliance and orc, undead for horde. It all depends on what matchups you want to have an easier time winning, Warlocks/mages, or Wars/rogues.
---
To be competitive in Pvp, you have to raid some what. If your ur lv 60 and have pre raid bis, which is what you usually want for Pvp gear, you can spend the time to raid 2-3 times a week for a couple of hours. This will make you a Pvp Killing machine.
---
I highly recommend practicing on rogue Pvp now, before classic releases. They are not easy like a spriest, but they have a lot they can offer to the pve and Pvp community given enough dedication and practice. With those things you shouldn’t have trouble finding a spot in raids and in pvp.
---
Hunters are statistically only \*slightly\* behind mages before AQ/Naxx and they provide a group dps buff in TSA and possibly Furious Howl (wolf pets). Warriors and Rogues are ahead of ranged DPS classes throughout all raids but they also take more healing resources in some fights.
---
I saw a video with a statistical breakdown of pserver DPS in raids and in BWL Hunters are only about &lt;10% behind Mages on average. Compare that to the Buff utility they provide to their group and the fact that Hunters play an important role on some bosses like kiting Razorgore adds or tranquilizing Chromaggus. Also Hunters have one of the least impactful Class debuffs on Nefarian and Mages have one of the deadliest. It all kind of balances out.
---
Also back in the day Hunters were more lazy and didn't actively control their pets, but now people are more mechanically adept and computers got better and the internet faster so it is easier to control your pet precisely and especially your rotation. Mistakes/lag in a Hunter rotation can clip Auto Shots and delay significant amounts of your damage. Note that most DPS classes just need to follow a specific order of actions, while Hunters for example need to weave in their Aimed Shot just at the right timing, which requires a little more attention and responsiveness.
---
The two reasons Hunters fall behind in ranged DPS with AQ/Naxx: Mages are starting to spec into fire instead of frost and tanks start to generate more threat so Warlocks who are very susceptible to threat (in other words they generate more threat/dps than most other classes)  can start pumping out. Hunters just stay like they were before.
---
Because it’s ‘feel’ and not ‘face.’
---
Mage is the most desired DPS in Vanilla, but it still ranks behind tanks and healers obviously. It’s depends on if you want to play Mage more than you want to be desired, which is a hard call. But if you don’t think you’ll enjoy healing, it really doesn’t matter how desired you’ll be because you’ll likely just stop playing the game.
---
I see no feels either.
---
You can breakdown the math however it fits your life, but I’d imagine most people on this sub (and thinking about Classic this far out) won’t take four months to hit 60. Whether it’s sneaking a few days off work or pounding it hard on weekends, I’d imagine we’ll be MC ready in 2-3 months. :)
---
Priest is easy as fuck to level with spirit tap + wand spec
---
It depends if you want top top meters or not, a Druid is going to heal but they also may have other jobs to do and are never going to outheal a priest/shaman because people get topped before your hots finish
---
I guess everything is as it should be then?
---
Not quite sure what you’re trying to do here
---
It's not really speed of leveling that I'm worried about. And I'm sure I DID do it wrong the first time around, lol, as I remember using Smite a lot. It's more like boredom that I'm worried about. I feel like it's going to be extremely repetitious for the first 30 levels and I'll lose interest. I'm trying to narrow it down to just one character because I don't think I have it in me to level a whole bunch of alts again after playing wow for so many years.
---
I might do a paladin only because I never really got into one fully as far as raids and so it would feel new to me. I have raised a paladin high enough to get the mount, though, and that whole questline is a royal pain in the ass.
---
As long as you are not progression raiding any healing class can raid in their PvP healing spec and do fine. Under normal circumstances it's only a small hit to output/efficiency depending on the class.
---
For progression raiding you'll 100% be expected to respec. But that's not a big issue these days because progression lasts a lot shorter than what it did back when we were figuring this stuff out for the first time.
---
I would like to see the same, but with survival specced, there was always that elusive "agi" cap. 
---
You know you like it.
---
Nah, it's just that I feel like I need to try something different. I really love my holy priest for raid healing but I only think I have maybe one or two characters left in me to level once again and I'm trying to figure out the best compromise for raid healing, PVP, and PVE.
---
Poster above you specifically said \*early\* raids. Hunters only really start to fall off in AQ/Naxx. It is not unusual for Hunters to be pushing into top 10 early on.
---
Paladins are the best raid healers simply because their blessings are completely OP. So every Ally guild wants at least 3-4 in every raid.
---
And yea, the mounts aren’t exactly free, but still a better option than cold hard cash on a new server.
---
10% is massive, at least in my eyes. The top 10 are all usually about 1% or less apart if they are tryharding.. DPSmate will be a sea of brown and yellow and you will have to change your settings to see any green :(
---
The only time I'd use Rejuv is between fights to help people get topped off. Regrowth is mostly good if you cast it just as the fight is starting, otherwise it isn't very efficient. HT rank 3 + 4 are going to be your most efficient uses of mana.
---
*"If there arent any changes, I'll get bored"*
---
Kinda says it all really.
---
When did I START, or what expansions did I PLAY - the thread title is misleading.
---
I would be very interested to see how far you could get like this, might be a fun pserver experiment to see war the max level that could reached from just running, and what the best class would be for it
---
Pick WC3 re release for the full pvp experience in Azeroth.
---
The healer should have let him die. As a healer I make friends with any tank I can. Anybody can dps; you can find them on any corner.
---
Shamans are fantastic Dungeon healers and very sought out by raiding guilds. Some guilds want to bring as many as 8 Shamans to have one for each group.
---
There are grinding/leveling efficient restoration shaman speccs because you get a strong DPS talent in the restoration tree and your totems get cheaper. You can also just do a mix of enh/resto or ele/resto. 
---
Shaman Totems provide insanely good utility and reward players who have intricate knowledge of encounters. Aside from several DPS enhancing totems and manareg ones you can also buff magical resistances or even dispel poisons, fears and sleeps automatically with them.
---
Also they are the only healers who can rez themselves and others, making your group wipe immune in 5mans.
---
This is so huge.  If you hit a hub with some straight local kill/gather quests and you have no competition... you could bang out midrange level in 2 hours or so.  
---
Hey Nixxiom, found the lvl 58 Death Knight.
---
For Alliance I think I'd go Deadmines, BFD, Stocks, Gnomeregan, SM, Uldaman, ZF, (never got further than level 50 in vanilla so just guessing past this point) BFD, Scholo, Strat, DM, LBRS, UBRS
---
Of course, you should just do as many or as few dungeons as you like along the way. As a semi-RPer I like to go to the dungeons my character has reason to go to, be it quests or personal reasons. For example I avoid SM on my pally because he's sympathetic to their cause.
---
I hope so, I hate Discord, and all Electron apps for that matter.
---
The program of choice is widely discord now.
---
proud teamspeak user here :D
---
Im with you dude, 10 days is slow.  If someones focus is leveling (not even speed leveling, just leveling) it should not take more than 7 or 8 days.  My first ever toon, day 1 launch was a holy priest and it took me 9 days.  I literally wandered around with fuck all idea what i was doing.
---
Voice chat will very likely not be baked into Classic. No confirmation though.
---
It takes that long to level to 60? That’s so rad! 
---
You say "tfw" and yet I see no fish. 
---
The questions is, did you make/save enough gold to get your mount right at 40?
---
"58 more then I can be done with this hell"
---
Barrens. Hopefully they will still talk of chuck norris
---
From memory, weren’t they Crocs?
---
It would have been so cool if they dove more heavily into the roleplaying route and added Goblins, Ogres and maybe a few other neutral races. Maybe even have a big redemption arc and help certain demon species of the Burning Legion break free.
---
Wishful thinking of course, but it would have been badass.
---
If you did that on retail the chat would be flooded at the start of a new expansion, you wouldn't be able to read anything else. 
---
Press alt+f4 
---
"casual" is more hardcore than hardcore. Spending 4x the time for same result. It is the time spent in raid that takes away from RL, gold and consumables can be farmed at whatever time you like with how many breaks you want.
---
Druid could spec HotW/resto and still play like a feral outside of raids. This was the preferred starting spec since HotW helped cover for your lack of gear. And then once you were geared, balance/resto hybrid based on Nature's Grace was possibly the highest healing/sec spec in the game.
---
Shaman could go 3x elemental/2x resto. They gave up their ability to tank heal but were still valued as chain heal spammers and totem droppers.
---
Paladins could get away with 20 in holy for illumination, then go full ret  or full prot.
---
Priests could go disc/holy, strong pvp support spec and the casters love Power Infusion. Tri-spec was also an option, you still got more efficient and faster casting heals with pushback resistance.
---
So no, you didn't need to be primarily your healing spec, but you would have to put usually 20ish points into your healing spec, and you often gave up something.
---
still using ts3. i guess i will have to install discord for classic wow. ventrilo is outdated long ago as far as i know.
---
Results are obvious. 
---
I expect even less, i wont play it every day and certainly not to days in the weekend but i dont care actually - i just want to enjoy reading questlogs again and finding out stuff i forgot about. i also expect to be idling a lot trying to find groups for dungeons - no LFG so you cant quest and form a group at the same time so it will all take more time and more time to dick around :D
---
I’m the same, hopefully going to push for BiS if work schedule allows it man. 
---
I’m melee main so I’m torn between warrior and rogue. I’m leaning mainly towards Rogue at this point (I’m cool with contesting for gear to play a class I’ll enjoy for 2+ years.) 
---
The thing that keeps me thinking about warrior is the mobility... god it’s going to be slow again. 
---
Here's hoping!  As few changes as possible!
---
I really can't stop to wonder why some people are always asking irrelevant questions... Classic isn't even here. Classic content covers two or more years of game-play. And some dudes already be like: "what will happen after?". Thank god we have two years and a half of fun ahead of us... and that Retail will not be the only option anymore.
---
Considering the amount of bug reporting/feedback that came out of the demo, i.e. 2 zones, Blizzard have a hell of a lot to get working on for the rest of the game, and it's a bit worrying that we've seen no beta yet. It kinda makes me feel like Blizzard have their own version of Classic they want to execute, and community feedback isn't their priority for the game. That would be fine normally, but I'm finding it hard having enough faith in Blizzard to pull off Classic in the most authentic way possible.
---
I'm not even talking about sharding (which of course I'm against), but we've had no interaction with Blizzard in regards to progressive itemization, patch/dungeon/raid release schedule, the subtle things that don't have an obvious answer; Blizzard has remained quiet on all fronts :(
---
Thanks everyone for the replies!  I honestly havent touched any online game since wow so I'm very much out of the loop - I will look into getting discord!
---
anyone who breaks their dominant hand must use their other hand.  duh
---
Forest Mantle Leather was my shit.
---
fail, unless you're on TBC. Because there are only 51 talents.
---
I’d rather mounts and cosmetics be in shop (assuming you have to purchase a mount with gold to buy one on shop) over name and faction changes. No tmog though.
---
löl true
---
The entire premise of his post is the rest of the raid playing well below par except for the hunter. Good discussion. 
---
&gt; I’d rather mounts and cosmetics be in shop (assuming you have to purchase a mount with gold to buy one on shop) 
---
first step towards making WOW the anime shit its on retail
---
Maybe. But also consider this: I know it's a long shot, but could there maybe, just maybe, be a reason to give a trinket that gives 2% hit to some class that has a hitcap of 24% instead of a class that has a hitcap of 8.6%?
---
There usually is. I work nights and use to be in a guild called Hour Past Midnight. We raided from 1am-6am.
---
Orc is the best race when it comes to PvP. Stun resist is truly broken, but alliance have the advantage of Paladin buffs for premades whereas horde individually have better racials. 
---
Shamans have good group utility and incredible burst damage when you want to throw it out there.
---
For rogue, dagger progression is pretty bad while leveling and it just doesn’t match up to the damage of the blue dungeon swords pre-40, where the epic daggers come into play. Daggers has good burst and can be used for PvP effectively, but swords will often deal more damage through a CC chain. Which is better is more determined by your level bracket and what you can find, but you can make either work. Daggers are considerably slower to level solo, which is worth noting. The best PvP build (hemo) and best PvE build (deep combat) are both best with swords.
---
Are you simple? 
---
My favourite levelling zone is probably Redridge Mountains. For Alliance players, Redridge is most likely the first time you encounter orcs, and my God are they scary when three of them jump out at you from behind the boulders by the northern road out of Lakeshire.
---
Lakeshire itself feels like a proper sanctuary in the middle of a dangerous land, and what a beautiful town it is. It actually feels like a bustling lakeside village, plenty of NPCs and players moving about and interacting, lots of LFGs happening for Stonewatch, Bellygrub, Yowler, JJ Keeshan, etc.
---
Then you've got Stonewatch Keep which in itself feels like a mini-dungeon. Take a few friends there and kill Tharil'zun and Gath'Ilzogg and get rewarded by Magistrate Solomon back in Lakeshire with a fat purse of gold!
---
And on top of that you've got the best escort quest: busting Keeshan out of his prison in the cave up north. I remember joining a group to go free him, and we all ended up RPing organically (none of us were actual RPers) just from swapping stories of our adventures in the zone as we walked Keeshan back down to Lakeshire.
---
Redridge is bretty fricking cool I tell ya
---
I don’t want the Russians on my servers smfh. They’re already ruining Dota 2. 
---
“KOTL GIFF ME MANA”
---
I hated south shore, as well.. I would definitely recommend heading over to elwynn and stormwind because all the quests and next level zones are so compacted. 2 reasons I suggest this for you. 1) a new questing experience and when retail classic hits most people WILL end up in that zone so you will have plenty of time to quest in south shore then as the quest items by stormwind will be farmed and 2) you’ll be by EVERYTHING so you’ll level faster and there are even class trainers in elwynn so you won’t waste a bunch of time running around. That’s just my opinion! Oh, and I’m not sure if your pserver has instances running but deadlines is right there in west fall. Plus you get decent gear for that quest chain! 
---
 But you’d rather people be able to circumvent reputation by name change and realm transfers. I could care less if someone bought amount. Kinda hard for the community to self police if ninja’s can just name change or realm transfer.
---
dafuq?
---
Would Orc rogue beat out an Undead Rogue for PvP sake? I'm probably going to level with another melee class so I would really want to go Hemo, should I still go swords even if I have someone else to hold the aggro and I don't get much in combat besides Imp gouge?
---
I'm probably going to PvP more than anything else in the end-game so I'm torn on Rogue or Shaman but I'm leaning rogue since stealth adds a lot of fun to wPvP etc.
---
Those sharks always scared the crap out of me...hated going in the water offshore anywhere.
---
When this quests takes longer then reaching 110-120 in BFA...
---
It's not just the buffs but the types of players that are excluded and the type of behavior that is promoted when you require consumables for raid. People automatically start to care way more about not wasting time and not dying when they have to have expensive consumables active that they had to farm for. 
---
It just cannot be achieved without consumables in 99% of people, so that is a genius accidental design feature. The raid leader can yell all he wants about standing in the right fucking place and losing 50 dkp but it's not gonna work even half as well as simply enforcing consumable use.
---
I love duskwood too! Minus Mor’Ladim destroying you on the occasion and getting ganked by horde. STV is going to be a bitch when classic hits!
---
I also enjoyed when I levelled during a PUG dungeon run, and bunch of strangers spamming gratz in the group chat :)
---
Well, the world record is around 5 days, which is on a Hunter at around 120 hours. So unless you play a hunter at peak efficiency, you’ll be around 6-7 days if you’re still trying really hard. 
---
I’m currently playing a Druid, just swapped to resto at 56 and I’m gonna dungeon my way to 60, I think I’m already at 15 days, which is 360, so I think I’ll cap at 400 hrs.
---
Lawdy 
---
Yeah I'm ok with gear comp, but I feel like caster is gonna be decently stronger than melee, at least solo, but all the pve rotations are painful
---
You can be sure that i have more /played in back in the day vanilla than you.
---
Hi Xaine. It's rare you'll be able to fit hunters mark on a raid boss. There's just better choices.
---
typing ding every time u lvl is arrogant/egotistic, nobody cares, everyone goes thru the lvling process, i'd understand if you type it when you hit 60, but every lvl? wow dude, nobody cares when u hit lvl 18 frick off loser
---
I feel this is a big misrepresentation of hunters. Firstly, you're wearing wierd pieces in all three of your sets. Secondly, you're using lupos on a patch in which it's fixed, making it a subpar pet for hunter dps. Thirdly, you're not trinketswapping. Fourthly, if you wanna min max your hunter, you should weave in a hard hitting 2h in between your rotation.   
---
Of all the above, your gearing choices and lack of trinketswapping makes the biggest difference. Overall i think you're missing \~100 dps. 
---
You can stay floating for any boss fight exccept loatheb with mana pots and dark/demonic runes
---
Is there something with the question format? I haven't played legion, they are using a legion engine, so it's kind of logical to assume pets work the same way? 
---
Surely some people here must have played legion that can give me a hand in this.
---
tbh forgot about that
---
Most people just use the weekly catch up mechanism and get within 5% of top raider gear instantly. There's like no point in working towards anything in wow anymore unless you're in the very cutting edge. 
---
If you pick a pve server for classic, you've missed the entire point.
---
The pve content isn't what made the game good....
---
That it is, and this story hit the spot with high school, LOL
---
Okay here it goes. 
---
Undead mage (because I've never leveled a mage before and I hear its fun)
---
Or
---
Tauren Warrior ( because I LOVE the beginning zone of tauren. Lots of nostalgia there, plus warrior ain't so bad)
---
OR 
---
Level both? 
---
Yes it is? PVP is actually a joke when you one or two shot everyone. Raids still exist on pve servers, which is the entire reason I want to play the game, and farming for mats while getting attacked ESPECIALLY if I don't play a dps character is not appealing whatsoever. 
---
Oh shit lfr is in legion client too, we’re screwed!!
---
I don't mind server transfers, but not name changes. Being able to change name can remove past history of being a ninja or dickhead. 
---
Why should something suddenly scale, when it didnt scale in vanilla ?
---
sure theyre using the legion engine, scaling isnt dependant on the engine. 
---
its code that can be written differently
---
Level your 2nd favorite with a friend. Level your favorite alone. All I can say based off that
---
Pets didn’t scale, so pets won’t scale. Regardless of the Legion client.
---
Zzz
---
That's actually a great idea. I can play tauren with my bro
---
Ts and mumble &gt; discord
---
Blizzard tried to integrate chat into the WoW client at one point, but it wasn't very good. Since I have not touched retail in the last 5 years, I have no idea if it's still a thing.
---
Most people in the pserver community are using Discord these days.
---
Found the alliance player.
---
Exactly what I'm doing with my friend. Shaman with his warrior and priest alone
---
Are you like twelve or something? 
---
Focus felt like it was community first, with gameplay a very close second.
---
I really want to play druid healer but I'm scared because everyone here says they're shit and not taken to raids. Don't know what to do :'(
---
I usually just skip ashenv (unless im going for the couple gear quests) just because of how much more walking there is compared to other zones. And no UC rep for my main to grind out with.
---
Awesome. Thanks! :)
---
Playing PVE server is like playing half the game. People still farm mats on PVP server, only it’s more challenging, and you might have to fight for them. 
---
High latency from a server is just as rare as finding  a way to get epics and a guild on a Chinese server 
---
I’m going to reroll.
---
Try downloading the retail client. It should be similar. If it runs the current game on low setting you should be fine. 
---
It gets really daunting towards the end too. Too bad i'm an altoholic.
---
Because I am *assuming* the possibillity of this being the same category as spellbatching, I do not know if it will be in or not. 
---
I just wanna know the % of scaling hunter pets took from the hunter gear or how that system worked in legion.
---
I'd you're playing classic for the sole purpose of only raiding and nothing else I would highly suggest you just stick to retail which has much more fleshed out raids. 
---
Raiding while is a great source of gear, is a tiny part of vanilla and isn't what people hold fond memories over.
---
But hey, enjoy your half game, I guess.
---
He says pvp is a joke lmao
---
Here’s the thing. I LOVE priest in vanilla, yes even leveling.
---
You won’t pay 50g for a respect right off the rip at 60, if you do it right you’ll pay 1g and if you respec before then it goes to 5g. You ABSOLUTELY need to level as shadow. You can add talents in shadow/discipline all the way to 60 and still heal damn good in instances. If you have the skill enough. I was asked constantly to heal in instances as a priest- even with being shadow I gathered gear for leveling and for instances. So DMG for leveling and healing gear for instances. You’ll be fine. Even though you get shadow form at level 40 as you level you can still put talent points into shadow/discipline and get skills like Mind Flay. Until you’re in a guild that raids you can stay shadow if you wanted to and still be a decent healing in a UBRS group. 
---
I was in a guild that had BWL on farm by the time my main hit 60 I respecd to holy minutes later and I was off to MC. 
---
If you have any questions about priest in classic please PM me!
---
Why would John need strenght thought
---
Excuse me for not wanting to get constantly ganked while farming/fishing/waiting in Blackrock.
---
"these people's version of fun isn't my version of fun, thus they are wrong" 
---
Good argument point.
---
If having a PVE server experience wasn't part of the game...why would they have included it?
---
they don't have the raw strength of other healers, but as long as you show up and know your class you wont have any problems finding a spot, motw is a mandatory buff, and br/innervate are extremely valuable
---
Depends on the spec for shaman, if you are willing to do the meta/ele resto spec you wont have any problems getting into a premade
---
Only one time. On my warrior surprisingly enough 
---
well, true with that... but, on the other hand, if he changes a name, and ninja's again, he will have to change his name again, or he'll be known. One item ninja'ed every 6 months, won't change much.
---
Another thing is friendlists that track name changes. And, judging by behavior, a sudden appearance of level 60 weirdo, etc.
---
58 more levels sir. Your title didn't specify talents, only your picture showed it as something *you* might be thinking about after gaining a level.
---
I ran a classic client (private server) on my MacBook Air 2015 and it ran on low just fine. Never had a chance to test raids or pvp, though. 
---
I was running a private server on my Mac I got in 2011 or 2012. I’m sure your 2018 could handle it.
---
This is just a complete guess but I'd assume youd be fine, but need to have your graphic options really low or you'll lag in cities or raids.
---
You could download wow and start a free trial to see how it runs to test it. Classic will be similar 
---
We don’t know how the launch experience is going to be. Sharding, increased spawns, etc. I remember at launch it taking forever just to get to level 10 because there were people everywhere and the servers crashed a lot. 
---
Trying to do any kind of math is a waste of time in my eyes unless your not planning on starting your character until months after launch. 
---
https://discord.gg/VYKTVJ  -  PvP specific
---
https://discord.gg/8zcK3N  -  Guild recruitment specifically
---
You're gonna make me cry. John's a good man.
---
You can do ALL the pve content on a pve server. You can't get the pvp experience on a pve server.
---
You have never in your life played on a private server. You have no idea how hellish it is compared to easy mode empty vanilla servers. 
---
For his Hunter alt
---
Yes, classic will run on a toaster
---
At least it is evidence people are excited. 
---
As for the question, Blizzard will just do as they will regardless, doesn't much matter what these 200 answer strawpolls say. Personally I hope I'm not no-lifing BC content like I plan to for Vanilla.
---
bro do you mind? we're trying to circlejerk here 
---
My body is ready.
---
Hi, /u/Eclectic_Epileptic
---
Nono, that's not what I meant. That is at most 10% on average compared to *each other*.
---
Top 10 are 1% apart from the *total* DPS and not from each other. For example if you take a total of 1k DPS and 100 players all doing roughly 10 DPS each then the guy doing 9 DPS and the gal doing 10 DPS are 10% apart in comparison to each other but in total DPS were talking 1%. DPS meters always show total DPS.
---
I member
---
It'll be playable on low settings and possibly even at 1440 x 900 but cities will be laggy and raiding won't work great either. The primary issue is the Intel UHD Graphics 617 chipset. You can get one of those external GPUs that work over Thunderbolt 3 but if you go down that road make sure and research the exact specs on your Macbook, Thunderbolt isn't a very settled standard yet so you need to put a bit of time into ensuring it's all going to be compatible.
---
"Stop liking what I dont like!"
---
His pvp experience is probably from a pve server where he flagged up for some "pvp" and either couldn't find anyone, or got rekt by the huge imbalance pve servers cause in pvp. Where no one flags unless they have the upper hand.
---
Id rather play the whole game and not get camped out of instances for hours. But enjoy that if you want i guess.
---
Hunter pulls are convenient due to higher range and it makes it a little easier to trap targets. It's not a huge deal. Warriors generally want to pull so we let them. I mean the fastest, most fluent way would be a Warrior pull and while the mobs run the Hunter distracts one melee target into a trap, but that costs slightly more mana for the Hunter.
---
TBC port and extra content are potentially equally interesting to me, but BC is just the obvious answer. The people will want it after years of Vanilla, it's easy to reproduce, easier than Vanilla in fact. And it will keep people subbed for another 2-3 years... how long can 1-2 raids really keep people subbed, in a world already full of raids?
---
Wow. This is what I needed. Those times seem pretty accurate too.
---
However, ur math dumb bro
---
No love for Loch Modan? Some of my fondest memories doing those trogg quests.
---
&gt; **What Should I Play** 
---
Night elf Druid. Balance.
---
I cant do all the pve content actually. Theres like a 20% chance of making it through southern barrens without being camped the whole time with huge corpse runs.
---
I can still do bgs and world pvp on pve servers.
---
And I leveled my first char (priest) entirely without wanding. Didnt even know it was a thing :)
---
It isn't worth mixing the trees early.  Go full into one or the other.  You're missing out on important talents by juggling.
---
I remember sometime in cata, people just stopped. I said ding and was met with silence.
---
Crazy how fast it changed :/
---
That's some serious progress. 
---
Paladins aren't exactly exciting to level, but team up with a warrior and you guys can wreck through a lot of quests and imo I enjoy the play style. Paladins are god healers, flash of light is so OP and almost any raid with good paladins will have them topping the meters just cause they can snipe easy. Running a 15 man with two healers and the other is a druid? you'll easily be doing 80% of the heals just cause the druid cant get there fast enough. Plus the blessings are obviously great and in demand
---
haha now a days he wouldnt even be able to have said anything as he would have been muted by their garbage system
---
I wish I had the fortitude to roll a Troll priest, but I shall be a Troll Mage and I shall enjoy it. 
---
My exact thoughts. I've been trying to get hunter out of my mind and pick something desirable. Almost settled for priest but I've made up my mind to just play a class I will enjoy the most and that is hunter :)
---
1-20 is quick and exciting to bang out. 20-30 is a couple evenings taking it slow, traveling a bit more. 30-40 similar but slower. Around 45 I start to do a level a night so i can get some sleep and take it at a casual fun pace. 
---
Or helpful PSAs in battlegrounds like "/me has reported you AFK. Please type /afk cancel to remove this report and continue playing."
---
They will work exactly as they did in vanilla, we know this as a fact! 
---
Otherwise the ripple affect could completely change the game 
---
I agree with that. 
---
Legion was with no lag for me, WoD scared away a lot of people. Wich Legion could not bring back. Then in BFA we have some issues but mostly because people had hope. 
---
Now the fucking lag we get with more than 40 people on a zone is outrageous and sharding adds to the fire. 
---
I don't know what results I was expecting but it wasn't this.
---
Projecting, the post. 
---
You shouldve had two more options
---
Tbc port and Classic updates in spirit of vanilla
---
Tbc port and classic updates while keeping the original realms to keep Classic the same
---
Radical position here. Play whatever you enjoy.
---
I'd be totally fine with that, how are Shamans for world pvp/ganks etc? I imagine nobody can ever compete with a Rogue but are they decent?
---
Usually casual raids bring only 1 shadow priest, minmaxing guilds bring disc with shadow weaving. 
---
For raiding as shadow you need many consumables, because you oom very fast, but til mid bwl you can do mediocre damage, but when pure dps classes get more crit you are will be on bottom. 
---
Back when I played vanilla all day everyday.  I remember being extremely tired in the morning taking a shower before school, and half dreamed/lived WoW.  I would thinking of real life people and try to remember what class they are, IRL. 
---
Then realize that the game wasn't real and that people aren't mages nor warlocks IRL. 
---
&gt;thinking about playing on chinese servers because I want to avoid high latency
---
and playing in Chinese, but guilds have to be English?
---
No changes REeEeeeee. Sometimes people dont realize they want versions of the game after vanilla, memory sometimes fail.
---
But everything before cata was good.
---
It already will because of spellbatching, rogues in vanilla were not able to gouge-restealth-sap IWIN combo to infinity but they can in wow classic because of how the engine works. 
---
I mean looking at wowpedia they added a change that gave pets 33% of their attack power and they increased this to 60%. But this was 2016 and I don't even know what period legion was from. I just wanna know how the hunter pet system worked in legion.
---
Nah, WC is the horde equivalent of Deadmines. The level brackets for those are exactly the same.
---
There really is no alliance equivalent of RFC and there is no horde equivalent of Stocks. 
---
To each their own. Roll PvE if you don't want to deal with world PvP/ganking, roll PvP if you do.
---
Personally? I'm gonna roll PvP and deal with my lumps as I level up. I'm also gonna go ahead and gank some mofo's when I get to a higher level. To me that is an essential element of the classic feel because that was a big part of the experience for me when I played. 
---
What's going to be annoying is the people who roll on a PvP server who then whine all the time about getting ganked. If you don't want to deal with that element of the game, then don't roll on the server type that supports it. The only response you deserve is "PvP occurred on a PvP server".
---
That said, there's a difference between whining and calling out in general chat for help. That is actually great because when 60's come to defend it can create natural open world PvP battles. It's just when that calling for help devolves into "no life loser", "our faction doesn't do this!" (yes it does), etc where it turns over into whining.
---
People will argue for either forsaken or Orc, but Orc is much more useful. Here is why:
---
The rogue PvP rank-2 trinket already removes charm, fear, and polymorph, which covers priests, warlocks, and mages. Undead have will of the forsaken, which counters an additional charm or fear. People can claim that this additional CC block will win you engagements, and that’s true to some extent. However, unless you are facing the rare and nearly unkillable in 1v1 soul-link warlock, you will have already lost the fight if you let your opponent get 2 fears off on you. 
---
Rogue PvP is all about opportunity and control more than pure burst like casters are. You have more CC than any other class in the game. Cheapshot, kidneyshot (different diminishing return than cheapshot), sap, gouge, blind, slowing poisons, possibly engineering items, special trinkets like the tidal charm, special weapon stun procs, mace stun procs (different diminishing return than cheap &amp; kidney), dropping combat through a CC to refresh diminishing returns, preparation to get all your cooldowns back for more CC/anti-roots etc.
---
With all of that in your toolkit, if you let your opponent gain the upper hand, either: you made some mistakes, your opponent is an exceptional player, you engaged outside of stealth or without cooldowns, or your enemy is an orc.
---
Every single class has access to stuns in some form. Many classes (Paladins, warriors, rogues, warlocks, druids, priests, etc) directly have stuns in their kits or talents, whereas all classes have access to coveted things like the tidal charm. Stuns are the most powerful form of CC because you can be hit as hard as your health allows within the timeframe and the CC will not dissipate, as even fear does. Therefore, you will see a ton of stuns in duels, WPvP, and battlegrounds. The only way to have a chance of avoiding the stuns is to: pick very specific class talents that reduce stun chance (prot warrior, disc priest, Paladin [?]), a class with a stun trinket (which rogues don’t have), or pick orc.
---
As an orc, not only do you have stun resist, but you also have a free melee dps cooldown. This is seriously a no brainer, as long as you like/can put up with playing as an orc.
---
Duskwood. Lots of quests, and the vibe is spooky.
---
I'm not sure what you're saying with this
---
Jokes aside, vanilla coke tastes pretty bad after the first few sips
---
There was a guild "Lost in WoW" on the server I was on.
---
i'd say so spammers / toxic ppl get silenced asap so they can't bother other players anymore. Atleast i'd like a gold selling spammer to get silenced asap and not that they can keep spamming untill a GM gets involved. 
---
It should be more than fine. Just don't have a lot of other things (especially Chrome) running simultaneously while playing WoW. Macs tend to overheat easily.
---
Priest has a solid leveling status in classic. About the middle of the pack. 
---
Ranged damage and can heal self. Easier to pull specific mobs as you're not facepulling. 
---
Respec is 1G not 50 lol. Does it even get to 50? Thought max respec was 25. 
---
All priest levelers are "Shadow before 40" [Something like this](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVZZx0gdcto) for lvl 39 talent build. Then respec so you can get Shadowform. 
---
The keys pre40 are Wand damage and Spirit Tap. (Note you need the killing blow to trigger Spirit tap. Keep in mind while duo or group questing)
---
Notice that these are both T1 talents so really you can do whatever. 
---
Also I haven't leveled a priest to 60 but have messed around in early levels so take all this with some salt but not too much. 
---
For Shaman however. They do it all. Literally. You'll always get a spot in dungeons as you can heal. Dps isn't that great overall. I went ele at 40 and couldn't think of grinding mobs AA'ing praying for procs ever again. Plus ele for Pvp is insane. I know much more about Shaman than I personally do Priest but hope this was helpful. Let me know if you have any questions.  
---
thats bad news :´(
---
Yes it bounces where ever. Chain Heal is the only "smart heal" in the game. 
---
It's not even the same zone. Feels like you're playing a completely different game. You will spend hours unraveling the lore and quests of Silverpine Forest.
---
It feels like a big place in which you are just a small entity and the loneliness it creates can only be countered by working alongside others.
---
Pyrewood Village is level 13 Elites. It's a damn micro-dungeon. 
---
Chain Heal bounces where it wants to. Not just within group. 
---
You kinda missed the points where John ninjaes the staff to use it as town gear and then eventually after 2 days of you pestering him endlessly and making him the bottom of the barrel in the server, so much that even members of the opposing faction don't even corpse camp him, so finally he relents and disenchants the staff in front of the auction house. 
---
Other than that, yeah, I kinda missed the social part of the little isolated server-world and the shared journey you sometimes got to experience if you were lucky enough.
---
The last big vanilla pserver to launch which was in june or july I can't remember now had 10k+ online at launch and had zero issues. At most I think there was one restart where it was down for 2 minutes but otherwise I played from 7 Am to 3 AM straight. 
---
I've played Legion retail on a MacBook Air from 2016, I logged the working hours as "stress test" for the machine.  
---
I could actually use decent enough detail, and get a decent enough framerate (around 35 fps without sacrificing too much detail, could get higher with lower detail).  
---
But it was heating a bit too much, for my taste (I have a bad past history with overheating computers.)
---
The items are not that important. The most important thing is that you are now away from the infinite swarm of level 1-5 players fighting over the same mobs. So you'll basically have little to no competition
---
I haven’t really played one, but I feel like for warlocks it should be Drain Soul. They have to cast it all the time, after all.
---
They tried integrating voice chat in patch 2.2.0 (tbc)  
---
    
---
But yeah you're right, it was so horrible that the collective WoW community even forgot it existed until last year when Blizzard replaced it with the Bnet voice feature.
---
I've done all rights in real vanilla up to huhu and Ill be able to reliably turn up and know how to gear :)
---
Min/max guilds will have a 0/31/20 healer priest to shadow weave.
---
So in the retail vanilla I mained a warlock. After much debate with myself over a couple months flop flopping between a warlock again mage, warrior, and back and forth between the three I've settled on warrior. I'm going to focus on tanking as I got a taste of it after vanilla and really enjoyed it. So my question is what professions should I use for my warrior? I was thinking of doing two gathering profs while leveling to help make money then keeping one at 60 and dropping the other for a crafting one. Any thoughts? 
---
I fell for that once.
---
Yeah I'm putting some ??? there, Hunter pets is something that you would eventually integrate into the engine and not as a seperate entity because that makes no sense from a dev standpoint. 
---
Like they might do a vanilla like thing and put the pet scaling % to 0 in order to get a more accurate wow classic experience but the whole system to manage that will be there in it's legion architecture. So they will already be different purely because of how the AI works but thats a different topic. 
---
My question is how legion handeld pets
---
I mean thats the closest representation of what we will most likely see (cause there ain't no communication from blizz so make do with info you can gather) hence I don't think it's a weird stretch to think wow classic pets will scale. Hence I'm looking for information as to how that system worked
---
You seem like a reasonable person/s. So I'm gonna go ahead and let you continue in your misguided ways. The only place there is a good chance you will be camped for an extended period of time is in STV and maybe the pirate area in tanaris. Other than that, it rarely happens unless you're publicly broadcasting your location like on Twitch. There is no way to get the full experience of a pvp server on a pve server. It literally can't happen, and k feel sorry for people that refuse to experience it, because it is handedly the best aspect of the game. It makes the world so much bigger and mysterious.
---
They tried adding some elements of vanilla with the leveling changes, and it was very ill received. No I’m not taking about scaling but they actually made it so leveling took more time. Backlash was huge. Largely because it’s such a different game that longer leveling in retail makes it boring and less fun.
---
That's how I played and will play once again. If an item can/will be used by another person in the group, if they want it they can have it. After all, I want the Horde to be better then the Alliance, so why not help my fellow outcasts?
---
Surely it’s Polymorph or Blink for a mage
---
Wow classic/wow vanilla
---
I try to toss a HoT so locks can life tap if I have the extra manna. But it's nice if they wait for me confirm that I have the manna to spare before going balls deep on lifetap. And as for pulling extras as dps, if I see the tank is cool with it and is working cooperatively with the dps on chain pulls then it's cool with me too. Like you said, the tank is your bro.
---
I'm so tired of those 2004 stereotypes lmao. You can do just fine late game as well, pulling around 400dps + 10-15% of every warlock in the raid group. Meaning you will be on the top 10, only increasing more for every warlock in the raid. But you never bring more than 1 shadowpriest, since you wont benefit from that. Also if you die you just devaluated your raidspot by 100% since you're there for shadowweaving. Also offheals ftw.
---
You're right, that makes it even better. You can just spam heal the main tank.
---
Mage would definitely be Conjure Water!! 
---
You're not playing the whole game by removing the whole aspect of contested zones. You're playing a nerfed version.
---
People were against them. DK cried their face of complaining "can't kill dwarfs" etc. 
---
It's a contested zone. You're removing that entire aspect of the game when you choose a pve server. You remove consequence from your actions. I can't fathom the idea of someone letting a horde just ninja loot a thorium node after you clear the mob, ya know?
---
This whole notion that pvp servers are just people (especially rogues) ganking lowbies or ganking people fishing all day is kind of dumb. Most classes can easily counter rogues anyways.
---
Also: No weapon upgrades for hunters after BWL. They have to wait for KT.
---
Have you played on any private servers recently? If we are talking about comparison to each other, fury warriors will routinely DOUBLE the dps of hunters lol like 700 personal dps vs 350 dps type of comparison. Furies do this early on too and then scale even harder later. They can excel early with pay to win gear like lionheart and devilsaur etc. The only times hunters come close is like you mentioned earlier on onyxia and threat based fights. You can verify all of this by looking at random legacy logs parses, personally I've watched it happen bc I was that tryharding fury obsessing over the meters. I actually started as a mage for pvp, and full on rerolled to a warrior when I saw other warriors (who I knew were poor players mechanically) excel on the meters while I was stuck decursing.
---
You may think I just played with poor hunters or something but this is also consistent with what i would see on legacylogs when comparing top guilds like progress. It gets even worse if you allow r14 weapons into the mix lol
---
There's actually a bunch of sharks all over the coats.
---
There are some in the SoS, North of Tirisfal, and I also remember some being off the coast of Feralas and Azshera.
---
I'm sure I'm probably wrong on one or two of those spots, and they're probably listed in the wiki.
---
Shame you can't somehow tame them as a hunter or get any loot since they are so far out of the way.
---
Pigtail animation is the best animation
---
I'll admit i'm too much of a girls blouse to play on PvP servers, plus I don't have the time for extra corps runs.  
---
RP PvE here I come!
---
Always loved that one!
---
There was a purple ring from SM lib I think around lvl 29. Ardent Custodian at 39ish as well
---
Level 18? That's super early to get a pair of shoulders. On some of my characters I think I've gone into the 30's not wearing any (I don't like to buy stuff from the AH while leveling because it's a waste of gold in most cases).
---
&gt;I did a little bit of searching for information on this topic, but I like data and doing things my own way. My favorite topical thing I’ve come across so far is this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9qfm86/fedex_and_four_kills_a_launch_rush_to_level_8/
---
I've changed things up a bit. [New Human Route](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_n2be6WJYnGxQUioBGd7JGYY7FtlU0ThwGcO8Mh69M/edit?usp=sharing) - my last run was 3:25 to level 10, not 6/8 anymore - only doing one kill quest, Webwood Venom to open up 5,000xp + of more exploration quests.
---
[Human 1-5 part of the route](https://youtu.be/rscZrZ4JppY)
---
I still think this is going to be the optimal path to 10 at launch.
---
This reminds me of Zul Gurub with Bloodlord and Jindo. Always got a laugh, even while wiping.
---
Pretty sure hunters need that though. 
---
I love me vanilla coke, too bad I can almost never find it in stores.
---
At least the new Coca Cola fountain machines give you the option for it. My go to every time I hit up Five-Guys.
---
Server transfers can do the same, you can actually get a free name change with a server transfer so...
---
That depends on world buffs etc and whether you just progress and wipe a lot, or it is a farm raid. I don't think any hunter (unless naxx geared) can outdps fully world buffed pre-raid fury warrior for example.
---
Heresy.
---
Try mixing it with a spiced rum or whisky.
---
It's late in the leveling process, but I've always loved Winterspring.
---
It's just a pretty zone to spend time. Either that or the rep grind for the mount gave me Stockholm Syndrome.
---
Yeah but make sure its at least a Kenmore with a convection cook setting.
---
Black an Deckers work too, but only the larger models.
---

---
Combat spec for rogues doesn't exist in Legion, therefore it won't exist in classic?
---
I don't think you realise what you are asking...
---
The problem I have with TBC is that, although it adds 2-3 years of relevant content for existing players, for new players and alts you *only* get 2-3 years of relevant content. Nothing that came before matters. That's how they ended up with a 14-year-old game with only 4 months of relevant content.
---
I'm not saying *all* content should be relevant but finding some middle ground should be nice. Releasing new content shouldn't make a near-equal amount of content obsolete.
---
Rogue is definetly stealth
---
&gt; My question is how legion handeld pets
---
It doesn't even matter, because they will be handled differently, just like they were in vanilla, in classic.
---
Mis the old talent point so much
---
You are right
---
Here in Iowa they have it at every store 20oz and 12 packs.
---
&gt;i really like shadow but i dont wanna sit on the bench nor be forced to heal.
---
Any hybrid you play that isn't healing will be in this situation. There are guilds that won't care and will bring you along. Others will slam the door in your face. 
---
Sure thing, see you in Azeroth
---
Raiding is not a tiny part at all, it’s actually a very large part of the game. And there are tons of people who have fond memories of MC, BWL, AQ40, etc. many of us made great friends while raiding. It was a totally different feel than retail, so I’d not follow your suggestion at all. 
---
I think most of you are overestimating PvP by quite a lot. Sure, it’s fun and it has its moments, but world PvP is not half the game, not even close. The vast majority of PvP can still be done on PvE servers. 
---
That being said I have always played on a PvP server, and always will. But I think we all need to stop pretending world PvP is half the game. But, even if it was who cares, there’s so much to the game that the overwhelming majority are not playing 100% or even close. 
---
To truly play 100% you’d need to do all the content with all the classes and races which is unfathomable in my opinion. 
---
I remember doing quests in tanaris and having 3 60 rogues killing me all over the place. I called in general and 5 level 60 and 2 mid 50's folks showed up and escorted me around for a little while. Once them even found one of the rogures and put em in the ground. Then while doing my quests I ended up in a guild with one of the people that came to help. It really helped me connect with people, turns out adversity bring people together lol. 
---
Yeah, I'd totally toss a renew or rejuv, but I was on a pally at the time so that wasn't really an option and they'd do life talk right before the pull
---
I wish that were true but  as i said i tried it, and you'll just end up in the same zone has everyone else, it's not that fast and people do get out of that starting zone.
---
It is so bad. Just every 10 minutes a flagcarry try is fun with all cds.But except this, it sucks.
---
A priest is still top tier at all three of the aforementioned content areas.
---
\+5 strength has never caused this type of friendship fracture ... +6 strength though and I would be going full NUCLEAR.
---
That's weird, I seam to remember BGs on pve  servers were available....
---
I started in early wrath and I people were definitely talking to each other quite a bit, seemed to die down in cata though
---
Please tell me more how you know more about my experiences than i do.
---
Hey I play Pserver on Macbook Air 2016 and it runs super smoothly but I can't run retail 
---
Just like when you go from 3rd grade to 4th grade, you also start picking on the 3rd graders, because you yourself was picked on by 4th graders.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills - Searing Gorge - Barrens

---

check out the youtube content creator "Tipsoutbaby"
---
he has a few of these comparisons for the top parses from different raid levels on his youtube videos
---
heres a random pic from the BWL video I just made, but if you check out his channel he has them for other raid tiers too
---
https://i.imgur.com/w1SBLeV.jpg
---
fury wars avg 753 dps in bwl,  hunters average 443.
---
so bringing a fury is almost as good as bringing 2 hunters.. the different in dps is 310.. compared to the hunters 443 TOTAL
---
:( RIP
---
OP writes word problems for middle school math text books. I can just tell.  
---
Eww, you're going to equip that thing JUST to level instead of AH it? Gross.  
---
What you actually do: Agree to put it on the auction house and split the profits.  
---
Except in this universe there's an alternative 3rd and 4th grade you can go to that doesn't involve being picked on. AKA a PvE server.
---
Again, if someone doesn't like the trial by fire that is leveling on a PvP server then they shouldn't choose a PvP server. PvE servers are there for their purpose. People can't get mad if they willingly choose to subject themselves to it.
---
Same here, but we do live near Atlanta so I would hope so.
---
Worth noting that chain heal used to bounce to anyone, even if they were 100% HP. It was changed later to intuitively jump to people with 99% or less HP.  
---
What doesn't kill you(permanently) makes you stronger.
---
I totally understand your viewpoint, but I also think that people can have better interactions in a world where PvP lures around any corner.
---
i feel that way with dr. pepper lol
---
Definitely. World PvP and ganking can lead to great interactions and camaraderie within your faction. I wouldn't trade it for anything. That's why PvE servers aren't for me.
---
This guy loves sitting naked in goldshire 
---
That is a sad mentality to have when youre not in 3rd grade.
---
It already tastes of rum and coke though!
---
It will always be Vanilla wow for me and not Classic. It was Vanilla from Day 1 of TBC, and so that’s what I’ve always known it as. 
---
What kind of high-roller can afford to buy a full set of plate armor at level 40? Also weirdly a lot of plate that requires level 40 has armor equivalent to mail pieces, and some pieces a few levels higher too, so it's not even worth it. Watch out if you're buying low level plate gear, compare the armor value before buying.
---
Have you actually played on a PvP server? Or is your experience solely from flagging on a PvE server? I ask because you have a MUCH worse time on a PvE server when you're flagged than you do on a pvp server. Like, I could actually see people on a PvE server camping someone that is flagged for hours, if the person let them.
---
Warlocks conjure firestone obviously
---
Only pick on someone in your own grade?
---
Cool I didn't know about this
---
The amount of dense people in this thread is amazing. So much salt about not experiencing the full game. PvE servers remove the whole idea of contested zones. You're removing so many player interactions, which create a strong community, when you roll on pve servers.
---
I swear, if you people would actually play on a PvP server, you would enjoy the game even more-so than you did on your PvE server. It's not nearly even remotely as bad as you guys think. I get some people want more of a single player game, but what's the point in playing World of Warcraft (mmo, based on a faction based pvp element) at that point? There are better pve games.. hell retail has more challenging pve content.
---
PS: There is a reason the popular private servers were all PvP servers and not PvE.
---
I don't think that the reason pets didn't scale was due specifically to the client in vanilla. I would therefore not expect them to scale in classic. Hunter pets started scaling with AP in TBC I believe so that would eliminate your argument about the engine as well. I think you should plan for non scaling pets in classic. 
---
Kind of creating a "no true scotsman" fallacy there aren't ya?  The way you phrased it makes it seem like you think World PvP doesn't exist on PvE realms, or following up on that; that you think that because of perhaps a lack of World PvP no great interactions/camaraderie exist on PvE servers...
---
Y.. Yes thank you I can read. 
---
So it's just a shitpost with no meaning?
---
On the one hand I respect your opinion....
---
But on the other, imagine questing in contested zones and never worrying for your life?

Make your own groups if you don’t like it. It’s perfectly acceptable to reserve 1 item if you are the one putting the group together. No one is forcing you to join.
---
Although I'm really against the exploration route for early xp gain and think people should just tough it out for 2 hours in the starting zone, this is incredible work and really fun to see even if I do end up not using it
---
Which two? 
---
The best experiences I ever had were PACKED pvp pservers in STV. 
---
We managed to wrangle a 7v7 while both factions were waiting for Sin Dahl to spawn. Literally just a line staring at each other across the green jungle of STV
---
Then she spawns, and those retards engaged her
---
If you don’t know Classic elite mobs were nothing to fuck with. Sindal hits like a truck, you need a dedicated healer to keep alive whoever is tanking that.
---
As SOON as they engaged her, it was a 7v7 all out bloodbath. The funnest vanilla fight I ever took place erupted. I shifted out of cat and started Dot healing our whole team, their rogue saw me and insta jumped me and he was 4 levels up, then our lock tried to chain fear him but he was resisting a decent amount with 4 levels, had to shift bear to tank him, meanwhile a million other scraps were ongoing. 
---
sindahl melted their tank and helped us wipe them, and since none of us had touched her she reset her position without attacking us. We rezzed our boys, tagged her, on to the next.
---
Long live PvP servers!
---
It matters to me, now clearly we are from different universes but since it doesn't matter to you could you please answer my question as to how they worked.
---
How can you hate Discord? It's pretty innocuous.
---
In pvp I see it as
---
Warrior - Charge/Intercept
---
Paladin - Bubble
---
Hunter - Freezing trap
---
Rogue - Cheap shot
---
Priest - Dispel magic
---
Shaman - Chain lightning
---
Mage - Blink
---
Warlock - Fear
---
Druid - Travel form
---
Gank the noobs 
---
&gt; Meaning you will be on the top 10
---
yeah no
---
Yes I'm asking how legion pets work, no more no less. This is one of those things I think might sneak through in classic. Maybe it will maybe it won't but can I atleast have some help with how legion pets work?
---
No. People littleraly say that and other shit in game now with no repercussions. You will get banned for racism and other shit though.
---
Exactly! That's the experiences PvE server players miss, and that's what I'm talking about how PvE servers can't get the PvP experience that is really only available on PvP servers. You can do everything on a PvP server that a PvE server can do, but not the other way around.
---
For some reason they think BGs are THE pvp lol.
---
Uhm, ok clearly me and you are from different universes since what you are saying sounds to me like they would have pet scaling whereas you think that is an argument for pet's not scaling. At any rate do you have any knowledge of how legion pets worked?
---
Good but from someone who leveled both paladin and warrior, paladin is actually a worse leveler. Stop saying war is the worst
---
Naw most of them will be initial levels. So you’d have to have a macro and furiously smash it.
---
As most of the content is, at least until classic is released. Is it your first time here?
---
It got harder to find vanilla Coke after it's initial launch, but I can find 12 packs in grocery stores and single bottles in gas stations. The freestyle fountain version just isn't the same.
---
#Nochanges
---
My pvp experience is playing a rogue in vanilla where I would just look at you and you'd die since m rogue was t3 geared. It was a joke lmao
---
As a vanilla paladin, my signature move was surely divine shield and hearthstone.
---
Raiding in retail isn't fun to me. TO ME I am looking forward to vanilla raiding the most. What's up with all these people telling me I'm playing wrong? Gtfo with that bs.
---
Having issues deciding between Tauren druid, orc shaman or Tauren druid when classic releases.
---
I love the idea of enhancement orc, but elemental Tauren seems way more interesting with warstomp.  
---
Druid's flavor is appealing to me, but the consensus that the class is p weak has me wary about playing them 
---
I always score Vanilla Coke at Cafe Rio! Can never find it in other places.
---
I am saying that I don't believe pet scaling is directly related to the client. Since pets didn't scale in vanilla they will not scale in classic. How pets worked in legion is not relevant to how they will be in legion. Your argument is on par with "since defense didn't exist in legion as a stat it won't be in classic" which it most certainly will. Pet scaling is a mechanic that did not exist in vanilla and will certainly not exist in classic.

Vanilla is what can no longer be experienced. The original game in the original time.  Classic is the 1.13 remaster we are receiving.
---
No it's really not. To me I don't gaf about pvp so pve raiding IS THE GAME. Stop telling me how to play.
---
Possibly the best post in this sub's life. And I don't say that lightly - there have been may brilliant posts.
---
Google would be your best bet, or the retail wow reddit. A website like petopia might be able to help but most guides will be updated to reflect BFA rather than Legion.
---
There's absolutely zero chance they will work like this in Classic though, it's not something that's tied to the client.
---
I'm taking 1 week off and rushing to 40 as fast as I can then buying my mount. I'll play about 8 hours everyday that week. After that i'm just going to casually play 3-5 hours a day and enjoy my way to 60
---
Ive never got camped on a PvE server. Thats why i play on them. Ive been locked out of dungeons on PvP servers for multiple days because a group of the opposing faction decided to take shifts camping em. 
---
You have an annoying habit of trying to overwrite my experiences.
---
I rarely engage in world pvp while leveling, actively avoid if anything.  Yet something deep inside me says the very notion of a PVE server is wrong.
---
This says a lot lol.
---
Cap is 50g.
---
That actually might be true. On average you wont get fully world-buffed stats though.
---
Yeah it does. Imagine if I decide to play a cloth wearer and want to farm tubers in felwood. I don't want to get ambush one shot by a geared rogue. I want to farm my raid mats and then go on to enjoy the part of the game I pay my subscription for.
---
&gt; Cash shop - as long as it's not ingame, or can be hidden with addons. And, as long as it doesn't contain mounts, transmogs, cosmetics, or anything vanilla-breaking. I don't care about faction changes or renames, as long as it'S cooldowned. But better not.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Transmogs - will live with them, as long as they come AFTER AQ, and let us use white/cloth appearances too.
---
&gt; ​
---
Its already officially confirmed neither of these will be on classic servers so shouldnt even be a concern or conversation of possibility.
---
On the other side I always feel shitty when I ride into battle with flying horde colours. I see the person that is getting ganked, is being attacked by 6people, I turn tail and run, abandoning them. :(
---
Yea I don’t disagree with that logic. And the idea that it can’t be experienced again is why I hated the approach Blizzard took to expansions. 
---
But I thought it was going to be 1.12?
---
Lol REEEeEeeEeEeEEE. You do what you want, of course. But bottom line is, you can do all pve content on a PvP server. PVP server is just for better players then, who learn how to farm while also dealing with opposite faction. 
---
Yeah I played Nost to 60 and it was literally aids to get anything done. So glad there will be PVE servers.
---
Very nice. Keep up the good work. I hope to follow your Dwarf/Gnome route on launch. 
---
I thought this sub was about vanilla crack, not vanilla coke?
---
It's kind of sad that you're reeing about a difference in opinion in a sub about a game entirely based on being an rpg that you can play HOW YOU WANT.
---
It's entirely different once PvP is agreed upon. By enabling PvP for yourself on a PvE server, you did as much as joining a BG. Nobody in their right mind feels camaraderie within the faction is improved by joining a BG.   
---
So on PvE servers you wont experience PvP camaraderie and faction pride the same as on a PvP.
---
1. All class that can heal will be needed in raid (druid, pala, priest, shaman)
---
2. Priest are top tier leveling class, wand &gt; smite
---
3. Shaman is always welcomed in raid and are quite fun to level
---
I never had issues with rogues on my priest once i got my armor high enough and had burrowers shell up.  Ganking ungeared people may have been easy.  But PVP was much more engaging in vanilla, to me anyways.
---
I'd say you're reading too far into it. I'm sure world PvP exists in some capacity on a PvE realm, but there's no denying that on a PvP realm it's more intense. It isn't opt in when you feel like it, you're always opted in when you choose to roll there. I prefer that. Others prefer to opt in when they feel like it and be free to quest in peace when they don't. That's fine too.
---
Not really, most hunters are running 2/5 imp hunter’s mark and nobody is going to give up 6 yards of range or scatter shot for 10 AP. Improved Hunter’s Mark adds 3.3 AP to HM per point. 
---
* Regular HM is 110 RAP
---
* 2/5 Imp HM (regular raid spec) is 116.6 RAP
---
* 5/5 Imp HM (which nobody runs) is 126.5 RAP
---
It’s not worth giving up the range that makes hunters so good for 10 AP. 
---
Not to mention that min/maxing guilds usually won’t have the room for hunter’s mark. It’s not free DPS when you can’t put it on the boss. 
---
Oh I see, yeah sorry lemme clear up something. I believe this is something more akin to the spellbatching scenario (which they said they won't fix cause engine) then the defense stat (which they said they will fix). However my question is simply this: How did pets work in legion, I'm not advocating I want or not want them to scale.
---
It was in vanilla. I remember because that's when shamans started stomping my priest on effective healing. I wouldn't even play priest on horde with the smartheal in effect from the get-go.
---
Perhaps I'll mess around with a Horde area next, since it's less charted territory (sort of). 
---
Does anyone want to see another map with dots on it? Any particular zone? Horde or Alliance? Starting zone or not? Basically, since I put the effort into the tool, I'd like to get some use out of it.
---
No meditation? Oof my Mana regen
---
It takes the feeling out completely
---
When you run through STV you’re *supposed* to be shitting your pants watching for enemies or 60s patrolling.
---
On PvE you can just AFK in the middle of the road. 
---
No risk whatsoever
---
I just thought you didn't know what ignite stacking was and were asking a simple question...
---
I don't get it, you want to play something to save travel time, even if it isn't fun for you? I mean leveling for 1-2 months only for this?!
---
The difference is, this time around, we still have Vanilla. If we want to go back to a 100% relevant Azeroth, Classic WoW will always be there to enjoy. And when we want to go to outland, Karazhan, and Quel'danas, for example, we can play BC. 
---
I worry that combining the games would just make the two games diluted. I'd rather 2 games as they were, flaws and perfections, than a mash of the two. 
---
Not to mention, theres lots of people who think Wrath is the best. It certainly had the most consistent subscribers. How could they ever tie in all 3 expansions without it being a clusterfuck?
---
I guess what i'm saying, is, 1-60 will be made obsolete in BC's world, but it will always be the focus in Classic. I Don't want to lose either of those in the process of a middle ground merge.
---
Paladins 6/10 in pve, being the top hps healer in game period (or you can say competing with priests). mage is 8/10 in pve despite not really being the top dps. 
---
AND mage can ONLY be one role (dps). While paladins offspecs aren't good, but they are possible, unlike for mages (you can't even be a shitty mage healer or tank), prots can easily tank 5/10mans, or some specific trash in raids. rets are bad but you can actually raid with nightfall and shit. while mages again only one role and they arent the best at it. still mages got 2 more points than paladins..
---
Druids 7/10 in pvp. are only capable as flagcarriers in pvp. thats it. druid pvp healing is trash and pretty much non existent, druids pvp damage dealer is trash, and moonkin is only partly viable and later into the game with shit ton of spd gear and flask. and with that druids are 7/10. common bros. (while hunters are 5/10 lul) All in all druids, overall one of the weakest classes in pvp. 
---
Also warlocks are ok in pvp, but they aren't THAT good in pvp its not TBC, you need a shit ton of gear, and they are a food for melees - being caster with no mobility. Also hunters are DEFINITELY better in pvp than 5/10.
---
and rogues aren't 10/10 thats for sure. you watched to many movies. they have no cloak, vanish is unreliable, super squishy, ppl one shot them, they aren't that welcomed in premades. guard that flag bro. mages, warriors, paladins, priests are for sure better than rogues in pvp. btw priest got 7/10 despite having TWO specs which are highest tier in pvp, priest healers are notorious and essential in pvp and bgs (especially on a horde side its THE pvp healer), and shadow is super good aswell, including being top duel spec.
---
Also about rogues, rogues are VERY gear depended. the fact that in world of roguecraft  (which you seem to dig your knowledge from..) you can kill one person using all cds, with a few 5combo eviscerate (which does static damage and doesnt scale with gear), doesn't make them gear indepented jesus christ. rogues are highely depended on good weapons, trinkets and gear in general so they can kill ppl in stun lock, and it wouldnt take blowing all the fucking cds, and taking 30 seconds of reseting wih blinds..
---
P.S. also paladins and shamans are historically lower pop, cos they are FACTION SPECIFIC CLASSES!! durrr. it has nothing to do with your points system proving the point... omg.
---
Vanilla Coke tastes like vomit+cleaning products, awful taste.
---
I only buy weapon upgrades.  Faster kill time means quicker leveling.
---
Free mount speeds things up
---
I reached High Warlord and see zero possibility of me reaching it again with similar hours (7:30am-530pm) unless something is changed.
---
They only way I could see myself reaching Rank 14 again is if they remove honor decay or make it so each rank is x amount of honor to achieve
---
Mage is convenient but boring in Pve. Hope you are ready to drink all the time while using only a few spells. 
---
100% for me its itemization. As a dps (ele) shaman having to wear leather or cloth to get the stats you need, basically giving up armor which is used as a balancing aspect of your class. And then when you do find mail gear half of it is designed for hunters; then raid gear being healing spec only. Obviously the most annoying aspect of Vanilla for me is class/spec viability but since that definitely isn't going to change, I'll focus on itemization.
---
Iowa clearly standing out in the flyby states.
---
Hunters need everything. Pet heal equip &lt;3
---
I’m reeeeing you because you reeeeeed “stop telling me how to play my game reeeeee!”
---
Dumbass I never once told you what to do. I simply said PVE servers are ezmode. 
---
Doesn’t all soda???? Or pretty much every drink. Never better than the first sip.
---
Personally I only got into WoW to slay dragons alongside other players, not fight other players. 
---
I've literally spent thousands of hours on both types of servers. I can confidently say I prefer PVE. Why some people feel threatened by this, I surely do not know. You won't catch me telling them they're playing the game wrong, though. 
---
my favorite so far
---
The only thing better than leveling up is leveling up by exploring new portions of the map.
---
Yeah the only aids part about Nost was STV. Farming mats/consums wasn't bad at all. I'd also say your own faction was more annoying than the enemy faction, especially in regards to farming mats.
---
It is based on 1.12 but will officially be 1.13
---
I'm going to push for semi-speed running times. I'm booking 2 weeks off and will play 14 hours a day for 2 weeks. If things go well.
---
A surprise to be sure, but a confusing one. 
---
You can play it however you want, but saying you can get the full experience of a PvP server on a PvE server is asinine. PvE servers are a diminished game, it literally removes a huge aspect of the game.
---
At least the hybrids can do some pretty awesome things that pure classes cannot. I don't know about shamans because I play Alliance, but paladins are amazing AoE tanks and can one-shot people with reckoning. Druids are great TPS tanks and very versatile. Properly specced and geared they are probably the best duellists of all classes. Also being able to stealth in with some rogues and a healing druid you can ambush objectives in battlegrounds.
---
It's not the app itself, its Electron, the tools with which it's built. It's a giant slow memory hog only because the devs are too lazy to learn how to built anything else but web apps.
---
My other issue with it is it just does too much. All I want is to hear my guildies voices show up in chat, unfortunately with the amount of funding Discord has taken in, it looks like they're going to need to morph into a full blown social network or shut down.
---
Rogue ? Being stealth allow you to reach everything without too much fight. They can farm gold easily too, if the BRD exploit is not fixed.
---
Hunter can farm golds easily too and you can run with the cheetah aspect without mount
---
Hunter already has more hit than they need by the time they get to BWL, and DFT gives 8 fucking AP more than their DM class trinket.
---
Would you give melees a trinket that's practically perma-bis for them (or tanks for threat) or would you give a hunter a trinket that gives him 8 more AP?
---
I suppose you can't really tell when I type things in my sarcastic bitch tone. 
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent](https://classicdb.ch/?talent)
---
Shadow weaving isn't good enough with the 8 debuff limit, but it is at 16.  There is typically 1 shadow priest in every raid with the 16 debuff limit, but some hardcore guilds have a priest that goes 31/0/20 for power infusion and shadow weaving.  Their main role is healing, keeping shadow weaving up, and putting power infusion on a mage or warlock.
---
Their damage isn't great, but if you put in full effort (world buffs, pre-raid BiS, full enchants) you can be middle of the pack on meters.
---
Not every guild is going to be hardcore, but it will be harder to get a raid slot as shadow just because there is more competition for DPS slots and from a raid leader perspective you are less desirable than a mage, rogue, warlock, or warrior.  However just getting 40 people for a raid can be a challenge, so you'll be fine as long as you don't have a bad reputation on your server.
---
I know for me there is definitely a chance I will turn back to Pservers if blizzard doesn't deliver. I cant tell you exactly where that line in the sand is... but I can tell you I WANT to pay blizzard for the product I enjoy, if they deliver it to me then I will happily continue to pay for it. If they don't deliver it, then I will return to where I came from. There are a lot of modern things I am very willing to accept because I dont feel they undermine the core of what vanilla is. I dont care about spell batching, I enjoyed seeing everything look smoother in the demo, i'll be glad to see some terrain abuse stop because the physics of how we interact with the terrain isnt the same.
---
You're much better off with a combination of ZG trinket/net/pvp trinket than DFT TBH. Having a 2nd multishot is going to be much better than a 1% dodge chance.
---
That's true but in the case of vanilla coke, the thick vanilla flavour really begins to overwhelm you at one point. It's way more dense than the caramel that everyone's used to.
---
Yes, confused it with the rogue talent that gives crit.
---
This,
---
The Demo was labeled as version 1.13 (due to several changed made in the backend) to label it as a distinctly different version -- as it was.
---
Likely the official launch day 1 version will probably be something like 1.14, but will still be based on the vanilla 1.12 patch.
---
"Pve servers are ez mode"
---
*proceeds to engage in 1 sided unfair world pvp fights*
---
I mean..."totem" is not a signature ability.  It's a group of about 20 abilities.  Shock is a group of 3 abilities.   Same with Seal/Judgement - there are like 6 or 7 seals.  And it depends on what specialization you are.  For an Arms warrior, Mortal Strike and Overpower are big.  For a Prot Warrior, Sunder Armor is about the best thing ever.
---
For a Paladin, I'd say Flash of Light and Illumination
---
For a Mage, you've got a ton - Portals and Conjure water come to mind.  Remove curse comes to mind.  Warlocks can replicate the damage from Blizzard, but they can't send you to Orgrimmar or Stormwind, or give you water.
---
I would say skinning and mining probably for leveling and at 60 drop skinning and run either blacksmith to make yourself some gear and maybe farm rare recipes to charge for them or enginnering as its useful in both pvp and pve the benefit being you have ore from leveling to offset the cost.
---
Oh, I should have added that I live in Shanghai and don’t speak Chinese 😅
---
There should be no squelch automatically, no matter what. 
---
There should be no automatic feature, the first step should be human review then a squelch or whatever must be done. 
---
That's what makes it so good and even better to mix with!

Well have fun on your hunter.  
---
I'm a little confused. What's Coca-Cola have to do with WoW?
---
In vanilla mages farmed everything better than almost any other class. They are better mara farmers than warlocks, and do dm more efficiently.
---
Do you know why you need 5k gold within the first month of release?
---
I don't view it anything like the spellbatching. That is a function of the servers limitations at the time. Everyone played with what would today be crazy ping, low fps and the spellbatching was a product of server speed, not an intended mechanic. Hunter pets are a mechanic, a value on a table that can be altered. Sorry, you are viewing this wrong. Hunter pets will not scale. 
---
I wouldn't call pick pocketing runs an exploit, as its a normal game mechanic just done in an efficient way.
---
If anything along the common gold farming techniques I would call exploiting would be hunters solo'ing the last boss in a DM tribute run by abusing the fact the boss can't path down a 4 foot ledge.
---
Yeah exactly it's all BFA on google and petopia etc. But il try the retail wow reddit then ty. 
---
It's not that they're playing the game wrong, it's that for some reason people think you can get the full experience on a PvE server when in reality you're missing a large portion of it. PvE servers remove the idea of contested zones, until you opt into pvp, if that makes sense?
---
That's just sharding with more steps.
---
Hinterlands was my favorite. Something about staying up all night and see the sun rise in Hinterlands.
---
I should of prob said des moines has it idk about the small farm towns lol.
---
Eh It's only really one sided on PvE servers, from my experience. Yea there are one sided battles on PvP servers, but it's never as bad as it is on PvE servers. Actually, now that I think about it, anytime I flag on a PvE server I get SWARMED by the opposite faction and then run to turn pvp off.
---
Me too, man.
---
I remember arguing with my roommate for hours about who could level faster -- him in the Barrens, or me in Silverpine.  I haven't played it since WotLK, but to this day I still know the Silverpine quests like the back of my hand.  Even my Orc/Tauren/Troll alts would make the trek over to quest through that zone.
---
The fact that it culminated in SFK, my favorite 5-man, is really just the cherry on top.
---

---
Yea I don’t entirely get it either. There is no wrong way to enjoy the game. 
---
If all you (not saying you specifically) want to is farm materials, sell on the AH and get gold, who am I to stop you? I think there’s so much to this game that every person should just find what they like and “play their game”. 
---
I did a lot of PvP but a ton of raiding back when I played and I loved it all, so play your game and the hell with others opinions. 
---
Should be fine. I've run the retail client on a 2013 MacBook Pro and it was fine, no issues on low-mid settings including in major cities, dungeons, and raids. Pro would be more powerful but I imagine the difference between a 2013 and 2018 machine would more than offset that.
---
I recommend picking up a proper keyboard though.
---
Of course stealth comes to mind for rogue, but it would be a shame for their spell to be the same that anothe class has (Druid).
---
Pickpocket is a solid one :)
---
Well yes it should in my opinion. Considering the huge age gap in a game like wow with a large number of players being children you don't want racists, homophobes, Child molestors and other pieces of human garbage to continue to roam free until a manual review can be made. 
---
Imma be Warlock, one of the favorite targets for rogues, still advocating for pvp servers. What keeps you on your toes is what makes the game.
---
Lucky warrior. Sounds like the opposite of mine when i tanked for it recently. I even had someone ninja the BoE shield that dropped which was an upgrade for me.
---
That staff is no joke though. High dps and spirit is good for leveling.
---
That's an absolutely retarded grading system. Leveling should never be considered as important as lvl 60 performance. There's 6-7 days of playtime in leveling. Potentially 100s of days at 60. "Paladin is one of the best healers in the game, 6/10 because ret and prot aren't viable. Rogues get an 8 even though they only have one role too, tho."
---
Absolutely fucking retarded. Did you even think for a second before making this video?
---
&gt;we tried to be objective
---
&gt;every healer class gets shit ratings in pve.
---
Priest leveling 5/10. Dude clearly never leveled a priest. 
---
Please stop making videos when you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.

Great work! I'd love to see more of the dot maps; Dun Morogh would be pretty handy.

---
The Vanilla one on the right is Original WoW; the Classic one on the left is the same thing, it's just bloated with 7.3 client stuff so the servers actually operate. They look different, but they're the same, trust in the process.
---
Pala: Hearthstone
---
You can run discord in your browser. But yea Teamspeak is still widely used.
---
Thanks for the awesome reply. Hunters being low pop actually is a plus for playing one if raid spots are more possible than when they are overpopulated. Think the content bucket showed t2 coming out with bgs so that would be perfect for lock.  Becoming less and less interested in war tbh.
---
Having more vanilla content would be great, but even if it'd happen, it just wouldn't be..it. Those people who made Blizz what it used to be before activision meddling are long gone. Maybe if they'd take scrapped content, butz still..I dunno, sounds good but also near impossible.
---
Ok thanks for letting us know.
---
Well no, the suicide counter is only for the 60 encounters, but the encounters of people around your level are definitely a battle and not a suicide. 
---
there should always be a couple for battle rez and innervate. Utility healers. Also, you will get loot quicker as there will be fewer folks to compete for your gear.
---
Where’s the pre-bc Coca Cola?
---
Hunter - Auto Shot - lol :D
---
they updated it for BFA so it isnt bad now but discord is so baked in that people never use it.
---
I would put Pickpocket into another category, which would also contain Mage's Blink or Paladin's Divine Shield. Signature ability is basically what the class is being built around and druids can still exist without Stealth.
---
There are dozens of you. Dozens. 
---
I agree that it's not really an "exploit" since it's game mechanics. 
---
But well anything that can be done again and again (dungeon reset) without the outdoor issues (mob steal, PvP etc...) is breaking the Vanilla gold value.
---
That probably why some pserver are trying to prevent those methods : to keep golds as authentic as possible
---
True for beer in summer
---
Lol I probably might have caught it if I watched that linked video before I commented, but it was midnight and I was tired.  
---
Mortal trike for the one, two punch. Autoattack, mortal strike, maybe one or two windfury procs. Dead clothie.
---
To me it just adds wasted time. Nothing is gained from being 1 shot by a 60 I never even saw except frustration, and I don't get any satisfaction from doing the same to others. I'm not 14 anymore, in my limited time to play the game I'd rather do things I enjoy than play corpse runner simulator 2019 while just trying to kill some fucking tigers
---
The best professions for tanking would be BS and Engineering. Having both is amazing but a giant pain in the gold or you need a mining alt. Blacksmithing - armorsmithing is great. If you opt for weaponsmithing I'd pick axesmithing so you can make your guild nightfall. If you want a gather proffession I'd do the mining/BS. But mining/skinning is a good leveling set.
---
I don't have it in South Carolina either :(. I get Pepsi cherry vanilla-  its good, but its not quite coke vanilla. I get it everytime at those coke free style machines too.
---
Get a bit of gear and you hard counter rogues, the rogue is only strong whilst leveling and at low gear levels. Rogues simply don't scale well in pvp and against a soul link warlock they don't have answers.
---
Classic is going to be using the modern client though
---
&gt;https://andygriffith.us/WoW/subzone_outline_sketch.png
---
&gt;https://andygriffith.us/WoW/path_around_hostiles.png
---
Another note: some of those zones are not discovery zones. Echo ridge, Thunder Falls, Northshire vineyards, Mirror lake / orchard, westbrook garrison, they're named zones, but no exploration XP.
---
FWIW if you're referring to [Odo's Ley Staff](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6318) that's actually a pretty viable 2 hander for a warrior and better than the crescent staff in that regard, though it's possible that by the level you need to be to finish SFK he'd gotten something better elsewhere.
---
It is a decent staff.  I don't know what he had for a 2H.
---
However, all of us casters had the +7/7/7 stam/int/spirit staff from the WC quest, so 5 stamina and 12 spirit was a bit of a downgrade for us.
---
I second that.
---
&gt; You may think I just played with poor hunters or something but this is also consistent with what i would see on legacylogs when comparing top guilds like progress. It gets even worse if you allow r14 weapons into the mix lol
---
I don't think that those hunters aren't good. But I also never raided on pservers (only started recently). Back in the day it was not uncommon that hunters reached top DPS now and then.
---
&gt; Edit: tipsoutbaby has a good set of youtube videos on this too if you want to see the top parses presented in bar graph style easy to digest. There are a couple outliers with high dps but they drop into the 4 and 300s pretty fast :(
---
&gt; Edit2: not sure why my updates keep not coming through i must have crap mobile internet right now -- but I just went and double checked myself to make sure i wasnt making shit up. From tips video the average numbers in bwl are warriors coming in at 755 avg and hunters down at 450. So the difference between them is 300... aka the nearly the damage of bringing a 2nd hunter LOL
---
Yes I looked at exactly the same data, and the thing is Hunters are just slightly behind mages at that point. There is just a significant gap between melee and ranged DPS. Warriors and Rogues are closer together and the ranged DPS too.
---
And again, you bring those classes not just for the DPS. You see the more "pure" a DPS class is the higher the values go. But then there is also unique utility and there is gear distribution. Two obvious examples I mentioned earlier: Kiting adds against Razorgore and Tranqing Chromaggus. You mentioned decursing yourself as a Mage and so on.
---
And it is fair to say that on some encounters Melees eat up more healing resources than ranged DPS. Which is a good investment but has to be factored in.
---
I mean those things are all pretty obvious and I know you know them. But they also kind of have to be mentioned so we don't confuse pure DPS with viability.
---
It costs like 10s the first time, I thought?
---
When I played through Vanilla for the first time I didn't think about getting to 60 asap. You can actually enjoy the game before max level, traveling the world, meeting people, questing, doing several hour long dungeon runs, farming gold for a mount, leveling professions etc. I had around 23 days /played (550 hours) on my first char when I dinged 60.
---
You do if you have friends willing to help you
---
I’m about that life 
---
Depends on your objective. 
---
If it is grinding gold, mage. Easiest gearing for PvP and PvE, druid. Securing a raid spot, Shaman.
---
Tests have shown that the MBA is still pretty bad  at gaming even with an eGPU which is a massive investment. The throttling is just awful, even for the CPU alone. For the record I’m playing retail on a 2016 MB at the moment, it is barely playable at around 25 FPS but I wouldn’t call it enjoyable by any means.
---
If I were OP I’d get an entry level MBP which is barely more expensive and less portable, but will run Classic WoW smoothly on its own.

Yup definitely true. Youre right the utility is mandatory for tranq shot rotations especially. You cant do the bosses at all if you dont bring 2/3 hunters. I wish they were more competitive dps wise because it just sucks to see the meters literally all brown and yellow with no chance of catching up unless youre cheesing a fight with aggro resets or onyxia flying etc :( 
---
You can roll with level 24/25, therefore you can not equip BFD Strike of the Hydra yet, therefore it's quite possible that Ley Staff was his best weapon so far.
---
They're also really good tank healers. No one will play them though as they're seen as shit.
---
Shut up.
---
So ww in my and dudes above me comment refers to whirlwind the skill. This skill is obtained at 36, no matter what help you get from your skills unless you have a GM cheating is not obtainable at 31.
---
This is the best.. compliment.. I have seen in years.
---
Hey man, ive done every pve version of shadow there is, full shadow, PI weave bitch, my famous "holy bologna and what you dont tell your raid leader spec" you name it. Shadow has a place in raid, especially naxx. If you want me to go more in depth what i mean just ask. :)

You’re not playing an MMO
---
You’re playing a single player game where you can simply see other people
---
You’re welcome to play PvE server and enjoy it in its entirety, but that doesn’t change the fact that many of us find that care bear play style B O R I N G
---
&gt;the mage was worried about loot sharing
---
What?
---
Unpopular opinion: too many of you are gonna want to bank lower levels and the game won’t feel the same for those who will be leveling a few months after release. I’ve tried playing a server and it’s just beyond stupid how much more often you get killed just because by a level 60. I know when I played in vanilla I wasn’t killed as much as I am now, back then if you were a worthless target you only got killed if you were in the way of something they wanted. Helping a friend or getting a quest item from a mob tag etc. 
---
I see. Thanks for the insight.
---
Try cherry vanilla coke. It's awesome.
---
Cool and I find vanilla pvp shitfest B O R I N G. 
---
First time is 1g then 5g then up by 5 Everytime you respec. Apparently it decays by 5g every month that you do not Respec
---
Having a focused spell set really doesn't bother me. I'm actually more worried about the opposite which is a big reason why I'm not going shaman. 
---
Although I play with keybinds. I can't see myself going past 12 - 15 keybinds for a character. 
---
&gt;It's not that they're playing the game wrong
---
I can point to a couple posters in this thread that would disagree but..
---
&gt;it's that for some reason people think you can get the full experience on a PvE server when in reality you're missing a large portion of it
---
Well it's not true that you can have every possible experience WoW has to offer on any server. So I'd disagree with people saying that but I'd also disagree with you. Social dynamics are always different between servers and even when you add PVP, you lose some things as well. If one side of the coin is fearing for your life while leveling in STV, the other side is a relaxing experience of leveling in STV. Neither one of those experiences is more authentic if you shout it louder. 
---
I also fundamentally disagree with the idea that PVP is a "large portion" of World of Warcraft. Very little of WoW was originally designed with PVP in mind. They didn't even launch with an honor system. The *vast* majority of content that Blizzard created at the onset of WoW was PVE. I know it ruffles feathers to say this but I don't see much room for debate. PVP is something players *decide* to make a large part of their gaming experience. And more power to them. So you can certainly say "you won't experience the game the way I do." But the statement "you're missing a large portion of it" doesn't hold up because not everyone makes the same decisions you do. 
---
I think people who played on PVP servers tend to hold up things like ganking and corpse camping as these vaunted shared experiences they all had and half the playerbase missed out on. But I can name some experiences that were even more widely shared:  botters disrupting the economy, trade chat/PM/mail spam from gold sellers and power levelers, several hours long server queues, maintenance lasting a full day or longer, slow internet speed, and a PC that was clearly not built to handle seeing a hundred players in Ironforge. I don't need these things to experience Classic correctly. 
---
&gt; I'm not 14 anymore
---
I mean, as long as you're not suggesting that enjoying the random PvP nature of the game means you're childish.
---
Now they just make tanks feel like shit and grind daily quests... Fuck live. 
---
Warlock time saving?? Hahahaha... Have fun farming soul shards before every raid so you can summon 30 people. 
---
Thanks. Besides your google sheet, is there a good list of discovery zones online? (I'll dig around later when I'm not at work.)
---
Honestly, picking a bad race would be the last thing I'd be worried about. Especially with a shaman. They're all viable. 
---
I first encountered one on a hunter near the Sen'jin Islands I think. Then one in Westfall, north of the Murlocs. Terrifying, but exciting!
---
These threads are always so entertaining. All it takes is that one little word in the title to turn the whole thing into a shitshow. I love it
---
That moment when i equip Talbar Mantle...oh god yes
---
Kind of a bad list when you don’t put bubble for paladin. And blizzard for Mage??
---
Like I said, I don't know what his 2H was at the time, but he greeded on it so he didn't consider it an upgrade.
---
Bloodlust doesn’t exist. 
---
If a cloth piece dropped, he wanted a higher chance of getting it.
---
If you plan to raid, warlock shard farming isn't exactly a time saver. They usually need at least 30 minutes of shard farming preraid to have enough.
---
You’re wrong. Paladin is one of the faster levelers because he can heal between mobs and has lots of ways to avoid death. A paladin can easily take on 2-3 mobs while that’s a certain death for a Warrior. 
---
People absolutely ganked for the hell of it in vanilla. Suggesting otherwise is silly. There are notorious players who's names are still known to this day - 14 years later!
---
That said what you're actually experiencing is the side effects of larger server communities. If you played on a private server most of them have a higher player cap than official servers did in 2004-2006. The result of more players = more bored 60's running around ganking people. It wasn't that it didn't happen back then, it's that with a larger population you're more likely to encounter one at any given time.
---
That was the joke, I don’t know why I got downvotes . I guess nobody understands the classics.
---
I didn’t say they don’t I said there wasn’t as many doing it just to do it as there is now. 
---

Also known as Hard Mode.
---
I'm a PvP server player and even I think your comment is ridiculous.
---
Let PvE players play on their PvE servers. Stop worrying so much about how other people play. Reserve your annoyance for those who roll on PvP servers and then whine.
---
I never said anything about being childish.
---
I just don't feel like spending the majority of the little time I have to play doing corpse runs.
---
We gave our Atiesh in retail vanilla to our resto Druid, that should let you know how important they are to raiding.
---
As a ret it’s autohit

These are quest reward items from Sunken Temple, not world drop items.

VOIP software was actually declared illegal in 2017.  You will have to use landlines and set up three-way calling chains in order to get everyone on comms together.

Oh yeah my bad, I thought he was talking about the axe. I didn't even consider ww as whirlwind in this case, I thought he meant cleave. Sorry about that. 
---
Even though I would want this.  No.
---
Wow, that's a really annoying noise!
---
Ok Im done.. and now?
---
*rolls alts*
---
Ham radio still ok though?

These are the same guys that go around telling people of their own faction to "duel me brah!", using a lot of /chicken emotes and being absolute loot whores in raids.
---
Gotta flex that epeen 
---
pretty good if you get the jump on them, obviously not as good rogue but nothing really is
---
Ah yeah i mean for a warrior (or enh shammy)
---
I mean it kind of is a classical piece. They just made it for a game, that doesn't discredit it's greatness.
---
I love this.
---
I thought this was Bryce Harper
---
Agreed. But Warlocks are strong in pvp. Yes they need gear to shine but once you rank up Warlock becomes a pvp god. And they are very valuable in premades because of fear, cos, coil, silence, dispel, crazy burst. A good warlock can control the entire fight. 
---
They were gone here in Sweden for about 6 years and then came back, will enjoy a can or two at launch for sure. 
---
Well, you could also be an actual hunter main rolling on gear like that. 
---
I played on a pserver and to this day people keep rolling on shit not designed for their class. 
---
You never know!
---
I did not downvote you though as I read it as a joke. :)
---
Ahhhhh fuck, the flashbacks. I remember playing closed beta on my lvl 12 nightelf hunter when I saw a lvl 30 human rogue with leather shoulders waiting for a ship at menethil harbor. 
---
The thing about rolling on gear in vanilla, is that everything is for every class that wants it to be. Look at paladins, wearing cloth. Melee survival hunters, feral Druids, or even rogues. Never see any of those rogues. 
---
Teebling has posted icon packs on his awesome forums at [https://barrens.chat/index.php?f=5](https://barrens.chat/index.php?f=5).
---
&gt;But then you see your boy John, a level 47 priest is online and so you whisper him for some help. Everyone in high school knows that John is the best healer. 
---
I knew a few people RL back in the day (when I was in high school and vanilla was retail) that played WoW but.....they were all, not very good. 
---
I mean that in the nicest way, I wasn't great by any means but these people were just flat out bad. Looking back, I should've helped them but by the time I found out some of these people played I was already in an AQ40 guild or the ones in TBC couldn't even get arena ranked (not even bottom tier) until I started playing with them so, yea. 
---
I'm really excited for Classic though, I'm recruiting as many people as I can RL and really want to aid everyone in their journey come launch and beyond so they can have as much fun as I did and will. 
---
It goes both ways...
---
I have played 1.12 on a Macbook Air from 2010, you will be fine.
---
&gt; but I was IN the game
---
If I have a dream about a video game, I'm always IN the video game, it's never me playing it or anything, but I'm my character. This has happened with WoW, Dragon's Dogma, Dragon Age Inquisition (I've been playing that recently) and Elder Scrolls 3-5. 
---
Hello fellow Des Moineser :D
---
Not a fan of PvP when I'm leveling up, but I'm gonna roll on a PvP server just so I have the option to do world PvP when I hit 60.
---
This made me feel warm inside. 
---
Lmao the entire game is wasted time without some element of random encounters. 
---
I hear microsoft excel is an exciting game for people who like watching numbers go up.
---
Druid or Shaman?
---
I want to heal in raids.  In pvp I like battlegrounds and having fun, not too serious about it.
---
I recently played a Druid to lvl 45 on a private server.  Loved leveling as feral.  How does Shaman compare as far as speed/down time/OOM?  
---
How does Shaman do in world pvp?  I plan to play a pvp server and I like the Druid's ability to be stealthed and flat out avoid the fights if you want/solid root and movement increases if you need to GTFO
---
Until you mess up your two main from 19-20 by mistake:p
---
You must be made of salt.
---
&gt; Unpopular opinion: too many of you are gonna want to bank lower levels and the game won’t feel the same for those who will be leveling a few months after release.
---
It's a good point. It's why things like summoning infernals in low level towns and kiting elites into cities will probably be immediately cracked down on by Blizzard. It wasn't a huge deal when it happened once a month but if people try it once a week? Once a day?
---
People love talking about that orc rogue that spent all his time in menthil harbor. Except that was one server out of dozens. Yeah, every server had a couple infamous gankers but most did not have anyone as obsessive as that guy. But now his story's been passed around so many times over the last few years, you can predict many copycats in Classic. Enough to change the dynamic of these towns for a long while. As is the case in redridge on current most popular private server. 
---
You can't just put lightning back in a bottle. It will be changed. Might still be good. But it'll be changed. 
---
I can't pick just one, but these are the abilities I think best define the class fantasy from every specialization.
---
Paladin - Lay on Hands, Divine Intervention, Judgement
---
Shaman - Chain Lightning, Windfury, Chain Healing
---
Warrior - Heroic Strike, Execute, Shield Block
---
Rogue - Eviscerate, Backstab, Stealth
---
Priest - Power Word: Shield, Prayer of Healing, Mind Control
---
Mage - Blizzard, Pyroblast, Polymorph
---
Warlock - Drain Soul, Summon \[Demon\], Hellfire
---
Druid - Moonfire, Shapeshift, Rebirth
---
Hunter - Call Pet, Auto Shot, Freezing Trap

Exactly. Red ridge always gets that asshole that kills everyone and comes back daily now. Stv at its worst gets unplayable with the amount of ganking for no reward as well as hillsbrad. 
---
I listened to the wow trailer with Jason Hayes' original long piece for an entire year waiting for WoW to release. 
---
I mean too bad for whoever has to play that shit spec. Doesn't matter to the raid leader, bringing one more DPS class that can carry its weight is heaps more efficient.
---
Exactly
---
If you're not placing bottom of DPS meters as Shadow, one or more people in the raid is doing something wrong or also plays Shadow.
---
Nothing bad about classic pvp. Far more balanced then most of the other expansions. I can see why people would not like world pvp though. It can be frustrating if your not very good or don't want excitement. Some times it's just nice to sit back and chill.
---
Stupid question: How are you already playing classic content?
---
Paladin: Bubble hearth 
---
Why hello there!!!!
---
If you’re rolling a class that can heal, you’re going to heal. Especially priest. Shadow priest only really excels in PvP, bur doesn’t bring anything in 5 mans. Only if you’re going to be playing with a tight knit guild will you be shadowing in 5 mans. If you’re pugging dungeons ypu should expect to heal.
---
&gt; care bear

Holy shit is it still 2005? Lol haven't heard that in years.
---
You're welcome to enjoy the game however you want but don't try to gatekeep me and tell me I'm playing the MMO "wrong" because we enjoy different aspects of the game.
---
Warrior - Tanking
---
Paladin - Being annoying to Horde in PVP
---
Hunter - Claiming every weapon
---
Rogue - Hunting clothies in battlegrounds.
---
Priest - Healbot
---
Shaman - Being annoying to Alliance in PVP
---
Mage - Water &amp; portal dispenser
---
Druid - flag carrier in WSG
---
That is what ignore is for, it never fails. Don't like that person? Well congratulations, you can just ignore them and you will never hear from them again.
---
&gt; Corpse Runner Simulator 2019
---
My thoughts exactly
---
I would say Mage is the more time saving character. If you ever need gold, you just run to a dungeon and be the most efficient farmer possible. Once your bags fill you hearth to the nearest vendor, hop on the flight path and repeat until your bags fill up again.
---
If you're going to be leveling slowly then ya I'd understand it.  If you're trying to stay towards the head of the curve it's much more enjoyable because you won't have 60's ganking you when you're 20.  
---
&gt;If you don't want to deal with that element of the game, then don't roll on the server type that supports it.
---
There are a lot more differences between a PVE and PVP server than getting ganked by someone 20 levels above you. What if someone really likes those other aspects of a PVP server?
---
Nope. Time to brush up on your morse code
---
Shaman is Windfury, come on.
---
I'm not *shifty eyes*
---
The real answer is private server.  But I'm not going to give any more details than that on this subreddit.  I'm also still subbed to WoW and I'm going to quit the private server when official Classic launches.
---
b-but that makes you a care bear loser!!!!!
---
That's true. I guess I meant they thought it was generic classical music but of course for us it means so much more 
---
Then they can weigh their desire for those other aspects against the downsides that they don't like.
---
Sometimes things have parts you like and don't like. You then have to decide if the upside is worth the downside. Whining because the downside happened is silly. You signed up for it.
---
Not just 60s. Rogues. Twinks. Anyone while im fighting a mob. Different flavors of shit i have no control over
---
Not knockin ya if you like it but its not for me.
---
Yes because group quests, dungeons, raids, bgs, and trading don't exist. Sorry some of us don't find constant corpse running or killing lower lvls fun. The reality of pvp servers is that most world pking is completely one sided and rarely are even fights had.
---
Definitely Grizzly Hills 
---
Also, what is this fancy embroidery shit? Your first pair are going to be significantly lamer in the most majestic way.
---
This will only ever be true if the combined amount of mages, rogues and dps warriors in your raid is lower than 10, in which case RIP. 
---
Private server is how any of us "playing" classic right now.
---
Though I think it's against the rules to mention server names or how to play on a private servers. 5 minutes on Google will help 
---
I think people forget just how much PvP still occurs on PvE servers. In vanilla WoW, playing as a Rogue on Uther (PvE), there was so much world PvP every single day that I actually never ran out of PvP. Put on /worlddefense and you will see just how much people like to cause havoc. On the other hand, when I wanted to just chill in a zone, I didn't have to worry.
---
Sorry you guys didn’t get the belt, shoulders and chest. Those last quite a ways at that level!
---
Better luck next run!
---
I have nothing against videos like this, but why can't people just use the word "Discussion/Opinion/Speculation" instead of "guide" when creating highly subjective and speculative content? 
---
taurens have a bigger hitbox, which can screw you as elemental - you can hit enemies at 7-8 yards, but they can also hit you from that distance, which is a pure disadvantage for elemental shamans. orcs have a normal hitbox of 5 yards AND ridiculous stun resistance - for this reason alone, orcs tend to be a better pick by far.
---
It's that moment when your party of 5 people has been waiting for a mob spawn for 10 minutes, and when it finally spawns an enemy rogue gets the tag and you can only watch as he slowly kites/kills this mob over the next 5 minutes and resets the spawn timer. 
---
If you like WoW music in general, check out Grizzly Hills Radio on YouTube! It’s a 24/7 live stream of music from various expansions. I have it on while I study, it’s perfect.

All of what you said is true, however you cant argue that being a high lvl and ganking low lvl in zones you long past is a scummy thing to do, even if its allowed.
---
You'd probably be good playing with aussies.
---
Imagine being this much of a Boomer.
---
I bet you had no friends in elementary school and were a dirty party pooper tattle tell.
---
I couldn't play on PvE back in the day after growing on on PvP during vanilla.  It felt like part of the game was missing :(
---
And if that downside is pointless griefing gets punished by the administrators?
---
Warrior - Charge
---
Hunter - Aimed shot
---
Mage - Polymorph
---
Priest - Mind control
---
Druid - Moonfire
---
These came first to mind to me :)

&gt; You can't just put lightning back in a bottle. It will be changed. Might still be good. But it'll be changed.

I really like how someone in another thread pointed out that this is going to be "Classic" and not "Vanilla". There is absolutely nothing that will bring back the experience of Vanilla. This is just going to be a polished version of it that, while I'm confident will be a blast to play, will never have the quirks and oddities that Vanilla had.
---
what about grouping, battleground pvp, trading, and doing raids? those are single player activities?
---
i played on a pvp server in vanilla and most of the world pvp is just higher level people one shotting you. on rare occasion there's some engaging and balanced world pvp but that is not common.
---
If Blizzard handed out suspensions for ganking/camping people then classic will fail, plain and simple. It's a reality of PvP servers and people either need to accept it or roll PvE. There are options in place for you if you don't like it. You can't complain about getting ganked when you knowingly rolled on a server where that was a possibility. End of story, get over it.
---
All g
---
Why is everyone in this sub so fucking afraid of rogues I dont get it.
---
No, it's not a scumbag thing to do. Stop taking everything so seriously, or roll PvE. If it isn't for you, don't play PvP. This isn't hard, guys. Assigning character traits to someone because they killed you in a video game is absurd, and frankly makes me wonder if you're not a little too invested in the game.
---
ooo thanks I'll check it out
---
If your guild expects warlocks to summon 30 people, your guild is ran by morons.
---
It's their job, not the warlock's, to be at the raid, on time.
---
Admit it we’ve all gone to an RP server and then to Goldshire to see what’s it was like. 
---
&gt;That said, there's a difference between whining and calling out in general chat for help
---
So much this. I hate when I ask if anyone wants to group up to help kill alliance only to get told "deal with it, you rolled pvp"
---
Yes, I rolled pvp and now I'm trying to pvp. In what backwards ass land should I roll on a pve server?
---
I’ve leveled on pvp private servers many times over the past few years and I’ve never found myself in a situation where I was like wow this is excessive corpse walking. Ur overstating the amount of ganking that happens. 
---
Razer naga with the numpad on the side is irreplaceable.
---
Lol, nice excuse
---
 I dont mind it as i will probably do it myself, the only difference between us is that i know that it is a scumbag thingy to do while you will make excuses for not being one.
---
I'm going full He-Man mode and leveling permaflagged on a PVE server. 
---
Nice try, Blizzard
---
You got me there.
---
My money is on Mage. Not only for yourself but anyone else you play with.
---
Say for example you are in Silly, a quick portal/tele to Org/IF will save HUGE amounts of time, more so ally side. We are talking 10 minutes or more on ally side saved from 1 spell. That adds up a lot.
---
For Alliance mages it was/is common to set your heath to Gadgetzan, you can tele to the Northern part of Kalimdor, Heath to the southern. And have 2 cities on the southern and middle of Eastern Kingdoms with SW and IF.
---
Horde I think set their hearth to Kargath.
---
These points give you the most coverage to tele or heath to anywhere to help cut down on travel time
---
Absolute, absolute noob here. Never played classic, nor did I play WoW much at all (OSRS player).
---
Many buttons to press scare me, so do many consumables in order to do some decent (read: mediocore) damage. I don’t care much for being top DPS, as long as I don’t get automatically blown up in PvP. I just... tend to be terrible at keeping track of multiple things. 
---
I’m sure you all played LoL before; I usually stick to tanks, as they’re difficult to kill yet have an impact on the battlefield. I don’t like being a tank per se, I just don’t like super quick combo’s with a lot of abilities. 
---
I’d love to play for Horde (sorry paladins), so I think that helps a little. I’m so sorry for being such a crybaby, I’m just INCREDIBLY looking forward to have my first proper WoW experience on a character I feel comfortable with in every aspect so I can play a long time!
---
Love this community :)
---
I think the ”while just trying to kill some fucking tigers” sums it pretty well. That right there is really all you have on PvE. Killing tigers. 
---
&gt; All I want is to hear my guildies voices show up in chat, 
---
You don't want searchable, persistent text channels?
---
You're entitled to whatever twisted viewpoint you like. If you want to identify as a scumbag live your life. But I still think you're assigning far too much weight to killing someone in a video game.
---
&gt;I get killed more on a 16k pop server than back in vanilla
---
Wow dude thats totally not predictable at all.
---
Going off memory but theres an NPC in the back of the shipwreck 
---
Unfortunately it's probably an upgrade for him too, which makes it even more sad if he just vendored it lol. Staves on warriors are actually strong as fuck for a lot of level ranges. Double tragedy lol
---
I played on 3 PvP US servers in 2005-2006 and hardly ever got ganked. Should be different in 2019 but who knows.
---
Nah, the dumbest sfk run ever is when you don't bring someone who can decurse, so you have those stupid ghosts spawning nonstop the entire run.
---
I played PVE retail for like 6 years then PVP on private servers for like 2 years. Mind you on the PVP servers I was Alliance and there were a lot more horde players on those servers.
---
PVP was really fun at times but really pissed me off at other times.  When leveling in zones with a more equal faction balance it was great. But once I got to STV I almost rage quit. I ended up trying and failing for a whole day to level in STV but there were too many groups of like 5 horde running around killing every Alliance who was by themselves. I ended up not leveling at all in STV and some other zones.
---
It was ok when there was 1 horde. I'd either /wave at them if I was busy or i'd attack them and they'd run away most of the time. Rarely did horde attack me 1v1 unless they were 5+ levels ahead of me. 
---
PVP also made it take longer to do some quests and was sometimes just not fun at all.
---
PVE servers were the complete opposite. Quests were fun to do and I had zero issues. I could AFK and go to the bathroom out in the open. I never had to be on edge and I could focus more on leveling and it was actually nice, but I started off with PVE and now that i've played PVP I don't know if I could go back. There might be an aspect of the game missing if I don't that's quite fun.
---
I'm hoping for a PVP server with a overpopulated or equal Alliance population I can join I think that'd be the best of both worlds. If not that, i'd rather play PVE than PVP on a horde dominant server.

Nope, I hate that workflow, hate slack too. People use chat channels like text messages or IRC, which is fine, but I much prefer a more traditional forum or wiki. The signal to noise ratio is much better. Search doesn't overcome the problem of the garbage that shows up in slack or discord.

I'd expect somewhere around €600 for a decent enclosure and something like a GTX 1070 vs \~€1200 for a Macbook Pro. It may well be the case that the Macbook Air wouldn't get the most out of an eGPU though. Ultraslim laptops will always have an issue with heat dissipation and the CPU isn't going to get to use Turbo Boost much at all, which would limit performance improvement for sure. But mileage does vary on this and so specific research (as you have clearly done and I advised earlier) is always recommended before dipping a toe into eGPUs in general.
---
My bad. It's 31 disc. So it's 31/0/20. I edited my previous post :p
---
Usually the new/worst geared priest can take this role, since the application of shadow weaving is not afected by good gear.
---
Without the pvp it doesn't feel like warcraft. You are entitled to your opinion but without the conflict the world feels silly to me. It keeps things exciting and interesting. As far as ganking. Thats just your view of pvp servers. Ganking happens but what happens far more often is on level conflict.
---
As far as it not being a part of the original design. This is true for sure but the original design never would have hit 8 mil+ subs. It is a massive and integral part of what made the game a success. You can't just deny that because you don't like it.
---
For my part. I think raiding is dumb. You stand in the bosses junk for hours on end and hit the same button over and over. That being said. Clearly for many people raiding is a huge part of why they love classic. However for me it's far more sacrificable then pvp to maintain an authentic wow feel.
---
Ally Dwarf. Horde Orc.
---
Yes I heard that's a particularly annoying spec as you cannot farm DM
---
Warrior, Mage, Warlock, Priest, Rogue. That’s definitely a strong pick.
---
I dont weigh killing some1, i weigh explicity waisting your own time to go to a zone where you will easily oneshot other people JUST to waste your own and their time while gaining nothing but selfenjoyment through others suffering is a scumbag thingy to do.
---
Except just about every major private server also has exactly such a rule in place and they don't seem to fail because of said rule's existence.
---
And so once again what you're repeating is "the server will be exactly what I want, if you don't like it I don't want you playing on it." And yet if one aspect of that server is modified to be more in line with basic human decency and the behavior of the vast majority of players, you think everyone is going to be like you and take your ball and go home (quit).
---
Just looks like the pot calling the kettle black to me. You're complaining about whiners but you would whine just as hard if the shoe was on the other foot. Perhaps those faceless toons actually have real people on the other side of the screen just like yourself, hmmm.
---
You're mixing up the responsibilities of the server and the client. The game client, for the most part, is "dumb" in the sense that it's responsible for presenting the world, characters, objects, etc. based on what the server tells it. Stat calculations including how pets scale is all handled server side.
---
tauren. cant lose with 10 druids
---
Thank you so much for your reply mate!
---
Seriously, this all seems so cool and so fun, especially point 4 :D.
---
Did you have a difficult time choosing a class? What other classes were you thinking about, and why did you rule them out?
---
What race will you be playing brother? 
---
I've tried the private servers and I usually last until STV until I just lose interest from the ganking and stop playing. I get that some people enjoy it but man I'm looking forward to being able to play the game at my own psce again
---
He may not intend to level staves, in which case he might out-level it by the time he gets the skill up.
---
I'm on the L-Word server.  Which is ironic, since I'm a straight guy.
---
How exactly can you ping people on a forum to log in to do a dungeon run?
---
Been there, done that.
---
I agree people that prefer pve servers don't like conflict. No matter how fun you think it is. They don't get any fun out of conflict. Convincing them to play on a pve server won't change that or make them happen.
---
Shaman is definitely Chain Lightning/Heal I think.
---
The thing is, with PvE servers you can still PvP, either by flagging yourself or by going into BGs. You have complete control over what part of the game you take part in at any time. If you’re really close to the next level and just want to grind it out you can not be flagged and grind it out. Or you can flag or go into bgs if that’s what you’re into. With PvP servers you can be forced into PvP when you’re just in the mood for PvE.
---
It’s not about not being good or not wanting excitement. It’s about wanting choice. 
---
I had a 60 warrior geared and a 60 hunter alt in Vanilla. Can confirm-definitely ganked noobs in STV for fun regularly. Waiting to raid to be ready? Gank noobs. Waiting for ZG? Gank noobs. See group of noobs working on a quest? Whirlwind or multishot and one hit all 3. Good times lol. 
---
No matter with or without mount, Priests are incredible smooth to lvl with no downtime. With a Paladin I watched 2 Season of Stranger things, it was a horrible leveling experience. Especially Murlocs gave my nightmares. 
---
On top of that, you need 1 Skill to raid from MC to Naxx, in Dungeons and in PvP. There is no skill required with this class. And of course, everyone and their mother complains about their Buffs. 
---
I ended up with a page full of Macros for different players.
---
Why do I write about lvling? The OP wrote this:  **I'm reluctant to play a holy priest again because it's just so frustrating to level in classic.**
---
The Paladin was a huge letdown for me, because I listed to everyone who said how awesome they are, because no one talks about the issues this class has. If this person, hated the Priest LvLing, he is going to loath the Paladin. IMO
---
The mount isn't going to make up for that.
---
Can't comment on the Shamen.
---
The only one I ever saw was on a druid
---
My wife is a care bear and she is quite snuggly. I am okay with care bears. Not everyone needs to be a seal team six candidate.
---
I remember leveling my first character (a warrior) and was embarrassed by the fact that I didn't have any shoulders. A friend that I made on the server gave my the gray level 15 shoulders when I was like level 22. I was ecstatic to finally have a pair.
---
Once again, you have your PvE server option. Go play there if you don't like the actions of a PvP server. People have whined about this since 2004, it isn't going to change. Ganking/camping is part of the game on a PvP server. If you don't like it, don't play on one. It really is that simple. Your stance is part of the problem, just like those insisting PvE players can't actually like their style of the game are the problem.
---
Accept the realities of what the two server types are, and make your choice. Then don't complain. If you roll PvP, see you in STV.
---
True, one of the upshots of discord is the ability to sit in multiple forums and ping people who are not currently logged on. But then again, when I'm offline, I'd like to actually be offline. I'm still back on my two main objections: Electron apps are ass, and I think that the giant pile of funding and recent e-sport aquistion of Discord puts the near-term focus of the product under serious question.
---
unfortunately, no. it's possible, but there's a lot more than 16 debuffs to be chosen from.
---
I always used alt+4 as one of my keybinds for situational totems.. the amount of times I’ve alt f4ed in the middle of a fight because I’m dumb is pretty embarrassing. 
---
When I first started thinking about a server to play on in classic I thought, "no way I'm playing on a pvp server. I probably wouldn't have enjoyed vanilla nearly as much on one". Then googled my old server and realized I had always played on one. Doh!
---
You're looking at damage meters in a vacuum. Those parses from pservers guilds with tryhards in full consumables. Their tanks have tfury and are popping expensive engineering grenades on cd to generate more threat. You can't expect this kind of environment for 95% of the playerbase. Does a fury warrior do more dps than a hunter in a vacuum? Yes. But hunters can feign death to instantly reset their threat at anytime. Unless you're in a top 1% world class guild your tank probably won't have the threat to hold a max dps fury warrior. This is where hunters shine. While your warriors are sat afk White hitting the hunter is going full damage on the boss.
---
There's plenty of opportunity for variety in BGs, dungeons, raids, etc. I actually enjoy the occasional PvP, I just want it to be on my terms.
---
Out of the two, which ones wins?
---
Hunter the first thing that comes to mind is freezing trap. Feign Death would be another good one. Anyone who thinks auto shot/attack is a signature ability of a class has obviously never played one. You can rule out things like Auto Shot or Bestial Wrath because they are not baseline abilities.
---
I don't want the pvp server experience. If I want the pvp experience I can queue for a bg. Sorry but getting gabled while I try to zone into a raid isn't the full experience. It's miserable.
---
Damn okay, must've been a custom cap on they who we do not speak of a while ago.
---
Several classes absolutely need to do some starting zone quests though sadly. Locks for example get their imp from those quests and only from those quests.
---
Dungeons, raids, BGs, trading, RP for the people that are into that, group quests, guilds, etc. The great thing about this game is there's content for everyone, and it's not even like you can't PvP on a PvE server lol, you just get to do it on your terms in actually balanced environments in BGs
---
I didn't ree a single time. I only correct people who claim pve servers aren't the real experience.
---
I’m not so sure I agree. My three characters I leveled pre-TBC were Priest, Paladin and Mage. I found they were progressively easier, but it might have just been that I was gaining experience with each one. I wasn’t AOE farming, but it seems like from memory, Paladin was almost easier than Mage. It was a long time ago, but I did it all as Ret and only rerolled when I learned how useless Ret was at raiding.
---
This sub is so shit
---
That's private server BS. It does not decay. Stop spreading misinformation please 
---
Yeah what a dumbass he is.
---
Human or Undead because they have access to a range of classes - Warrior, Priest, ranges dps/caster.
---
Unless I get distracted by another zone, Dun Morogh is definitely at the top of my list, since I plan on making a Dwarf first.
---
I feel like hunters are also being SERIOUSLY underestimated in PvP. More or less their entire kit is long range, instant cast, burst damage or cc.
---
With their myriad of traps, melee and ranged skills, pet micro and kiting I think they easily have the highest out-play potential of any class in the game.
---
Dwarf doesn't have any dps casters, though (except shadow priest)
---
Curious to know... Are the people that vote "no" to guild banks in Classic playing currently on a vanilla pserv, or have they played on one recently?
---
Are there just lot of people that just do not remember or have not experienced the annoyance and unnecessary complexity that a guild bank entails for a large raiding guild?  Wish my current pserv guild could have a easily visible and managed bank, so that members could see for themselves that "we need more XXX mats for XXX raid/progession!!" instead of just sending a single individual thousands of gold worth of item that people put in hundreds of hours to collect, and having blind faith...
---
Didn't know honestly. Sorry for that. So it just never decays? 
---
i understand that but i know i will be gimped no matter what i do. i just want to do some easy quests and pass the time for a few weeks. i know gameplay changes a bit later but i was able to manage ok on my 24 warrior. Thanks for the advice though.
---
That information is new to me.
---
Will the retail 1.12 itemization be a different one than private vanilla 1.12 itemization?
---
I mean they also can't win, but sure.
---
Perfectly said
---
The fuck does this even mean lol
---
Some European guilds still use TS but most of the community is on Discord these days, as far as I know.
---
Well it's not about being good for you. Many people don't wanna play on a pvp server because they are bad. All they do is die a lot so they move to a pve server and think to themselves. I might try pvp servers for my second character when I am more experienced. Nothing wrong with this not everyone has 15+ years experience.
---
As far as excitement. Yes you can pvp on a pve realm. That being part of what makes a pvp server fun. Is that your consent is irrelevant. Fairness is also irrelevant. For many people this can make things even more exciting. I for one have been playing for 15+ years. Unless the person has 10+ levels on me. My mage is prolly going to win. Even in 2 on 1 match ups. This is part of what makes it fun as well. Winning even though the odds are not in your favor.
---
Today Iearned "trading" is fun in wow.
---
To be honest I think it's fine. Unlike melees, Hunters are top tier levelers and grinders, FD and traps bring fantastic utility, their kiting is untouchable and in BGs Hunters are the worst enemy of melees because of their superiour range and instant ranged CCs, while applying constant pressure with their Pet and on top of that they are one of the least gear dependand DPS classes in the game. Hunters just bring fantastic tradeoffs to the table, yes they are kind of the "sidekicks" of WoW but they are really, really good at that.
---
&gt;You are entitled to your opinion but without the conflict the world feels silly to me.
---
Since you recognize that the "important" parts of WoW are subjective, it doesn't seem like you're the kind of person I was addressing with my post. But I'll respond to other things you said just to clear them up:
---
&gt;As far as ganking. Thats just your view of pvp servers.
---
I mentioned ganking once as an example of the kind of argument some people make. Don't mistake that for me saying "all world PVP is ganking" or some other strawman. I understand the many forms world PVP takes.
---
&gt;It is a massive and integral part of what made the game a success. You can't just deny that because you don't like it.
---
Never denied that or felt like denying that. I also don't think I said I don't like it.
---
I merely challenged the idea that PVP is immutably a "large part" of vanilla WoW. 
---
&gt;Maybe 10% of people who played classic raided. 100% of people have pvp'd
---
While you're providing no source for either of these claims and I sincerely doubt that **100%** of people in vanilla PVPd (probably a very high percentage tried it at least once if I were to *guess*), the obvious response to this is that raiding is not the only type of PVE content. You *could* confidently claim that 100% of people have done some type of PVE content given that it was the only method of leveling in vanilla. But that doesn't really have any bearing on whether people enjoy one over the other or both. As you said, it's up to taste. 
---
exp total is off. 59 to 60 is over 200k, forget the number exactly.
---
It's not a waste of time if you enjoy yourself. It's a game after all.
---
Now, does that enjoyment come at the cost of another players? Sure, but that can be true when you gank people of your own level.
---
We know what pvp servers are like. You will get ganked, often, and likely by players that can kill you by simply sneezing on you. If this angers you, it's your own fault for playing on a pvp server and expecting anything different.
---
Is the place filled with dinosaurs?
---
None of my friends will RP. Every now and then back in vanilla/tbc at late nights me and my mate would join RP servers as level 1's and see who could make the most gold. tbh it was so much fun. I hate people who make fun of RP'ers, its full of people having a fun time on their fantasyRPG. I'll probably make a second character once the initial buzz dies down on an RP server and just enjoy the fun
---
I started on a PvP server because my friends were playing on one when they got me into the game.  I soon regretted playing on a PvP server since I got ganked all the time, and you always have to watch your back.  However, after playing that server for years, I came to enjoy it.  Eventually I rolled a few alts on a PvE server and did not enjoy it one bit as it was boring.  You still get griefed (in different ways) on PvE servers, just not  in the same way as a PvP server.  
---
There is nothing like being caught by surprise by a member of the opposite faction who intends to gank you, only to turn the tables and obliterate him/her.  During BC I played an elemental shaman, and whenever I got ganked on him (if I couldnt handle the situation) I'd log onto my rogue and exact revenge.  It was well worth the time and effort spent leveling a counter-class alt for revenge.  
---
It's called world of WARcraft ffs.  Horde and Alliance are supposed to be bitter enemies, so you can be damn sure I'm attacking every gnomeloving SOB I see!
---
95% of "PvP" is high levels killing low levels. Sure, you *might* get a decent skirmish every once in a while, but let's not pretend the vast majority of PvP isn't just fresh level 60's looking to flex in Redridge.
---
Its less than 15 ap for each of your maybe 3 hunters.
---
Paladin - Blessings
---
Hunter - Feign Death
---
Those are my only disagreements I think
---
Yes 
---
I stand corrected :)
---
It's an element in MMOs. He said if you play pve server then you're not playing an MMO. Trading and the AH are an example of why that's false.
---
I think so, #diversewildlife
---
I'll keep this in mind, tho I don't think I'll level as demo.
---
Warrior - [MS, Overpower, Hamstring, Execute] or [Bloodthirst, Death Wish, Whirlwind, Flurry] or [Charge, Thunderclap, Revenge, Sunder]
---
Paladin - HoJ, Heals, Seals, Bubbles, and Buffs
---
Hunter - Hunters Mark, Multishot, Concussive Shot, Serpent/Viper Sting, Traps
---
Rogue - Stealth, Ambush, Vanish, Blind, Backstab, Kidney Shot, Gouge, Eviscerate
---
Priest - Fear, Heals, SW:P, Renew, Resurrect
---
Shaman - Grounding/Tremor/WF Totem, Frost Shock, Lightning Shield, Heals, Lightning Bolt
---
Mage - Portals, Fireblast, Cone of Cold, Frost Nova, Blink
---
Warlock - Death Coil, Fear, Soul Link, Soulstone, Summoning
---
Druid - Shapeshifting, Roots, Moonfire, Rejuv
---
&gt;This whole notion that pvp servers are just people (especially rogues) ganking lowbies or ganking people fishing all day is kind of dumb.
---
It's not dumb. You just described 95% of "PvP" on PvP servers.
---
I always played warlock and i felt fear, ritual of summoning and soulstone as my signatures.
---
Also, hunters can't be relying on trinkets for hit if they want to trinket swap when aq trinkets come out.
---
It's alright. After your 50g respec you're stuck at that cost in Vanilla, otherwise there be no real pain or point to hold down a spec. If you could respec each month for a gold that would be kinda broken imo.
---
Just to get gangbanged on your lvl60 by a crowd of lvl30-40's.
---
Bear in mind this is another example of private servers skewing expectations, but for a slightly different reason than the usual private server bashing.
---
Private servers generally have a higher population cap. This means more bored 60's. More bored 60's = more people running around and ganking. 
---
The reason it is near endless is because the sheer number of people support it being endless. A more traditional player cap like official Vanilla had would be a different beast entirely. People got ganked, people got camped. But people didn't get 24/7 ganked and camped in Vanilla. 
---
Ranked in terms of strength... Alliance:
---
- Human: has the best class variety. With access to two supports for Warrior and double casters for covering the healers, they're strong all-rounders.
---
- Dwarf: has strong double support like human, but replaces Mages and Warlocks with Hunters. The warrior + support lineup is solid but without proper support from ranged DPS it has some major flaws. I don't think Hunters alone can cover those weaknesses properly, and the racials won't outweigh the power of casters (particularly mages) either.
---
- Night Elf: Yet another warrior + double support, but Druids aren't nearly as good at that as Paladins. They face the same problems as Dwarf, but with weaker racials. One BIG thing is that few races will have access to strong FC's however, but I don't think that will be enough to outweigh Paladins. A well-coordinated enemy team should be able to overcome the FC mobility disadvantage.
---
- Gnome: No healers at all. Nothing else needs to be said, really. Frankly, given their class selection, the most terrifying thing that could come out of Gnomes is just 10x Mage lineups (which is actually pretty terrifying though).
---
Horde:
---
- Troll: Yes. Their PvP racials are garbage, but they have the best access to classes IMO. Warrior + double support + mages is superb. They win on class variety alone.
---
- Undead/Orc: I think it's a tie between these two. Undead doesn't have double support, while Orc doesn't have mages. Both have strong PvP racials. They both miss something pretty important.
---
- Tauren: More or less equivalent to Night Elves, except they're "worse" because there aren't any Gnomes to be completely bottom-tier.
---
An overall winner is hard to point out. Trolls have Shamans, Humans have Paladins. Trolls have Hunters, Humans have Warlocks. Both classes perform more or less the same role and are pretty similar in group PvP strength. Both races have racials that don't really matter in premade BG's either, because both races won on class variety alone. I'm personally gonna go against popular opinion and give the victory to Troll, just because I disagree with the popular assessment of Paladin &gt; Shaman. But really it's a toss up.
---
Found the guy who rolled PVP and got gsnked alot and never really improved their PVP skills. Don't be so salty dude. Next time, roll on a PVE server.
---
It's a meme. [30 year old boomer](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-year-old-boomer)
---
&gt;30 Year-Old Boomer is a character spread on 4chan mocking older millennials who enjoy things that are considered to be out of touch with younger millennials, particularly in regards to video games.
---
Basically just the newest way of quickly insulting and dismissing someone without having to think too much about it. 
---
You need to start a new tradition where every Tuesday morning you blare the log in menu music for 6 hours straight. Make sure to slip in the sounds of a fat man weeping at like 1/5 volume too.
---
I agree completely.
---
because a 60 rogue ambushing for 100% of my hp when i am a lvl 23 mage killing mobs in duskwood is because im unskilled lol.
---
Birds are dinosaurs.  So likely.
---
Well let's start from the bottom.
---
* Gnomes are worst - they can't heal at all.
---
* Night Elves, Tauren, and Dwarves both lack warlocks and mages.  Although all three can be hunters, losing Polymorph and ranged fear is pretty bad.  They all do have multiple healing classes, but again lose out on important CC.
---
* I'll take orcs and trolls out next.  Orcs are great classes, but I feel that missing out on mage hurts them more than the others.  Same for Troll and Warlock.
---
* That leaves us with Humans as the default for Alliance, and Undead for Horde.
---
Now, if you were instead to look at starter zones...Gnome + Dwarf would be amazing, and Troll + Orc would also be amazing.
---
Haven't played it in years and I can still remember the exact sound, EQ ding was way more scary and loud than WoW one haha :)
---
Yup, very true.
---
I'll be going a Druid, a tanking/healing spec. I am fully aware as I look for groups as a tank, some people won't invite me, other will. Some pug raids wont let me OT or DPS, and will ask that I heal. Which is fine, ill have gear for it all. Anyone going a hybrid class/build need to be ready to be denied or asked to do a role they don't enjoy as much
---
That's not dumb, that's pure genius!
---
This is one of the most pathetic posts I've ever seen on a wow forum. Hahahaha
---
Baby boomers, or old people want things catered to them. You don't have to be in your 60s to think like a Boomer either.
---
"I'm not 14 anymore, I have a family and a kid, I don't have time for... raiding, finding groups, gearing, traveling, pvp grinding, 40 mans, 20 mans, 10 mans."
---
So you're not 14 anymore, you don't have time for video games. But you will resub for classic cause of nostalgia, however you'll play with safety bumpers before you ultimately quit 4 weeks later. 
---
That's what it means.
---
I played WoW all through vanilla, BC came out and it honestly didn't seem like a huge improvement to me but I still played, but a little more casually. By the time WoTLK came out I had quit. 
---
Honestly, I think you can play classic for years, I mean, maybe it'll get old after 5 or even ten years, but there is SO much to do. 
---
Everquest progression servers have some that lock at an early expansion, they pretty much dwindled and died, but WoW has so much more to offer after raids than EQ did.  With EQ, once you reached end game and did those raids for a few months, it was basically over. They were so heavily dependent on new content to keep things interesting.  Once population went down, it was so hard to level any alts because it was so group dependent. 
---
With WoW, there are improvements in all of these areas. Sure, raiding PVE end game might get old more than anything else, but there is so much more. 
---
You can wpvp, do different variety of BGs, rank pvp, try different alts that you can actually level solo or with fewer peoples, then raid and pvp/rank with them. 
---
I think there will be a lot more staying power with classic than people think. 
---
I personally wouldn't mind seeing new, original BGs to be released eventually in classic. It doesn't change the itemization or feel of it as a whole. You just add some new fun games to apply your classic toons to. 
---
I'm fairly nochanges but I'd be 100% on board with this
---
Thanks. I guess that's how I know I've made it in life, when "the kids" start calling me weird shit and saying I'm out of touch.
---
I'm not even 30 btw haha
---
Respec decay was absolutely a real thing. If you did not respec for an entire month the cost went down 1 tier. So if you were capped at 50g and didn't change for a month it would drop to 45g. Hold off another month, down to 40g. With a bottom end of I think 10g.
---
Ya we’ll im just saying it’s not as bad as u make it sound. It’s honestly fun trying to kill mobs and position urself so you can escape easily or stuff like that. for example if I’m a shaman I fight near the water in stv so I can fight underwater if needed due to underwater breathing, and no one will chase me Bc they’ll drown 
---
I don't really play melee classes so for a Warrior or a Rogue weapons obviously make a massive difference but even then I think in most cases you shouldn't buy them.
---
The weapons you usually want to have are blue ones, and blue BoE's are really expensive to buy from the AH while leveling if it's your first character.
---
On top of that, a lot of those great blue weapons will last you a good 10 levels so you shouldn't really have to keep going back to the AH to buy a green weapon every few levels to keep it up to date.
---
I think that as a melee class you should just try to plan the content and try to grind the dungeons you need for the drops, you'll get XP at the same time as well.
---
Sometimes you can probably get really unlucky though and outlevel your current weapon but know that you won't get anything else for a while, so in that case it might be acceptable to buy some green weapon from the AH but I don't think it's something you should need to do all of the time.
---
RP PvP is the only way! 
---
That is the best feral dps i have seen, he didn't seem to have world buffs either. 
---
I know one thing is certain. If blizzard makes banking and camping a banable offense or hinders it in any way, I'm definitely not going to play classic.
---
It is one of the only ways you can stoke any PVP in a zone. It's not like I can talk to the other faction and ask for PvP. You did that by banking people and then them calling their friends
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4iGo0dqsZE
---
When it comes down to it, I wouldn't pick a Class based on the leveling experience, either. But what it sounds like OP has issues getting past lvl 30.
---
I just pick the Druid, because he fits my playstyle better. That's about it.
---
As i said, i dont mind because it im gonna do aswell only to enjoy myself which is what the game is about, doesnt change the fact that it is an act insipired from itentionally do it just to ruin their time, aka scummy
---
Do you enjoy trading in the AH? Lol it's probably one of the most cumbersome and boring aspects of the entire game.so much so that they have mods dedicated to making it better.
---
If the warrior needed for the Shadowfang weapon that is a huge /eyeroll.  That is a hugely sought after twink weapon for the 19 bracket and should basically fund your level 40 mount just about unless it's a BRAND new server. Every Pserver I've never seen has that weap selling around 100g
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=1482
---
Very silly though for a mage to try and prevent other people rolling on cloth.  Here's a thought... Just bang out a few more levels and all the sudden that gear gets replaced.  Much better to just get a group together and take your chances than to exclude people because you don't want them impacting your chance to get gear. 
---
At 60 I can see it a bit differently because its end game but while leveling?  Just go get it bud.  Play the game. 
---
I feel weird after reading this idk why 
---
Pretty much. I bet you did t even make it to 60 in a PCP server until you cried back to the toon maker screen to roll on pve. I understand if you did that. But literally calling people names because they killed you on a video game is just laughable. And pathetic
---
The funny thing is you would think most people on this sub would be in their 30s or approaching them. Yet many still argue with the mentality of a teenager.
---
The term "boomer" is especially puzzling here since vanilla world PVP *is* the I-used-to-walk-uphill-both-ways-in-the-snow in this scenario but like I said, that person's probably not thinking too hard about it. 
---
Or if you’ve played any private server you just invite the closest person or people, you do the quest, you all says thanks then go on your way. 
---
&gt; Its already officially confirmed neither of these will be on classic servers
---
character services are possible, though
---
unless I'm missing some news?
---
The post literally says level 60 rogue. 
---
For hunter I would say feign death or freezing trap.  Auto shot is boring =p
---
You lack reading comprehension. Nothing I said is related to "fun." I am simply showing that despite less world pvp, pve servers are still MMOs.
---
Yup. I agree 100% with 240 being an average for people who are trying to level, But not too hardcore and not too casually.
---
Depending on time played a day this can be done in 1-4 months IRL time on average. 
---
I will get crucified for this, but wouldn't it be nice if there was an easy way to just give the item away voluntarily when a guy forgot to roll (or was being polite and didn't roll).
---
&gt; "our faction doesn't do this!"
---
I kind of enjoy that shared bullshitting, though. It's fun to be the underdog, or to have moral superiority, or at least to pretend that's the case.
---
I used to be this guy but in other MMO games. In World of Warcraft all I did was help out people I was friend with as long as I didn't pursue any goal and wasn't in middle of somthing.  Basically I valued friendship over some items I dropped and could sell for some extra money and was happy to show people some tricks, places, ways to deal with monsters or give them stuff which could help to better their experience. I miss overall social aspect of MMO games and devs nowadays don't understand that you require to have hard time in order to have need to group up, ask for help or don't know where are you going to ask for directions. They just give you shiny pointers to every quest, place, "secret location" and make everything so easy you want to puke.
---
Iron Man challenge, anyone?
---
Lol, na, read my other comments , the fact that you defend people like me is just hilarius haha.
---
don't even dare roll alts! Help us with out MC run, at least once a week!
---
Sure, but not worth the exploitation that will happen. 
---
if it was a good upgrade for the warrior I don't see why not.. that guy might use it long until he gets good shoulders. see many with Herod until 45+ish.. 
---
I feel like troll is underrated for this question. You have warriors shamans priests mages hunters and rogues to pick from. Shaman and warrior synergy and burst would be insane. Priest for the obvious reasons. Hunters can harass casters with viper sting if needed. Rogues can do their rogue shit. And mages r essential for cc. 
---
Anyone who makes any kind of big deal about loot during leveling dungeons is someone to avoid when you're 60 because they'll only get worse when the stake are higher.
---
Even this tank you described actually *did* create a bit of drama in the form of unnecessary discussion about loot that is useful for a few days at most. Maybe not that shaman feels a little regret and resentment that he otherwise would not have. Fast forward a few weeks to raiding: will that warrior constantly be chipping in his two cents about who should roll on what? No one needs that noise.
---
People exaggerate the amount of ganking, how much they get camped and how it makes playing impossible.
---
People gank. Sure. But it's easy enough to run away, hearth etc and just pick a different area/zone to quest in.
---
I think in most cases the reality is more along the lines of:
---
Gets ganked once or twice, rage logs and then heads straight to the forums/reddit to whine.
---
If you don't want the danger of PVP then just play on PVE.
---
I'm not much of a PVPer. I got Blood Guard in retail Vanilla. Mostly from just hanging out in Tarren Mill and running AV. I'm more of a PVEr who enjoys the threat of PVP. To me it just makes it more exciting.
---
Except I don't want anything catered to me? I'm just looking forward to playing a video game on a server type I already know we're getting. How the hell are you going to call it "safety bumpers" when it's literally something that existed in actual vanilla lol
---
Druids had Tranquility in Vanilla. Though it had a CD, and iirc it wasn't super great
---
Can't get to Classic DB from the computer I'm on right now.  It was a BoE 1H Axe.  Think it had a low-20s requirement.
---
On the other hand, my priest had Assassin's blade drop.  THAT will be sold.
---
I sit corrected. Thanks!
---
And you have obviously forgotten what the original argument was about. Thanks
---
I just did an awful Gnomer run with myself (Mage), gf (Mage), two priests and a Druid tank. Lmao
---
Generally I'm not much of a fan of yours. But this video I liked quite a bit, good info about solid content. Looking forward to the next one.
---
The same 'better community' that will police offenders of loot ninjas won't police offenders of another form of loot ninjas? Either you can take care of it with social structures, or you need external prohibitions from the developers (and since the ninja loot solution was forced personal loot and no master loot...)
---
I'm not defending you. What gives you that idea? I'm laughing at you for calling people on the internet scumbags because you were killed in a video game. It's pathetic
---
I agree with troll. A great shaman can roast ppl, enhance the dps of warriors exponentially, and off heal. Shaman + priests + Warriors + mages are some of the most if not the most key classes for a premade horde team imo. No other horde race offers that. 
---
Orc.
---
Not even a contest.
---
Yes. It not always "that" bad tho, really depend of the pop.
---
Note, I did not watch this video with sound. Aren't those items being in loot tables a bug unique to private servers?
---
Youre arguing the scenario that me ( a 60) is corpse camping a low lvl person who has no chance to escape / kill me because of the lvl difference is not a scummy thing to do. All the while i get nothing from it exept for enjoyment of waisting his time.
---
Any chance of doing this for horde?
---
They look like nothing alike ?
---
...and terribly saturated colors with janky models with weird hitboxes. I really hope that was just the alpha version though. 
---
&gt; rogues in vanilla were not able to gouge-restealth-sap IWIN combo to infinity 
---
Um, I think World of Rouguecraft videos would like a word with you. Rogues in vanilla could 100% sap and re stealth, and do a bunch of B******t to perma stun in PvP. it was a common strat in fact in 1v1s.
---
And in case you are wondering why you are being downvoted by everyone here, let me explain as best I can, in the nicest way I can.
---
You are in the Classic wow subbrreddit, a community solely here for Classic/Vanilla wow discussions. You have come in making assumptions about how pet scaling will work before the game has even been released. Furthermore you keep saying again and again you are asking about **Legion pet scaling**, this sub as I stated above is to talk about **Classic/Vanilla**, not Legion. Even if somebody here perfectly understood how hunter pet scaling worked in Legion, I doubt they would answer that question here. 
---
If you truly want some helpful advice, I highly recommend the Wow subreddit, they would be a far better place to look for info regarding Pet Scaling in Legion.
---
Kinda looked into it, but I'm a Pally, and still working on fine-tuning the rest of my route. If and when I finish, I might work on Horde, but no firm plans.
---
I am speaking stricly damage yes, but Im not looking at top guilds in a vaccum - this also mirrors my personal experience from raiding. I rerolled from a mage to play a fury warrior and raided in 3 different ~medium/hardcore guilds over a few years being an officer and class leader and the whole 9 yards. Crunching spreadsheets to help people balance their gear sets and all that fun stuff. I was definitely tryharding even though I wasnt in any sort of top guild. I find most guilds have at least a few people who are like this (and hopefully the main tank is too, since so much rides on him)
---
Anyone who is willing to put in a lot of effort and go above and beyond will get a lot more out of their class, definitely - and if you have a terrible tank then of course you will be threat capped all the time, but that doesnt change that I was able to nearly double some of my equally tryharding friends who played hunters :(
---
9.0 yards ≈ 8.2 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)
---
Thats a too narrow way of thinking.
---
I like conflict. Thats why Im in BGs.
---
I like tension. Thats why I like being on my toes in the open world.
---
What I dont like is being ganked by a mentally 12-year old, corpse camped and forced to quit the zone. Nor do I like calling out for help endlessly in the hopes of someone coming to aid.
---
Yes, it has its moments - but they are not worth the negative aspects to me that just make me feel bad. Im playing to have fun. Having no chance and being forced away / uselessly wasting time is the exact opposite of that.
---
Thats why Im on PvE. I loose out on the tension of open world pvp which is sad, but I also will NEVER encounter bullshit assholes who soak up my limited play time. And thats worth it.
---
Aww, I thought so. Check Google and compare maps
---
Pretty much all the private servers have had a custom cap for some reason, some even have 5g lol. This is something to consider for those who plan to play rogue or warrior since you'll have to spend 100g every week for respeccing alone if you want to PvP and PvE. 
---
Who has time to stay ahead of the curve leveling when streamers and WoW lifers do it in just four to 7 days? Anyone with a job, family or adult responsibilities would find this pretty hard to do. 
---
Not bitter...just saying, I run a business, have some semblance of a social life...I can’t just no life for a week. Cheers to all those who can, though. I’ll still enjoy playing, I think 
---
Ok u took it too far 
---
RP &gt; All
---
Kinda.
---
I’ve definitely noticed in my play time that horde are more likely to help a fellow horde out in world pvp. Whereas on my Ally most other Ally just run by. Not just in vanilla but in any xpac I’ve played I’ve found this to be true.
---
Might be cause the horde has more people who want WPvP or maybe it’s just a brotherhood type thing, dunno.
---
For me, I'd consider the signature ability of each class to be the characterizing sound/effect that announces their arrival to me in a world environment - usually me being ganked. That is to say, when I'm out leveling and I suddenly hear a certain sound or see a certain graphic and I say, "Oh shoot it's a &lt;class&gt;." With that in mind:        
---
                
---
Warrior: Charge            
---
Paladin: Hammer of Justice               
---
Hunter: Hunter's Mark                
---
Rogue: Cheap Shot              
---
Priest: Psychic Scream              
---
Shaman: probably Frost Shock, though I level Horde so this isn't very familiar              
---
Mage: Frost Nova                  
---
Warlock: Death Coil            
---
Druid: Moonfire
---
If the character you are playing can immediately or eventually get legitimate use out of an item, rolling "need" is fair game.
---
It's a pretty simple approach that many seem to agree with, but it's funny to watch how people throw that right out the window as soon as a BoE epic drops.  But even then the rule shouldn't change.
---
It's weird that Totem isn't there for Shaman.
---
Then you like the constraints. The point theyre making above is they want to play "at their own pace" and not get locked out of some content just because other players have control over it.
---
Broadly speaking it is very true however not entirely true for individuals. You will see mostly Undead on Horde despite Orc having the best PVP racial on Horde. You will see mostly Humans on Alliance despite Gnome and Dwarf having the best racials for many classes.  
---
  
---
I'd be more scared of a Dwarf Rogue or Gnome Mage than an Undead Rogue/Mage because I know which one has decided to min-max and which one picked for appearance.
---
Everyone on Lightshope agrees 60's killing in low level zones are no life losers. The real PvPers are ranking in premades. Only scrubs have fun ganking people who can't fight back.
---
Bro wtf is this foreign shit ur posting on a sub meant for 2004-2006 memories ONLY. Idc about u or ur guilds feelings or what u did in Goldshire in 2007. We were all done with wow smoking our first blunts n slammin poon. Last time someone did something like this they never returned to reddit. Uve been warned. 
---
It stands to reason that if horde has better PvP racials then the more PvP focused players will probably roll horde. But it isn't like no one on alliance side will PvP. At the end of the day both sides are gonna engage in world PvP, but you may find greater numbers of PvP focused players on horde side.
---
As with anything though it depends on the server. But that's the common trend.
---
I hate when people say ding every fucking level in vanilla it is so fucking annoying. There are only two levels that matter 40 and 60. And even 40 isnt that big of a deal. Link your mount and I'll grats you and 60 thats a big grats and welcome to the game but no one fucking care about you hit level 14 on your hunter. No one cares that you hit 26. Just play the game once you've done something of worth then you get a congrats in chat.
---
Good on the tank IMO. If you can/will use it even if it’s not for a few levels you should roll. That is my take. Shamans were being polite by not rolling but they should be allowed a chance at an upgrade just as much as anyone else in the group.
---
Some people get mad about stuff like that though. I’ve been in groups where people have been kicked for rolling on an item the leader or leaders friend wanted even though the other person could use it.
---
&gt;you're not playing an MMO
---
Totally
---
I’m all about that winterspring track. It’s like ur ascending to the sky’s of level 60. 
---
Let me put it this way: There is no horde equivalent of Redridge.
---
Every PVP server has horde guilds called like "Redridge Riders" or similar that consists of players who devote their playtime to locking down Lakeshore, killing both NPCs and players. However I have never seen an alliance guild called like "Ashenvale Assholes" or "Hillsbrad Hardcocks" who take up the other side. Alliance players just tend not to be that way. The most famous "griefers" of PVP server history are horde.
---
Nearly right, I'm a sit quietly in the corner and watch type of guy.
---
Is it like this on private servers
---
no you go vagina mode and pretend to have a dick
---
This. I’d like options to keep one realm Classic, another classic++, another tbc. 
---
LOL yay bot
---
Ding
---
I never don’t say ding.
---
Improvised wars at leveling zones is the best part of world of warcraft.
---
No changes.
---
I had these drop on back to back solo farm runs when I was trying to figure out what to farm gold for my fresh 60 warrior. I couldn’t believe it and then I sold them to buy devilsauce gear and quit that character when I realized I won’t have time to raid. Good times Elysium feb 2017
---
Truth. If you read wow diaries, they didn't even plan to have factions until very, very late in the project. 
---
1) Yeah, if it's unhappy it loses loyalty so eventually its loyalty would drain and it'd run away.
---
2) Not sure how it works with stabled pets.
---
Nice i will roll RP PVE too like i did in 2004. Which Kind of RP will do when Classic is released?
---
Not really easly, you need to pop bubble/bop for bandage atleast, 2  mobs is ok, and i don't talking about reckoning /sit abuse, just command and 2h wep
---
Currently leveling a pala on pserver. 
---
I think the core statement is true: 
---
&gt; They rolled on a PVP server for some other reason like population or BG queue times. They will not help you control territory or recover from a corpse camp. They will not be going rambo in the landscape thinning out your competition for quest mobs. Instead they'll be bitching about gankers in /1 and doing cutesy emotes at every horde they see hoping to be left alone. 
---
Alliance often will have many top tier PvPers but they're more likely to be focused on premades more than asymmetrical WPvP.
---
You can flip this argument on its head just as easily, however. If you're interested in WPvP why don't you roll on the side that will have a more target rich environment? You can be cynical and argue the army of undead rogues and their ilk are only looking for easy kills not interested in more challenging PvP encounters. Just as with the above quote I think theres an element of truth to that.
---
Find a group of like-minded people if youre interested in WPvP as alliance. RP-PvP is a server type that has a better balance ime.
---
Sry I don’t speak scrubish
---
10 levels later is probably excessive as they can find better at that point. But a Shaman rolling on Herod's shoulder for when they hit 40 is perfectly fine.
---
&gt; The way you phrased it makes it seem like you think World PvP doesn't exist on PvE realms, or following up on that
---
Most people who never played on a PvE server think that. Try asking around. I remember a guy being surprised that TM vs SS was a thing on PvE servers prior to BGs. He couldnt imagine the idea that someone would flag for PvP on a PvE server.
---
I got a nice chuckle out of it.
---
/me has reported you AFK (Away From Keyboard). Please type /AFK or you will be automatically removed from the battleground. 
---
ok, thats what I thought on number 1.
---
I just dont want to stable a pet and he runs away lol.
---
It was a safety bumpers back then too, and you're using your age as an excuse to use it yourself.
---
This kind of stuff is worse on private servers because higher population numbers means there's pretty much always someone bored and murdering people in Redridge. In official servers with normal population caps there just aren't enough people around to keep it locked down 24/7.
---
Launch is when the most gold can be made, after that it slows down until the next huge patch etc. 
---
I’m pretty sure my first shark attack gave me ptsd for awhile anytime a quest involved the ocean. The sharks face iirc was like a classic evil cartoon shark, and then the skull level just did it in for me. Never got so scared until I played gears of war a couple years later. 
---
You can't really say my view is too narrow. Of course it is. It's my view of it which is that the world is boring an unexciting without spontaneous non consensual pvp. You don't have to. Thats what great about the fact that they have two kinds of servers.
---
Personally I like the fact that those mentally handicapped griefers exist but I like the that they are Villains. I really like the fact that classic wow had players who's names were synonymous with being a shitty human. I think it gaves realms character and help bring the world alive. Everybody has names they remember from classic of the players they hated and loved. That was the beauty of it for me. If you don't like that it's cool but for my money you are missing out.
---
Will classic servers have population caps similiar to regular servers u think? 
---
It's ok to roll on an item that you'll be able to use in a few levels. It's also ok to pass on an item to let it go to someone who it fits better.
---
Usually what I see is if someone thinks a need roll would be selfish, they just ask in chat "do you guys mind if I need roll this?". It's rarely a problem.
---
hunter's lack the viability of endgame as they're typically pretty weaker dps after MC and only NEEDED for a few raid encounters plus there is a huge population. This is why I said Semi-speed running because Im not pushing world first, I just want to get 60 in 2 weeks.
---
what a fantastic take on such a common occurrence!
---
Druid must go feral charge+swiftmend spec, they are good on Arathi also, good support and flag defender. 
---
World pvp also good, you can kill anyone, except healers, i think, but its will be very time consuming. 
---
I would expect so, but I'm not aware of any official confirmation
---
I wouldn't join a guild that expects me to summon 30 people every raid. 3 or 4 would be acceptable and also there is more then 1 warlock in a 40 man raid..
---
I agree, also there is more then 1 warlock.. so at the most I'd maybe have to summon 10 people. =D
---
That's like saying it can still rain on the moon, you just have to put water in a bucket and pour it on your head.
---
Flagging for consensually PvP isn't remotely similar to playing on a real PvP server. For one thing, many players will avoid fighting you just because they suspect it's a truck (attacking a flagged character causes you to be flagged).
---
Fuck retail. My only concern is that they will try to re-coup production costs by jacking up the sub prices, or introduce a cash shop to classic.
---
Yesss! the skull level just topped it off for scary factor, all the exploring we did I thought every mob in the game past the starter zone was a skull and that you would have to guess its strength by just fighting it 
---
Ahhhhhh the good old days wish I knew nothing going into classic 
---
Hey I sent you two friend requests on discord. Would love to chat about joining up with you all :)
---
Is there a reason for population caps anyway
---
So, you have no clue how the exploitations will work. 
---
I'm familiar with how the game cycle works. I'm not sure you do. That was my point. 
---
'Launch' is not necessarily the time you make the most gold.
---
I was planning on getting eng for the teleporters as well no matter what class.
---
Unrelated to the post at hand, but the name of that radio. Grizzly Hill Radio.
---
Does anybody else around here think that Grizzly Hills is way, way overrated? Don't get me wrong, it's a nice zone, but the amount of hype it gets for what it is, is certainly confusing to me. The soundtrack isn't that great, and the layout, while nice, isn't mindblowing.
---
Played on an Everquest pvp server for four years where you could actually prevent other guilds and players from accessing dungeon and raid content.    
---
WoW pvp outside battlegrounds isn't hardcore mode, it's just gank mode in comparison.  I tried a pvp server (blackrock or dustmaul or something like that), and I got ganked a bunch in my 20s-40s, but as soon as I hit the 50+ zones the level 60 pvpers were notably absent.  I wonder where they were? :p    
---
Battleground pvp is where the real skill is.  
---
One reason why I love Rogue is you get so few buttons that it allows you to add lots of trinkets and consumables to your bar. 
---
Sure, every class requires a little prep work though. I mean rogues need to make poisons, hunters need to stockup food and ammo, mages need to make water and food.
---
Not this shit again. 
---
How strong you can be without legs? 
---
Once upon a time it was for server stability reasons. Hardware in 2004 was a lot different from what is available today.
---
The argument for keeping the cap where it was in classic despite no longer having the technical limitation is for reasons like what I described above. A large population means more people running around an area designed for a smaller number of people. So, quest mobs become more contested, PvP and ganking rates increase due to the volume of the player base, the economy can be impacted etc etc. In short, the classic game was balanced around a certain player cap.
---
I agree, but I they are all over the place, functionality-wise.  Totems are very iconic, to be sure.
---
The Chuck Norris jokes addon. 
---
They are on the loot table of oozelings that spawn in WPL and ST. But I doubt that blizzard will let these items slide :)
---
Would be great ye... But a lot of the list would have to be redone with 1.12 itimization. I really hope they don't go through with that. I hear some ppl talking about it, but I have yet to see a confirmation. 
---
Do you have some blue post to back this up?
---
Yeah, thats why mages are warlocks are my two front runners. Warlocks can do similar farms as mages but lack the mobility but in group content allow replacements to be summoned. Right now if a guy rage quits your group you'll spend 30+ min getting a replacement. 
---
Haha I loved those though. 
---
I have heard the same, I don't think blizzard will let them slide - but who knows?!
---
This honestly looks nothing like Un'Goro. Un'Goro is green, has lots of wildlife, and trees, I don't even recall a lake being in the crater. Nice karma bait tho.
---
&gt; hallucinating due to the nostalgia nuking my brain while I hear Legends of Azeroth for the 11th time 
---
Lmao, never quite known how to express that feeling until now.
---
Most guilds would be pretty annoyed if you showed up without a mana tide totem as a shaman. Some guilds might be okay with that but you will most likely be a resto shaman in cloth gear for a while before you can actually play 30/0/21 to it's fullest potential with nice elemental gear. MM hunters and SM/ruin warlocks on the other hand can use the same spec for both PvP and PvE. 
---
Actually, that's not a bad idea. I may add fire resistance and shadow resistance for at least tanks in the future.
---
I want someone who can farm gold early.. So Devilsaur or AOE DM is a must.  I want someone who is heavily wanted in raids and someone who can cut down on downtime. Typically for me this is a debate between warlocks and mages. Warlocks for saving 30+ min replacing people in groups or raids and mages saving tons of time by teleportation.
---
Gnomer is either a 20min romp through the zone where people jump in the right place, you finish your quests, get some sick leather pants, and go home. Or it's an hour+ of long runs back to the instance, longer runs through the instance, and people getting lost.
---
There is no in between.
---
Has to be the Xbox "turn 360 degrees and walk away" in trade chat. After all these years it still gets people, although it's basically an inside joke at this point.
---
Awesome! I'll be home tonight and we can talk!
---
If anything, I'd say it's shaman prio over the warriors since they can upgrade to plate soon, and Heavy Mithril Shoulders are crafted and almost as good. However I'd still roll as a warrior since the shoulders are great and so iconic. Also perfectly viable for a hunter to roll on them seeing as that much star is worth it.
---
This issue goes the other way too. Look at the Scarlet Leggings, should a 40 warrior roll on those even though he has access to plate? Absolutely, +20str is insane and the next real upgrade isn't till 50.
---
Having the world be "too full" really isn't a good thing to be honest.
---
PvE misses out on lots of the fun of vanilla though. I probably spent like 30% of my time in vanilla in BRM killing people. Also world bosses are 1000x more fun on pvp than pve. 
---
It has nothing to do with my age and everything to do with my time. I don't have the time I did when I was 14 and I'd rather not spend what I have doing corpse runs so some dude can get his jollies off ganking me. I frankly don't give a shit if you think that's a "valid excuse" (whatever that even means)
---
I'm the guy below hating on discord, and even I'll second this one. I run my own mumble server that I use since I prefer a pure voice chat app, but even I've given in to using discord for guild activities. Sometimes you just can't fight network effects.
---
I feel like you went into making this video with the agenda of making the classes look somewhat balanced somehow.  The leveling rankings make some sense in terms of just pure leveling speed.  But the PvP and PvE rankings just look totally skewed.  
---
In PVP every class has a role to play in premade grinding which makes them equal there so if you are going to differentiate PvP ranks what is left? Solo que BGs and World PvP?
---
Rogues 10/10 in PvP seemingly just because they are the best at ganking people? While being useful in WSG are one of the least impactful in AB and AV?  Also incredibly cooldown dependant which is fine when you CAN pick your battles but if the option is to pick a battle and likely die because your cooldowns arent up, or don't engage and live but lose the BG you really don't have the choice as much as you think and it can be more of a negative when you aren't doing premades.  Rogues are great in 1v1s but WITH their cooldowns and certainly aren't the best especially in the average players hands.
---
Warriors 8/10 PvP? again on what metrics? They are the most gear dependent and consumable dependent class in the game, and also the worst 1v1 class in the game with all things being equal (gear skill etc).  They can surely charge into deleting people later on but without a healer and or dispeller they enter the fray and end up at the rezzer in short order.  So with a dedicated healer and gear or premade sure great, but otherwise? Not so much.  Those AV turtles we all remember? Warriors needing to charge in the frost line and getting focused down immediately while all the casters healers and hunters poke from the lines - not so much fun for the wars.

Hunters 5 in PvP? This one blew my mind the most.  Hunter is easily the best class for solo queing BGs if you just want to wreck people and even for objectives imo.  In really any gear: dungeon sets, T1/2/3, pvp gear what ever you are going to 2 shot crit people 100-dead from 41 yards on the outskirts of the battles and have sooo much room to kite in wsg mid, AB, and AV.  They are among the best at defending flags and running down flag carriers but admittedly suffer in the tight quarter team fights in WSG.  They are the base defender of choice in AB and also great tower defenders in AV.  World PvP and duels they are among the best (hard countered only by close quarters, SL locks and dwarf SPs).  However as stated the big catch to hunters is their deadzone.   Even so being among the best at so many facets of pvp, the deadzone is really the only thing that keeps them from being broken.  And as much as we like to talk about rogues being able to chose their engage, hunters can chose to stay out in the open areas where they like to kite too.  Really can't get behind a 5.
---
As for locks, again what metrics are we basing these rankings on? SL is hailed by almost everyone as being the strongest 1v1 spec in the game with no counters.  Its not only viable at end game its broken good.  Even SM/ruin which can double as a raid and PvP spec is great for solo que BGs where you can melt down the entire enemy team even if you die for it.  However locks Achilles imo is the need for a specific pet for specific encounters.  That felpuppy is insane but there are a lot of times where you have a pet to your detriment and another pet (void sac, succy sleep, etc) would have won you the fight.  Id have to agree locks start out weaker and scale better with later patches tho.
---
When you start talking about PvE it seems the only thing that matters is the 40-man DPS meter for your rankings.  Hybrids get a penalty for being hybrids, pure dps get a penalty for being dps, warriors get a bonus for being #1 dps and #1 tanks?  I guess... if that is all that matters to people is the DPS chart but there is a lot more to PvE than just the 40-man raid meter.  Ease of finding 5-man groups - this is varies wildly not only by class but based on patch progression.  Tons of warriors tanking dungeons early on to get pre-raid BiS whether they are going prot or fury, then the tanks dry up and you have a ton of late levellers and alts looking for tanks for hours.  On top of that most wars aren't going to bring in a rogue (and in some cases hunter) that is going to roll against them for gear or join a group with them if they aren't the lead.  This can greatly affect the amount of time people spend sitting LFG while gearing up at 60.  Farming for consumables and BoE gear is also a huge factor.  While warriors may be topping the DPS chart they sure aren't topping the solo gold farming chart.  As for the various classes for raiding, all the healers except druid look pretty equal in terms of what they bring to the raid.  Some might heal a bit more while others provide more utility (buffs, wf, etc).  When it comes to DPS all warriors do is dps... they might off tank at times but they aren't curing or kiting, or dispelling, etc.  You could take no fury wars and complete raids.  Good luck killing enrage bosses without hunters.  And for this hunters get a 3 and wars a 10?  Pretty sure most guilds at the end of the day don't care if their raid took an extra 5 minutes to clear because any 1 person decided to play a hunter over a fury war which decreased raid dps.  There are things you need for the raid to succeed and function well and the DPS meter just isnt the be all end all of the PVE equation.

Esfand (or was it Tips?) Filmed when they had a Q&amp;A with the panel and they straight up answered questions about transmog and Cashshop with that it wont be a thing. And cited authenticity.
---
They also said Character services wont be at the start but MAYBE realm-changes will be later on since they did get added later on back then. But thats about it.
---
You must have played on a super carebear pvp server in vanilla. We had people camping low level npcs constantly. There would always be horde in Darkshire.
---
I want my epic mount, That's 1k, I want ENG thats likely another 1k though I've not mapped this out on a P.S so that might be more or less then 1k. So that's a easy 2k plus I want a surplus to keep me going until next content patch.
---
Played PvE or rather I played Normal servers day 1. (Thats what they were called in vanilla) and enjoyed it.
---
Will play Normal again this summer. Not interested in telling anyone else how to play, or whether they are enjoying themselves properly like some kind of authoritarian moron.
---
Play what you like, and let other people play what they like. If you need something to boost your ego or make you feel superior to others, find something other than a video game to do it with.
---
i may give mage a try. Im just looking to play easy and pass some time.

It‘s not true, on light‘s hope there‘s still a raiding population around.

---
On my rogue I was alliance so I used Dartol's Rod and a giant's growth potion to make myself a big furbolg, then I would stealth ontop of the horde Gadgetzan flightmaster, people would accidentally right click on me and the guards would destroy them.
---
I kited the feathermoon stronghold boss to Orgrimmar, she had a giant AOE moon beam that would kill everyone.
---
Same with kiting an emerald dragon to Org, and unkillable mobs.
---
I'd summon people to the bottom of a very deep geyser in Ungoro so they would drown. 
---
I'd /duel lowbies in PvE zones and then cancel the duel right as is started so they would attack me outside of the duel and flag then I would kill them. 
---
Killing the important NPCs for the enemy faction.

You mean repetitive like this? 
---
Great, you can do that with any class including warrior. Pick your favorite 
---
Your instinct is the same as mine with fishing, I think that would probably be the easiest for you. If not, perhaps you could use the time to advance a profession if you can grind the mats for it during play time that is more active. 
---
The only other thing I would recommend is playing the AH if you can get some start up gold, although that's not in everyone's wheelhouse.
---
Sometimes you just wanna kill mobs in peace.  
---
Dude, I need the epic bow, I’m a warrior and the agi give me crit

Had a run like that last night if a server that rights with porthmale. 20 minute curb stomp and my hunter has nice new dungarees.
---
&gt; I kited the feathermoon stronghold boss to Orgrimmar, she had a giant AOE moon beam that would kill everyone.
---
Not doable in Vanilla, it was only the post-Cataclysm iteration of [Shandris Feathermoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFuBmkVvUTQ) that would destroy Orgrimmar with her AoE.
---
Even loatheb you can eat and drink while everyone else bandages, and once you get your 6 piece mana isn't an issue on that fight at all
---
I could count the amount of times this happened on 1 finger.
---
True, memory is kind of hazy from when I did what, but it still works with one of the emerald dragons, and Kazzak, and certain unkillable mobs.
---
The best semi-AFK is making mage portals and water. Very nice steady income for a few seconds attention here and there. 
---
Prob nelf druid. Tform + meld
---
It's fairly uncommon to need a replacement though. Imo Mage is the way to go.
---
Farming for pets and playing the AH can be fun and profitable.  You can use the money to level professions in town.
---
Yes but alot of that would persist if they logged off, besides mage food, but thats just them sitting there and casting. Locks have to go out and find high enough level mobs and farm their souls. It's extra time/effort that the closest thing for most classes is going to a vendor.

I would highly recommend finding a resource heavy location like Un'Goro mountain for MSS and thorium, or the ooze hill in hinterlands for ghost mushroom, and camping it :)

In terms of wpvp possibly due to undead having canabalize and orcs having stun resist but I feel like in organized pvp id pick having paladins on my side 9/10 so its a tradeoff really

I don't necessarily think that Galivet's argument goes too far. The point being made is that reputation is important, arguably more so that a gear upgrade that will be transient at best. I would much rather have someone in my guild who has grace in defeat than have someone who constantly nitpicks gear allocations. How do you think that would play out in LC guilds?
---
Mages can easily aoe grind levels if need be.

Just go to grind spots and risk dying once in a while.

There are some craftables that the mats on the AH plus vendor mats are cheaper than the vendor value of the craft able item. If you snag all of those then create a mass amount you can profit while afk. I know one tailoring item this worked well with from private servers that was netting me like 20s each minute craft depending on AH supplies. 
---
Source : i crunched the numbers 
---
yes because there's nothing quit as chicken shit in world pvp as running flagged into a group of unflagged players who can all get the first shot at you.
---
what really takes balls is being level 60 and one-shotting lowbies from stealth.
---
The rules go out the window because it's an entirely different situation. 
---
A priest isn't likely to ninja your mail helm just so he can vendor it for 2g. What is very likely however is that a priest will roll need on a pair of epic mail gloves that sell for 1000g so everyone should just roll need to avoid such a problem from occurring. All 5 people get the exact same use out of a BOE and all 5 people have an equal shot at it and so it's fair. 
---
That's be great! 
---
Yeah, the main dealbreaker was if I actually liked healing. I just recently healed in RFC for the first time, and apparently I'm pretty damn good at it! It was lots of fun especially when the people were complimenting my healing. I'm 100% set and stone maining Druid now. I love supporting other players, plus being unique and gearing quickly is awesome.

Pick a RPPVP server so when you get banned for ganking and camping by blizzards care bear force you can claim you are just Role playing lol.

I put a Warcraft 2 music file in as the sound test of my testing script at work. It would play every few minutes. Gave me a little kick of happiness throughout the day.

I think a big part of it in actual classic was just a lack of knowledge.
---
I rolled a pvp server because all my high school friends were there, invested a fair chunk of hours into it and didn't really see my first horde until duskwood or STV. Knew pvp was a "thing" there, was not aware I would be a level 25-30 repeatedly camped by some undead who just had nothing better to do.
---
By then I felt too invested in the character to leave, and again, friends. But eventually I did finally pull away from pvp servers just because it wasn't my thing.
---

---
They don't get the same use out of those BoE mail gloves if there's a Hunter who wants them.  What I'm saying is that in these situations, the Priest who wants to argue *"lol everyone* ***needs*** *gold bro"* is just an asshole, if there's someone in the party who can genuinely use those gloves.
---
Actually the modern client runs smoother than all the mac versions of Vanilla I have found - my macbook could fry an egg and sounds like an airplane taking off after 30 mins with those.
---
Lol dude all the warrior did was say you shouldn’t feel like you can’t roll on that Bc u can’t use it for two levels and I can use it now. He wasn’t doing anything more than simply that...
---
Don't mind me as I'm a level 24 warrior rolling up in a fucking azure cloth hood.
---
Do you know if it actually decreases ranks and then runs away? Like, would it take about same time to go rank 6 to 1 than 1 to 6?
---
I always wondered about that.
---
imo need means need right now and not "I will need this in the future". The shaman cannot physically wear it yet so the expectation is that he should not need on it without asking. That being said 95% of groups will have no problem with you needing if you ask first.
---
 
---
Should I be able to need on enchanting plans if I plan on leveling it in the near future? Probably not, because rolling is based on your group expectations in the present.
---
Eyes of the beast from underneath the red ridge bridge :) 
---
This is how I met so many people. Crushing campers is fun af.
---
eng is less than 100g to level ^^
---
Maybe also consider this; Everyone is playing together and vying for gear upgrades, not every class is the same and some drops are desired by multiple classes. Loot will be distributed in accordance with whatever rules set by the raid or guild beforehand. Not everything is simply decided by the Rocket Racoon 'I want it more' mentality. 
---
Though on my current pserver, theres a dude who just sits his pet right in the middle of Sun Rock in Stonetalon and its a wrap. Here'll park it there for hours lol

---
I’m kind of with him on the scummy thing and I’ve never understood people who like ganking. The lower level has a 0% chance of survival so I struggle to see how the higher level isn’t just a dick in this scenario. 
---
It’s become part of the game sure, but it’s far different than a lvl 58 attacking a lvl 56, where it can be a real fight. 
---
Theoretically yes a fully loyal pet could eventually lose all its loyalty and run away. But its loyalty has to drain all the way down to the minimum level first which would take a very long time of being unhappy. The game will kick you off if you are AFK too long so realistically you'd need to be online for like a day or more of /played time (not sure about the exact loyalty drain rate, but it isn't very fast) without feeding your pet for it to decay enough to run away.
---
I like this story, as a hunter.
---
This warrior is a man of my own kin.
---
Ah yeah Shadowfang is a level 19 sword with slow speed and a damage proc.  It's absurd for level 19 twinks =P  Other BOEs are barely worth anything on AH (maybe a gold or so on average) so that doesn't seem bad. 
---
Kinda the definitive answer
---
Haha yes such a LOOT TRADING!
---
Potential for abuse is there sure, but it also really helps the community engage a little more and not be stuck with these all or nothing, 20-30 second timer loot roll. 
---
Theres still a decent amount of world pvp on pve servers. Specially with city raids and random stuff like that. You don't need to be on a PvP server to experience world PvP.
---
&gt;They don't get the same use out of those BoE mail gloves if there's a Hunter who wants them
---
Yes actually they do. 
---
First of all I was talking about edgemasters that go for 1000g+ which 60 warriors use to raid cause of the + weapon skill.
---
Now if you want those as a warrior you can pay 1000g for them on the AH. By winning them in an instance however you don't have to pay 1000g so you in theory just made 1000g.
---
A priest could take those same gloves and sell them on the AH and also make 1000g.
---
It's the same reason why everyone rolls need on material worth a significant amount of gold. I might not need a righteous orb from strat live because I already bought them off the AH to get my crusader enchant but that doesn't mean I should have to pass to a cheap ass rogue who didn't just buy his off the AH already.
---
There is no challenge to you in doing it. There is nothing whatsoever to prove by doing it. All you're doing, is briefly annoying someone by interrupting their day. WoW doesn't really have an open-world PvP system, it has an open-world *griefing* system.
---
Almost none of my open-world PvP experiences in classic have been "fair" (ie, both sides had a reasonable chance to win). My attacker has always been so much higher level that the idea is absurd; and/or has attacked by surprise from stealth while I was on low health, in combat.
---
There is nothing *courageous* or *skilful* about this type of behaviour.
---
It’s pretty much assumed that enhance shamans are looking for mail gear to use when level 40 at 38 when running sm.
---
I think it takes longer to level down than it does to level up.
---
Low consumable class? Any healer. 
---
Lowest number of buttons? Paladin
---
You can heal shaman but you’ll be dropping totems every pull.. hope that’s not too much 
---
This is pve only... pvp shaman is much more complex 
---
/chicken
---
Forgot to add too that later on in the run, scarlet legs dropped.  Both warriors already had it so they rolled greed but so did everyone else- and one of the warriors won it again.  Should have passed but it does sell for 1g so there's that!  So now a great leg piece was wasted.  RIP
---
If that's how you want to play, that's fine.  But if you are literally rolling need on an *item you can't even use* and winning it over someone for whom it would be a genuine upgrade, I'm of the opinion that you're kind of an asshole.  That gold justification is super flimsy in my eyes.
---
Thousand needles as alliance, simply due to the "danger" factor of always having to be ready to pvp.
---
From a purely pve perspective, Westfall. 
---
Maybe hang out in a heavily farmed some and skin other people's work?
---
Until Blizzard finally gets around to creating  classic servers, there *isn't any other reasonable option* than PvP servers. For some reason, they are *all* PvP servers, with WoW's broken griefing system.
---
If your time is so scarce and valuable, why don't you go and play retail. You have to do next to nothing and you get gear given to you daily. You don't have to learn  any strats or contribute to a guild and you can experience all of the raid content. You don't even have to leave the major cities 90% of the time for any reason. I'm sure that no one will pvp you and waste your precious 10 minutes if you're sitting in 3 different queues in Stormwind.
---
I get that you don't have time, but instead of using that as an excuse to take the easier route while vocally complaining about it on Reddit, shut up and don't play. "I'm not 14 anymore, I don't have time for..." Is the reason the devs have incorporated every single change that has made the game leaps and bounds worse then it once was. The I don't have time crowd gets catered to and everyone that does have time, or is willing to make time gets fucked over hard.
---
I was also pretty let down by Nagrand. It's nice I guess but not that exciting after the previous three zones.
---
Is the the white lion from the crossroads quest chain? Why are you chasing him? You just blow a horn at the bones he hangs out in and he just shows up
---
All of your examples are part of what made vanilla great though.
---
Thank you for your reply mate! I’ve been refreshing my inbox in anticipation and excitement, lol.
---
I appreciate your way of saying the way it is, despite me saying I prefer horde. What class will you be playing, and why?
---
People who complain/worry/fight over levelling loot (especially at lvl 20/30) are a special kind. It all gets replaced in a few hours of time and makes very little difference to your character.
---
Many of the active people here still play the game through private servers and so you're literally preaching to the choir. 
---
It did not feel so great when you had been LFG Scarlet Monastery for 1 hr and finally getting a group and the tank decides to ditch when everyone had made the walk from hillsbrad to SM. Thereby wasting 2 hours of gametime... 
---
There is not a PvE server that provides any kind of population experience, and will not be until Blizzard releases classic WoW. Possibly after they screw it up, there may be enough demand for it.
---
Until then, PvP servers with tiny populations, or not playing at all. Those are your choices.
---
A lot of what you yourself complain about are what people who are looking forward to Classic genuinely like though, stuff like manually finding group members promotes social interaction, or at least common decency as if you're rude and someone leaves, you're a bit stuck unlike retail where you can replace them straight away.
---
Nope rogues work warlocks all the way through the game. If you are a warlock and you see a rogue, fear coil and then run the other way. 
---
Hunters don’t “scale badly”. Fury warriors and fire mages snowball ridiculously and rogues are always consistent and really take off in naxx when they replace most slots. Warlocks (if horde) also take off when grace totem drops In aq patch and when TPS on warriors peaks in the final tier of raiding.
---
Hunters are effective DPS at all tiers and are mandatory through every raising tier, especially in the first three. 
---
Hunters are effective in 5 mans due to universal CC options, aggro Reset, pulling, kiting and effective ranged dps. There is also a myriad of utility they bring, such as NR aura which helps considerably in places like stratholme and scholo where many of the debuffs are for nature damage.
---
Hunters are superior farmers and have many options including generic farming such as grinding and gathering, as well as maraudon and DMN farming.
---
There is no huntard stigma if you turn up with thorium bullets, buff food and pots, enchants and correct spec and learn your weave. 
---
Hunters are excellent levellers and world pvpers. Very secure too. In places such as STV I place a freezing trap at my feet before engaging every mob. The amount of ganking rogues and warriors I’ve killed because of this is uncountable.
---
I got ganked a million times, but only camped a small handful of times. It wasn't a burden worth worrying about at all. 
---
Man, stfu
---
Jump on main with level 30 axe??? They are scared now! 
---
&gt; Many instances could take 2-4 hours to complete due to you having to manually find group members and also find a way to get to the instance.
---
this is just not true. on an active server groups are constantly being created and filled. join a guild and make friends with people to avoid having to pug everything. 
---
&gt; The long time it took to level and sometimes being forced to rely only on grinding mobs.
---
quests are just blizzards trick to get you to grind.
---
&gt; How hard it was to get into a raiding guild and the extreme comittment it took. You had to be available for 2-3 times a week for about 5 hours each time.
---
there are different types of guilds that have different levels of goals. find what works for you.
---
&gt; Of course, most of my issues with classic was how extremely time consuming it was. 
---
god forbid you spend time on something, become attached to it, reap the rewards from investing your time into it
---
&gt; There was also various Class imbalances such as mage-warrior etc.
---
if everyone is the same than there is no point to play one class over the other. it just becomes bland (see BFA). the asymmetrical system is what creates nuance and flavor. allows for different classes to be great at different things.
---
&gt; Is it just me or is a lot of post in this sub sugar coated and romanticising about classic?
---
no, but maybe classic just isn't for you?
---
At first thought, sure, but upon more reflection I have to say no.  Out of all the proposed changes I've seen so far, this is the least objectionable, but the slippery slope always starts with something unobjectionable.
---
Just kidding, I'll be there :-)
---
Many Hunter upgrades are considered minor, that's just the way the itemisation works. They go from a 1% crit 2ap melee weapon upgrade in ZG, to 2ap upgrade in AQ40, to 6ap upgrade in Naxx. Comparatively, an 8ap 2% hit trinket upgrade doesn't seem as bad.
---
100.
---
the hype is just from all these wrath babbys
---
Hard to get as an alliance. Need to find a kind horde.
---
Nothing like hearing the sound of a Cheapshot going off as you gank some poor unsuspecting nub in STV.
---
That's just untrue, a soul link warlock is extremely difficult to kill for a melee class and as gear increases the warlock gains more from it than a rogue does.
---
Thats the problem, you view your gametime as a window to accomplish goals. A lot of what people like about classic is a slower pace where the game IS the fun.
---
Well thats what i get for being civil with man children on the internet.
---
In my experience Druid is a faster leveler and both have a similar amount of utility. Healing raids as a shaman is lovey. As a Druid I hated it but a few people like it and even fewer are good at it. Resto Druid is more valuable on horde side FYI. 
---
I do enjoy Druid pvp more though and Druid tanking is sexy
---
No, but that tank gets blackballed real quick.  So...meh?
---
I want PvP to be on *fair* terms. WoW does not enforce *fair* terms; quite the opposite. All they ever needed to do (and I made this argument in 2005 too) was make people more than five levels lower than you, blue to you. Make the blue/red flag subjective, not objective. Simple as that. In theory a person could intentionally attack someone +6 to them; this would temporarily flag them, and achieve nothing worthwhile.
---
If u can’t handle the heat get out of the kitchen 
---
Insanely. Without legs weighing you down the power to weight ratio of your upper body muscles is enormous. 
---
Yes. It's part of the game. It's how it's intended to go. Your feelings are irrelevant to the game.
---
Running lowbies through ragefire chasm. Tell them there is an important item they need to loot in the lava, watch them die, then bail. I wont be able to do this cause I'm going ally this time around, but I'll say it's cause I'm such a nice person that I wouldn't do it anyway. :)
---
I leveled my first hunter (a night elf female, naturally) into her 30s and was doing some group quest or another in STV when the lead said, "Alright, I'm gonna' pull X, mage sheep Y, hunter freeze Z."
---
"How do I freeze him?"
---
"Freeze trap."
---
"Oh, I don't have that. I couldn't afford it at the time, but I've 
---
never needed it while leveling, and besides, I'm saving for a mount at 40."
---
In hindsight, I can almost feel the facepalm dude must have done.
---
To his credit, not only did he not lose his temper, he actually took the time to explain to ignorant little huntard me how traps worked and why I should have them. Even lent me some gold to help with training up my skills. I came away a much better hunter for the experience.
---
Assassin's Blade is pretty well up there, though.
---
Going to have to IV this 
---
That sort of thing sucked but honestly it was part of what made it feel like a real world to me. I'd remember who that son of a bitch was forever. If someone did that in retail I'd just click lfg like a lab rat and teleport someplace else. That doesn't really inspire a sense of adventure or community.
---
Even a ruleset that just flagged you when you hit 60, would be acceptable.
---
I said I was wrong in a previous reply. Sorry. It used to be that way but they changed it in a later patch. 
---
While that is true, what's the point in slowing yourself down to run a dungeon if you don't get any loot out of it?
---
My signature move was to Divine Intervention a rogue at the start of a boss pull.

I sometimes went to Durotar on the my dwarf hunter and tamed one of the low level boars there. I'd then hide somewhere, Eyes of the Beast, and pace my boar around the starting zone. It didn't happen often, but I would occasionally catch some newbie unawares, he would attack my pet thinking it was just another quest npc and I would hop out of my hidey hole and give him a shiny new feathered headdress. 
---
Sure, then you realize that the 2% hit is completely useless because you already get 2% from ZG enchants, 3% from scope, 2% from T2 pieces and 2% from neck/ring already. That's 9% without DFT or Accuria, both of which are useless to hunters.
---
You shouldn't even be using DFT as a hunter, especially once you get to AQ40 and you're trinket swapping between active trinkets. Menwhile melees/tanks are actually going to be using DFT for practically forever.
---
&gt; Comparatively, an 8ap 2% hit trinket upgrade doesn't seem as bad.
---
Not when you're screwing over everyone else for 8 AP.
---
Find a few decent enchants you can perform with their materials for tips. Or a craft-able item in demand (probably bags or flask). 
---
Set up a macro to press every ten minutes or so and just check for whispers when you come back. 
---
I won’t be playing but I’ve been playing p servers for 2 years. I would roll another raiding priest and eventually spec Power Infusion - dwarf or undead. Second choice would be troll shaman for resto. 
---
Priest healing kit is insanely good.
---
I don’t pvp much anymore. 
---
Damn I wish there could be a place for photo of the day when classic comes. Like in wowhead classic for example
---
Because they get to initate PvP combat at a time and under conditions of their choosing. If they don't like the odds, they just stealth away. This creates a situation where the rogues think "my success rate is excellent, I must be really good at this, my victims are just salty" when they truth is, the rogue gets to choose his engagements and the victim doesn't, so of course his odds of victory are going to run 99%.
---
I get what you are saying but your feelings are irrelevant. It's a PvP server, it's meant to be that way. It causes open world pvp to happen. If you are the type that gets personally offended and rage at a video game, then maybe you should take a break and reorganize your thoughts. Maybe take up knitting or something. I don't know. All of this could be solved by just rolling on a PVE server. But instead we are sitting here arguing whether or not your feelings are more important than the game. You don't like it so they are scumbags for playing the game within the rules and not cheating whatsoever.
---
We just replied "pvp happens". Scrubs gonna scrub though
---
He didn't say they looked the same. The name however is very similar and it *is* a crater. 
---
2019 version: ”You’ve yoted your last yeet”
---
1. I played an active server and no, it was not that easy to quickly replace a tank or healer as u make out.
---
2. Sometimes there was not enough quests.
---
3. True. Good point. You dont have to be a hardcore raider and my guess is that it takes just the same time in bfa as in classic 
---
4. Yes but sometimes the investment of time did not yield anything back what so ever.
---
5. Good point
---
When you make a character it can be frustrating until about level 25 or 30 because that’s when you’ve gotten most of your abilities. I recommend trying a few out and seeing what you like. 
---
Yeah, I guess I can see both sides of the argument here. There's a "local" context of what the warrior actually said, and a "global" context of the impact of discussing loot drops pre-60. If you look at the original argument, he switches focus in the second paragraph and defines his subject as the impact of perspective or lack thereof on reputation and the associated impact on desirability at max level.
---
After finding that out, I have a feeling that the team had a hard cap of 24 months to get this project done and out, which is why we're getting a Summer release.  Unless they're running multiple betas, it seems too early for a Beta, unless they're dropping Classic in the beginning of the summer. 
---
Idc how people want to play. The issue topic is that PvP servers offer more than a PvE server can offer, thus PvP servers have the "full" experience. You literally can't get that experience on a PvE server, but you can get the "PvE" experience on a PvP server. It doesn't work the other way around.
---
It was more about having an item, on a class that no one else has it. My first guild master was a hunter and was the first guy on the server with TF, just to quit after ~6-7 months.
---
Its funny how the prospect of leveling a single character to 60 in vanilla is daunting to most players, yet you want to level two in parallel haha.
---
Well, I'm sure we'll all miss you.
---
Okay let me explain this easily:  
---
Its a part of the game : yes and we both agree ond that  
---
People will do it: yes and we both agree on that.  
---
Its not a waste of time as it is quite fun: yes and we both agree on that.  
---
No1 feelings about the game will change the fact that people will still do that: yes we agree on that.  
---
The ACT in itself is getting pleasure from others people suffering, by DEFINITION making it a scummy thing to do: We disagree.  
---
But go ahead if you think you are not a scumbag for doing that go ahead and delusion yourself instead of admitting that its a scummy thing to do but still do it as all humans are with flaws and have our own guilty pleasures
---
I feel like this is the same as ”no matter what faction you choose, your faction always loses on battlegrounds”. I’ve played on both sides as well, and always felt the opposing faction was more aggressive and more determined to defend against the other side.
---
Was this during pvt servers or vanilla
---
Nonsense Poopy Pants!!
---
im fine with people doing it as it is a part of the game and they can do whatever the fk they want if they are having fun, the only part im against is saying that it is not a scummy move to do.  
---
But most of these peoples egos are to big to admit that they have flaws and get guilty pleasure from it x)  
---
well my recent experiences are  from pservers, but I remember talking with my friend about the same matter years ago, and having the same opinion back then aswell.
---
You’re getting downvoted but I actually agree with you. People take this shit way too serious 
---
PvE servers are for sub par players who cant make it on a PvP server.
---
Maybe not, but it’s fun. And who are you to tell other people what’s fun and what isn’t? 
---
I actually liked them better smaller. Hard to believe I know. Thing is, I had the blue pvp shoulders and the glowy orange spikiness was just [WAY too big](https://www.wowhead.com/item=28839/high-warlords-leather-spaulders#modelviewer:2+0) to feel sneaky on an orcish rogue.         
---
          
---
When they were small they felt more appropriate.
---
The people in that story were +/- 5 levels apart. It wasn't "some asshole 60 came in and facemelted all 7 of us and Sin-Dali at once".
---
“Undocumented server” 
---
Have to setup those add-ons
---
Sounds more like you don't understand basic concepts such as opportunity cost and game theory then cause I'm one of the nicest, fairest people you could probably ever hope to meet in this game. 
---
It's really hard to say. From just this one interview we confirm that it has quite a bit of internal testing already ongoing which would cover most of the non-stress related stuff. But they may still do small 1-2 day tests on very specific zones or areas. Or they could do a capped testing phase just to build hype. It's all speculation but what im more interested in is the realisticness of it releasing even sooner than some of our precious predictions
---
I do not equate ganking to world PvP at all though is my point. PvP implies they each player has, at least somewhat, an equal chance at survival. Throw in gear and etc and it becomes complicated. PvP is not destroying someone who is lvl 30 when you are 60 so I’d question the notion that it’s meant to be this way. 
---
All in all, I’ve always played a PvP server and always will because I do enjoy true world PvP. Ganking just seems pointless to me, it’s not a challenge in any way and I don’t see why anyone would get joy from it, but to each their own. 
---
So again, whether it’s how the game was meant to be, you see it as PvP, or any number of other things, my opinion will always be that people who gank others are just dicks. 
---
That'd be hours for me on a first char :p no time at all if there's already a ptr to copy from though. 
---
Its an Easter egg
---
&gt;take 2-4 hours
---
It depends on many factors (like you will definetely have a harder time as hunter than tank), but you know what you're going for, are you? Although I kind of agree that 4h is a bit too much.
---
&gt;forced to rely only on grinding mobs
---
It used to be an issue in early patches, but we're getting 1.12 and there is always more than enough quests you can do.
---
&gt;raiding time
---
It heavily depends on the quality of the guild and players. In a good and organized guild where players have an idea of what they are doing it takes ~4 hours to clear MC + BWL + Ony in a single evening.
---
the current group of vanilla wow players are often engaging in very large wpvp battles over one thing....RAID BUFFS
---
players from the opposing faction will often form raid groups to ambush guilds who are traveling to their 40 man raid fully world buffed.  this really spices up things on a server!
---
but the biggest fights you will see are over world bosses.  you will often see the two factions form multiple raid groups and battle for hours over the right to kill a world boss.
---
&gt; I'm one of the nicest, fairest people you could probably ever hope to meet in this game.
---
Calling BS on this one, man.  If an item drops that would be a massive upgrade for someone, and you need-roll it out from under them just to make some gold, you're a jerk.  Justify that away however you want, doesn't make you any less of a jerk.
---
When their "fun" affects me.
---
This was a screenshot that I made with a couple of random guys on the server, on top of the bank in Orgrimmar, probably all waiting for something to do. I remember that we didn't even know each other, but it just sorta happened that we all started dancing in our Druid forms and then we all thought about making a picture for "Screenshot of the day" and this was the result. Sadly it never got chosen :(
---
This time around, picking a class went pretty fast. When I played vanilla way back when, I rolled a human warrior. I find that tanking, charging in and slashing away is a super fun way of playing. Especially in a group environment when you have people to back you up! So I think that this time around I wanted to play more of a support role and help the group out a bit more. I also figured I should switch things up from my typical playstyle of big weapons heavy armor. Playing someone squishy sounded interesting.
---
The other classes I have thought about was playing a mage for there ease of travel and high dps, but since I want to raid more than I want to pvp, the end game seemed way to simple in terms of spell rotation. I also was thinking about playing a shaman for the group utility mindset but priest just seemed more fun. I'll probably make a shaman alt though!
---
Since I've rolled alliance so many times I thought it would be fun to switch to the horde but race was a bit trickier. Playing a priest means that not only are you comparing racial abilities, your also comparing priest racial spells. In vanilla priests had the unique trait of gaining two spells specific to the race you play.  Undead get Touch of weakness and devouring plague while Trolls get Hex of weakness and shadowguard. This one is tricky because if you add these to the other racial abilities, Undead are objectively better. Devouring plague is a fantastic DoT and they also get will of the forsaken which is the best pvp racial ability. But in the end i'm thinking Troll simply for lore and aesthetics. Undead are not the most appealing of characters and I really don't want there to be random bones and flesh hanging out of my armor. Their starting area is also really boring to me haha. So maybe i'm not min/maxing to the fullest but I'll have a better looking character in my eyes!
---
ganking isnt against the rules
---
I've played extensively in BC/WOTL on both pve and pvp servers. Here's my admittedly anecdotal experience.
---
pve - you had to look harder to find pvp, but when you found it there was a lot of fighting. Imagine that, when people consciously flag for pvp then they are looking for it. ganking was non-existent.
---
pvp - solo-wise, ganking was both common and boring. All of the group pvp I engaged in was infuriately timid. Players were obsessed about "winning" encounters rather than just wrecking shit and so would spend an inordinate amount of time trying to amass more players than the other side before attacking.
---
BGs on both server types were remarkably similar. Didn't even feel like pvp, just organized honor-farming instances.
---
you are acting tough in a server full of care bears who cant pvp
---
Oh well. Sometimes it isn't fair. You know what the solution is? **Roll on a PvE server and choose when you engage in world PvP.** Like what are we even talking about here guys? There's literally an entire server type dedicated to solving this problem you have, but you're still bitching about it. Go play there if it bothers you.
---
Hell yeah I ganked people in Vanilla, and I will in classic. Guess what? I got ganked the shit out of too. I didn't whine about it because that's what I signed up for.
---
&gt; But that doesn’t matter to you, you are almost at your end point.
---
Level 43 is like in the middle, xp wise.
---
I am one of those "STV is my favorite zone to level in..." folks, of *course* I  am picking a PvP server.  Hell I wouldn't even come back if it was only PvE (or the asinine "warmode").
---
John immediately need on the item, he wins the roll, you are too embarrassed to ask for it.
---
John proceeds to disenchant your dream into dream dust. 
---
John: hey want +3 stamina to your wrist
---
You: sure, shows white leather wrist
---
John: You can tip :) (1g-3g)
---
You pay 2g out of confusion and look at your white enhcnated wrist armor.
---
John is a true player, better learn it.
---
Honestly warrior rings the most bells.  Low button press with smaller amount of consumables. Don't have to keep track of too much and in pvp you will be doing the blowing up.  
---
Of course nothings wrong with that. Lots of people I feel will be interested in doing so. Play the game the way that make you happy!
---
I will throw out the argument that a well organized group of nightelves could use shadow meld to their advantage in a big way. Having an entire team essentially stealthed has to provide an advantage if well coordinated. 
---
One thing that frustrates me about the discussions here is people calling Vanilla WoW a "sandbox", as opposed to retail being a "theme park". 
---
WoW was always a themepark MMO, as was its predecessors. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be so many people asking what will happen after Naxx. There *are* ways in which players in classic WoW can "make their own fun", but they are incredibly limited and shallow compared to real sandbox games. 
---
This is an official Classic WoW discussion forum. It's literally rule number 1 on the side bar.
---
No one cares if you're forced into a PvP realm on private servers. When WoW Classic comes you won't be.
---
Yea that’s basically where I’m at, it is what it is and do what you want, but it is totally a dick move. 
---
You can easily do this by always disconnecting in an inn with the character you are not gonna play. 
---
Playing 10 days 1 character then switch to a fully rested one etc... you can adapt this to mutilple characters.
---
Only casual players may find this impossible
---
Mind Controlling as Priest will always be a highlight.
---
Rule 1 on the side bar. This is a discussion about WoW: Classic. I don't care about your private server woes.
---
So a level 38 shouldn't be allowed to roll on a level 39 piece of gear by your logic. Or a priest shouldn't be allowed to roll a healing mace because they didn't go buy thier mace skill yet. Natural character progress is not equal to profession choices. My server no one rolled need on profession stuff unless the group okayed it. That was etiquette. However if you are going to be able to use a piece of gear you have all right to roll on it even if you can't use it right now. Because you will be able to use, heck you may be able to use it before the end of the dungeon. A level 39 item drops but I'm only level 38 so your rules state I must pass because you are level 39 and want it. However 1/3 of the instance later I'm now level 39 and I lost out on a piece of loot that I could have really used.
---
Hm....I think in order to be among the "best" wpvp classes, a high degree of escape and mobility are required. So while for example Soul Link locks and Shadow Priests are insanely strong 1v1 classes, in the more hectic world of wpvp their lack of mobility brings them down a few notches. Rogues certainly qualify with sprint, vanish, and stealth in general. In addition, here's a few others worth considering:
---
Druid - Kings of mobility with travel form and shape shifting to break snares. Stealth as well to avoid really bad matchups or setup good fights. Lack of burst can sometimes make it hard to finish off fights before the opponent can call for reinforcements, but worst case you can escape.
---
Hunter - High speed with AoC, strong pvp builds, high skill cap with opportunity for fun moves like setting up traps. Good if you're leveling up two chars in parallel since they're fast levelers.
---
Shaman - Imp Ghost Wolf is one of the best wpvp tools there is, you get massive mobility. This speed combined with frost shock to slow them down gives you the ability to close in or to run away. Pretty weak in group fights due to lack of CC though, but good at picking off solo players and gets very strong in group pvp.
---
Mage - Lacks conventional mobility, but blink + frost nova can somewhat substitute. However their CC and variety of AoE skills make them the best 1vMany class in the game, so certainly worth consideration.
---
Classes that don't make the cut: Warrior, Paladin, and Priest, all 100% due to their lack of mobility and/or CC.
---
We could do it here on reddit?
---
I've pvp'd on both types of servers. If you think players who roll on pvp servers are better at pvp, then you are sadly mistaken.
---
Some of the crappiest pvp'ers I've ever seen rolled rogue on pvp servers. In fact, the rogue class is basically a magnet for crappy players.
---
The beauty of a game as free as WoW is that it can be whatever you want it to be.  I wrote a thread a few days ago about how I'm more excited about farming than anything else!  More than any game except perhaps Minecraft, WoW is whatever you make of it.
---
Whoosh
---
no one mentioned AV... strange...
---
Some of your negatives I consider positives.
---
The fact that you have to work to find partners for a dungeon run causes you to spend more time chatting and getting involved in the world.
---
It makes it so that when you find a really good player, you want to keep playing with them and so add them to your friends list and look them up.
---
I've had many good friendships start with finding a good player to regularly run with.
---
When i remember at the demo make it so strange. 
---
They may have worked 1 year on trying to run with the old client like they said... Nearly 3 years to adapt (and not create) a game is too much.
---
Shaman is a little slower then druid leveling but not too much.  They are vastly superior raid heals and do very well in pvp.  You can run hybrid 30/0/21 and do great burst without losing much of your healing and have more pvp utility.
---
My friend made a video of this with an ape from STV in hillsbrad foothills. 
---
Are you serious? I haven’t played in pservers but in vanilla the crossroads became infamous for always being under attack by the alliance. The “alliance aren’t like that” is definitely anecdotal because I’ve seen it plenty 
---
I don't even agree that you can get the same experience on a PvP server as a PvE server but more. The experiences are fundamentally different. The lack of PvP actually drastically changes the leveling experience in a way you can't get on a PvP server. It's just a *different* experience.
---
Also, you said:
---
&gt;I swear, if you people would actually play on a PvP server, you would enjoy the game even more-so than you did on your PvE server.
---
This is where especially lose people. You can't tell other people how they enjoy the game.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Mind control is a good one and one of the reasons why I’m going priest this time. They patched this later on, but at one point you could mind control the opposite faction and write messages to them via /e custom emote. 
---
 I remember getting quite a nasty message from an orc warrior on his way to r14 in wsg after I repeatedly hamstring him. 
---
The beauty of a game like WoW is that it is whatever you make of it.  If you want to raid, you can raid.  If you want to PvP, you can PvP.  If you just want to level alts, you can do that, too.  I even wrote a thread a while back about how [I'm more excited about farming than anything else](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/auc551/does_anyone_else_just_love_farming_as_much_as_i_do/), and that applies, too!
---
To that end, offering PvE and PvP servers separately simply allows for more players to more efficiently focus on the game as it applies to them.  And you don't have to interact with *all* the parts of a game to say you got the "true" experience.
---
World PvP? Not a rogue? Soul Link Warlock.
---
It just doesn’t die:
---
You have 15% increased stamina, an improved healthstone (non-potion heal), an improved voidwalker sacrifice shield, the tools to near instantly summon another to sacrifice again, drain life, the ability to use a health potion on top of all that (because you’ll never need them while leveling so you’ll likely have some on hand), 30% pure damage reduction while soul linked, 10% more physical reduction from master demonologist with your voidwalker, an offhand spellstone that creates another absorb shield against casters, and you can even bandage during a fear if you are not fighting a dot class.
---
If they somehow manage to burn through all of that before your multitude of dots and fears whittle them down, get up again with soulstone and finish the job.
---
Pretty much this with shaman.  Warstomp is a lot more reliable then orc stun resist because you can force a trinket or get a free heal/chain lightning. Zerking is clutch and stun resist can be very good too.
---
That makes sense I suppose, a hell of alot of hours of leveling though!
---
This is fact
---
Also there is a lake.

Back again with another druid question. I have no problem doing everything I need to do to min/max. Engineering seems to be a lock,even though I'm pretty sure I can't use anything while in bear form,but I plan to primarily be resto,so that added damage from sapper should be useful.  
---
What should my other be though. Alchemy seems good. Druids seem to use more consumables,especially if I want to tank. But I'm worried about being able to afford raiding with dual crafting.
---
I absolutely will be playing on a PvE server, once these exist for Classic, ie when Blizzard creates them.
---
^This
---
No argument here.  PvE servers is WoW with training wheels on.
---
&gt; If your time is so scarce and valuable, why don't you go and play retail.
---
Because it's a completely different game, and obviously one I don't want to play or I wouldn't be on this sub. Don't tell me to go play a different game because I don't enjoy what you do, that's textbook /r/gatekeeping
---
You keep putting an incredible amount of words in my mouth about not wanting to contribute to a guild when you could not possibly be more wrong. Because I have limited time I *want* to spend my time doing meaningful guild content instead of walking my corpse around STV for months. I'm not asking for the game to be easier, I'm not asking to be catered to, all I'm asking for honestly is for people like you to get the fuck off your high horse and stop pretending your way of playing the game is any more legitimate than mine.
---
&gt;but I'm only level 38 so your rules state I must pass. 
---
It's not about passing on loot, it's about asking about it before needing because people have different perspectives on loot. Hence this thread.
---
He said it started out as a passion project, so it's not terribly hard to imagine it growing slowly over time and becoming a "thing".

intense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth, power, or food.

Needing an item that you can’t use for any reason other than selling is greed, and if you do that you will get blacklisted as a ninja in my book. It doesn’t matter what it could buy you because everyone has upgrades that they can buy eventually.

If you can’t use the gear, never need it. If you need for your offspec, clear it with the group beforehand.
---
Haha. Wow. Ok. Ganking people causes them to call in reinforcements. Then you have world PvP. I thought everyone knew that. I can't wait to gank the hell out of people that whine. Those steps the ones who send you have PM's. Yes it's fun. And it's funny.

One I just remembered. 
---
Probably the first time trolling on my first character and looking back a bit tasteless, so sensitive redditors stop reading now. 
---
A friend had the engineering skill and my gnome mage had acquired a green cloth hat that resembled a common head dress worn in Indian culture. 
---
There was a long queue on wsg and as we waited outside the entrance as alliance, a plan was formed. 
---
Strong engineering bombs with an aoe effect were handed out and parties were formed with cloth headpieces similar to mine were bought out from the AH. 
---
About an hour later the horde entrance to WSG was full of skeletons from both sides. 
---
Hahaha. Just putting it out there. The game will fail if they mess with the PvP mechanic from back then.
---
Horde and Alliance fought their wars on battlegrounds. Ganking parties don't exist in the the lore of Warcraft. That's a player invention. 
---
Lmao imagine calling a game which did not even have PvP system at release (it took them half a year) a "PvP-oriented game".
---
Yep.  It's a very, *very* simple system.  But like I said in my OP, it's funny the lengths people will go to in order to justify changing that up when it's a BoE epic.
---
If someone is the correct level for gear and it's an upgrade and you're below level and it's an upgrade you should pass for them.  If you're both below level to use it but it will be an upgrade you should both roll on it.
---
I can totally understand why the tank would be surprised and also why the shamans would be considerate.  This is overall an example of everyone being empathetic and thinking of others.  "I wouldn't want someone who can't even use the gear yet to win that under me, I should pass that would be shitty" and "These guys passed on an obvious upgrade, they should have a fair roll at this as well".
---
Those times are perfect but unfortunately Friday and Saturday and the only days my wife and I have to go out each week :/

That's not even close to what the No True Scotsman fallacy means.

lol if you think thats the case i have nothing to say

That's on me. I should of known there was a lake. Still a long shot that Blizzard would base Un'Goro on this random place. Just my personal opinion.
---
Lightningsblade EU FTW
---
Personally, I think being unable to play the game because you're getting corpse camped by max level enemy player while you're level 20- or 30-something has little to do with PvP.
---
When I rolled PvP back in the day, naive as I was I expected epic world battles with an actual back and forth. Reality hit me in the face quite hard when I realized world PvP on PvP servers mostly means lowbie camping. To me that form of "PvP" is nothing but lost time. You're basically forced to do something else other than playing WoW (with that specific character at least). Truly sucked when you've finally got the free time to spare for WoW... planned on getting a few quests done, maybe even a few levels? Nope. 
---
Also in my opinion it has nothing to do with immersion or "a sense of danger". On the contrary, I think lowby ganking breaks immersion. You know the cause of your misery has nothing to do with the game world or lore, you know it's just someone behind his screen deciding you won't be able to play tonight. 
---
But to each their own. 
---
U could sell the white ones for 19 twinks for a insane amount of gold 
---
If only they could put the servers into several pieces almost like shards
---
Eh, I'd still take the WC quest staff, A little less spirit but 7 int and 2 more stamina.  They have the same dps.
---
"People who kill me in my video games are scumbags."
---
A BoE epic is equivalent to a bag of gold dropping. The fact that one person doesn't need to exchange the bag of gold to get the item he desires is kind of a trivial technicality.
---
I mean, personally I haven't ever rolled need on a BoE epic, because I never really cared enough about gold, but I can't help but admit that BoE epics are no different than bags of gold dropping. Isn't it strange to give one guy priority, because he happens to be able to directly equip that bag of gold?
---
It should be noted also, that this need on BoE behaviour is mostly borne from the fact that there are people that will hold on to BoE items and equip them to pretend to equip their recently acquired BoE. People do some dodgy shit.
---
How does any of that make someone a scumbag for killing someone else in a video game?
---
Then pvp servers aren’t for you 
---
Wow that was a HARD transition from reasonable person to elitist asshole. /u/Adlai-Stevenson was making reasonable conversation, can we *please* stop supporting the stereotype that classic wow players are toxic people that call everyone scrubs, god damn it's so childish
---
You are describing what makes wow feeling rewarding to me. As a hunter, I put in work to put together groups myself. I don’t wait to get invited, I invite. 
---
That means LFM SM Arm/Cath. PST. Not LFG SM. 
---
That means /who 34-40 and sending whispers to tanks and healers personally for invites. 
---
That means adding Tanks and Healers to my friends list after a successful run. 
---
That means playing my class well and being remembered as a good player in pugs. 
---
All of this is hard, but like others have said, it makes vanilla great. That sense of accomplishment. That community. That levelling process. That sense of dread questing in STV on PvP server. 
---
That’s my take!
---
This is fine if it's purely for the first few zones (1-20, maybe 1-30) for the first week or so. Just to help stabilize populations. But it would be detrimental to the feel overall if it went beyond that.
---
They shook
---
To be there, there is a lot of wpvp going on between higher levels in epl 
---
People who go out of their way killing and camping low lvls who have no chance of escaping only to make them waste both of their time gaining nothìng from it (exept joy from others people suffering) are not scumbags
---
FTFY
---
I would happily let a dwarf tame it after blowing the horn. Night Elves are getting a kick in the pants, tho. 
---
You are talking about passing loot. You are saying that because you are able to use it now you should be able to demand what ever rules that suit you. It isn't fair to say just because I'm too low level to use this right now you should be able to dictate if I even allowed to roll on it or not even though I'm helping do this dungeon. Because if both of us want the item you are automatically going to say no to me asking for a roll because you want the item. By making that the etiquette you are telling people to not bother if are not high enough level for the loot.
---
Because at the end of the day if you would have brought a character who is the appropriate level you would be rolling against them but you didn't because you took what you could find.
---
Isnt there peace at the start of wow? Sure its not easy and there are warmongering elements but leaders on both sides do try to make the peace work.
---
When it comes to those "epic" world pvp moments I never experienced it like that. For me its just someone who is too bored oneshotting lowbies or someone trying to start that "epic" pvp. What I think PvP servers have going for them is the constant danger in the world.
---
And you can always toggle pvp on if you feel like it.
---
Fair enough. I don't remember the specific specs people needed so I'll defer on that. In relation to this specific post I think it still works in that any class will be expected to heal and can be good at it, but you don't necessarily have to be 31 points in your healing tree.
---
Honestly reading your pay I'm remembering how weird some talents were where the benefit of going crazy in your main speed want always there and that was always mind of silly, but fun. 
---
Human have Paladins, warriors, priests, and Mages. End of debate lol.
---
Every subreddit "glorifies" their thing.
---
I mean.. technically it is Classic music...
---
How? It's BOP in vanilla
---
Back when gaining levels mattered.  I can't wait to celebrate gaining a level again.. I absolutely loathe level scaling.
---
Gotta be honest, I mostly play PvE, but I couldn’t care less if I’m ganked by someone 50 levels higher or at the same level. It’s still getting ganked, which means wasting my time.
---
I actually have fun memories of when higher level people would come to lower level zones and then a faction wpvp would break out. I could leave the zone or stay and waste more time, but it was part of the game. It’s a living world. The idea that the opposing faction should be nice destroys the idea of pvp imo.
---
Pets that aren’t happy do 25% less damage by just going from green to yellow. My eyes are trained to see that the moment it happens. It’s never been close to happening for me. 
---
1st 3 hours: average player will get 10 
---
2nd 3 hour: expect lvl 14-15
---
3rd: at this point level take 30-45 min
---
Past 18 its around 1hour per level if you dont aoe grind.
---
Past 24 I usually take 1,5 hour per level.
---
At this point you really get going on a mage. You can kill a lit of different mobs in groups of 3-6 with just basic eagle gear/quest items.
---
You should be able to ding every 1.5 hour till 30 and 30-39 its 2-3h per level if you’re dedicated to speed.
---
40-45 under 3,5h im happy. 
---
2h can be done if you got a crazy spot to yourself like swamp of sorrow murlocs.
---
Past 50 there’s some sweet quest spots like un goro where you can level like a beast, the cauldron quests in wpl past 55 etc.
---
Past 50 I usually take 3-4h per level .
---
45-50 it dependa jf they release searing gorge quests and hinterlands. 
---
Warrior - Rend
---
WoW officially died when rend as a standalone ability got removed.
---
T. Me, warrior since the vanilla beta
---
I dont mind aswell, and the wpvp that breaks out is fun, the only thing im saying is that it is not a nice thing to kill and camp some1 who has no chance against you and you gain nothing (ingame) from it.
---
I will still do it myself.
---
Cool!
---
+ every time one of your bears fails to kill someone. They will gain access to big sky magics. Eventually you would be over run.
---
No, the wotlk login. Complete with dragon.
---
Well camping is lame, but I think a high level terrorizing a low zone (not griefing one player) is kind of cool.
---
Exploring is a huge part of why I play. 
---
Why should it be bad, if you get joy from it, and doesn't hurt anyone? There's no losers, right?
---
Ok look, no one is arguing to take away PvE servers or arguing people shouldn't play on PvE servers. It's annoying that people can't understand that we are trying to get them to actually give PvP servers a shot and not to let one bad experience that they had or heard of (which is most likely extremely over-exaggerated) prevent them from doing so. What's annoying is the amount of stubbornness people in this thread are displaying, and complete lack of comprehension. The majority has misunderstood the topic in its entirety.
---
cool, fun, part of the game, but still scummy
---
everyone's already said the usual about how those are part of what made the game great, how it's not inherently worse just because it takes time to do things, ect, so i will just say, as far as i know, they added plenty of quests later on so if you are leveling in 1.12 (the classic patch) you shouldnt be forced to grind mobs only to level 60, the more hardcore guilds will take less time to down raids so join those, ect
---
But you in classic wow sub. Me thonk so.
---
The answer is human full stop. They have Paladins, Mages, Warriors, priests, warlocks and rogues. If you can only go one race. Human would be unstoppable.
---
The frustrating bits are part and parcel with what made it so great though. There's just no separating it. It's like complaining about a camping spot "I love how secluded and peaceful this place is but it's annoying how far away from everything it is."
---
The fact that things were time consuming is what solidified the community for me. Looking for additional party members and travelling to the dungeon gave you a chance to talk to your group. The fact that you put some effort into putting together a party gave everyone a reason to take some pride in their performance, since they knew they couldn't just be useless, afk, fall asleep, etc. and then just jump into another group and be back in the dungeon five seconds later.
---
Sure thing! If you go directly to their website (I think it’s like warcraftmoments.com?) you can also layer ambience (crackling fire, thunderstorms, nature sounds, tavern sounds) over it. 
---
Warrior leveling made me discover this. 
---
Running around sucks.  I will frequently charge/intercept just to move around that tiny bit quicker.  So here I am running through Stonetalon, charging a level 18 Ally warrior but just /hamstring and continuing to run.  Make him senor poopypants for a second then just amble away on those stupid slow cow legs.
---
The only difference between pve and pvp is that pvp has a bunch of edge lords who think its "hardcore" to kill players who are half their level because in real life they are complete losers with no discernible achievements. 
---
RP servers are where the real experience is, since the game is an mmoRPG.
---
The difference is that barrens is a horde territory, so while you can kill NPCs to annoy players, you can't kill the players themselves, so they can always leave to another area.
---
In RR you have lvl 19 twinks honor farming alliance players 24/7
---
You are correct. I agree with that statement. 
---
Seems like you’re forcing something semantical, but I suspect this convo has run its course...
---
Yes, indeed. Which is why I am so much looking forward to Blizzard's release.
---
It’s the most fundamental part of the game.  Horde vs Alliance 
---
Its also why I dont invite hunters when running SM :D
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Runeblade_of_Baron_Rivendare level 48 but there's an epic in stratholm
---
But if you invite all melee classes and like a shammy healer, then all cloth items go to you
---
Eh, old gods are breaking through, quit squabbling.
---
To each their own. I’ve never been in a situation where that happened actually. I’d get my main, kill them, and be fine about it. But I’ve never been in a situation where it sparked actual world PvP, and I played far too much vanilla wow. 
---
A scumbag causes others to experience major losses, for minor positive gain on his part. It's basic utilitarian theory.
---
Trolls are under rated for the pure fact that Tauren and orc aren't even a consideration. Not having priests means no dispel magic. Thats an auto loss in my book. Its down to UD or Troll for horde and Human is the clear winner for allie.
---
&gt;Yes but alot of that would persist if they logged off
---
Soul shards are not conjured items, they persist when logged out. If you have a soul bag and a properly set up drain soul macro, you should always have a full soul bag.
---
not really, let me put it like this:
---
what reason does a high lvl go into a low lvl zone and terrorize them?
---
One answer: to have fun.
---
Which is all fine but the fact of the matter is that the person is having fun from making other people waste time.
---
If waisting some1 else time (and yours) to do something you find fun without them not having a chance to go against its scummy.
---
Thats all.
---
I like this way of putting it 
---
So a group of 2 people doing easy bosses in DM E and DEing the drops is an "exploit" ?
---
Fake guild recruitment ads...&lt;Twilight for Life&gt; used to get trade chat humming in wotlk....&lt;Gender is a Myth&gt; is my current troll, its a  vegan only guild with strict recruitment criteria
---
This will not work.
---
You need to download a cpu temperature gauge and look at what happens to your temps with wow running. It actually bricked my old laptop using it for a long period.
---
Does me eating a hamburger then make me a scumbag, because the cow experiences a major loss, while I just gain a minor positive in the form of a tasty meal?
---
Pretty solid list. The only things I feel are amiss are:
---
Warrior: Stances
---
Paladin: Divine Shield
---
Around level 40 I consider 1 level a day to be good progress. Earlier levels it changes of course, 1-10 can easily be done in a single sitting, 10-20 might take 1-2 days.
---
I agree that consensual PvP isn’t similar to what you get on PvP servers. In my opinion it’s far superior. 
---
Randomly sapping alliance in goblin towns.
---
Repeatedly. 
---
My favorite character was a Gnome Lock named Tinyric. If Min/maxing PvP is your sole focus then, yeah you'll be at a disadvantage but I still had a blast doing PvP. Roll what you want to play.
---
Only problem with SL warlocks is that people can just run away from you. You have bad range on your spells and the burst just isn't there, you're not going to kill someone who doesn't want to fight you, assuming you're the same level. It's only good in duels or 1v1 where both of you are trying to kill eachother
---
As someone with blood pressure issues, and who hates pvp, why should I be forced to have blood pressure spikes when some level 60 rogue decides he wants to ruin my fun for the day?
---
Imagine if someone came to your house, knocked you out and stole your stuff, and said "Its how things used to be, deal with it, this is the full experience". 
---
honestly the main thing holding back on them is the lack of a non-combat rez for running dungeons and stuff. Not sure how much that should concern me though.
---
Well, I think you cannot generalize it because beauty and personal preferences lies in the eye of the beholder. For me as an example Grizzly Hills whole style and presentation is mindblowing. I just love those green foresty landscapes with wooden houses, flowing water and lakes imbedded harmoniously into the nature. The music also matches perfectly
---
I could imagine to live in such a place its wonderful.
---
I’d say playing on a pvp server would indicate that the person being ganked finds some fun in it — the entire experience. If they didn’t, why not play on a PvE server and pvp on BGs? It’s what I typically do.
---
I think it’s incredibly pathetic to play on a PvP server and complain about PvP. I think far less of that person than I do about the person tanking lowbies. 
---
Scummy is reserved for players camping one player extensively, griefing then. Getting one shot by a 60 in Redridge is not even remotely scummy — it’s playing on a PvP server lol.
---
Ok? The tools a rogue has is still more than enough to squash any warlock despite the stamina difference. 
---
Raging berserker helmet ain't no joke
---
Ok thanks for letting us know!
---
Oh true. Didn’t know RR was contested. I always assumed it was alliance territory 
---
100% this \^  you wont kill anyone who doesn't want to fight you as a SL warlock, and if 2 people come to kill you there is next to no way for you to escape, not to mention it will take you a long time to set urself up after death and that makes you vulnerable to corpse camping. Hunter, druids and rogues take the price
---
Were you trying to reply to the guy above? Not sure what you meant by that
---
&gt; A BoE epic is equivalent to a bag of gold dropping. The fact that one person doesn't need to exchange the bag of gold to get the item he desires is kind of a trivial technicality.
---
&gt; I mean, personally I haven't ever rolled need on a BoE epic, because I never really cared enough about gold, but I can't help but admit that BoE epics are no different than bags of gold dropping. Isn't it strange to give one guy priority, because he happens to be able to directly equip that bag of gold?
---
If that justification holds, then it's fair to say everyone can roll "Need" on everything then, since all the gear in the game can be exchanged for money.  So we may as well do away with the need/greed system altogether...
---
Except not, because that would be absurd.  Need/Greed exists as it does for a reason, and the rules of engagement don't suddenly change once gear crosses some arbitrary gold value threshold.
---
You can definitely be an alliance lock and still be really strong. I played horde and on my server there was a human lock I’d always see in AV and I was never able to kill them as a warrior. Racials do help but are not as crucial to success as some people might lead you to believe. At the end of the day play the race and faction that appeals to you the most and don’t worry about racials. 
---
Playing on a PvE server is Vanilla WoW Lite. It isn't the full experience.
---
People laser focus on the negative of being corpse camped and are completely ignorant of all the life and positive experience PvP brings to the game.
---
The first Rank14 on my server and leader of our Alliance premade group was a Warlock. 
---
Since everyone and their mom seems to roll Orc for pvp nowadays I guess it won't be a big deal.
---
alliance is favored in horde in every way in vanilla just due to paladins alone.  Anyone who tells you horde is better for pvp because of racials clearly never played vanilla recently.  
---
I'm glad we could agree in the end!
---
Alright, thank you - I might reconsider playing a hunter seriously, thanks again for your input ❤️
---
lol, chill out. why does it bother you this much that people want to play the game differently from you??
---
Is it that way on pvt servers?
---
The only rare occasion where a grey item is extremely valuable, people will pay any price for aesthetics!
---
Did the same thing with a plainstrider outside the Crossroads. Always fun. 
---
Pvp server has alot of other stuff only than high lvls ganking low lvls lol.  
---
Pvp while leveling with simmilar lvls in the zone.  
---
Having pvp in the open world as an option when hitting max lvl.  
---
Usually have more population and healthier population.  
---
I still dont understand how: I am a 60 rogue im gonna go to redridge and kill low lvls that i will get nothing from exept for joy of robbing their time is not scummy.   
---
I will still do it, its still a part of the game but doing it and saying its not a toxic or a scummy thing to do is wrong, by defenition lol.
---
&gt; major losses
---
You consider getting killed in a video game to be a major loss?  I think I'm starting to understand why you take this all so seriously...
---
&gt; minor positive gain on his part
---
Who are you to say how much fun he's having?  What if PvPing is the best part of his day and he loves it?  How could you possibly claim to know the amount of joy someone else gets out of an activity?
---
&gt; If you need that sort of thing explained to you, start with John Rawls
---
I looked around but I can't find anything by Rawls about the morality of killing people in video games or how people having fun in a way that you don't find fun somehow makes them scumbags, could you link me what you're talking about?
---
Tell that to Alchemists needing flask recipes despite only wanting them to make gold. It´not all black and white.
---
I'm so dumb I thought he meant loot trading.
---
I don’t need to watch the video now!  Thanks for saving me from that lol
---
There's also a rare in Winterspring with the same model with a very long respawn time that I think he is referring to
---
anyway, all I recall from the recent "histroy", is:
---
&gt; no changes people have won even more than they think
---
and that's what I like.
---
Something you need to consider in group pvp especially is fear ward. 
---
Would it be more frustrating to be unable to fear only undead players every 2mins, or be unable to fear the most important targets at all.
---
It is black and white and it’s not different. The better gear you have the better you are at gold farming from mobs. The better recipes you have the better you are at farming gold from potions. If you can’t use the recipe, you don’t get to need it. If you can use it and don’t have it, great, congratulations!
---
That’s how it works, plain and simple. If you need on other people’s gear you’re an asshole.
---
That's the basis of vegetarian/vegan philosophy. However vegetarian diets still require natural habitats to be taken over for farmland. There's no real way out of that particular dilemma.
---
But yes, broadly speaking you're on the right track.
---
Literally take 5 minutes sitting in Elwyn/Durotar to level up a new weapon to the point where you're comfortable questing with it.   I used Staff of Westfall (alliance) from the mid-teens until my WW axe.   Got some strange comments but fuck em, but got more from stacking "of the Whale" items.  
---
Oh it is so different
---
I never reached level cap in classic back in my days because I was very young and ignorant about reachkng end game. I got close (level 54). I must say, Hunter for me was the easiest class to master and was hella fun. On top of that, fastest leveling class in classic.
---
I'm going to roll warrior this time round though because it's supposed to be the most difficult class to level and takes a lot of grind to be good end game which is a good challenge imho
---
I'll be in this boat as well.  I'm going to try to spend as much time as possible just so I can at least pass STV before all the 60's emerge.  That tends to be the harshest zone for PvP while leveling.  If I can be hitting about 44 when the top levelers are hitting 60 I'll be happy.
---
Loo
---
if there was gear that vendors for 1000+ gold u would see everyone rolling need on it.  
---
Since you can roll on gear that you can´t use yet I conclude that you can roll on recipes that you can´t use yet. What now? 
---
Calm down, Satan.
---
I’m pretty convinced this is a thing:
---
Every time you complete a quest with a reward, the game takes note of what you picked. It keeps a tally of what all you’ve picked. Based off these picks there is some sort of algorithm that is used and you’re more likely to get gear that you haven’t picked as much. 
---
In this case, you had 4 cloth users and 1 mail. I’m not familiar with SFKs loot but I’m going to guess there isn’t that much cloth? I think I remember a belt but that’s it. So, you’re stacked so heavily that it almost seems like it phased out the option for what you all would have picked as quest rewards. This is obviously a theory, but in pretty convinced it’s a thing, so much so that when I made an alt I tried to take things I didn’t need from quest rewards regardless of what censored for the most money. (I still took upgrades but I tried to ignore taking certain things like weapons or plate if that’s what I needed end game.)
---
Losses are contextual. In the context of WoW, the level 20 loses 10 minutes of gameplay and and experiences frustration and anger, and the level 60 experiences a momentary, jaded frisson of relevance at having caused another person to experience frustration and anger.
---
If he "loves" it, if this is "the best part of his day", he should be in therapy, not harassing people.
---
Rawls predated video games and therefore did not talk about them directly. If you think *that* is relevant to this discussion, it doesn't really surprise me that you're here justifying the actions of the "bored" ganker.
---
I mean... the alliance exists. 
---
But other Horde players might roll on my loot. 
---
Who's the real enemy here?
---
This is the trade off. Alliance warlocks have to deal with will of the forsaken. It's annoying but once you have gear. You are more then fat enough to play around it. 
---
In fact in organized pvp Alliance warlocks are actually way better because they don't have to face off against paladins. Paladins are way more frustrating then will of the forsaken. Dispel magic can eat your lunch.
---
Boo PvE servers boo!
---
well alliance always have higher population on pvt servers 55/45, or even 60/40.  
---
Satisfaction? Fun? Community? I get it's nice if something good for you drops and you get it -awesome. But if anyone lets levelling loot or loot drama raise their blood pressure when the loot just makes such a tiny difference in the long run they've really got their priorities mixed up.
---
I agree with what you are saying. If you think of it though, tokens are going to be pretty much impossible early on in the Classic lifecycle (I'm talking first few weeks) because there won't be enough disposable gold in circulation to even support it. On day 1 the price of a WoW token might be something like 5 gold. If they did it at all, I think it would be a ways down the timeline. Unless a huge portion of the population are just gold farmers who want nothing else to do with the game, most of the gold in existence will be put to use by the players who have it rather than trading it for a token for quite some time.
---
All I know is I loved my raptor mounts. 😁
---
I've never quested Alliance side so I'll be doing plenty of exploring myself. Though my motivation is mainly the end-game. 
---
Ok, so where do you draw the line, and who gets to decide?  1,000g?  What about 500g?  100g?  Hell, 50g is still a lot for a bunch of fresh 60s on a new server.  10g is maybe nothing to scoff at, either.  And level 60 blue gear vendors for 5-10g.
---
What happens if you draw the line at 500g, but I personally draw it at 100g because I have less time to play?  This line of thinking is just arbitrary as hell and opens Pandora's box for all sorts of dumbass justifications, which is silly given that we have the Need/**GREED** system built-in to the game to address this exact problem.
---
Heard about a hunter using pet taunt on players in neutral towns in order to get the guards to attack them. 
---
No healer is capable of being higher than a 6/10 in PvE?  Are you trying to tell me there isn't a single class in the game that even remotely excels at one of the three core roles in all of WoW PvE?
---
There's a lot of issues with this list.  The leveling and PvP are all out of whack, but you've had your personal experiences so that's fine.  I just can't get over the fact that you clearly didn't acknowledge the holy trinity which has been the basis for WoWs PvE success since its conception.
---
Thank you for the work you put into this but it's hot garbage unfortunately.
---
You assume the classic wow team has more then two people. Doing it as a side project.
---
This guy skips leg day
---
You also never kited an emerald dragon. They were added post kazzak fix and were unkitable. 
---
I became a master at getting people to aggro guards and get repair bill in Silithus quest hub. There was an art-form to it, you had to cause twitch reactions and fake-outs, and also as hunter my best method was to use max range outside of guard range but close enough to enemy player guard range and then feign deathing when they attack me. 
---
Interesting. Thanks for the input.
---
I'll be sure to keep asking people where the transmogger is
---
yeah, i mean, their is water, like un'goru, and it's a crater ok, i'll give you that. Still, doesn't look like alike much.
---
All these pve people complaining about pvp servers. Oh my god its 2006 all over again 
---
Deadmans hand is an awesome twink item to have.
---
I take WPvP seriously ([and I even wrote a guide about it!](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903)) so I'd like to share my thoughts on this from the perspective of a person who probably thinks too much about this subject. 
---
I've always played Horde and will likely always play Horde but let me say that this has almost nothing to do with racials. I'm not going to deny that they're nicer for WPvP on the Horde side, but I have always considered playing Alliance to try something new and I really, really tried to convince myself to give it a shot but I couldn't. 
---
Most of my arguments have to do with the fact that either
---
a) Horde tends to have safer leveling areas, at least in the early game
---
b) Alliance actually poses a challenge, at least late in the game
---
Just thinking from the Alliance perspective for a bit, what could I actually do against the Horde to be worth convincing 40 people to waste 2-3 hours of their life for zero loot?   
---
* Cross-roads? Just flag your PvP off, share quests and return later. 
---
* Stonetalon Mountains? Pain in the ass to get there, too big and spread, no dungeons or anything too important going on there.
---
* Ashenvale? Too big to bother roaming between Zoram Strand and Splintree Post, even as Horde. 
---
* You can't really camp the zepellins (except the one in Grom'Gol) because they're in Horde territory. 
---
* By the time you get to Hillsbrad you're already at least 5 levels over most Horde in that area and there's very little incentive to kill them unless they're killing you. The cities are boring and easy to penetrate. 
---
* Kazzak? Usually over before it even starts, 63 elite demon patrols means no space to develop anything.

But on the Horde side, I have sweet Duskwood right next to Redridge which is sort of right next to BRM. I can take a zepellin to Grom'Gol right into STV, which is an actual base in STV unlike that worthless camp in the north. Further more, I can break the Alliance's back by camping Menethil Harbor and deny low levels access to Kalimdor as well as make their painstaking trip to the FP in Menethil a burden. And the closed off capitals of IF and SW really are a challenge to penetrate, since you can't really backdoor anything. Did I mention those long epic fights you can actually have at Azuregos? 
---
Let me underline that passives are in absolutely no way a discriminating factor and I think you're more than welcome to try WPvP out as Alliance the way I'm doing it (with organized groups) if you're comfortable with the fact that you're not going to be half the dick you could be playing Horde. Yes, Horde passive are nice to have, but I would be lying if I said I wouldn't give WoTF for pally+sapper combos. I think that PvP is fundamentally different from WPvP (specifically structured WPvP) and evaluating passives' performance there the same way is not very relevant.
---
Hunter is the best by far in earlier stage of the game and good wpvp since you can kite almost everything to oblivion.
---
Np keep in mind too when I say alliance locks are way stronger I mean that in the context of group pvp. Obviously in 1v1 horde ones are stronger. Orc Warlock is just brutally strong and hard to 1v1.
---
Back to my earlier point. If I’m questing and I’m ganked by someone, I die, and then rez and go back to leveling. It doesn’t matter to me what level the person who killed me was. 
---
If that's what you want to believe dude but it's still untrue, rogues scale poorly as classic goes on however because of x2 void sacrifices, soul link, healthstones and constant ticking instant dots a rogue generally just can't burst a SL warlock down and in a war of attrition a rogue has no sustainability.

---
This warlock also makes a point to fight naked, rogues were thought to be OP during vanilla WoW but over the decade of private servers it's been found to be the opposite.
---
&gt; the level 60 experiences a momentary, jaded frisson of relevance at having caused another person to experience frustration and anger
---
You're clearly projecting your own bias at being on the losing end of the fight here just from the way you describe this, can you not see that?  What if he's a guy who loves WoW PvP and he's pumped hundreds of hours into the game in battle grounds and raiding to make his character as strong as he can possibly be and going out into the world and killing every member of the opposing faction and seeing the results of all his hard work and character growth is just really fun and satisfying for him?  You know this is an RPG right?  Could that not be a perfectly healthy way of having fun?
---
Or what if he's looking to start a massive fight and that's why he's out killing lowbies?  Couldn't that be a perfectly possible explanation that doesn't involve any of the negative things you projected onto this hypothetical person?
---
Or what if he's just bored and he's not even thinking about what he's doing or the person on the other end of the connection?  What's if he's watching a movie on Netflix or shooting the shit with his friends in discord while he just runs around aimlessly just killing people to pass the time?
---
The point is that I can think of a million reasons that someone could be out ganking that are perfectly reasonable and mundane, but you seem to want to project these extremely negative qualities onto the people doing it.  You *know* they're not actually having fun doing it, they're just experiencing "aded frisson of relevance at having caused another person to experience frustration and anger".  And even if they *are* having fun, it's just because they're nuts and need therarpy, because you're also a psychologist I guess.
---
You're clearly way too ass-pained about all this to look at the situation objectively.  My only advice would be to either stop taking it to seriously or just roll on a PvE server.
---
&gt; Rawls predated video games and therefore did not talk about them directly. If you think that is relevant to this discussion, it doesn't really surprise me that you're here justifying the actions of the "bored" ganker.
---
I don't think it's relevant to the discussion, I was making fun of you for bringing up Rawls and suggesting that he's at all relevant to anything we're talking about.  It doesn't surprise me that you didn't pick up on that at all.
---
I wouldnt mind either, i wouldnt mind them camping my ass either.  
---
I will do that myself, but the one doing it is still doing it to be a scumbag.
---
Elaborate on why you wouldnt give wotf for pally+sapper combos? &amp; what that means? 
---
I love just going somewhere and being excited about seeing something new. I always pretend I'm the first person to see it.
---
It's not that common. I cast it maybe 3 or 4 times per play session. Granted I'm not raiding and banking 40 of them to summon everyone.
---
And then you can't find the asshole because he's a rogue and a coward 
---
I love pvp I always roll on pvp servers. I raid but I raid to gear for pvp.  
---
That being said pvp is always optional its a side addition to the game. You can play the entire game without ever participating in it and the developers put 1/10th of the effort into pvp that they did for pve as it was an after thought. We have two pvp sets a blue and an epic which don't get anymore additions to them even after pve offers much more powerful gear even for pvp.  Most everything added to the game revolves around pve.  
---
The only thing pve servers don't offer is mandatory world pvp. That's a very small part of the game that becomes optional not even completely missing. Change your mind? Most likely impossible not matter what is said but this is the reality.
---
where u draw the line will depend on person to person, but i think an item like edgemasters or any other high priced item is fair game for everyone.  
---
If i was your hunter in your group and you needed on edge masters handguards for the gold youd be on my blacklist and id call you a scumbag
---
How could you roll on loot? Personal loot is enabled across the board. 
---
You're absolutely wrong, friend.
---
Yup and mage and warrior work super well together as your main and alt. Your main mage can aoe farm gold for your alt warrior to always be pimped out in good gear since they are very gear dependent. Mages can get away with wearing trash gear while you save up for a mount etc, while the warrior as your alt will always want a badass weapon and max stats.
---
They do on private. And vags, babies, carrots and depression.
---
Tbh the warrior deserves it all considering repair cost is expensive as shit compared to clothies
---
I think both lines of thinking are valid, but I would think the person who will actually equip the item is the default choice. After all, the person who will wear the gear right away is guaranteed to get the most value out of it. You may or may not be able to sell it on the AH immediately and the longer you hold the gear without selling it the more the value depreciates. Its probably a ground rule that should be decided upon in advance if you want to do BoE's as free rolls.  
---
I feel like thats an unfair comparison 
---
In classic is there a world ping system that tells me if a certian area is being hit by enemy faction? Maybe if im alliance i can respond to horde at redridge &amp; duskwood &amp; have fun that way
---
&gt; where u draw the line will depend on person to person
---
What's to stop me from drawing the line at 2g then?  Because my first character is going to be a Warrior.  I'll have plate repair bills and will want to respect to PvE/PvP frequently.  I should need-roll on everything.
---
It's the exact same logic you're trying to justify with BoE purples.
---
Look at what subreddit we're on.
---
Common misconception.   
---
Alliance warlocks are arguably easier to play in group PvP, especially as things get more organized. Paladins have freedom and protection to help stop Warlocks getting blown up by melee, which is their biggest weakness. A two minute CD available to one race is also nothing in comparison to facing up against a whole additional class that can dispel. Fear Ward can also be more annoying than WotF. It's only on a 30sec CD, two dwarf priests can basically cover their whole team with it before teams engage in a BG. Then they reapply it to the key targets every 30 sec.  
---
Horde warlock can run around the world with Succubus and kill bads 1vX a lot easier than Alliance, but that's about it. Outside of Succubus, the 1v1's against UD classes don't really involve fear anyway. 
---
No wipes.
---
They're intended to evoke Geta, a type of Japanese wooden sandal.
---
Those are called geta. Its a type of traditional Japenese sandal. 
---
&gt;I actually liked them better smaller
---
H E R E S Y
---
But yeah, I suppose it's a different story for rogues, being stealthy and all. I had a warrior and shaman, both male orcs, whose beautiful T4 shoulders were tarnished! The size of your pauldrons is like the size of your feet, it shows you've got big... shoes, or something along those lines...
---
The warrior will still need to repair like it was a wipe
---
Totally planning on rolling a rogue name Gankenstein.
---
What the hell kind of school did you go to?
---
&gt; the longer you hold the gear without selling it the more the value depreciates
---
No it doesn't lol the fuck are you talking about? If you got edgemasters you could get 1000g+ easily and if you really wanted to you could advertise in trade chat for 900g and multiple people would whisper you immediately. 
---
Thank you for the reply brother! Mind controlling people also sounds super fun to be fair 
---
*Points to Head*
---
Can’t get corpse camped on your alt if you don’t have an alt.
---
It gets fuzzier there, but if you truly intend on leveling a profession, I think that's fair game.  If you don't intend on actually leveling Alchemy to make use of the recipe, then you're just an asshole *and* a liar.
---
They show off her incredible balance, just one sign of someone in peak physical condition with a healthy frame.
---
Pvp is one of the few areas in the game that blizzard dropped the ball a bit. The original system was garbage and seemed like an afterthought, and before you downvote, here's why: For a game that is called world of WARCRAFT, the vast, vast amount of time was spent NOT attacking the enemy faction. Name ONE QUEST in patch 1.0 that required you to kill an enemy player. Name one objective that required you to raid an enemy city.
---
Instead, we are tasked with settling local, minor disputes and eventually taking on a major threat to the whole of Azeroth. PvP has precisely ZERO place in that epic quest except to make it more frustrating (which is stupid since both factions are literally working on the same objective).
---
If blizzard had made PvP relevant, like in DAoC, we wouldn't be having this debate. Instead, it's a tacked on system that was given literally no thought at all and put in simply because MMORPs "need them". I'll be the first to admit that this did change as the game progressed and in some ways got better, and in many many others, got worst. For instance, BGs were awesome! Except that they effectively killed world PvP. A new realm (BC) where horde and alliance are literally forced into close proximity with each! Except Shattrath City is shared for some reason and it's not even possible to PvP there. The list goes on and on. PvP has became progressively worst as the game moved forward to the point where PvP servers literally DON'T EXIST anymore. 
---
WoW is not and has never been a true PvP game. There are dozens of others that have made that their complete focus and it shows. So, choose a PvP server and enjoy world PvP for 3-4 months until it dies when BGs come out and, from then on, is just an annoyance. 
---
P.S. Those 3-4 months will be awesome though...
---
I looked at your post history to confirm that you're trolling and now my eyes hurt
---
Why? Things take the time they take. We can't really say it's too much without knowing the details of the development process.

---
Really?! I have no idea why but this made me excited. I kept reading warriors need a lot of consumables and a pocket healer in order to be relevant... but that’s not fully necessary then? And not many buttons to press? Sounds really, really good... 
---
In all my years of playing, I've never had a problem with being camped. Worst they'd get me was about 3-4 times before I was able to res in a hidden place and escape.
---
It's more of a problem if I need to *stay* in the area to do a quest.
---
Agreed with the addition that when comparing good players to bad players windfury leads to a bigger crushing, but that only matters if you're talking about good players and gear vs bad. When you're all similar level of gear and skill I'd always give alliance the edge.
---
Did mind controlling someone and hitting your walk hotkey and releasing them work? I know it did at some point, was ridiculous fun watching them furiously walk around 
---
Private
---
There is nothing but anecdotal evidence to support that, which can often be worse than no evidence.
---
I played horde initially in vanilla. First time i got in the Barrens, ally raid on crossroads.
---
I would say that the reason why Redridge/Darkshire ganks were more often is the ease with wich a horde player could get there from OG (via grom’gol zep). Even so that would be too little evidence to state “pvp bad boys” play horde.
---
She’s a sophisticated matron of socialites. 
---
If you read quest text in Durotar it's clear that the Horde and Alliance are not at war during the events of Vanilla. There are friction points between the two factions that arise primarily due to aggressive sub-factions like the Grimtotems and the Theramore marines.
---
The Horde Onyxia quest line makes it clear that Thrall wants you to kill Onyxia because she's working to destabilize Stormwind and turn the Alliance against the Horde. That doesn't sound like factions at war to me.

It sounds like an amazing challenge for sure! What made you decide not to play hunter this time around?

Would you say warriors are difficult in terms of skills? Or more so time investment, survivability etc?

I’d vote Polymorph for Mage. As a lifelong Mage, Blizzard seems like a lame selection.

Warrior: Charge
---
Hunter: Pet/Hunter's Mark
---
Rogue: Stealth
---
Priest: Fortitude
---
Shaman: Totem/Windfury/Chain Lightning
---
Mage: Polymorph/Blizzard
---
Warlock: Fear
---
Druid: OwO
---
On a long timescale, Mage. In the immediate, Warlock. You’ll get to 60 faster and not have to grind as much gold for your mounts.
---
There are a lot of things we can/will try to organize once Classic is released.
---
Reminds me of what an asshole I was.
---
I used to be a GM on private server and customer assistance was the only thing I was ever good at lol.
---
Once I had been playing on my normal account when someone ganked me, I think in Tanaris. I got pissed so I logged on my GM account and decided to drive him nuts.
---
I repeatedly summoned him to one place and he thought he lagged. As he fought random mobs, I made them say random shit like "You have no friends", "You die alone", "Everyone is your enemy". Dude thought he'd lost his mind. The last thing I did was fuck with him while he was fighting a quest mob - once he'd reached half the mob's health, I'd keep it there. He thought the mob was bugged. Then I'd let him almost kill it, only to set the hp back to half.
---
He gave up and reported the bug on the forums.
---
I lost my position as a GM after I'd increased my character size and walked around Stormwind naked.
---
Guys you're supposed to vote in the poll, not with the karma arrows :(
---
I wouldn’t kill lowbies but I would kill their pets and then fuck them while they watched
---
Specifically I liked to find guys turtles and then my little dwarf would fuck their turtles
---
My favorite zone is Feralas. Its such a pretty zone and in my opinion underrated... I remember soloing the elite harpy quest (I think it was on the north side?) as a Druid thinking it was quite a feat to do alone! Roots ftw!
---
Those sexy cankles. Why must you tease me OP? I need a cold shower.
---
I'm thinking about warlock or hunter to main in classic. They both are great levelers, good at pvp and have dynamic experience. But I've heard hunter is not really good for raids, so I would like to know if this is really a problem for endgame.
---
I LOVED the instance designs for classic.  In fact, I'm onboard with a TBC Classic, but the only thing I don't like are the hallway dungeons.  
---
No heirlooms, no level boost,  no dungeon finder, just good old vanilla 🍦
---
only way to get these for a twink would be to farm THOUSANDS of steel lockboxes and only unlock them without looting, then trade to twink character, 
---
My golden retail vanilla had a free warrior that was still wearing that when we started bwl lol
---
You're right. 
---
We used to say “QQ pvp happened”
---
If you read quest text in Durotar it's clear that the Horde and Alliance are not at war during the events of Vanilla. There are friction points between the two factions that arise primarily due to aggressive sub-factions like the Grimtotems and the Theramore marines -- factions to which players do not belong.
---
EDIT: Verbatim from the Horde Onyxia attunement quest line:
---
&gt; With all due respect, Warchief - why not allow them to be destroyed? Does this not strengthen our position?
---
&gt; &lt;Thrall laughs.&gt;
---
&gt;
---
&gt; So much to learn still, &lt;race&gt;.
---
&gt; You are too young to remember the wars and bloodshed of ages past. Too young to remember the burden of the 
---
&gt; curse carried by our people.
---
&gt; Our position with the Alliance right now is a tenuous one. Skirmishes and smaller battles do take place, but there 
---
&gt; is peace - something our people have not known for millennia. Would you give this up and plunge us into the maw of chaos again but against a new foe? One that will not rest until we are destroyed?
---
Yea really nice to hear tbh, even if vague
---
Ahhhh man you beat me to it lol
---
Get ready for massive spam.
---
Remember Flasks in Vanilla can only be made in 2 locations, THe Alchemy Lab in BWL after the 3rd boss, or in Scholo(I forget where exactly). So semi afking while good for some crafting, is not possible to do with flasks
---
It's not the same. Someone rolling need on a BoP has some level of worth beyond its monetary value. If they use it, it has value above that offered by the nearest vendor or your local disenchant button.
---
The same simply does not hold for BoE items. Even if a person decides to use that item, he could've also done so by investing an equivalent amount of gold in the auction house. The effective value of the item does not change regardless of whether it is equipped or sold.
---
Therefore, since the effective value of the item is equivalent in all cases, it only makes sense that everyone has equal rights to the item.
---
I really don't know whether I'll actually follow that logic come Classic. It'll probably depend largely on server standards. But that being said, the logic has no errors in it as far as I'm concerned.
---
This. It aint that hard
---
U better drop some sick dad jokes in barren chat
---
My two favorite zones in classic are The barrens and Tanaris. I hated them as kids but the older I get. I begin to appreciate the desert zones more and more. 
---
Wow so much is wrong with what you just said.  You literally choose to play on a PvP server.  This is part of the game.  Don’t get mad and call someone a scum bag for playing the game lol seems a little over the top.  Go roll on a pve server so you don’t have to deal with us “scumbags.”  Easy.  
---
Some of my fondest memories are getting ganked by super cool looking skull level horde.  It motivated me to level and return the favor once I was 60.  This is literally a huge part of this game on a PvP server....
---
Ps: if you do roll on a PvP server (idk why you would with that terrible thought process) let me know so I can camp yo ass.
---
Don't live in China. I'm in Korea and still play on my NA WoW account. Reason being is I didn't want to start all over. 
---
Anywho, Australian guilds might be your best bet. I personally don't play on the Oceanic Servers because the ping there is worse than playing on US-West Coast servers. Even worst than US-East Coast servers. Either that or find ones that raid on your weekends. I shortly found a guild that raised Friday nights which is Saturday morning for me and that worked until I decided that I wanted to spend my Saturday mornings prancing around the Korean countryside 
---
Im not against people doing it.
---
I will do it myself as it is fun.
---
The only thing is that doing it is  scummy thing to do even if the game lets you as the only thing you do is waste others time for your own pleasure which by definition is scummy.
---
I am all for corpsecamping low lvls but saying youre notna scumbag while doing it is wrong lol.
---
With your pserver experience, do you believe Naxx will be 'clearable' in pugs or still only HC raiding guilds? 
---
Is my goal doable without much pre-planning?
---
Should I random a pvp server, and hope to find a guild with my wacky schedule (EST 1am-4am) or find a raiding guild pre release?
---
The logic is internally consistent, but it doesn't change the fact that it flies wholly in the face of what the need/greed system was meant to address.  If you only want something for the gold it represents, that is the definition of "greed."
---
If everyone in a party agrees that everyone should just "need" on the item and they have a consensus, that's fine.  But if there's someone in the party who wants to actually use it, IMO they should rightfully get it.  Otherwise it kind of defeats the entire idea of getting lucky with a drop, if you're always going to reduce it to it's monetary value.
---
You seem to be getting defensive for no reason.  Creating a strawman argument because you feel somehow slighted that u/Ok_resource prefers PvP servers over PvE.
---
It's not a "no true scotsman" either, I think what you mean is gatekeeping, but even then, it's all you bud. Ok_Resource wasn't gatekeeping at all, he was just expressing his preferences.
---
6 strength 6 stam leather belt?!?!?! 
---
And that make you appreciate it so much more when you finally get to clear it. This is simple psychology.
---
* Playing the AH is a great way to afk some money. Scan every hour, and set alerts for items that drop below a certain threshold.
---
* Fishing can make money depending on the fish, the only true afk fish I think would be the fish from WC, as you don't need to fish them from pools depending on the spot, so you can just fish in the water with something like a 20% chance of a Deviate fish 
---
* AV as a defense in a tower. Most AFK only a few moments of action here and there. When you die or cap the tower move onto some other defense point. In front of a GY, , another tower, or in the last boss. 
---
* If you afk near a spawn, make it something good, like a Thorium vein, or a rich thorium vein, though I'm not sure a certain spawn will always be rich so. Can do the same for herbs
---
* I think Warlocks can solo a few mobs in one of the Dire Mauls, that drop felcloth. Only takes a few minutes. SO when you have 5 or so, you pop in, kill the mobs and leave. Next time you have 5 minutes of attention do it again. Though you mention no combat, this might be an ok compromise 
---
* Sell your service as a watcher for a World boss or Dragon. And afk near their spawn, making sure to alert the guild the moment they spawn. I am not sure if this is a thing or not, just an idea I just thought of right now
---
That's about all I got off the top of my head
---
The difference is in the attitude of players. Generally it's the same in both factions, but most assholes (for lack of a better term) when it comes to PvP go horde for various reasons. A lot of them seem to enjoy undead rogues for example. 
---
What do you mean by alliance lock is like shooting yourself in the foot in pvp?
---
Hakkari ring also drops from heavy junkboxs and does not have a level requirement or unique filter, but holy shit 5% droprate on lockboxes for HORDE only is op as fuck. 
---
See the word you said there....camping....I’ll agree that you can start to question the morals of that individual lol but if some high level kills me and goes on with his life, there is nothing wrong with that imo 
---
&gt;You can read for yourself the alliance culture.
---
The people in redridge are not really representative of player culture at lvl 60 though. Just to be clear. 
---
Nothing wrong with camping either, if it brings the player joy and happines why wouldnt he do it.  
---
Just the mindset that i will go into this zone to kill low lvls who have no chance against me just to waste their time because its fun is scummy.  
---
It is fun, but it is scummy. And i dont mind it.  
---
I have the opposite experience actually. I've found that ally only attack in big numbers, and stay away if outnumbered. While horde tends to initiate way more 1v1 fights and stuff like that. 
---
I got a ring in ‘ere last night.
---
Ofc Vanilla WoW isn't a "true" sandbox game, but it has alot more sandbox elements than for example Bfa.
---
Worth it
---
Nelf druid or dwarf hunter or gnome rogue...? :/
---
Haha I see where your coming from now lol
---
So there is going to be toxicity in Classic. There is really no avoiding that. WoW Classic is basically going to attract the largest amalgamation of basement neckbeards you have ever seen. 
---
That being said, the fact that servers will have static populations means if you block enough toxic assholes on your server, eventually there won't be any left. You don't have 20 combined servers of people interacting with you, just one. 
---
Roll horde my buddy, Orc is still one of the coolest races for PvP AND PvE, they look cool as well and have a great class selection.
---
DRUID!!!!!
---
Blizzard isn't using private server data or scraped allakzham/thottbot for loot tables as far as we know. These items dropping from things other than the Hakkri Urn are non-existent.
---
I love PvP realms and World PvP, and I agree with all your posts. But killing someone with a grey level is a dick move, I usually just let them live.
---
It’ll most likely be a case of the grass is greener on the other side but will probably be the same on both factions.
---
Yeah if getting called a scumbag is such a big deal for you keep being this delusional.
---
nothing is stopping you from doing that but were talking about etiquette here, so if u want to roll need on everything go ahead and see what that does for your reputation.  But if someone rolls need on edgemasters with the intention to sell it, majority of people will agree it was fair game
---
 Warrior - Charge
---
Paladin - Divine Shield
---
Hunter - Aimed Shot
---
Rogue - Sap
---
Priest - Power Word: Shield
---
Shaman - Chain Lightning
---
Just wait till you see Horde toxicity. 
---
That’s what the Japanese used to walk on before westerners showed them how to make proper shoes. 
---
You understand that we admire people whose actions show *courage* and/or *skill*, right?
---
You don't need to "pump hundreds of hours" into BGs to be able to kill other players. *All*, and I mean *all*, you have to do, to win in WoW's shitty open-world PvP system, is be ten levels higher than the opponent, and not actually be AFK. That's it. No skill, no gear, nothing.
---
It is in no way a "challenging" or "courageous" or "skill-requiring" act, to gank lowbies.
---
Being "bored" and "not even thinking" about the effect of his actions on others is not some kind of argument for defense, you realise. It's an argument *against*. It may be "aimless" to him, but it's a fucking painful nuisance to everybody he affects.
---
There are no perfectly reasonable or mundane reasons to be out ganking. It's a shitty, bullying, annoying behaviour that the broken system enables.
---
I am indeed "ass-pained". I despise bullies, griefers, trolls and assholes in all contexts. I will indeed be playing on a PvE server, because that's where people like you, whose "fun" is ruining the game for others, *aren't*.
---
It's not about an arbitrary gold threshold, but about the difference in value for each player. If the difference is 0, logically all players have equal rights. This applies to all BoE items, although I can't deny that players generally only feel the need to enforce that logic when it reaches some arbitrary threshold. It's a drama avoidance thing, really.
---
This discussion seems to be more of a phrasing debate, really. I certainly don't intend to imply that one "needs" the gold. It's just that others need it no more than you do, so you may as well use the highest priority roll. That highest priority roll just so happens to be called need. I mean, your argument is essentially based on the labels that the rolls coincidentally have.
---
...Anyway, I've said about all I care to say about this subject really. My only point is basically just that the argument of the need-rollers is sound, even if they're inconsistently applied at times. In the end, none of us will have any real control over what becomes the dominant strategy in Classic. It'll just grow into one of the many hidden ethic rules that may very well differ from server to server.
---
Afraid of toxicity, wants to roll on the faction that spends 20 levels in The Barrens
---
Pick one
---
While that's true most of the time, in some cases (like Robes of Arugal) it makes a major difference and lasts a very long time before bring replaced
---
Not defensive at all. Was just pointing out it was a slightly snide comment. It's also not gatekeeping at all...so if you're going to get and discredit someone at least get it right.
---
Now downvote away ya fucking incels...God forbid anyone has a dissenting opinion and you just think "eh whatever" and move on with your life without downvoting. This is what I get for trying to be somewhat cordial in my original comment;  Doesnt pay to be nice in the slightest on the internet it seems
---
I got a std from Barrens chat. 
---
You'd think if people were really brave they'd roll Alliance and fight the supposed tryhards on Horde. 
---
They wouldnt be able to kill anyone of course but you cant pick up the flag if someone is hitting you or am I misremembering? 
---
I could help but I have to know if you are talking about PvE or PvP.
---
Going to mainly PvE with a side of PVP here and there
---
This is the type of run I think of when I see posts about people getting their pre-bis gear. 
---
Why make Scholo 10? It's pretty clearly balanced around 5, totally doable with 5, and once they fixed the bugs in the zone it was easily doable with 5.
---
10 is probably about right for UBRS even though it started as 15. With 15 you had crazy amounts of CC. With 10 the large mixed orc/dragon pulls before Drakkisath's room are doable but still fun.
---
&gt; But eventually I did finally pull away from pvp servers just because it wasn't my thing.
---
I roll PvE servers, and flag when I am feeling like it. It's perfect. PVE when you don't want to be hassled, PVP when you want to live dangerously. 
---
The other "advantage" is that I ~~never~~ rarely get openers. I'm the flagged toon, come at me...I can't touch you.
---
Then I'm stuck as a nelf :( dwarves and gnomes are my spirit buddies. It's impossible...
---
Nah. Only pick on kindergartners. I'm in my 30's and I still go back to Westfall Elementary from time to time to beat the shit out of 5 year olds.
---
A few days a go i got to level 26 so i was after Strike of the hydra from BFD. I tanked and got a pretty good group with no mail wearers and the run went really smoothly. I managed to get 2 BoE Mail Blues and still get Strike of the Hydra at the end.

Well if you are mainly going to focus on PvE, just pick whatever you think looks cooler. Mages gives AI/portals/water, Warlocks gives summons/healthstones/soulstones. Mage spams Frostbolt/Fireball, Warlock spams Shadowbolt. If you care about ranking in PvE, pick Mage.
---
Warlocks can do similar farms, but they also need to spend gold on food.

Well I played mainly Hunter through classic through to cataclysm. Just want to change it up really. Feel like I've achieved a lot on my Hunter and now I have the opportunity for a fresh start.
---
I started playing warrior in wrath and absolutely loved it. It's definitely my kind of class (get into the mix of a fight and just drop enemies at my feet), high skill ceiling with stance dancing and just felt those big numbers when they hit. 
---
However, a lot of people have said to me that warriors are a lot different in classic then they were in wrath. A lot harder as they have less movability, they take more damage, they're harder to level, they're one of the worst in 1v1 fights but are overpowered if they have a pocket healer, they scale heavily with new gear and are one of the most wanted class for PvE. It sounds like a nice new challenge to take on.
---
Pve player, probably.
---
I always tried to spice it up a little with "Grats man, almost to --!" or just a little extra so they knew I took 5 secs to acknowledge their accomplishment rather than just a macroed Grats button or even worse some auto gratz addon, we didnt have a lot of rules in our guild for the most part it was adult friendly little spot of heaven but the few rules we did have we enforced vigorously.            
---
             
---
 * Turn of the Auto Grats because you obviously dont give a shit.                    
---
              
---
 * In raid as long as bosses die dont whisper me about DPS/Healing meters because shits getting handled.                   
---
 * If i hear dubstep, heavy metal, parakeets or any other obnoxious shit during a boss fight you get muted, more than just you in here.           
---
Why do you have to level with quests and not grinding mobs in an RPG? Pretty sure this is a thing that comes from WoW. Other RPG's before it all had tones of gridning.
---
this is a really really important point imo, ive been in a pve server all my wow life, and in vanilla i world pvped all the time, big thing though was that it was something i could choose not to do if i didnt want to.
---
I was quite a big fan of Zangarmarsh back in BC
---
Shimmering Flats is one of my absolute favorites.
---
Barrens chat is a gift.
---
Wasn't expecting such an explosion of comments. Id like to say thanks to all who commented and I appreciate the corrections made. I do make mistakes and this
---
is a learning experience for me as I prepare for classic. 
---
I hope you are enjoying the series and hope you check out the shadow priest video coming soon.  
---
I remember them as 15 mans
---
I've played both, and as an aggressive person I don't really notice too much of a difference when hunting players, persay.  The thing i noticed most was the maturity level.. horde players tend to be more immature/dishonorable - zerg people, corpse camp and spam emotes etc.  Alliance tend to just kill you and move on.  This is of course not every horde or every alliance, there are plenty of people who don't fit the specific tropes, but in general, yea. 
---
If you want fair pvp on your own terms, play horde.. if you want to always fight an uphill battle, play alliance (and keep your bubble hearth handy).
---
&gt;not every class is the same
---
Exactly, some classes benefit more from certain items.
---
&gt;Not everything is simply decided by the Rocket Racoon 'I want it more' mentality.
---
I agree, that's why you don't give Choker of the Fire Lord to healers or DFT to hunters despite the fact that those items are BiS form them during certain points of progression. Those players may want it more, but it's actually much more beneficial to other classes.
---
A T2 geared hunter with ZG enchants and hit scope only needs  an additional 1% hit to hitcap, something that is usually provided by a ring or necklace. At that point, DFT becomes a marginal upgrade over DM seal trinket (+8 attack power) for hunters, but it's still incomparably better than anything else a fury warrior or rogue can get their hands on. Giving DFT to hunters so that they can enjoy 8 more attack power is the most "I want it more" thing I've ever seen.

[What Should I Play Wednesdays (February 27, 2019)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/avbmpi/what_should_i_play_wednesdays_february_27_2019/)
---
I have the same dilemma. I'm leaning towards warlock though. It could be hard to find dungeon groups as dps so at least you can say "I'll run to the instance for summons" which I always did anyway 
---
Will summon stones be in classic? I can't remember when they were added 
---
you overestimate my skill in pvp. After something like 14 years of playing wow, ive learned that if someone starts trying to world pvp me that its honestly less frustrating to me to just stop what im doing and willingly die.
---
But then, im going to be going pve when vanilla comes out
---
Could be helm of endless rage
---
Thank you for input with no reeees.
