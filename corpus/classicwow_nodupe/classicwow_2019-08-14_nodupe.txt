We are getting a bunch of hardcore players who have been playing vanilla for the last 14 years. While we were playing other games and maybe even retail, they were busy theorycrafting. 
---

---
It seems like these are the same people who rushed rushed to form Discord groups as soon as server names were announced, to have some sort of control over the communities. It's about power. And from reading the chats in the Discord groups, it's obvious a lot of these people (not all) have the min/max holier than thou attitude because of their experience.
---
Hopefully they don't ruin the community aspect of the game that I loved back in the day. I am personally going to find people that want to take their time and enjoy the game for what it is instead of rushing to 60 and through raids because they've done it 200 times on illegal servers.
---
---
---
Classic is all I can think about and I still dont have beta access?
---
Finally they're showing some ads for it.  They've been so hush hush lately.
---
Hear!  Hear!
---
F the Horde
---
Why? it makes total sense they will start pushing advertisement for classic now, considering there has been very little before now.
---
Lol the doomsaying on this sub is fucking unreal.
---
That's what i thought about hunter, looked into hunter already because they're often recommended as a beginner class but they just look easy to level and farm, pvp with deadzone and endless kiting looks pretty hard. But they might be easy for big open world fights, just spam your shots from the back, but i guess any ranged class would be good in that situation...
---
Like someone else here said, it’s not really the streamer it’s the giant crowd of players. And small streamers don’t have to deal with that
---
I’m playing a ret paladin. If I don’t get groups that’s fine. I’ll just soc horde in world pvp and run dungeons where we are really sought after. The amount of utility we provide in 5 mans is more than enough to outweigh our lower dps. 
---
Also at the end of he day, dps isn’t the be all end all of classic raiding.
---
Working as much field overtime out of town as possible to accommodate the 3 weeks off I’m taking for launch
---
From my understanding it's not a horde heavy server, it's only like 5% off that 50/50 split. Herod is so big I would not doubt if there's a late night guild that fits your hours. 
---
The biggest problem for Herod rn is the population being too large and we'll see if that holds up but maybe you can talk your friends into playing Whitemane or something.

Somehow got my name..
---
[removed]
---
Thanks
---
woosh
---
That‘s cool. Means I can focus on my level 60 main
---
I knew someone back on vanilla that had a name that that started with N and ended in "ith" instead of the hard "er" if you catch my drift, until after level 40. So ya never know. I'm surprised that got through their screening during the name creation tbh
---
Yep, I need to confirm this info for myself
---
Pack it up, boys. Classic is dead.
---
They are probably just paying streamers to play and create some pre launch hype

Most of the pserver incorrections were *more* difficult than what we see in classic...
---
Whenever you decided to post it here probably
---
And I’m assuming you need an invite, correct?
---
Lootlag or too much has changed.
---
drool...
---
yeah sure ok
---
Already done that all but for A. But I can't do that since the tendie and fruitpunch supplies would be cut off. And my dad might say the J word.
---
Hunter wing clip spamming is NOT higher uptime than warriors spamming hamstring; both situations are a 3.5 swing speed with 1.5 GCD instant damage abilities.
---
&gt;we aren't even sure if Prot/Fury builds are going to be a thing yet.
---
Why not? Outside of enrage sit-critting, everything else about Warriors should be 99% accurate to Classic.
---
It makes sense in the context of the game now.
---
If you haven't played retail in 10 years then you wouldn't understand.
---
Are you never happy?
---
Their expansion betas for retail usually stay open until launch (sometimes even a little past launch, basically whenever they get around to closing it), there's no real reason to not keep it open as much as possible.
---
Jesus Christ what an edgy informed post.
---
No, you're the one being arbitrary. If it's the same content and the only difference is damage, health, and additional mobs then someone can perfectly exclaim the content is scaled to be harder. It won't be what people mean when they say "level scaling", but that's not the only instance the word scaling is allowed to be used. Imagine being this anal and gatekeeping the word scaling. I've missed the personalities on wow lol.
---
Warlock demon quests. Actually having to beat a demon into submission. Feels good man.
---
Where does she come up with all the money to buy everyone's garbage?
---
Hey u/EsfandTV  how bout that beta invite you promised me?
---
If you're into the shadow stuff and not into healing or holy at all, warlock, hands down. Shadow Priest feels like a dumbed down warlock with the ability to give up and heal eventually. (I played warlock main, priest alt back in vanilla).
---
&gt; WoW had its issues at launch and it did fine. So there's no reason to change it
---
we just have totally different standards it seems. if there is an issue, then let's fix it.
---
I don't know much about spain. Do they speak english in group chat?
---
Stoutbarrel, Dwarf Hunter.  I think it's a good Warcraftian/dnd pun name.  I'm proud of it.  
---
I got my usual usernames from other games too, but those aren't anything to brag about.
---
I got Ashley, Vb, Xp and Tv. Pretty happy with my haul.
---
You're welcome.  
---
The best way to do it is to set up interact with target on both windows and turn on click to move on your slave.  To do this go into the key bindings and then targeting menu and then scroll down until you find the interact with target option and set it to something like 'G' on both characters.
---
Then only on the slave go into the Interface menu and then the mouse menu.  Turn on the click-to-move option.
---
Now if there is a corpse you need to loot a quest giver you want to talk to target it on your main character and then hit your assist macro so your slave is also targeting it.  Then hit the G key (or whatever you set the interact with target keybind to) and both your characters should now interact with that item being it looting a corpse, talking to an NPC or even autoattacking a enemy.
---
The video was aimed to get my friend started on this and he is also asking me similar questions.  Before classic releases I will most likely do an advanced tutorial video including things like this :)
---
To be honest, all I've got are vague recollections from a decade ago at least.
---
I was the one responsible for most of the web / VoIP hosting back in the day and remember mumble's server being a nightmare to get running with anything but the default settings, mostly thanks to them wanting that single master server browser instead of just sharing ip/port like TS and Vent.
---
Speex really wasn't up to par with the proprietary codecs at the time and always sounded like it belonged on a 16-bit computer.
---
And the client ui was just a disaster from what I remember. Granted, that could be said for almost any open source project from the 00's.
---
Granted, Vent had it's share of problems. I always liked TS personally. I still miss a lot of the configurability that TS3 had.
---
People upvoting you here doesn't mean shit. How many in the community have you actually engaged with? You said yourself you're as white bread as it gets, so of course you've never run into any issues engaging in the online gaming community.  
---
If your voice doesn't sound 'standard' for the whitebread gamer boy, people will always question your voice so there is no hiding from that bullshit.   
---
OP doesn't want people to misgender her, so there should be zero issue telling people "Hey, I'm a woman so please use she/her pronouns for me." She 100% has a right to having people refer to her properly. She shouldn't have to put up with being misgendered just to scout the Guild out.  
---
It's really simple, when someone tells you they are trans all you gotta do is ask what pronouns they'd like used for them. That's all. No, "Eww gross!" No, insta-block for daring to be honest with you.   
---
Why the fuck do you people think it's okay that others have to hide what they are? We're not all generic white boys, thanks.
---
The only one upset here is you, I think. I'm not even rolling on Whitemane lol
---
I wonder what the honest number of people are who:              
---
A) Are unaware of Classic but watch WoW Classic Streamers.                   
---
                 
---
B) Know about Classic but were uninterested until they saw a Streamer playing.              
---
          
---
C) Just escaped their crazy parent's nuclear fallout shelter where they've been living for the past 20 years after a freak plane crash convinced them they had been attacked and upon seeing the internet the first thing they see is a streamer playing WoW CLassic and go "Oh gee Willikers that looks Neat-O, I wana do that!"                   
---
             
---
I honestly can't imagine the numbers are exactly staggering.
---
The biggest issues are server stability and leveling fast enough. That's literally it. All this other stuff people bring up is trivial. A few hours of dedicated grinding planned ahead of time.
---
Stop correcting someone for spewing bullshit?
---
I only reserved two names. Don’t know if you need one reserved but I can do it once I get off work.

Also Paladin, I get it's alliance only but in classic (and I've already seen some mention online) ALL the blood elf fan boys (which make up a majority of wow) played human paladin. There's no way paladin will be one of the most uncommon classes come release.

&gt; 4\. How does IP-based geolocation work?
---
ARIN Whois database provides a mechanism for finding contact and registration information for IP resources registered with ARIN. The IP whois information is available for free, and determining the country from this database is relatively easy. When an organization requires a block of IP addresses, a request is submitted and allocated IP addresses are assigned to a requested ISP.
---
IP addresses are assigned in a block to an organization/ISP.
---
whois query shows the 24.xx.xx.xx addresses registered in Irvine and the 137.xx.xx.xx addresses registered in the Netherlands.  That doesn't mean that's where the servers are physically located, of course.
---
If you played retail you would know that not every mob is killable at level 15 tho? Mobs only scale up, not down. Try going to the burning steppes as a level 15 in retail.
---
You said "nipped it in the butt".

Which sucks because I genuinely enjoy the art work for that ability. If it were useable in defensive stance I could see it being viable.

Actually slayer of the lifeless was the new name for wotlk Naxx and a reference to the episode, the classic naxx version had some other name I can’t remember, hungering cold I believe?

Druids can't interact with NPCs while shapeshifted. So he turned it into a pun of the NPCs actually thinking the druid is an animal.
---
Idk, it may sound silly but for some people, they've had the name forever and it would kinda suck to change it. I've always been Youk, and I managed to snag that on GROB. I could have used other variations of my name if needed, I wouldn't have been upset, but it just feels so right to have the OG name. I'm cool with "wasting" half a month of game time to get names that I love. It's only $7.50 which isn't bad (really depends on people's situations, I get it).
---
ZG, my favorite raid.  Loved the 10-15 man raids, **loved**.
---
Same
---
100% correct. It's sad seeing people repeat the bs they read on Reddit instead of playing what they like and letting other people play what they want.
---
Your overbearing concern vomit will hang like a weight around your neck and muddle your game experience
---
Im thinking of switching from mage to druid just so I can get a copy of this and use it! Ahh! I can't afford to switch again.
---
How does that kill the hype?  Actually curious.  Im not in the beta and I'm hyped no matter what.  Who cares if the streamers and people that were in it get to go play a bit and make new classic content for their channels, free advertising basically.  If anything that should promote hype I would think.
---
Why? Honest question.
---
Big yikes.
---
God dammit, I'm a retard. I saw this and renewed my sub for the first time in forever. At least I got to create a character?
---
No, this is you excusing yourself for bad behavior against others, while demonizing your perceived opposition, while misrepresenting their actual intentions. I started posting here because I saw you calling people racists over this issue, which is as intolerant as you claim me to be, so I pushed back.
---
So, let me lay it out for you. I sincerely hope that everyone from all places has a great time playing. I also hope that includes US servers not being overrun by groups trying to take them over from other places, just as it would be obnoxious for groups of English speakers to try and take over Oceanic servers. I hope Blizzard does a good job ensuring that each different group/culture/whatever, has a place to enjoy the game and that everyone gets along well.
---
This includes you, I hope you have a great time in the game wherever you end up playing.

I have a macro that says REKT, while eating the corpse and laughing.

Everything I'm reading is suggesting that wing clip spam is better than hamstring for uptimes.

I'm not an expert on warrior tanking, but IIRC Skarm explained in one of his videos that it might not work as well as it did in pservers.  Take my opinion with a grain of salt, though.  As I said before, I am not an expert by any means.  
---
Mainly I meant that we aren't sure how fights are going to work out yet, as we haven't seen how the bosses are really going to work.  All the data we have is not related to the actual raids in Classic but related to pservers.  We just don't have any data on anything to support that any of the "niche" pserver specs like that are going to be good or not.  I'm not saying by any means that none of them will be any good. For all we know they very well could be the new meta, just like on pservers.
---
If I ever find you, I will kill you. But I will always /respect your body, Thex the Troll Shaman.
---
can you give an example?
---
Eh, if you’re rolling tank there’s no real need for it.
---
If you’re a DPS in a 5 man, you could use it on trash to help your tank with survivability since it does offer reduced attack speed but you can’t use it anywhere outside of that.
---
So tailoring is a useless profession otters than ZG phase?
---
I like seeing the cool names people got.

The bulge is unsettling.

I don’t care  if they’re streamers.

The high end gladiator community is rolling there (Cdew, Venruki, etc.) That should be exciting.

Does anyone know if pfUI works in classic? I never used any addons back in the day. Wanted to just use a UI one to make it look a little cleaner this time.

You say "rekt" to someone on the opposite faction ? You know they can't understand you, right ? Come on there's limits to self sufficient

Why tho

Accounts invited to the original closed beta have access, even if they have no current active subscription.  I have a current active subscription and I can't get in.  See?  That was easy.

But then you have to send it to your phone to text it to people. Such a hasslleeee

maybe that's just for me, but if i can't play with my name then my motivation goes down quite a bit. If I couldn't get "alpacaa" I would have to chose something else and every time i log in i have to see that name i never wanted.
---
I'm actually excited to level a paladin. I love the lore, the look, and even the methodical feel. I'm leveling as ret then swapping to holy/prot. Definitely trying to level with friends, it's so much more satisfying as a paladin and my kit can be used to its full potential.

I hope all the pally shit talking in wow communities scares people away so we can be special snowflakes.

But what will you do at 60?

This was ACTUALLY the cringiest thing I've ever read on this sub. And I mean it. I love how people are speaking on behalf of the servers...as if they are inportant or as if their opinion matters. Chances are, OP won't level their hunter past level 30 anyways.

We don't know what ''Low'' means, it could be 100000 characters, 10000 or a 1000 characters. There will also be a lot of people who will change servers when they get to be 40000 in queue on the other pvp-servers.
---
The faction imbalance will likely be the case on most pvp-servers. Horde tends to have a majority on pvp-servers and Alliance on pve-servers. Rp-pvp servers seem to be the only servers where there's a rough balance.
---
Jesus Christ this is a bad troll

I think scaling has a place in retail as the leveling experience can be annoying when you are halfway through a zone and really into the story but you've outleveled it and everything in the game is telling you to go elsewhere. It's really been an issue since Cata. 
---
Vanilla is the best as it's pretty much impossible to outlevel a zone if that's the only zone you're leveling in. In fact the game essentially forces you to explore other zones in the same level range as there simply aren't enough quests to get you to the next tier of zones.
---
Thex!
---
Fuckem
---
I've definitely noticed this as a new player (I joined this year). It also felt like a huge step backwards when I got to WoD content and suddenly I lose the ability to fly for three expansions.
---
Did you even try
---
We know
---
Server merges effect literally everyone on both impacted servers. Forced name changes, forced guild changes, and mashing two economies together and hoping for the best. It's the problems with layering except amplified.
---
How expensive is this? I need to make a budget so I can afford it. I need the full rundown. I’m good with my PC and peripherals though. Just need everything else and monitors.

Don't you know it's the evil boogie man activisionblizzard, they can't be trusted to do anything. But extort the maximum  amount of money for the minimum of effort. And they keep making changes to the more blizzlike then blizzard vanilla code perfected by private servers to make there previous comment of you think you do but you don't come true.
---
Yeah I'm trying to tell them that too lol
---
It's better than the 150gb download for call of duty lol
---
&gt;I can’t wait to never visit again after launch.
---
No one ever leaves for good.
---
Remember! Blizzard released less servers, they will want to transfer due to queue times that's for sure.
---
Fairbanks is a hidden gem it's going to be the "real" classic experience.
---
Retail needs to die.  I mean that with respect.
---
"Relative realm population will be visible in-game to help in choosing a realm so you will see Low, Medium, or High in the realm selection screen. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during name reservation and character creation, we will post warnings about the potential for queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms."
---
Relax
---
I haven't found a good source for it yet, but is there a definitive list out there for how vanilla wow auto dropped debuffs in its debuff priority?
---
how do i play? or is this another streamer only beta
---
tl;dr - stand still
---
Is it just me or are Rets seemingly the least likely to throw off heals in dungeons though?

Oh it’s not bad but for some reason people just like to complain about stupid shit
---
What made you choose Herod?
---
Wasn't there a small xp gain from turning in marks or was that just the first time and my memory is dog shit?
---
buddy, this is years in the making. I can tell you my monitors are 24" benqs and they run 120$ a piece. my computer itself was about 1400$. TV was 400$. All my bluetooth LEDS were about 100$ but they sync to my phone which is nice.
---
What else are we going to do?
---
I think he is saying its redundant as in you cant be a paladin without being holy (as the archetype is a holy warrior)
---
This is the type of hardhitting investigative journalism I subbed for. Next week can we examine why Iowa sucks?
---
Is it not already exclusive?  If you solo gather 50k carapaces by yourself for the rep grind and manage to complete the other 15+ steps of that quest, involving multiple raids and world boss encounters isn't that enough?  By today's standards of "an achievement", this one takes months of dedication if you are working with limited time windows.  
---
Damn to your "it's supposed to be that way" logic.
---
As far as how to blizzard farm on a frost mage?  Not sure. I do remember (from experience) that tanaris and western/eastern plaguelands weren’t too bad to do this
---
Don't /w croots.
---
I don't understand why you want people not in jail to be not fully let back into society.
---
it was closed, now it's reopened
---
Uhm its you who keeps taking my name "JiB" ay??? :)
---
Don't you have to BUY BFA?  Why the fuck would I do that?
---
I'd maybe actually throw shadow priest on a close second (if not maybe split first?) with mages. They are pretty easy to just play at a okay-ish level, and even though I feel they have a lower skill ceiling that mages, can still be quite godlike if played at perfection.
---
The "easyness" comes from the whole "shield yourself, throw a dot or two if you're undead, then just mindflay/mindblast" rinse and repeat. Fear if anything comes close. It's kind of like mage and their frostbolt spam, but just with a few more buttons in their "rotation"
---
Quick Edit: ANd I definitely agree with hunters being super difficult to even play remotely decent. I'd say they are up there with warriors and druids as far as complexity goes.
---
It doesn’t, people just need something to complain about and criticize Blizzard and streamers
---
My formally Horde guild is rolling Ally this go on Mankrik. Thought for sure it would draw the more fun crowd.
---
Making sure streamers got into the beta was really all the advertising they needed to do.
---
I remember as a young man making it my personal quest to not die a virgin. Having already popped the achievement I can finally devote myself fully to the horde.
---
op: i played vanilla wow in 2005 with my brother. we were kids.
---
mr anime porn star: NU UH KIDS DIDNT PLAY GAMES IN 2005
---
I, too, will be rolling on Herod. I dare not waste my time on a server that is doomed to fail.
---

---
Haven't decided on classes yet. Thinking a horde priest and mage. Maybe a priest and warrior.
---
Druid sounds like the class for him tbh
---
Easy: I ain't in it
---
Honestly, I expected worse.
---
Yeah, so what ? You want me to find you a therapist ?
---
How many ink cartridges where needed to print that art?
---
I'm kind of curious as to why the lgbtq community needs to be lumped together as if they speak a diff language...  like.. should I be worried if my tank is gay? Who is even making the calls for them in this department? Was there as big gay election to choose the director of lgbtq activities in classic? 
---
Seems a bit silly,  I think lgbtq should be encouraged to go wherever they please.  With the understanding that they won't be the only lesbo on the realm for not following the pack.
---
I'd go for those servers as others said, tourists will come and go leaving the full servers at a better stable pop after they go.
---
My advice? Don't use voice.
---
PM'd :)
---
I honestly did like skyrim and also thought it was the worst entry in the series. The combat was the most fun in the series, mechanically, but they took out so many of the rpg elements that it just felt like an adventure game, not an rpg. Some mods improved it a great deal, but even with them it doesn't quite feel right, since there's no getting around the fact that the original game was designed around stuff like using fast travel and being able to safely go to any city at any point. 
---
Then they took all of the worst parts of skyrim and amped them up for fallout 4 and further cut back on rpg elements. BGS is probably tied for my favorite development studio, but if the next TES game doesn't take a step back closer to it's roots I might just be done with them.
---
They will probably keep it open over the weekend like they did with the stress test
---
too many.

---
That sub is fucking insane and toxic as hell. Can never tell if the info is good or not.
---
Click bait, troll, shit post.
---
If memory serves me correct Blizzard did the same thing in 2004 to increase the hype for the Winter 2004 launch. I remember them giving us a few extra days to play around in WC (horde).
---
Can you in any way guarantee that, because if not your just blowing smoke up our asses over some meme bullshit.
---
I'm an adult who doesn't cry about such things. I didn't cry in vanilla and I don't demand changes because discomfort makes me cry. If it did I'd still be playing retail.
---
 
---
That's a good suggestion btw. They should make a server without layering.
---
I've played on AUS servers from NA, it's fine.
---
The poop socks that are competing will be online 24/7 so lol
---
You really think people on reddit would be able to all agree on a server to call it home? Come on.... no way.....
---
Someone post the gay seal please
---
sorri
---
No because we only get 2 stickies and there are other things of greater importance atm.
---
True lol
---
Yeah, I mean I was a dumb kid that thought those names were hilarious. Not sure why the downvote frenzy lol. However, I don't understand the logic of older players doing it now knowing they will lose it.
---
C
---
This is authentic. My gateway misses me too...
---
I made a multi tab spreadsheet with when to learn skills, crafting, what to craft and when for gear, talents, key quests I too have a problem
---
Idk what this discord shit is. Is that even what they use for voice chat now? If someone on Mankrik is running a Ventrillo server I’m in that guild
---
And that's fine with me, for I will be playing on the Undisputed NA Champion server. I do not need to even name it - you know of which realm I speak.
---
The beta remains closed to those who had previous invites!
---
Yeah it is, although if you get some cool names I'd say it's worth it. You still have half a sub to play Classic so three names for $7 is not  a bad deal.
---
OG ZG was 20.
---
It’s a race. The time required means nothing if you can take as long as you like. And the quests only being able to complete for one person per raid means a guild needs to decide who gets it, just like all other legendary items, because it’s unlikely they’ll have time for more than one or two scepters before another player rings the gong.
---
Did you count that one chair in that other room?
---
Is ninja really going to stream classic? Good publicity I suppose
---
Makes sense in a stupid kinda way.
---
Why sink advertising cost into a game you think will fail and that nobody wants? 
---
But when you have confirmed player interest in said game because hundreds of thousands of people just paid you money so they could name some pixels in a game they can't even play yet... Well now you have a confirmed interest plus some extra cash in the budget to pull ads.
---
Grob mob best meme mob.
---
yeah i hate scaling, getting amazing gear SHOULD give me a big advantage in pvp or even just killing mobs.
---
i honestly dont see the point of even playing retail and getting gear as i will just get downscaled anyway so whats the point ?
---
The nascar commumity intend to dominate the track on herod. 
---
And the knitting community plans to blanket the realm of faerlina with their yarns.
---
I have splayed my evidence in the original post. If that is not good enough for you, be my guest. *Roll on Fairbanks*, and doom your grandchildren to poverty!
---
Bluepost has people bitching “WHAT DO YOU MEAN ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAD ACCESS CAN PLAY?!”  GOSH BLIZZ ONLY WANTS TO HAVE STREAMERS ADVERTISE THIS!!!!”
---
Ugh.. Fuck off. The waits almost over. It’s been 15 years, you can wait another few weeks
---
You’re projecting, sir.
---
All my friends said most of the pvpers they know from the old days are going to Herod so let’s go too.
---
Something about a shirtless man with an axe and helmet just gets people going I guess.
---
They are probably trying to get people to even out the servers more and encourage people to go medium and low pop atm
---
&gt; You: *Games bugged as fuck*
---
also You
---
&gt; *yikes it's bad that they're reopening the beta 2 weeks before* launch
---
imagine being this dumb, the real **yikes**
---
Right prayer, wrong fandom. Still thanks for the effort.
---
Fuck pve, you need the real experience
---
I got carpal tunnel on both hands last time... I will pass on Classic.
---
I’d say considering most derogatory words have some kind of history and impact to them because of how they were first used, approaching that method probably would not work because of all the people that would get easily offended. That and reverse psychology is probably the easiest form of persuasion to use.
---
I think it all just comes down to discipline and how you teach your child right from wrong. Because if they respect what you say, they won’t swear.
---
White mane for sure
---
It'd be cool if DPS meters could show a more hybrid stat compared to raw damage (DPS) and healing (HPS); and the others stats too of course. But, something like a **normalized DPS + HPS + Buff/Debuff Uptime + Damage Reduction**. So that even if the Rogue is crushing you in DPS, this hybrid stat would show you similarly ranked due to healing, damage reduction, and buffs. Could even set it up in a way that tanks, heals, and DPS could be in the same list/ranking.
---
By role I mean what the class will be doing. I heard about decurses, buffers and so forth
---
They should remove the timer. And only give it to the first person that bangs the gong.
---
a few friends and I still use vent to this day.  We are relics of days long passed
---
I told myself that too and then made my characters this afternoon. XD
---
Agreed
---
My wife would take offence to that. Well, if I am cooking, yes there are flames. I have been banned.
---
Demand blizzard give you a 2500 population limit server! Really show it to them
---
Midnight not noon
---
I don‘t play zoomed in, but I still hang out every once in a while and have a look at the character I‘ve played for days (game time).
---
idk why people are overreacting, it was / is the same on tich, I know sharding exists but .. even in the 'old' days I rarely saw content creators... max is like seeing them in Dalaran chilling in full gear in front of bank
---
Everyone here saying the mounts should be exclusive, but where is this support when it comes to the unarmored mounts, not fair.
---
**Translation**; My partner revealed that she's lesbian to this random dude guild leader and he kicked us from the guild. So you guys are assholes, boo!

Thank you for your sacrifice in saying out of my queue.
---
Shit posts like this is what makes me worried how people will act in classic. Ret is perfectly fine in 5 mans
---
lmao
---
there are other options now?
---
The higher ap you have the more important crit becomes. Getting more ap is a flat increase while crit is multiplication, therefore agility becomes better than strength at some point.
---
I'm in OCE. Cheers tho
---
Hmmm well I guess we don’t know
---
Hey, these namereservation are everything we've got!
---
OP probably wants personal loot in Classic too.
---
That thread is a great read if you're looking for a bunch of people getting emotional about not being invited.
---
Had a guildmate doing the grind. Our server had a honor system that once you got 12-13, whoever was closer would be helped and next in line would be up. 
---
Well we had a guild that decided one of their rank 10s should be next. They account shared and did nothing but pvp to jump everyone else in line for HWL. Many tickets were opened but Blizz never did anything and this account was on 24/7 for over a month straight. 
---
Needless to say he gave up at rank 12 and it forever burnt him out on WoW. He shortly quit after BC and is still iffy about playing Classic.
---
Robe of the Archmage is extremely powerful for mages. Trufaith Vestments, while I haven't played a priest, I'm pretty certain is damn powerful aswell.  
---
Warlock you have either Robe of the Void or Robe of Winter Night. Void is better, but marginally so and Winter Night is BoE so you can have a tailoring friend to craft it for you.  
---
Just depends on what clothie you are my dude.  
---
When it comes to Bloodvine, you REALLY want it as a mage.. and it's pretty much mandatory as a warlock, since warlock suffers a ton from lack of hit rating.
---
Or you go back to the first zone you leveled in and all the mobs now leveled with you, makes it feel even less like a journey and just about stripping your stats.
---
Splynters- shaman
---
Orphan - rogue but may make it a lock
---
Bobthedruid - druid

It’s the implication.
---
Druid is extremely variable and adaptable in playstyle. Try it.
---
never stopped bruh

Wait you can't see castbars in classic?

Taking my first vacation from 60hr work weeks since February, for wow classic.   So excited it hurts.

---
Who pissed in your cheerios?
---
Is this beta open to everyone like the stress test was? Sorry if someone already asked this
---
Yeah, i have a good name in discord already that everyone uses. If that was what you were thinking, but i think that wasnt something you were thinking.
---
There is a difference between voicing concerns (at which point you wait to see if they change anything, and respond accordingly) and acting like the world is ending, and the sky is falling.  The problem isn't voicing your concerns.  It's the manner in which its done and the follow up reaction.  Some things are very much worth being vocal about the very *instant* that someone has even an *inkling* of an idea that it will happen.  Others, not so much.  This shouldn't be a new concept for functional adults in modern society.
---
Yeah, not until we can get a character logged into the realm and run traceroutes will we know. Blizzard has a nice web app called Looking Glass, but it only lists Retail realms right now.
---
How is this Blizzards fault?
---
Depends on how agi stack you go, in my expierence.
---
Comments like this confirms that people take this shit too seriously. It’s a joke, I will play ret paladin myself
---
The fact that totems went from short-term buffs/utility that you could place quite often to High CD cooldowns is what ruined the Shaman class for me on Retail.
---
I want my Totems back goddamnit.
---
The important question is, what should we do about the Thex in other servers? I'm playing alliance on EU so if I see a Thex, you want me to hug them before I kill them, or spit them before I kill them?
---
Similar boat... I've used the same name for multiple "mains" across multiple servers over the past decade+. Although I'm sure the name won't be reserved at launch, I think I'm going to retire it and leave my retail legacy behind. After all, I'm a totally different adventurer than I was back then. So stoked!
---
Exactly, free marketing to millions who follow like leaders.
---
Great minds

Thanks for your input!!

Question - does anyone know if I can create a second character if I already have one on a "full" server?
---
A great boss right there
---
At first i was sceptical and now i believe it'll happen. I'm convinced there'll be a guild that manages to get everyone to 60 with the rep done.  Only things i see preventing a kill are server issues or the boss damage output being drastically different to pservers.

Thank you so much for this! I haven’t played the game since a little after Cataclysm and I went back to my roots and OG name for the re-boot. Druid Night Elf FTW!  It was the old trailer that decided that option for me. Had no idea what I was in for.
---
Shame you can get arrested for your speech though.
---
True. I tried to jump back into retail, but honestly I want that warrior 1-60 grind. I love retail but after years of playing all I want is Classic now.
---
When all the common words or names are taken you end up with kind of shitty names or wierd spellings. Super rare to have a name that isn't something like XxKillerrzzahXX

It feels clean to me to have my rogue named "Stealthy"

oo those are nice names! which will you main you think?

Why? An asshole doesn’t give out their BNet anyway.

I had \~35 at the end of vanilla, but I didn't start until feb. 2006. 75 by the end of tbc and 350+ by the end of wotlk.  
---
2008-2010 were rough years for me.
---
Nice.  How does one go about that?  Just open up a chat or something and put in all my bank info?
---
&gt;  re opening it back up two weeks out means there is a big problem. 
---
They're reopening beta at most to test bugfixes they recently made, and more likely just to re-ignite hype. Sit down.
---
I think the rules are the same, they're just never enforced on a non-RP server unless it's vulgar.
---
It’s reopened for people who already have been invited to the Beta.   I don’t see the connection to advertising because the new people who see it won’t be participating in the beta.
---
I showed up to the party late, and all the chips and salsa were gone! so unfair!
---
Sort of. But you have to go check out how much agility it takes to get an increase in crit by a whole 1%. I think the payoff of crit per point of agility is super inefficient, and going pure bonus attack power and picking up bonus % crit that is directly on gear is the better way to go.
---
That's really just been the case here for 2 years.
---
I honestly never had an issue with feeding my pet or stocking ammo. The problem is when you have 1000 arrows and you get a gun drop that is much better.
---
+1 for fire mages 👍
---
I wasn't going to do it.  But then the stress test was extended from 1 day to all weekend.  I'm so effing bored lately I couldn't resist the opportunity to goof off on Classic all weekend.
---
I actually re-learned some valuable info about Vanilla that I forgot (which private servers got wrong) so I'm glad I did.  Name reservations were only the icing on the cake for me.
---
Yes, there's about $6 - $7 worth of subscription time completely wasted until the 26th since I refuse to play retail.  But that's a tiny amount of money and it's not worth agonizing about.
---
I got on herod but my brother was unavailable until today and now herod is full. so i have to reroll on thalnos. side question they gonna open more servers lmao

It’s great to know you think of your stepdad that way. Let him know from time to time if you don’t already.
---
Are you sure, because I jumped on retail to mess around and the Un'Goro Devilsaurs were my level (48) not the 60 I expected. It turned what I expected to be a probably losing, but fun fight to the death into a bland dinosaur beating. I just logged of after that.
---
Tbh I dont think anyone, regardless of streamers, is gonna have an actual “authentic” vanilla experience. Its been over a decade how you play games and understand things is gonna be different. You know where the storys meant to go now. Its gonna be vanilla but its not gonna be like how it was back then, chuck norris jokes are out if date.
---
I still think its gonna be great but I think people should be ready to embrace what modern culture brings to it, including streamers. Its basically just a famous person in the game world.
---
Are you in the mage discord or bug discord?  
---
Because you didn't address any of the points people have been talking about for the last month+ regarding this.
---
"Melee leeway" isn't even the right term for what people are experiencing.
---
It happens when you run straight and you don't do anything that forces an update on your character's position on the server.
---
So many people who post threads about leeway don't even consider your server-side positioning when that is literally ALL that matters.
---
That's why things like this exist:
---

https://clips.twitch.tv/GiantMoistRhinocerosPeteZaroll  &lt;-- position doesn't update when jumping until you land
---
Because client side people's characters are moving, but they are not taking any action to update their position on the server, so the server keeps their position where it was up to 500ms prior and the mobs behind you move close enough to that spot to be in range to hit your server position.
---
I'll get on beta right now and record some clips since it's back up.
---
Very nice! :O
---
I'd say in very short order by some jealous hater that'll /friend you first so they know when your name is changed and they can snatch it right up.
---
Dark Cloud was such a good series, loved it. Sadly I only have a PC and not big into emulators any more.
---
A company that wants to promote their 15 year old game without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars....
---
Why dont you just roll a rogue?
---
Yer didn’t read correctly the first time, “beta”, I was only part of the stress test :/
---
I’ll help you here but first I need your DOB, SS# and credit card details
---
Some people like to shit on everything so they cant smell their own stench anymore.
---
Hopefully they're fixing the layering. 😅
---
The idea is to "give it a chance" on a server that is not likely to suffer from prolonged pain.
---
There is no paid character rename in Classic, only realm transfer.
---
Good thing i made one on Fairbanks too
---
Whats the deal with everyone hating whitemane server?
---
And they hated him for speaking the truth :p
---
Those servers went down faster than an alter boy on a priest.
---
Haha yeah probs has a herod model as his screensaver
---
No. You’re not special enough.
---
I think the population is just relative to the other servers.
---
I think there is going to be such an imbalance from the other main servers since certain groups have "claimed" that server. With only 13 servers there will be no "dead" servers. All will have a healthy population, with some maybe having queues. Blizzard is doing this on purpose.
---
I love this, I know a guy I plan on playing with who's been playing longer than me. I think he's just been lazy and playing overwatch all the time, he's kinda acted like a dick lately, so I might ninja his name. Your post gave me that idea, thank you.
---
What about the ooga gang?
---
No. Jed isn't far away and you still need to run in a bit to target him
---
Runescape overall is a great game RS3 and OSRS, but for less than 2 weeks I couldn’t recommend it.
---
low iq op low iq target audience
---
I've had my name since vanilla, I'll be damned if I play any other persona. My main has always been my *main*.
---
Well this is torture..
---
&gt; it's not exactly a hard fix, 
---
Small feature != easy to fix.  
---
It *might* be an easy fix, but it might be incredibly time consuming to “get right”, or it might break a whole bunch of other stuff and simply isn’t worth the time.  The fact is, none of us know, so stop talking out of your ass.  
---
The fact that you think this minute level of nitpicking is valid critique is just irksome.  Yeah, they’re different.  Does that fact change any meaningful part of the gameplay?  No, it doesn’t.  Blizzard is working on very limited time and your complaints are non-issues.   I’d rather they spend the little time before launch working on something actually important, like making sure layering works as intended.
---
I'm in a chat with around 180 Transpeople in it and I've never seen anyone like this ever.
---
This is not a representation for transwomen, this is a representation for some good ol' white american trash.
---
Woah you got Thex?
---
Obviously propaganda to get fewer people to reserve all the names you want on launch day.
---
One of my favorite names in retail is a panda named BearyPunny as a dad, it spoke to me.
---
Undead Priest on Herod called Zeal. Was my SPs name in Vanilla. I didn't try anything else (other than my real first name).
---
I work nights during the week, so I can’t raid til 1130 on weeknights, I’m trying to find a weekend guild, too.
---
I plan to go alliance since I was always horde in vanilla and only went alliance in WoD onwards so I never experienced alliance side of levelling/questing in classic.
---
I'm making a gnome and had already planned to do the proper gnome/dwarf levelling path but this is making me wanna go straight to the human starter instead.
---
But you can. Get some intel gear and crit and just heal as ret, really not hard to heal as a paladin.
---
Really wanted the name "Roar" on Fairbanks, but someone took it.  Instead have druids named Rur, Growl and Lenin.  Don't know which I'll stick with.
---
They didn't though
---
#no changes
---
We need more servers....
---
So basically what you’re saying is that the process of “slogging through bullshit quests” is actually important.
---
Might roll here from EST just to be away from the Latin, Streamer, and jam packed server we have. Est only has regular RP.   
---
Serious question, how do RPers handle raids in general? Like the fact we keep redoing them and so forth. How is the pacing different?
---
Great post. Thank god someone can see some sense.
---
People only notice LGBT people talking about their sexuality because it sticks out so it seems like they're doing it all the time when they aren't doing it more than anyone else. Everyone does it indirectly most days without even noticing. The amount of times you hear guys say in guild chats "my gf said..." "gotta go spend time with the wife bbl" or talking about getting laid with whoever...  yet say a guy in a guild said he was going to spend time with his husband all of a sudden that would be considered as announcing unnecessarily.
---
I am guilty of letting that negative stereotype get to me. I try damn hard to use neutral language and never give anything away in a game unless REALLY close with someone. I don't even correct people when they call me bro etc because people even think letting others know you are female is "looking for attention"
---
usually i dislike these posts since they are so low effort and a karma grab. But this guy has made an actual sort of useful thing and made it look cute. I like it.
---
As all things should be.
---
Did you really not anticipate the possibility of the servers melting and things not working out as expected? Just think of it as a relatively minor $15 idiot tax and move on.
---
Is it?
---

Willing to trade for gold on retail // names on Herod/Whitemane PST
---
Having to switch out of forms to change into a different form stood out to me more, going straight from cat to bear is pretty convenient
---
It is the unofficial official 4chan server, so it's like white trash central.
---
(that's the funny part-)
---
sorry just trying to save the fairbanks people where i can, havent seen one good thing about it so far
---
Let the bodies hit the floor
---
I was rogue when I originally played in vanilla... and back then I always liked how druids could do rogueish things but also heal, use travel form, tank, etc... 
---
I've read a lot on their shortcomings here and in other places, but the real struggle for me will be hitting level 60, since I'm not sure if classic WoW will be fun for me.
---
This is my shit, inject posts like this straight into my veins.
---
Like the people on 4chan are going to agree to all go on the same server.  Are you high?
---
Then they don't want to fight. Seems fair to me. World pvp is fun when both parties want to fight. I get why people would want to play on pvp servers but it’s still the same game either way, just less hassles on pve.
---
Bruh, you're the one bringing up your cancer. Exactly who is playing victim here? All I've said every time is that there is nothing wrong with not wanting to be misgendered.   
---
Giving the GLead a heads up isn't 'waving it in your face'. Saying, "Hey, I want to give you a heads up to reduce the possibility of drama. I'm Trans" isn't waving it in your face at all. It's simply giving a GLead some info they can use to help protect one of their members. It's easy to do, too! You simply correct people who misgender that person and kick the transphobic ones. I know, as I've done this in one WoW Guild, one Wildstar guild, and one fucking 4chan disocrd server of all things.  
---
Waving it in your face would be more like... "Hey, unrelated to the topic at hand but I want you to know that I have cancer so my life is hard because I have cancer! I know it doesn't relate, but I have cancer!", "Man, this dungeon is really hard for me. It must be due to all the chemo treatments because I have cancer." "Hey guys, can you not be so mean to me? I'm sensitive because I have cancer.", "Guys, did I mention that I have cancer? I will now type out a wall of text on how hard it is for me to have cancer and how tragic my life is because I have cancer.", "Hey, that's a nice epic you got there. Sure would be nice if you gave it to me, as I have cancer and could die."

No. You haven't had a chance for months, now. Unless you are a streamer with 10,000+ followers, you aren't getting in.
---
That's a good idea. I'll do that more often. Thanks
---
I'm finding it so hard to wait!! Love your handwriting and drawing, gorgeous
---
Or 300+ hours remaining to be productive before you're throwing away your life for 2 years.
---
There are 13 servers, none will be dead it's just relative.
---
All the servers that are full have been "claimed" by a group of people or just have popular names (like Illidan from vanilla).
---
This is why blizzard chose this amount of servers, if one becomes too populated they will offer transfers to the lower populated ones and do their best to balance it. All servers will be packed with players.
---
I proudly played Ret when I was 12, mostly cause I didn’t know any better... I shall proudly play Ret at 27, because I can’t wait to be that chad walking around with one judgment piece.
---
If you ever want to stealth, your options are a NE or a druid.
---
If you want to tank dungeons, you'll be fine as either.
---
If you never want to be told to heal, you know your choice.
---
Otherwise just play whatever you think will be the most fun.
---
It seems like all enemy castbars doesn't work that well due to some sort of restriction to classic's API (They can't seem to distinguish ranks with different cast times, so it only takes a few chain casts of lowrank spells to completely throw the castbar off.) Dot timers are also very faulty because that info is restricted on classic (even though it wasn't in vanilla)
---
This isn't the same addon, but I've been using Kiwiplates, it's the only nameplate addon i could find that showed castbars and debuffs on nameplates. The castbar ican get thrown off at low levels and the debuffs don't have timers but it's the best i could find.

According to the census, Fairbanks looks fine.  Also, playing in the least populated faction has the advantage of faster BG queues

I'm in ultimate purgatory. I don't have and cannot afford bfa right now, so I have 3 110's and more than that in 100's. It all feels pretty pointless but I want to play. Classic is the only thing keeping me excited.

Yes

If that's the case, I've never heard of it actually enforced on my server at least.

Either way that has no bearing on actually playing the game and enjoying PvP and raids

No.

I'd rather have 1000 threads about relevant issues rather than knowing which char names /u/WoWfreak took.

Have a megathread about it if it's so relevant, so people who care can spend 10 hours reading random char names if they want to.

I feel like this one is less useful. Lots of people just logged in to get their settings, macros, and addons setup without caring about leveling or even class at all.

this is awesome op. nice job.

I can't wait to level a warrior and actually make it a long process. Level mining and blacksmithing together while leveling, make my own gear, cook my own food, make my own bandages, and actually relive the world back like I did in 2005
---
hunters are literally the most disruptive class with a gigantic amount of cc on different dr's on retail lol
---
My first 1-60 was a warrior and my 2nd was a pally. When Nostalrius came out I realized I could never have leveled a warrior if I had known how amazing other classes could level. All of the people saying they're going to play Warrior give it a month and see how many even hit 60. Once they do wait until everyone has to tank, depends on their peers to farm damn near anything etc.
---
NA reading comprehension OMEGALUL
---
I came here to say Tool guess I can leave
---
What class exactly was Kenny? XD
---
You assume no one else is trying to reserve names now.  I'm sure others are and they just didn't want to during the rush.
---
so you didnt get jib on one of the servers. just know that i would be the guy that would never call you "jib" when you played on "Jiib" and i would always make the I's in "JiiB" really long, just so you know you arent actually called "Jib".
---
you need to learn that when you dont get your preferred name, adding a character or an alt character is not the same.
---
Now you jump on Limewire/Morpheus and download every Disturbed, Drowning Pool, Saliva, SOiL, and Linkin Park song for literally any videos you make.

you sound pretty insecure about yourself lmao

I’m here for the scraps!

Oh wow! Well, I'll be on Herod Alliance as well. Hope to see you around, friend!

People have called me Bubz online for 15 years now, cause my warriors name was Bubblez back in the day.  Got both of those.  Go with your gut, man!  What means something to you!

Didn't they already fix the majority? I haven't kept up on bugs this month so idk what's still left.
---
I know a dude with a black pally that was named neegadin. Still has it in retail to this day.

You fucking newbs.  CS beta 7 was best CS.

That the best you've got? Lol.
---
That's disappointing...
---
Herod will be fine lol
---
Heck yeah Blood Sailors unite! So excited to jump into classic. For the Horde.
---
I look forward to people twisting their brains to find a way to complain about this.
---
Alts man, once you start you cant stop
---
After doing some testing, I think you may be right :/. I'm trying to find an add-on that measures exact units for further confirmation.
---
Thank you for agreeing with me, fellow redditor.
---
All three of those are perfectly valid criticisms and, frankly, just true.
---
Might add that the game being streamed robs no-beta-plebs of the shared experience. There would have been fewer GoT viewing parties if half of the people had already been shown the damn thing 2 months prior.
---
We don't get to re-experience Vanilla together, we get to go second.
---
Yop. Majority of them are morons who are so eager to try and prove they can dps (and fail miserably) that they forget that have anything other than seal of command and judgment.
---
Mana issues are biggest for Ret.
---
However, they can still buff and rez the healer if needed.
---
Pretty much. I quit my job for launch so I sit around and do nothing now.  I frequently visit my parents and help them with handywork around the house a lot now.  I figure it's the least I can do since I won't be seeing them for the next few months.
---
People like having a unique name or name that they've been using for a decade for themselves too. It's pathetic you think they want it so they get whispers about it lmao. 
---
To most people it's clearly more important to have a name. I know other people having a different opinion is shocking but I explained how your small character face is a much less important factor for multiple reasons.
---
&gt;while looking hideous.
---
I guess you keep missing the part where you play zoomed out with a helmet.
---
Your wish is granted.
---
Awesome hand lettering! I did something similar for BfA only to be met with crushing disappointment. On the bright side, I now save $15 a month!
---
I did but I mostly stuck to the basement of that inn in Goldshire... it was pretty chill.
---
Shot for my hunter and Dusk for either a rogue or a warlock.
---
By "us" you mean "some of us"
---
Lots of Linkin Park and early 2000s nu metal
---
Are you horde or alliance
---
I share this sentiment. Literally hitler. Before you know it they'll be putting the rest of us in gas chambers.
---
Yep, made Skyrim unplayable for me. As awesome as Breath of the Wild was, I think it was their approach to scaling via weapon durability that was the most impressive part of the game. Such an amazing solution to a problem that plagued the whole sandbox genre.
---
Just because someone dosent call you a girl when they dont know your gender dosent mean they dont respect You. I subconciously assume anyone i play with is a man until i have reason to think otherwise and I may say dude or hey boys or what ever, but is that really such a problem? I dont do it to disrespect anyone it is just how the human brain works.
---
If i ask "hey dude wanna do Scholo?" is that really such a big deal that you have to correct me and tell me you are a girl? It is not ment in disrespect, there is just a very good chance that it is actually a dude im asking.
---
Well the jumping thing has always existed in wow, that is why you don't jump out of fire or other boss mechanics. The position not updating while moving in a straight line sounds like a bug to me, which either way I did not experience in my testing. Also the mobs shouldn't be moving when you are moving if you use my strat which would solve the client side vs server side movement issue.
---
Super easy, barely an inconvenience!
---
whoah
---
I’m not raiding, min max players will call me stupid, in fact most players will call me stupid....
---
Either way, they won’t scare me off.
---
Add % of total pop on each server under #'s of responses for server please.

---
Not until the PVP phase.
---
The seal looks a bit strange.  Looks like a cross between a bat, a seal, and a scrotum.
---
Warlock. I used to keyboard turn in vanilla and I was constantly wrecking as a lock. So easy. Dots, deathcoil,  fear while deathcoil is going,  shadowbolt spam till death.
---
I don't think so. They changed the category recently. That being said, streamers using the tags would be enough.
---
LMAO
---
Alliance if you don't want to be yelled at.  
---
Horde if you actually want to have fun and not talk to a bunch of sauced out stay at home moms.
---
Huh.
---
That would be locked. Full means, you can but expect ques ontop of layering.
---
The main issue in a dungeon is lack of CC and interrupts really.
---
But that will depend on your comp.
---
Make a Night Elf, go kill people in Mulgore.

The problem isn't that 100% of players are streamers, the problem is that 100% of streamers are players. It's not a random sampling of people. They very deliberately invited streamers. You had a higher probability of being invited to the beta as a streamer than you did as a normal person, and that's, by its very definition, unfair.
---
How about xxLeGoLaSxx
---
Except for the “and not a beta” part. 
---
There is nothing mutually exclusive about serving marketing and QA purpose at the same time.
---
It's fucking hilarious, this will be a great source of entertainment for the night.
---
2.4.2, not even the final form ;o
---
your character resets every expansion. no one but like 1% of people will not play because they dont have their achievements or transmog in a new game.
---
I’m the one who knocks.
---
Lf Dennis on arugal
---
&gt;not true. Stop lying.
---
Lying? When two servers get merged, who on those servers are not merged?
---
&gt;And you can get invited by another player into another layer in the beta
---
As long as you're not on later cooldown.
---
yeah ofcourse, take it as you will, I just thought i'd post them incase anyone is interested :)
---
To be fair, they said the stress test was only going to be up until friday....
---
The hype is real!
---
let's be real, Pagle Allies don't care how much Horde there is
---
Feel bad for whatever server your going to , they defiantly got the better person on their side...
---
I think you're a pretty bad judge of character unfortunately then. Sodapoppin isn't even my favorite streamer by any means, part of the reason for that is that he's a actually a bit too tame in my opinion lol. If you watch other streamers you'll understand that he's FAR from a narcissist, compared to most he's just a pretty normal, kind of awkward dude.
---
Because in your very first comment You said i obviously didnt Face any problems online because im a white male, which is a stupid thing to assume and say. People find any reason to be vile to online strangers, happens to White males just as it happens to anyone else.
---
You have been condesending and acting like anyone elses problems is irrelevant compared to your, and none wants to deal with people like that. Im sorry You have your problems, but im done talking to you, cause you are really annoying and it has absolutly nothing to do with whatever problems you have, it is not how You act.
---
&gt; Well the jumping thing has always existed in wow
---
&gt; The position not updating while moving in a straight line sounds like a bug to me
---
These are the same thing.  Your position does not update when you jump.
---
It makes sense since the other Eastern PvE server is Mankrik. Seems a lot of horde would go there, since a horde quest reference.
---
go on,.....
---
All I have to do to win is Seal of Casino and roll on the Valor shoulders.
---
Lol what do you mean not be yelled at? And are they Cougars in my area that want to meet me?
---
Why tailoring for pvp server? Does it offer any advantage or just good solo profession?
---
Luckily ventrilo has supported opus for a while and is just as good as the competition sound quality wise.
---
A lot of people will not act super cheery and friendly. A lot of people will not accept any spec into their group; they'll roll need on the blacksmithing pattern worth 400g. They'll tag your mob and they'll steal your chest.
---
They did it then and they sure as hell are going to do it now.
---
Every time I Tank a dungeon and out dps one of our group members, their class is hereby forbidden from DPSing. The only class that this applies to is Paladin.
---
full just means there is a queue, can make a character wherever you want.
---
Would love to have you! It will be a great experience!
---
Arent starting zones safe zones or is the starting zone only considered the village area you spawn at?
---
Yeah you can
---
It's only the beta. You should be able to create a character but you will be in a queue to enter the world
---
If they don’t, everyone will just use the #classic tag. But based on how shit Twitch has been lately, I’m not sure how relevant they’ll be in a year. Allowing other streamers to play on Ninja’s channel page because he switched to Microsoft’s Mixer and not banning Alinity was the last straw for a lot of folks.
---
Ret paladins can’t raid.

Wonder what cities he has to go to in order to connect the fliggt paths 🤔

"Fine" is subjective. If it is fine for you, then have at it.

You mention tailoring and a few others as gold sinks but it's funny that you don't include enchanting on that list. The amount of greens and blues you have to disenchant sucks gold directly from your pocket in the form of lost vendor money. DE all of your dungeon gear you out level, useless items from quests, and tailoring crafted gear and I guarantee you will be 50 before you can afford a mount and a while after 60 for epic riding.
---
Tailoring can sell bags and moon cloth on cool down but it's not significant. Enchanting can sell DE mats at max level but that assumes you are getting blues consistently to DE. They both are a huge gold sink to level up especially together with a small payoff at max level. Excluding the tailoring gear, which is great but not gold efficient.
---
The best money makers like OP said are gathering professions. Alchemy is a pretty good money maker from flasks and potions. So many are useful at max level that it's easy to find something in demand on your server. And it requires much less of a sink as you level. I would go herbalism/alchemy if you aren't considering engineering/mining.

\[Did you all see this leaked video of a meeting between the top Fairbanks guild leaders?\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moWe3rk7LzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moWe3rk7LzQ))

Is it true everyone will have their preferred pronouns added to their names on the Fairbanks server?
---
Calling it now, Fairbanks guilds will be the last to cross all major in-game milestones across all servers.
---
Well if you look at the level range for Ungoro in retail, it's minimum level is 40, so yes, it would scale *up* to 48 if you are level 48.
---
During the stress test I played both Horde and Alliance, the general chat on Alliance was mostly people ignoring the random ranting/trolling that happened and having fun conversations about old WoW/Current WoW. There was even a Korean kid that turned up and had a chat with everyone, apparently the Classic servers aren't very popular over there and EU has the best ping for him.
---
Horde was mostly people trolling each other and laughing about it. Not much rage, but very Twitch Chat. There were also a couple of people mostly just trying to ask questions about quests, and a few other people trying to answer. But the spam of random stuff was a bit too much.
---
It was good humour, both sides, in terms of chat... But I would consider Alliance is probably more new player friendly. I'd also remind you that, though Mulgore is beautiful (it really is) it's only one zone.
---
I got Mankrik on Mankrik. Can't wait to return to the Barrens and be reunited with my wife after all these years.

I wouldnt personally even if you can.... not if you mind one of them potentially being randomly deleted.

Exactly, you are absolutely right. The default terms are skewed one way and that's totally fine. If the person on the other end wants to correct you however, I believe that you should respect their decision, especially if you want to play with them in the future. Actively ignoring their request is what causes the drama and is just rude
---
Yeah sadly but I could always come back and fish mine or any other profession right?
---
yup
---
Yes because a paladin is only providing dps to your group.
---
The longer I have to wait the less excited I get and the more I get to a "eh" opinion/excitement.
---
I can see the reasoning here though. Reopening the beta does hint, to me at least, that something isn't going to plan otherwise they would have stuck to the schedule. First they postponed a stress test and then now they reopened the beta.

Yup.  Whitemane is basically the klan server at this point.  Faerlina is for the streamers.  Thalnos is Br.   And Herod is going to be overpopulated, and filled to the Brim with tryhard assholes.

I think I got lost on the way to /r/classicwow and ended up in /wowpsg/
---
:( I think so.  I used to run a low level undead mage around goldshire on a PVP server, but I can't remember if I had to let them attack me first.
---
***WAAAAH!!!!***
---
Surprising given that at 15, there was a constant shortage of Warriors for deadmines groups. Usually not only would my group be looking for a tank, but we were competing with a second group that was also looking for a tank. 
---
Roll warrior! You will be very popular in Classic's dungeon leveling meta.
---
You dont Need all auras at once. And you bring more than 5 healers to a 40m raid.
---
Usually the sweet spot is 4 paladins and you would be fine bringing 4 hpalas.
---
Both European English PVP realms are now full and both the PVP and PVE German realms are full. Don't know what all the servers are looking like in the US but if they don't open more in Europe the situation is going to be fucked. If PVP players end up swarming to the RPPVP one it will wreck it for the RP players and if they end up on the PVE one I don't expect they will be happy and imagine the chat will be nothing but bitching from them.
---
Ok here’s the skinny, mages are the Top magic damage class followed by warlock, both of them have 1 button rotations in raids (frost bolt / shadow bolt)  both have a lot of crowd control (freeze / polymorph / fear) with mages a bit more than warlocks.  
---
Mages get free food/water with conjure food skill and  have the ability to teleport to any city of your faction and can open portals to let party members teleport aswell. 
---
Warlock on the other hand have the ability to summon players tonyour current location(requires 2 people + you).  Summoning requires a soul stone which can be acquired from a skill “drain soul” if used when the target “that would offer experience(can’t be  super low level)” . You will be EXPECTED to farm a minimum of 40 soulshards before every raid to help summon players that are slacking or log in late.
---
Paladins are the Jack of all trades / master of only being able to heal. Most people in this 15 year old game have the mindset that Paladins only role at lvl 60 is to heal.
---
Paladins CAN dps as retribution but they are the absolute worst dps in the game(only slightly higher than a healing spec Druid in cat form). Paladins CAN tank and are actually the best 5 man Aoe thank in the game, BUT they do not have a taunt and none of the Raid Tier gear is optimized for tanking. Which means you will be useing a mishmash of BoE Stam and defense gear. None of which have intellect, so you will run out of mana very quickly and be drinking more often than the healer. They also do not have a TAUNT.
---
On the flip side holy Paladins are the absolute best tank / single target Healers in the game and almost never run out of mana, they have extremely strong Buffs and auras. Pair a Hpaladin with a warrior and you two become absolute killing machines.
---
I will take a video of me on my nightsaber pre-60 and you can downvote that for how stupid it will make you look
---
I am simply a public servant.

Nah man, it's all about that x-fire.

It's still the most popular streaming site, it basically enjoys a monopoly currently. Mixer seems to be the only "sufficient" competetion and even calling the sufficient is very generous, think they'll remain #1 for at least another 3-5 years

OP paid $120 to reserve names and didn’t get a single good one. lol.
---
Do you mind explaining how you not getting invited is a "perfectly valid criticisms"?
---
Yeah i havent got very far on BFA and played a Blood Elf and Undead so i dont know a lot about oter zones and kinda glad I dont so I have places that are still a mystery to me

Go to your skate shop and get a blank board, that's what I always did

To be honest I'll probably invite anything that isn't a fucking oomkin.

Fuck fucking oomkins.

Herod is said to have between 50-100k
---
I made rank 11 and quit my grind after my internet went out for several days.
---
Quite literally, in Hollywood, California in like 2006 my entire area lost internet connectivity for three or four days. It happened one night while I was heal-botting for my group in Warsong Gulch, and I'll never forget it.
---
We called the ISP and they barely acknowledged what was happening which was frustrating as hell, and when my internet came back up, I didn't want to make up for lost time and just settled for Lieutenant General.
---
Even the grind to 11 was a serious time commitment, at least with the old server pops. I'm not sure I could pull that off again.
---
There will certainly be weekend guilds. The average are of classic wow players is close to 30, if I remember the last census right. Everyone will be working during the week.

Get Consecration ASAP. It really helps with damage and is aoe too. Might want to use blessing of wisdom though.

I played the last stress test, I got more declines on people i invited to party that were killing same thing as me. Maybe i should ask first? I figured helping a person with their kill then an invite is kinda self explanatory? I just hope its different on launch. I imagine 5 man groups in starting zones wrecking stuff!!

Well that pretty much answers my question. Still not sure why they chose to block "low" when they can block blow or the full word

You still don't get it, which is comprehensible since you defend ret pallies, but I'll repeat for you... slowly.
---
Any class and spec in the game: most were competent. With dps'ers having the highest ratio of morons in the game in terms of morons by % of the players. 
---
Ret pallies: every single one I've ever met are mouth breathers.
---
Kapiche?
---
For the buffs, and if that person reliably fills the raid slot they'll be invited.
---
Unfair? Lol...
---
You must have known that the names you want might be taken. And you knew that the game will not come out for another 2 weeks. The only thing unfair here is you crying like a baby. Hurts my eyes.
---
I have had a lot of fun with the demon hunter class though. Legion was also a great time imo
---
See you on the other side :)
---
For what? To curb some hype? They don’t want to give early access to everyone. That would potentially cut some of their profits and that’s just not smart from a business perspective.
---
Skarm seems to be more about tanking theorycraft and dispelling some of the stigmas against Druid tanks.  He is one the extreme few streamers I wouldn’t mind playing alongside.
---
People aren't asking for updated mechanics or balance changes, just graphical improvements.
---
i know its pretty old but with so many new faces , and classic release in 13 days ,i did not want anyone to miss the chance to download  lots of porn !

Are you trolling or do you actually not understand?

I am on both the RP and RPPvP server in the EU. I'd appreciate if it stuck around Medium and didn't move. I cherish small, tight-knit RP communities more than choke-full servers.

Idiot
---
Go check out an episode of Letterkenny then get back to me. I'm quoting an adult show
---
lets all welcome op to classic wow! since no one knows who he is
---
Then why are you trying to trade them?
---
Streamers only. Please return to your regularly scheduled shit posting.
---
Nah.
---
Because there is such thing as an LGBTQ community? Well you learn new stuff everyday.
---
Okay, I will guide you through it step by step.
---
First of all, I indeed didn't get invited. So that part is true.
---
Secondly, I like Vanilla WoW. 
---
And that's already the entire conundrum
---
I am playing horde (for the first time) on Pagle!
---
omg your handwriting is beautiful 🥺
---
I'd say blizzard have a good amount of say in this decision, and I doubt they would want sperate categories, they want classic tone a gateway bring new and old players to retail and the WoW subscription in general. They dont want two separate communities, otherwise theyd have a different subscription for each game. It all comes down to business decisions.
---
so why would you put one-Herod in the title and then "one-Herod" in quotation marks you baboon
---
[Look at the old NA server list](https://i.imgur.com/VeCUTyO.png) - the people thinking there are going to be any empty servers is so silly.
---
*Groan*
---
tailoring is required for raid progression, some of the best in slot gear til T3 or T4 is from tailoring.
---
Hahahaha this is hysterical.
---
I absolutly agree, but at the same time it depends alot on the way you correct that person. Many people will correct them in a way that kinda assume that person did it on purpose to be rude or something, when it was most likely just an honest mistake or the person just didnt know.
---
I was a coach for a esport team playing cs, they were 9 boys and 1 girl and I would often say Things like "nice boys!" or "listen up boys" or whatever and I absolutly ment no disrespect, but you are just used to gamning being mostly boys or you see like 5 og the boys and thats what your first instinct is to say. The Girl was one of the best and I spend a lot of time trying to make her better and so on, so i knew She was there and it wasnt because She didnt matter or anythng, it's just an honest mistake. But she was very cool about it and didnt felt the need to correct me, because she knew what it was and didnt assume it did it to be rude or something.
---
My point is just that if you are a Girl, trans or whatever that decides to be a part of a World that is by far mostly men, expect us to make mistakes like that, we dont do it to be rude, but we are by no means perfect either, so we will make mistakes. And the yes there will be the ocasionally aashole, but none of us can do anything about that and sadly whats how the world is.
---
Haha hope i bump into you!! 
---
But for real I'll probably do some of the same :)
---
The point is, the guild I was sitting in was at that point of socializing. We were already having quite private conversations in the Discord, talking about our jobs, about where we're living, about our other hobbies, what have you.
---
When I first joined voice, it was with the Guild Lead and his best friend. His best friend excused himself rather quickly, the Guild lead stayed for a bit until he just ghosted out. I did bring up the "masculine voice is because of way too much vaping and smoking" excuse (which isn't a lie to be honest) already at that point.
---
Like still, most people didn't care, everyone was chill, but I was at that point where I started feeling comfortable opening myself. I was at that point where I thought at least the guild lead got my back if for some reason I might blurt out that I'm trans, or that someone might figure it out.
---
Questions like these are being asked in guilds, even rather soon, especially if you're the sort of people who are joining voice if there's some activity, just to hang out a bit with other folks and share the hype for classic.
---
So I had to prepare for a question like this coming up. Which I did by probing the waters a bit and just checking in with the Guild lead, so atleast he knows already.
---
The rest is history.
---
So yeah, I'd really love taking your advice, but it's just not useful unfortunately. It would be great if things were this easy, but they aren't.
---
1st thing 1st, buy a tabard.
---
WAIT who the hell isnt using PTT?

Well yeah that's he point.
---
Scarab Lord isn't meant to be a participation trophy.
---
I'm curious what differed from private servers, other than the scaling of dmg/health generally
---
&gt; perfectly valid criticisms
---
Yea that doesn't check out
---
I wonder what you're going to play /s
---
The whole porn thing was blown out of proportion by ninja himself. Twitch caught, and stopped it, before ninja himself even knew. Porn is, has been and always will be against TOS. It was a mistake in the selection algorithm that it even showed up because it wasn’t playing the same game, but in their defense the stream had fortnite tags in the title so it got “confused.”
---
I was watching the vod and whenever the enemy caster would stop cast the bar would disappear, looked real accurate. But thanks for the help guys.
---
Hahaha. What an amazing crossover.
---
Agreed.
---
As a returning player that played since beta I haven't played in the past six years I have to absolutely agree that I was blown away by how atrocious the new scaling system is. I don't even understand how it really works when I'm playing with a friend that's level 111 and I'm level 120 and we're both fighting the same mob and then mom says to him it's level 111 and it says me is level 120 and we're both dealing equal amounts of damage to it 2 our level.

I do this to buffer 8k VR porn on the way home from work
---
Imma give Herod a genuine “go”. According to others all PvP servers are now “High” population. If it feels like shit after awhile I’ll likely cancel my subscription or roll another class on another server. Let’s roll Herod, bud!
---
It does tho
---
Nothing beats Ventrilo's Bitchin Betty saying everyone's name as they pop in. My tanks name was Tankality and it would always pronounce it Tanka-LIT-y.

---
You can still roll on Herod. Full doesn't mean locked.
---
Have me banned for what? You telling me about my own story went? You being rude af the entire time telling me what happened? I didn't come to you and tell you how your story was wrong because I'm ignorant that was you. So stop harassing me about my own story

Lol this.
---
I remember getting into Cake while playing vanilla during high school, so Prolonging the Magic will be on heavy rotation.
---
I did this during vanilla/BC when I was in middle/highschool to practice spanish and it actually helped a lot. Minus picking up slang I couldnt use in class.
---
I definitely wanna play on a majority spanish server again.
---
why would it be bro? do you get naxx gear at level 10? no

They're fine in raids too tbh

But like... one of them and no more lmfao
---
is Classic going to be updated like a WoW2
---
Where there's a will there's a way 😂
---
And thotbott.....
---
You underestimate their power
---
I’m playing “solo”, as in I’m not currently affiliated with a guild and none of my RL friends are coming to classic.  That said I plan to play with tons of people and make lots of new friends ideally.  I’m going to try and tank ever single dungeon at the appropriate level for them at least once, so that should keep me meeting new people even if I start off alone.
---
3-5 years is a LONG time on the internet. Larger companies than Twitch have come into and then lost the spot in less time. Twitch entirely depends on their streamers for everything. If they piss off enough of them, their domination will end.
---
You see that poster in the back.  That's Balance druids.
---
I mean it depends some of the bugs were present in Vanilla and so those have remained unchanged.
---
I never felt the dailies were bad in WTLK especially when you compare it to the mess its now. You actually need addons to track them. There were only really a handful of them back in WTLK - The Argent Tournament, The couple of other factions.
---
When your drawing is better than the in game model. Why the hell aren't the graphics updates and newer models in classic wow?
---

---
He dears to think outside the box
---
Uh.  Gnome racial mounts?  What's wrong with felsteed?  It's one of the coolest mounts in classic
---
Game isn't even playable and already calling out servers for being inbalanced/low population
---
&gt; Layering during phase 1 only.
---
Do you really believe that? With so few servers I doubt population will drop enough for Blizzard to remove layering after P1.
---
Better then ret pallies.  And you have healing, melee and ranged dps options.  Raids like Windfury.
---
Right? You'd think streamers gassed some of their family members with the way people foam at the mouth over them.
---
This was amazing work! Literally teared up..I thought I didn't want this, but holy shit I think I do.
---
No, just memes.  a lot of funny stuff will happen on the server im sure.
---
That's cuz they were still leveling.
---
He has.
---
No they will just have server queues and offer free transfer to the lower population realms.
---
I was excited for it initially because it would allow me to play through a single zones quests all the way without quests/mobs going grey.
---
What I didn't quite anticipate was how it would lose that sense of scale (ironically) and danger. As you say, once you hit the minimum level to go somewhere (which you *have* to anyway as the quests won't even start) every level thereafter is the exact same difficulty as the one before. That and no new talents/spells regularly makes levelling pretty lackluster.
---
It's like WOO DING oh wait that just means a freshly empty bar of exp to fill oh joy...
---
There’s something akin to sensory overload with retail WoW that I really dislike but I feel like they would have had to take the game in a very different direction to avoid. There’s just a complete lack of visual harmony wherever you see players. Stand in Stormwind, above you is a gnome flying an undead frostwyrm. Next to you is a worgen werewolf riding a crate covered dinosaur. Turn around and there’s pirates riding space robots and other people on frogs while some people are flying on sky rays and other people are on helicopters.
---
Just get a bg bot. I used to run bots in battlegrounds all the time. I came home once and saw my rogue running around with all red gear lmao. Apologies to anyone who actually does bgs manually.
---

No still useful but you can find better gear in high-end dungeons and raids where the Bloodvine shit it super good even in the end game. Useful but replaceable.

Thalnos is shaping up to be the best, most balanced and most inclusive server. I can't wait to be part of the community!
---
&gt;  I don’t see any better solution so it doesn’t really matter.
---
The better solution is to simply make more servers. Instead of making 3 servers with 10 layers each, make 30 servers with no layering.
---
&gt; But you’re paying for retail and getting classic “for free!”
---
It’s how they’ll justify it.

Who the fuck was dumb enough to actually like scaling and think it’s good!? No wonder retail is garbage.
---
In your fantasy
---
&gt;Every gets server merged too.
---
ah, you meant **everyone**. True but it's just a few and as soon as they get merged the game continued as it was. No sharding or anything
---
The thing is that streaming changes the dynamic of the grind. The 40 hours u/Weaponsonline had to put into work is no longer as applicable. If you have decent streamer numbers, going for the grind will likely give you a boost if you're actually good at pvp. Additionally, you aren't as alone, since you have chat. It's still insane, but streaming makes it so you don't necessarily self-destruct in the process.
---
What they really mean is, streamer advertisements have been activated.

Most of the bosses in MC don't have enrage timers, or have really long (10 minute) enrage timers; with Naxx gear it would be pretty easy to clear MC with just 10-15 people.

---
Probably because you surround yourself with mouth breathers. I've met several good Ret Pallies.
---
&gt;Any class and spec in the game: most were competent.
---
This is such a bs statement especially if you've played in Vanilla. Hunters were the class, doesn't matter the spec, with the most players that were least competent. The is no arguing about this fact.

DO NOT WANT
---
Well its also ridiculous to hate on "min-maxers" just because they advice people to pick one class/race over another or something like that. If I were looking for help or seeking advice I wouldn't want to hear "just play what you want, you'll be fine", because thats just stating the obvious. Of course one can play whatever they want, but if ones goal is to top meters or have an advantage in PvP I think its fair to let them know that some options are better than others.
---
&gt; Classic isn't vanilla, it's an "accurate" representation of vanilla.
---
......based on the actual fucking server code that was used in vanilla
---
are you seriously arguing that Classic is somehow going to be vastly different than retail vanilla / pservers to the point where it will shock and surprise people with how different it is? fucking lol
---
You're just grasping at straws with your "buh buh buht we DON'T KNOW FOR SURE!" crap. Shoo.
---
Have you familiarized yourself with the classic paladin mechanics?
---
The way seals and judgments worked mostly. 
---
Ret paladins are just bottom of the barrel. Prot pallies are unreliable as the have no direct single target taunt.
---
I was horde on retail vanilla and I never saw a paladin attack anything at max level. They were all healers.
---
You want Bonersauce? Cause I got Bonersauce for ya.
---
They could just......remove layering.
---
PSA: nobody gives a fuck about what you think either.
---
Hey man, I've been horde for 11 years, I don't think there's going to be any shortage of horde. I'm just telling it like it is. Horde are typically better pvpers though.
---
here I am playing on my shitty desk and my dell inspiron
---
What about Bonergarage?
---
Harambe we love you!

That's nuts, I had no idea!

So uhhh how much for a hunter version? :)
---
Just play a class of which fantasy you like. All of the other pieces will fall into place.
---
but the new TOOL album
---
They aren't going to release more servers with a medium and low pop pvp server.
---
On Whitemane, I got
---
Smite - Tauren warrior
---
Meat - watever
---
Int - undead mage
---
This is pure gold.
---
I don’t think it’s that deep, I actually do think he’s kinda cool after seeing some of his YouTube videos. He seems alpha online but it’s cause he’s probably a beta irl

US guild here: welcome! Keep em coming to scare away the chuds.

I’m paying for Classic and getting nothing for free. I’m not touching that trash.
---
Try this one
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/hunter-pets/
---
Deadthexy - whitemaine undead female
---
Randy was also a r tard.
---
Shadow.tech allows an under spec machine to play the game as the local hardware isn’t needed as much.
---
And you probably can because a lot of guilds will wrestle the roster boss.
---
*mind blown*
---
I'm in the scarley monastery with herod. I've got scarlet leggings, and ravager. BLADES OF LIGHT GIVE ME STRENGTH!!!!
---
While I agree Nost rocks I think it's better they left the name out. Maybe they will add an npc named Nostalrius later on :)
---
Some of the "increased mana regeneration" talents also require you to get the killing blow. If you intend on grouping with a priest with spirit tap, always let them get the killing blow on mobs when possible.
---
Faerlina, Whitemane, and Pagle have gone full too.
---
Nice!
---
*laughs in Rogue*
---
That was the plan all along
---
Nothing un-masculine about being a gaybro, bro.

 WoW Classic will launch with content up through the original Patch 1.2. A following update will move to Patch 1.3 and 1.4, including Dire Maul and world bosses like Doom Lord Kazzak. The next update after that will cover Patch 1.5 and 1.6 content, with the Blackwing Lair raid.
---
I’m waiting for Classic to have it’s own subscription.
---
Fairly positive this isn't 100% accurate. Towelliee is playing on Pagle, not Faerlina.
---
I got that reference.
---
Thalnos lowkey hype af
---
Yes, you dont need to write complicated scripts in classic since it is based on the new game engine.
---
Those name combos are awesome.
---
I have my hunter named Deez, followed by pet named Nuts.
---
On a side note i havent laughed this hard in a while reading all the names you guys/ gals putting up here :)
---
Gnome named chompsky.
---
Imagine someone popular being guaranteed to win the lottery every time.
---
Imagine your lottery analogy being really bad.
---
I played Horde all throughout retail.  I'm going Alliance this time around.
---
Poor guy, got so many accounts but lacked the creativity for even half way decent names (apart from unique, which I like, due to it's extreme irony in this case 😂)
---
Well, I guess, good luck with the trading mate!
---
Jesus, you’re so entitled.

wouldn't that be nice :)

Wow, I didn't even know that was a thing.  I know it's not my thing, but apparently, that's a thing.
---
It's all good, I bet you just dinged level 6, bud! :D
---
Sometimes I don't want to fight. Then I'll _try_ to run and hide, and enjoy the excitement and fear.
---
I prefer Teamspeak over discord. I wish Teamspeak 5 would hurry up and release to provide a little competition to discord so i could move away from it.
---
If you try to target jed from the entrance you wont find him, gotta walk further in, its all about how close the mobs are to you
---
So if I understand correctly, different skill ranks of Healthstone have their own cooldowns?
---
They’re easily detected now. Tech has caught up on blizzards end.
---
I'd say just make the current servers more powerful and raise caps
---
As far as classic goes, if you wanna get a quick grip on classes, look up platinumwows class guides. Otherwise the faction has gotta be based on who you plan to play with, if anyone, or if not, what mount do you like the best lol
---
This will be fun to do in AV just sick back waitin for cds then blow some1 up out of no where dam well knowing its pissin some1 off lol
---
Only 8 raid groups though 🤔.

The second I see it I'm sacrificing my VW so you better be up in my grill boii
---
Fairbanks.
---
Anytime I hear inclusive I know that I don't belong.
---
What do you have tasers coming out of your face or something?
---
Love the name and the spread!
---
zandalar. people say shazz has the spanish community but actually gole has more spanish people according to the spreadsheet. shazz has considerably more swedes. zandalar is the most english speaking pvp server in the eu
---
I usually dont farm and naturally have the gold for it around like 44-45
---
and STV is good to have FPs for the pvp right?
---
On nostalrius there was some deep state council that cycled the #1 spot. Everyone in the council agreed not to get over a certain amount of points to keep it a little less torturous and took turns.
---
yep- tried to go to my retail toons, bored, deleted retail and decided to just wait for classic
---
&gt; so i have to reroll on thalnos
---
Hope you speak Portuguese.
---
ah im dumb do you think queues are gonna be fucked on herod? like if im trying to raid am i gonna have to anticipate a queue i wonder
---
You don't want too many, they'll just end up ghosttowns
---
Someone also mentioned something about Paladins and PPM (procs per minute). Are there any pallies that would like to enlighten us?
---
Horde my dude, the good guys. ;)
---
Ah yes, must be the racists that did this, gosh darn white males
---
It’s ok for people to point out low-effort bullshit. You can’t honestly admit seeing the entire front page full of pics of names is interesting. Just admit yesterday and today on the subreddit sucked and move on.
---
Slob on my grob
---
Best friend was a druid in classic. While I haven't watched the entire thing, first 5 minutes has been entirely accurate so far.
---
That’s what I’ve tried explaining to him, literally begged him
---
Your graphics say Alliance, but your lighting says FOR THE HORDE!
---
Orc Lock on Herod named Guldang. Wanted Guldamn.
---
Mumble is the best and I wish it was one of those open source programs that got popular but it didn't. It's great quality and barely used any  bandwidth. Its simple and does it's job amazingly well.
---
From a Blizz perspective it does make sense. Not saying it's fair or whatever but it's a good approach from 2 sides:
---
1) The obvious, it generates hype.
---
2) The streamers will play more on average due to that being their job, the more play time the higher chance you'll see bugs. And not just the streamer but viewers as well.
---
But this is coming from someone who didn't really want beta since the chars are wiped. A lot of time investment for something that's going to be cleared off. Of course, that's my personal thoughts and everyone is different
---
Great room/setup though.
---
Nah I'll call my wife an hour before I get home to log me in m.
---
i have Peanutbutter on herod, willing to hear any offers
---
This should be on the front page of this sub. Instead we have awful means about name reservations.
---
I cackled
---
Unless you plan to make wands early on enchanting isn’t worth it. I plan on going two gathering and getting the good stuff at lvl 60. First priority is getting my mount at lvl 40. 40-60 will take a lot of time and getting that mount is super worth it.
---
I think I finally understand incels now.
---
How about just playing and not worrying about min maxing people?
---
Kekled*
---
Ahhhh BC, I miss that expac.
---
None of them are valid criticisms.
---
\#1 &amp; #2 promote the game whilst testing it. If you enjoy healthy populations and want this to succeed then why on earth would you criticize an effective way to market/broadcast the game before release?
---
\#3 It's a closed beta that deletes any progress you make. Not getting an invite is normal and probably saves   
---
 some people from burning out on a temporary server.
---
We had a French Canadian in our Vanilla guild. I wouldn’t exactly call his English fluent... we still loved him even though he refused to be anything but feral. Sherkal, wherever you are, hope you’re well!
---
It’s the best 30-40ish leveling zone. You’ll be goin there quite often
---
/r/instagramreality
---
Just trying to save people the trouble of thinking they can roll ret and balance druid and expect invites
---
Cause the na servers needs to fit through ;)
---
What's going on with the klan thing? I was gonna role on Whitemane because, well, thicc thighs save lives. Is it because the name is close to "whiteman"?
---
There won’t be enough people playing to worry about layering.
---
I've been horde since 2004, I've tried alliance back in cataclysm but I went back after I was bored at level 85. I just can't see myself leaving horde
---
[There's a button called print screen you can press to screenshot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHDHNMLNhA4)
---
Is there really no one to make ret good DPS?
---
Even if you play a perfect rotation and just do everything top tier.
---
Will other DPS classes just out DPS you with ease?
---
And you'd be right
---
ur mom.. hah i mean dying inside every day
---
literally every expansions set of zones does this
---
kill people trying to retreat and then use one of your escapes
---
or let enemy overextend based on limited information and turn the tide by adding an extra guy to your side
---
or just die
---
Ah okay cool, thanks for the info. And good call on the mount, I didn't even think about that. I always played Alliance before so I'm semi tempted to play Horde, but at the same time, my nostalgia comes from Alliance.
---
I hate how they never gave you the chance to earn the cat form through a class quest.
---
the rank 14 grind has nothing to do with skill but rather how much time you have to waste
---
It's one of only 5 NA pvp severs. Can't see it being a problem.
---
Nah they reopened it so streamers can do some free advertisement and some extra cash for themselves.
---
Also Two Weeks by either Grizzly Bear or All That Remains.
---
It was posted on youtube hours ago, clearly just troll attempt or really bad player describing life as a druid.  Feel free to believe it all more loot for the rest of us.
---
Who let the boss kill the healers
---
waaaa waaaa GM's stop Apes WAAAAH
---
Theres 3 servers that meet my criteria for type and location, two of them are full and one is populated by Portuguese and French Canadians lol
---
&gt; the new models look good enough  
---
No, they suck.  They are also not vanilla.
---
you're joking, but it's a one way street to eternal September
---
Sick.

Hilarious!

AUGUST 30TH BOYS
---
Hell, I'd run an empty spot before a Huntard
---
blizzard we NEEDED rp-pvp servers!
---
I member that post. Good times.
---
I think most people like enchanting to DE the greens from tailoring. 
---
But Im thinking maybe starting with mining/tailoring and then going engineer/tailor once I get high enough level and use the saved up ores to level engineering on the cheap. Thoughts?
---
Thing is this is a very different team, and you yourself stated where they listened directly to the community.  When was the last time the retail team did that?
---
You can't argue that voicing your opinion is good because they will listen then turn around and use past actions of a different blizz team to justify your current actions with this team.
---
You're assuming.  I'm sorry, but you're not going to convince me otherwise.  No one is kissing blizzards ass here but you're trying to convince me that everyone should act like the sky is falling at the slightest hint that something might not go their way.  That's incredibly childish in any context.  You're welcome to continue trying to convince me but I gotta call it quits here.  I can't use logic to get you out of a position you didn't use logic to get into.
---
He’s saying that while making a blog-type post that’s arguably less relevant to classic than people posting the names they reserved.
---
Sure ya will
---
People talking about what Pallies bring to a dungeon are missing the main point - No warrior is going to invite a dps Paladin to his 5 man because it halves his chance of loot. Why would a warrior take a pally to a 5 man when he can spend 14 more seconds looking for another dps class and basically double his loot odds?
---
Bug fixes = good
---
More exposure -&gt; bigger player base = good
---
More content during the wait = good
---
Closed beta -&gt; more time to get your RL shit sorted before the real game starts = good
---
Seems good.

For long fights however it helped to have more than one in your inventory.

Haha you make minimum wage. You're probably 37 and work on lawnmowers all day until it's time to come home, scam Blizzard, and yell at kids on Reddit. Sorry that you couldn't get names like "Fordtough" and "Bassmaster", but other rednecks were faster.

I will be playing the song from the southpark ep of wow none stop, LIVE TO WIN!!!

Ah okay that makes sense!

Oh dont start this shit again.

imagine playing ret and you havent yet found a cult of 39 other non-ret people to orbit around you and let you get gear.. it's already mid-august.. what are you doing with your life
---
Im sorry, is this some sort of alliance meme im too horde to understand?
---
Deadmines is 1 word. DM isn't even an abbreviation, let alone an acronym.
---
VC = big brain
---
DM = the image
---
They're not exactly wrong. Even the best games often have somewhere near a 70-90% attrition rate for various reasons. Whether that just be IRL issues/commitments, not liking the game, friends quit, etc.
---
Can you make me one for a hunter? My mind is running with ideas now.
---
I’m sure there will be bugs because there always is, but don’t think this is a red flag. They may as well use all the time they have. I think the stress test went well enough that I’m not super worried, but could be interesting when we get everyone on at once.
---
Seconded.
---
I hope so. Playing on p servers, the racist children were allowed to run rampant. Looking forward to actual moderation.
---
Yeh I like the simplicity. Discord is great tho if you take the few minutes to set it up and learn it, being able to hyperlink your channel in game and everyone click it and be in is so so nice.
---
I also cannot wait for the Iphone 11, a whole ONE better.
---
Your probably 12
---
Just wait until EA and Activision merge
---
Literally unplayable
---
[Have your friends ever played this for you?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rotkjJKAvFY)
---
Bliz has made it clear its easier to create more servers than merge existing ones. They won't introduce new servers until they're sure they're needed in the long run.
---
Will they lock the server if it gets too full?
---
I dom't like this photo causs I'm in it
---
Interesting, thanks!
---
You 3 listed questions are VERY specific about wow, stuff a "new" player shouldnt even worry about,  and just to note people  wont exclude for being new, they will exclude you for being an ass.

Thalnos seems like the most fun at parties
---
Well thanks for this not-dog crap contribution, Dostoevsky
---
"Canceling life" seems pretty final.
---
Whats this ilvl you speak of
---
Try Tekken 7 lol
---
Just stay Thalnos, you'll probably have a better time. Herod is going to be so insanely packed that it won't even be fun. There just won't be enough resources going around. The competition to world first rag will be insane, as people as to down him week 1. It's gonna be wild, which will most likely be a blast, but I want my classic experience to just be a little more lax than absolutely insane, so I'll be rolling on Thalnos. I think we're going to have a great community there.
---
Nobody wants druid loot but druids. Next you'll tell me rogues will want the str leather gear, or that shaman will take your crappy blues over their epics that make them worth anything at 60.
---
Isn't he a child molester?
---
Thats another reason I was thinking not to go Horde since its going to be my first why not have it also be the grandest
---
This was definitely my experience on Private Servers.  Even when it's a counter-class, if you get the opener, you have a great chance of winning.
---
Try it out guys, just go apeshit on everyone all the time and watch the ranks just happen!
---
1. More casual guilds will invariably have trouble getting a full 40 for the big raids, and a less-useful off-spec is better than an empty slot in the raid. While I can't speak for druids specifically, bigger and more hardcore guilds will choose raiders for positions based on class need and spec.
---
2. Addons are a personal thing. You'll most likely find out what you want by seeing what others do, and finding things in the interface that annoy you - they often have addon solutions. I like Bartender/Dominos to customize the appearance and layout of my action bars, a better quest log addon, anything at all that will show coordinates on the map/minimap, and a few others based on class and circumstance. 
---
3. No one will exclude you unless you're crazy annoying. Join a guild, have so fun (or quit the guild if you don't like it, and join another!), run some content, experience the game.
---
Grob could have the most stable numbers months after launch because world pvp guilds and rp guilds make fun for themselves and dont burn out on pve and BGs
---
You give it life!

Blizzard banned a lot of tmorph users a couple months back, I wouldn't dare running it tbh.

Low, medium, high.  Got it.  But what about when it says FULL.  Can you still create toons on that server for alts?   
---
What if I want to change the class of the name I reserved and delete the toon, and recreate it quickly on the full server.  Is this possible?
---
Even though I use discord. I have always been push to talk. Because fuck all that god damnrd feedback from constant open mics.

I'm so impressed...

I'm not sure of the exact numbers but you're right on a lot of things. Lava packs seem to be extremely nerfed, and the boss AI seems mad fucky though.

Imagine using up all brain cells spending talent points and having none left to find the print screen button...
---
Totally. There are certainly classes and builds better suited than others to be effective; but if I remember anything from Vanilla, it’s that the best guilds had the best players, not class compositions. 
---
Sure, your Mage might do more DPS than a Ret Pally, but the Mage does 0 DPS if he can’t manage his mana/threat and dies to the fire.
---
It ins;t like they forced an extra month out of us for this. We were all going to pay up by the 27th anyway
---
2. On talents looks a little monkaTOS I had to do a double take
---
You should prolly roll alliance since you didn’t immediately know the answer is always horde
---
Because fuck that guy amirite ladies
---
Yes, Decursive works just fine on old 1.12, but blizz decided not to reintroduce some of the more "bot like" features of the API for 1.13..
---
I think that change also made HealBot incompatible with classic 1.13
---
Your going to have to clear it with your guild if you want to do that. People have a lot of opinions on what classes to bring. Like wanting to take 8 mages into MC when it'll be hard to gear those mages, the warlocks, maybe the one shadow priest, and if anyone lets a druid play moonkin; that too.
---
3 - You won't be excluded. People will help you with questions. Unless you plan to speed level I'd recommend a more casual guild while you get to 60. You can always swap guilds after if your looking for a more dedicated experience by then.
---
amen, y'all addon freaks are cowards
---
Games have silly arbitrary rules that exist for no other reason to increase the pleasure in achieving your gold. Classic WoW felt more like a game. Modern WoW feels like little more than a time sink.
---
I’d hope so, seeing as osrs and rs3 are separate, even games on the same game client like League and TFT, and different versions like Pubg and Pugb mobile are separate as well.
---
But seeing as the thumbnail for the game category is Rag and not BFA then I’d assume they’ll combine then.
---
We out here 🍁
---
Misfits on repeat!
---
I've thought about playing BFA. Every time I do I see that you can pay to max level. I then immediately logout. No self-respecting RPG let's people pay to max level. No self-respecting PRGer plays a game that you can just pay to max level.
---
I can't wait until the Thex meme dies. It was never funny
---
Names are exclusive to the server, so it might be taken on another server. Also, we don't yet know if blizz will offer realm transfers for classic yet.
---
DM - Deadmines

DMN - Dire Maul North

DMT - Dire Maul Tribute

DME - Dire Maul East

---
I'm still going to play Feral Druid and no one's going to stop me.
---
I was a shadow priest from vanilla through Cata then quit. I’m not sure what to do this time. Roll priest again and heal dungeons/raids off spec or just make a damn warlock.  It will be horde either way so please someone convince me.
---
Tailoring and enchanting work really well together for sure. I did that on the stress test. But it felt too slow for me.
---
Don't avoid STV on a fresh server, you're really robbing yourself of one of the best times in your leveling journey.
---
Gaming and team sports have taught me the only part of your name that matters is the first unique syllable, anyway (and for games, make sure that first syllable is spelled phonetically).
---
If you’re in EU you have to wait until the 27th but Blizzard likes US more so they get it a day early on the 26th
---
All of the initial launch servers will be full. The ones who have less people at the moment will have lower queues which will attract more people. As a fellow Fairbanker I'm not worried.
---
I dont do pvp unless engaged on by someone else first, even then that doesn't happen much. PvP realms are how you get the full authentic vanilla feeling imo
---
I'm debating on getting a sub for name reservation, but since so many servers are listed as 'full' already I wonder what's the point anyways.
---
That's the only version I could find on GitHub. It's not updated for classic yet.

If that’s honestly the case, layering is never going away. 
---
10k alone is already mad crowded, that was on a pserver.
---
Most people don’t care about that. Only racists care about Brazilian players and only neckbeards who take themselves too seriously care about Twitch streamers. Props if you’re both

Happy cake day, fellow hordesman.
---
Engi can make a trinket to reflect the damage back to the mage too
---
Not just theory crafting but actually doing it too. He has lots of footage of him tanking all sorts of bosses as bear and fury. I have definitely chosen a druid main to try and learn from him
---
You're totally right.
---
How about play what you enjoy.  If you put in effort you'll still do decent enough damage as a druid polo plus bring some good support to the raid and LotP
---
Would also love an add-on like this (possibly things like gold from drops/quests and gold spent on flights/repairs/training too).
---
Threat meter and details. I also like Domino's.
---
You forgot all the good loot is reserved. Maybe you can have a blue if you're good.
---
Of course not. It was an ad created specially for you.
---
No death knights, monks and demon hunters! Fuck that shit!
---
That guys also had the name Pat on Herod.  So if you see Pat give him a Pat.
---
You can fix most of it, definitely not all of it.
---
I would just have stoped the music close to the end , and let the original vanilla cinematic music play.
---
The first time I played oblivion I chose monk class. This class had acrobatics and athletics as major skills which meant you literally just leveled up from running around. I managed to beat the game with this character, but the game was ridiculously tough towards the end. I remember almost rage quitting the game because those simple imp mobs in the oblivion realm constantly wrecked my shit.

My second playthrough I made a melee class where all the primary stats were combat oriented and holy shit the game was so much easier. I actually upped the game's difficulty because I was so used to things being so much harder.
---
Is there any somewhat legitimate way to check server populations?
---
how would paying 50$ give you a better name?
---
The highlight is a coincidence honestly. I just don't understand what the problem is. This is a name sharing thread, nothing else. Why can't you just let people enjoy something?
---
I keep getting told to buy that awful, awful game, Wolfenstien young blood. Good to see they are advertising tho.
---
Any old Synergy players on here?
---
Where'd you see that number from?
---
Yeah there weren't a lot of dos checks in vanilla. As long as the pull cleared before the healer ran out of mama, you were good. 
---
That being said I never once saw a eet paladin at level 60. We accepted that holy was the only legit spec. Or at least a hybrid.
---
Dude, I am not going to get my shit together and it has nothing to do with world of warcraft.
---
Oh boy release DKs. Now that was an OP class
---
Level a hunter alt if you want to make a ton of money and or learn to flip auction house items. Get super good at healing get big bags and run back to back stratholme runs for righteous orbs (they sell for a ton) and traveler's backpacks.
---
And
---
Tbh this ad is a bit bullshit, any names worth reserving are already gone. Might aswell sub the day prior to release at this point, doubt many new names will be reserved from now on until then.
---
I'll admit, I only rolled Holy Pally in WoTLK, where the modus operandi was stack int and spam Holy Light as quickly as you can click.
---
it wouldn't make sense to do that on the beta at all because the pop of any zone will not even reach one layer's population from the stress test.
---
I'm just going to avoid all douchebags whether they're casual or min/maxers I don't care. I only hang with cool people.
---
Play whatever class and roll you want to play. Classic is about creating your own adventure. You will find people willing to pug you into a 40 man raid.
---
Whole milk the true milk experience not that watered down crap.
---
Very clean thanks fam.
---
What is this "we" bullshit?
---
You are right in one thing, it is deeply satisfying to go and kill the horde of fanboys because it is like playing zombie mode.  But going after the actual streamers themselves?  Good luck.  The big ones will always have a geared escorts as the best players will get geared with the streamer.  Big streamers will get geared before everyone else.
---
I remember the Archeage alpha where we would hunt streamer guilds or larger zerg guilds like oran'thul.  That shit was so much fun.  Most of them were god horrid at the game and you get the great feeling of taking down a group far larger than your own.
---
All this streamer hate is getting old and really pathetic.  The community got what they wanted, so please stfu about it.
---
Or UO where you likely lost all your gear if you got ganked. I remember being like, "you can't rob people while they are standing at the bank? What sort of care bear shit is this?"
---
Pffft beta 5.2 was the best.
---
Feels so good to avoid all this server drama. And have great ping. And have raids in your timezone. And have people understand your accent. 
---
Did I miss anything?
---
so if its taken on a server then it could be avaliable on another?
---
I just called the FBI.  It's safe to say you're going to jail.
---
2 letters are allowed?
---
how much for that?
---
To be fair, 99% of people who even did hit 60 didn't ring the gong, and an entertaining story can be told by anyone.
---
&gt;french canadians
---
&gt;not xenophobic
---
Sit macros don't trigger reckoning. That was always a private server inaccuracy.
---
No I’m rolling thalnos too, these guys just don’t like that international guilds are coming to the server
---
I played on a RP-PVP back in 2005-8 and I found it to be a good experience for a solo player. I was in a guild as well, but we only did RP events once and a while so I had plenty of time to go out solo. I played a rogue and that pretty much allows you to go anywhere and do anything without too much fear of ganking and such, and allows you to RP the pvp aspect of the server as well, helping out lower level players and going after players in a hostile zone, but not just to gank but as part of your characters personality.
---
I just watched the episode today. It's free on comedycentral's website (for US at least)
---
That's just a straight up stupid idea for them.
---
If they did this; then I personally think that you, yes you, along with many others would be saying "It's so stupid. They could just let us keep our characters we made on the test realms!"
---
Also; you know that you're going to have to buy Classic, right?
---
Cool setup up. May I ask how you've set up your triple monitor setup? What sizes are the monitors and how have you set up the stand? I'm considering doing something similar with a corner desk.
---
You know what, I aint got nothing more to do for about 2 weeks. Ill take this post and anything that comes to make them go faster. Quality content.
---
I'm rolling a druid. Look forward to people telling me what I can and cannot do as a druid.
---
I named my Undead Priest Matthewmara
---
Grobmob
---
Dammit
---
I wanna switch servers now
---
I don't get it
---
Who is Goon Squad?
---
Make sure you pick a race that can actually cast spells
---
favourite band
---
Get off Reddit every once in a while and go outside
---
Too many low effort ones. Three names and people come up with stuff like bop, hop, and top? All that shows is how bad at naming things they are.
---
I'll find glory and pure joy in watching all the anti streamer guys get shit on by the streamers massive following, cry on reddit then leave the server
---
Been 60 with both myself.   Gotta say I hated druid compared to rogue.     Rogue has so much more fun with its utility/burst.      Druid pvp felt like I was being forced to heal alot.    And if u like healing that's fine I guess.  Not for me though
---
Yep full just means there may be a queue
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/HyperWrongLatteWoofer](https://clips.twitch.tv/HyperWrongLatteWoofer) is not what the community wants. this guy is a streamer that has openly stated that you fall in line with him or fanboys will be sent after you
---
I quit my job because it was shitty and I start classes in 2 weeks, so whem classoc comes I wont have time to play 😭😭😭
---
I just recovered my vanilla account as well, but all the characters were gone. I wonder if it’s possible to request they be returned?
---
Good news for you. Brazilians rarely speak Spanish either
---
If realms are truly full they become marked as 'locked'.  Only people who already have a character on a locked realm can create more there.
---
Depend on if it's a good reference or if they're just an edgelord. Someone calling themselves Fuhrer or Reich probably suck, but some named Goebbels or Hindenburg could be cool.
---
Great news!! Thalnos is going to be a great great server!!
---
World pvp it’s not really a contest, a medium geared Druid is gonna be damn near uncatchable and you’ll be able to get away and engage when you are ready and on your terms.  Also druids are quite efficient at grinding and farming (not the best but very consistent with very little to no down time.  Warriors (especially at the gear level you would expect based on your post) wouldn’t have it as easy in either regard.
---
Tanking 5 mans either is fine, tanking ZG or MC you might find anti-Druid bias, but you would be able to tank it or off tank it if you want, and healing a raid is always a possibility.    Warrior wins out here obviously for being the preferred and better tank, but Druid is viable.
---
BGs, as a warrior you’ll be limited to how much the healers love you, and since you said horde no blessing of freedom.  You can have fun as a mid geared warrior with support, but you won’t be an absolute wrecking ball with just some MC/ZG and pvp rep rewards/rank rewards.  I expect the AV exalted 2H the unstoppable force would be the easiest weapon for you to get your hands on there.  A druids experience here will be radically different.  You’ll have a lot of options on what you can do, but you won’t be slaughtering your way across the field.  You’ll either be support, flag carrier, or an annoyance able to stealth ninja.  The Druid pvp set gives enough int and spell power to drop heals when need be too.
---
Since ideally you’ll play more at 60 than leveling time, this may not matter, but druids are within the upper tiers of levelers and warriors are....painful.
---
Hope this helps some.
---
Rather than buffing every player, you throw up totems which requires a lot less maintenance
---
He's only saying that so he has less competition getting it again
---
The same thing with warlocks and soul gems, and that’s counting his own demon. A lot of people thinks it’s a bug when the demon last hits it and he doesn’t get a gem
---
See, this is the sort of thing I was thinking of too! Like, everyone says it's horrible so you kinda wanna prove em wrong.
---
Having a real normal one
---
How much would this cost me?
---
The best caster is the one you have the most fun playing.
---
Yes and no. It's where I originally heard the word, but the true definition holds true for a rogue
---
Regardless of the class you pick I'll own you.
---
So just pick a class that you think is fun
---
What I need to know is what kind of pen are you using besides what I can see from the pic.
---
Prolly Boomy
---
I'm a pretty new private server player but my friend used to raid back in '06 so I figured if I had the name someone might recognise and I could help him link up with them!
---
We have our raid channel in discord set to force PTT for this exact reason.
---
Like certain streamers.
---
Probably both and some additional big brain thing.
---
I don't mind healing but I want to avoid it if I can this time around. Rogue is not gonna be fun to level though!
---
And some people don’t enjoy it. That’s why there’s both.
---
No one man should have all that power.
---
I would 100% pay for an Undead Warlock version of this...
---
Questie and a shot clock timer if it's applicable to your class.
---
I actually played boomy in tbc
---
Yeah
---
I have the name Hog. Probably using it for a human warrior.
---
Also have Donte and Danté
---
There is still plenty of servers that are not full and you can still make characters on full servers, you would just expect a queue when trying to play.
---
wc lvl?
---
Nice work by the way.
---
I sent just money to my alt in the stress test and it took an hour, not sure why as every where I've seen it is supposed to be instant. Maybe because I typed a subject line? Not sure. Was definitely not instant.
---
Because my friend wants to play a Paladin. He can have all the 2 Handers and Mail, Leather (80% of his BiS), and Int Plate.
---
And Bears are a thing...
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

Upvote for periphery :)
---
I just think the plan changed and they did want to retest some things they fixed... like it says in their post.  Postponing the stress test allowed people to participate in that, name res and have time left over to cover part of launch.  Guessing they would announce if something was backed up or a lot of refunds will be happening.
---
Gee on Herod, please DM me
---
The one that always bugs me is the no summoning stones but I know Warlocks feel very different about that.
---
And I’d agree with you, and so would the peak of the player base. It’s probably somewhere around Wrath of the Lich King, we would say, right? Of course, marketing and word-of-mouth hype played into Wrath being the apex of WoW at 12m players. 
---
 No doubt it’s a slippery slope. But BFA feels like being in the gutter or whatever slope that is.
---
&gt;so you can't play with a friend if you're on cooldown?
---
It's unclear how exactly it works yet in that regard but I suspect the cooldown is a different length depending on what actions you've taken recently, it's known that the length can vary from 5 to 30 minutes. It also doesn't apply to entering instances.
---
TIL the beta consisted of 10 people. All those videos I saw must have been relics from super computers back in real vanila.
---
I don't think Blizzard "destroyed the game."  I think they entered the MMORPG market at the right time and did a lot of things just better than it's predecessors.  As a player that also lost interest in WotLK, I think that it was a combination of maybe the content and direction of the game wasn't as good, but also the competition in the market was also picking up, as other companies were learning from what Blizzard got right.
---
Also, I loved WoW, but I think playing for 3 or 4 years a fuck ton, is about as good as a shelf life as you can get in a video game.  For me the shelf life was met.  That being said, I'm excited to get back to vanilla no matter how much nostalgia factor is guiding me.
---
The inconvenience of accessing allied races encourages you to spend money on a race change.
---
Activision-Blizzard strikes again.
---
Yep, didn’t mean to imply it’s all theory and no practicality.  He’s inspired me with his videos to main a Druid as well.
---
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
---
From Quebec here, headed to Thalnos to reserve names with my friends today, we wanted an EST PvP server and preferred avoiding the 2 other full ones (queues are ugh). We speak both French and English so you shouldn't worry too much even if Thalnos seems to be branded as the "cultural communities server".
---
Looking forward to leveling with (or despite) you all!
---
Warlock or mage. I will have limited time to play, ill be going horde pvp. Some of the time ill be duoing with a druid. But mainly solo is what I'm thinking.
---
Looking for something that would be fulfilling in pvp and dungeons. Probably wont see raids till everyone is over geared for them anyways and it wont matter too much then.
---
Thinking warlock for easier time leveling with a pet and free 40 mount. Mage might be easier to jump in and just start playing without a lot of preperation beforehand.
---
Was maybe thinking a warrior or shaman, but i would prefer a pure dps class because of spec switching costs to have fun in different areas.
---
thanks my friend
---
finkle is einhorn
---
Thank you
---
The Strokes - Is This It (album) - I have a spotify playlist with \~100 songs from bands I used to listen to
---
That's some great points, thanks for sharing!
---
I have the direction to go for the Vengence build you've mentioned as I plan to primarily bring the pain to Horde. It will be very helpful to have the extra CC of Repentance by the looks of it, which matches nicely with Seal of Command Judgements.
---
When it does come to the deep Ret build, would Seal of Command be my primary Seal to use for Judgement cooldowns? Or maybe do I save Judgment for near the end of the Seal duration?
---
I've been considering Reckoning even but I am concerned that the /sit mechanic to force a crit would bring in too much damage to myself, unless it's not too bad compared to the extra damage output?
---
You had to be his friend. That’s something 😌
---
I think a lot of us did stuff like this this. For me it was wandering into the burning steppes from redridge.
---
The danger that came from no level scaling made places more memorable. I honestly could not tell you how to get to anywhere in the bfa zones, but I could remember details from vanilla WoW locations that I explored nearly 15 years ago.
---
I know ok!? You didnt have to say it. I can't stop myself. Im too angry at the world, im too angry at myself. If i cant be happy no one should be! And that makes me hate myself. And now i cant stop. Im spiraling downwards in an endless cycle of self hatred and hate for others, and then guilt for that hate. Im surprised she didn't leave earlier.
---
I played WoW when you had to log into another character because people would sit around and corpse camp you for hours. That is part of the experience I know. What we have not had the pleasure of, is having a streamer breakdown live because his experience is unplayable. Logging into another character doesn't work when you post your location for all the server to see. sorry friend. It's not the anti streamers who will be leaving the game. Streaming simply isn't sustainable on a pvp server. Be a kind to the community for get camped every time you log in.
---
uh.. okay?
---
Nobody.
---
Yeah definitely. Herod so far seem the highest population, so I imagine most of the popular names are taken on that server.
---
More likely, you'll watch the movie produced by someone who hasn't played baseball since they were 8, because Derek jeter is a baseball player not (probably) a writer or movie producer. And if you think he wrote it just because its his name on the front you should probably google "ghost writing" or "what do editors do"

Here are the least common class/race combos based on the raw numbers from the survey:
---
1. Tauren Hunter
---
2. Troll Rogue
---
3. Gnome Rogue
---
4. Dwarf Rogue
---
5. Troll Warrior
---
6. Gnome Warrior
---
7. NE Rogue
---
8. NE Warrior
---
9. Undead Warrior
---
10. NE Priest
---
Looks like certain races for rogues and warriors are way more strongly preferred over others -  Humans and undead for rogues, and humans and orcs for warriors.
---
As for #1, almost all horde hunters are orc, followed by troll. I've never played horde, but I guess tauren racials must suck ass or something. 
---
Also, no one seems to like trolls. I always thought they were cool.
---

Oh god its 2019 how do people not know how to press a printscreen button lol

---
The Defias riots take place before the events of Classic Wow. 
---
Varian was in Stormwind and Anduin had just been born. Onyxia was slowly manipulating both the nobles and stonemasons in the background to cause chaos and potentially divide the Kingdom. After a lot of he said, she said, riots eventually broke out in SW and Queen Tiffin was killed by a stray rock. Years later Varian goes on a diplomatic mission to Theramore where he's abducted under strange circumstances and so the crown is given to his 10-year-old son Anduin.
---
&gt;is not what the community wants.
---
there is no monolith community that decides what everyone else wants.
---
Just as there will be streamers who will want to shape their own gameplay experience, there will be others whose sole purpose in classic will be to ruin the fun of the streamers and those carrying the streamer's tag.
---
If you aren't play on Faerlina, then you have no business complaining about anything the streamers do.  If you are playing on Faerlina, you still have no business complaining about anything the streamers do.

Thanks for the info!
---
I expected a bit more of a support role than most, but I was hoping to be able to not be constantly worried for my teammates besides a few spells now and then. Maybe that mindset belongs more to a Warrior or Rogue though.
---
Aside from the pic being rough, go with the right. Left looks like you're 4 feet from the sun.
---
I agree with everything you just said.
---
But I would like to add. If I'm waiting in a long ass queue, I would at least like the server to feel alive and full when I join the game
---
Whoever did this, THANK YOU.
---
Name Abortion was flagged about lvl 30
---
"Magus" is a lot better. Kinda sounds like maggots in reference to the undead portion as well. Second one will only be noticed by weebs.
---
I enjoy Vanilla more, it's closer to how it used to be but I'm fine with what they did the change is very minuscule.
---
Oi where are muh mates. (Layering)
---
You get an epic felsteed bruh
---
Yeah, it's problematic.
---
I've unlocked all of them except Kul Tiran and Dark Iron because I main Horde and just don't feel like grinding out alliance rep.
---
I also don't feel like faction changing just to unlock them and then faction changing back. Waste of money.
---
I have a pretty common name, so whenever it’s taken I just add Tanks or Heals to the end. So it would be ThexTanks or ThexHeals...
---
Sound accurate.  I watched a friend of mine try to make a character at exactly 3pm PDT yesterday and had a 11,627 queue for that server.
---
Could an engi mage reflect it back again?
---
I wish they would do another one for classic coming back I tweeted them
---
Thats an astute observation haha
---
Eye of Kilrogg from warlock or the extremely fast run speed wolf from AV from a hunter (probably not in classic) were the only quick ways you could scout a instance in vanilla that I can remember.
---
Oh shit, this started?
---
Considering rolling Fairbanks instead of Herod now
---
Nothing more sad than having high haste at 110 and losing little by little until 120. My MM Hunter went from cool to play to a boring class. 
---
Pretty desincouraging.
---
this subreddit =/= the community
---
Awesome sauce!!!
---
He says that actually. He just tries to dispel some rumors about what Druids are and how they're played in PvE and PvP. They're *very* hybrid. Other classes do more damage. Other classes do more healing. In PvP you use a very wide but kind of shallow pool of tools to support others. You can't go straight feral, balance, or resto without limiting your potential.

Ventrilo Harassment needs to make a comeback
---
Oh Jesus you just tortured yourself and now you gotta stare at a "just gotta wait another two weeks" reminder for the time being

Actually though, sick penmanship. You should do sketches inspired by other classes too.
---
Dang. Commendable, man.
---
&gt;	RP servers are usually heavy alliance strongholds.
---
And this is why I won’t roll RP or RP-PVP.
---
Thank you!
---
Why report them? I don't understand, its their guild and if they don't say anything like hate speech in public channels it shouldn't be reportable unless its one of their guildies who sees it and does the reporting.
---
I don't doubt a guild like that will be able to not say stupid shit in public chats but if their requirements for joining a guild are that I don't see how its a reportable offense unless they actually say or do something to someone.
---
While I don't agree with their stances, I also don't think they should be able to be reported because of their presence. Unless that presence says or does something in line with their guild publicly then I agree it should be reportable.
---
Good old dodgy English to Chinese and back to English subtitles.
---
The meter knows
---
Play where your friends are.
---
Also I have no idea who told you that horde has an advantage in AV,  that is completely wrong.
---
That’s a shame, but if hates pvp he might straight quit on you in phase 2 on a pvp server. WPvP is gonna be insane in phase 2 on all the pvp servers.  No BGs but yes to a ranking system, I’ll have fun, you’ll have fun, he might not have so much fun.
---
This is somewhat speculation, but we have plenty of reason to believe phase 2 will be a war zone on the pvp servers.
---
I think what he says sounds about right based on what I've read. And I've read quite a bit by now. I'm by no means an expert myself, but I considered maining a druid for a couple months and did a fair amount of research. In the end I changed my mind - will main priest and level a druid afterwards. I enjoy healing very much - I have little interest in pvp other than the occasional battleground, and I'm not sure my RL situation will allow too much raiding. I'm looking forward to leveling, the world, dungeons and probably pugging a raid here or there. Since druids are the only healer without a regular rez, and my main "goal" is mostly 5 mans for now, rolling a druid as main just didn't make sense. Hence the priest (which I'm also looking forward to immensely). But I feel like having a druid alt will suit me just fine. I think you need to have realistic expectations with a druid, and be ok with being a team player and not a meter topper. I look forward to having the old cat form again, and buffs like MoTW and thorns :) It will also allow me to sample tanking on a basic level without having to go through the grueling experience of warrior leveling. And being one of the only two decursers at 60 is pretty neat. Plus their sets just look great.
---
TL;DR he's right by saying druids won't be a good fit for everyone. But for those who know what they're getting into, I imagine it will be a blast.
---
I love how a non-maxed server is consider "dead". People only operate on extremes.
---
Vidas got memed by a bunch of lvl 20 thinks

No

&gt; There would have been fewer GoT viewing parties if half of the people had already been shown the damn thing 2 months prior.

I've also been looking up some info on glancing bows. I'm finding mixed info regarding ranged glancing blows; some claim that ranged attacks are exempt from the glancing blows mechanic. Others say that ranged attacks have a 60% chance of landing a glancing blow. Which is it?

You mainly only start to use shield when you get inner fire so you don’t lose stacks.

Level 18?
---
They honestly wont interact that much. The min/maxxers will be farmin MC when the casuals are getting their mounts. I wouldn't worry about it.

Got a link to it on curseforge?

Pro tip: Brutal Impact is shit. Especially while leveling. You don't even get Pounce until level 36, and once you do you won't use it as your opener 99% of the time. (Ravage does more damage than a full duration Pounce. Even against heavily-armored targets.) 
---
On the other hand, maxing out Feral Aggression gives you a higher stealth level (always useful for sneaking past mobs + world PvP if you're on a PvP server) and extra threat for tanking in dungeons.
---
I mean it is one of our biggest gifts to the group, or to strangers that /who you and PM for a summon. Like portals are to a Mage. Instant travel to friendly cities on the other side of the world without a Mage would really mess up a lot of things and be kind of gamebreaking...
---
...so I expect that is also something that BFA did?
---
Did you reserve it on herod
---
What did it cost you
---
45566 queue
---
What if it’s a ruse cruise, and they all split and announce an hour before launch on the 26th.
---
Your handwriting is beautiful.
---
I did! I honestly did, gave BFA a red hot go for as long as I could and eventually could not stand it any more. Definitely not touching it again unless it is improved on a number of fronts.

I don't know whether to be more impressed by the drawings of the animal forms, or the font hand writing.

It'll be eventual, I had that same exact name in WoTLK and I got banned for it

Naah, just take the layering away and watch the people whine about queues. Implement free transfer to other servers and eventually people will take the option to skip the 10h wait to log in.

Any private server's world chat is filled with "dead server" or "dad server" as soon as it hits 3k. Real clever and calculated, that bunch is.

I could give you a (much) longer explanation but I'll stick to the TL;DR for now. French Canadians speak French (duh). We've had issues with the English trying to assimilate us going as far back as 300 years ago. There's many laws to ensure that French stays as the primary language in Quebec and to preserve our language+culture. There's some people that outright refuse to talk to tourists/outsiders in English. Oh and religion is also a bit of a polarizing topic because the state and the Catholic Church were effectively one until 1960, so we're a bit anal about religious symbols (at least our politicians are).
---
That might explain why people see us as untolerant or xenophobic, but I really haven't seen any case of Quebecers being outright xenophobic. It's mostly english-speaking tourists having bad encounters with people that refuse to and/or can't speak in English.
---
Most of us have no issues speaking in English, especially online (although the English might be a bit wonky for some).
---
You don't use one? I'm aghast!
---
I say don’t put the logo on and make bank, bro.

We didnt have in Vanilla.

quebec has a bit of a reputation for not being very welcoming to immigrants, esp if they're not white and don't speak french
---
If their intention is to demonstrate to the community the actual, planned amount of layering, sure it makes sense. There's been a lot of worry over what was seen on the stress test. I think it'd be smart to use this probably-already-planned test to demonstrate that.
---
No reason to think I'm right so far, though. Here's to hoping.
---
I seriously think this idiot (TipsOut) just put this together. I find it hard to believe that Ninja, Shroud, Dr Disrespect and other big name streamers with no big affiliation with WoW will go to that server.

Druids also are considered the 2nd best tanks behind warrior. Many guilds utilized a feral druid (cat) for leader of the pack in a melee group (rogues+fury warriors). Feral dps is considered one of the hardest pve specs to master. That said the token feral druid also would collect tank gear (not an issue cause leather) for fights that required many off tanks and in my old vanilla guild sometimes a druid tank was preffered because a druid in bear form could reach a larger overall HP pool compared to a warrior so on bosses that could 1 shot a warrior a druid could soak. Their more of a punching bag though whereas a warrior can mitigate damage. 
---
We used a bear on our 1st Twin Emps kill for example because our 2nd tank warrior would die if they didn't dodge or parry enough, but our healers had no issues keeping a druid up.
---
Also my guild ran alt raids and we would farm MC/BWL and we did it all with a Druid as MT. Yes the last boss was an issue with fear but hey it was fun. It was also very common for ZG or AQ20 to have a druid tank.
---
So yes druid usually is stuck healing but not always for the dedicated out there.
---
Probably sucking off our tax dollars too.

I think you should watch this video:

---
Druids in Classic are able to play a bunch of different roles, but are almost universally subpar at all of them when compared to “pure” classes. This is because Blizzard’s balance for the versatility of druids was to make them weaker in every area. “Jack of all trades, master of none.” If you are wanting to pvp, you should 100% pick warrior unless you want to be the best flag runner around in WSG.
---
I remember getting rank 12 and spending the whole week grinding the fuck out of PvP... I'll get rank 13 and stop I told my self... I played from 3pm until midnight endless PvP. The next week I was..... Rank 11 lmao... I gave up. I didn't want to push even harder than I was.
---
Classic wow and reactionaries, name a more iconic duo
---
i dont believe its that hard, they will just need to add more servers on day 1 lul.
---
Selling coal... selling cow hides... memories.

push to talk is mandatory in the discords i run
---
i laughed too much at this
---
Cool, so only server transfers ?
---
Yeah, I guess I might be getting old and out of touch with internet lingo (which figures, given the topic at hand). This thread is the first time I'd seen this new usage based on the 4chan meme someone else linked here.
---
I’ve been playing for 15years as well and read this exact thing a think a month ago in this sub and had no idea either.
---
Because it detracts from the community feel that we had in vanilla. You were with the same people all of the time. Now you're not. Those people are off in other shards and you may or may not ever see people that play on your server. We had no issues playing without this shit in vanilla. If the servers they have can't handle the load, add more servers.
---
Pretty much. It's pretty simple to get around without a Mage anymore.
---
Thanks to the original vanilla private server VanillaGaming for causing Classic to happen. Nostalrius did help, so cheers to them too.
---
I’m just happy I got Udderchaos for my Tauren
---
I was going for "Subterfuge" for a rogue but I didn't make it in time, settled for "Camouflage".
---
Also thanks for the info, now I have a bit more insight on Cato Sicarius from 40k :P
---
Ha, you might be right. But that's a bonus then. I thought t3 plus the idol from AQ made for some sick healing potential too. But I only started playing at the end of vanilla so I only know what I've read/seen in vids. Rolling Alliance so shamans will be irrelevant ;)
---
Yeah that was my thought, i was begging for a queue tbh
---
Gives me some drawing ideas for myself! I got a new sketch book too. I love druids &lt;3 I made a tauren druid I plan as leveling as feral tank casually.

Look closer, it;s the rogue. The hunter is just covering his hand.
---
I think it was around 7k when the PvE server opened up and I switched but yeah.  WPvP is fun at 2-2.5k people.  I'm not sure how many to expect in Classic but PvP was never my main focus; it was just a fun way to take a break from grinding PvE.  I don't want to risk getting forced into it 80%+ of my playing time.  It might be fine, I'm just being risk averse.
---
Depends. How much of the server population consists of sjws
---
Before Dire Maul? DM.
---
After Dire Maul? dm.
---
Or you could just SHIFT CLICK THE PERSON LFM DM AND SEE THAT THEY'RE LEVEL 18.
---
I lol'd so hard I peed a little.
---
Copy &amp; Paste: VC is Deadmines, DM is Diremaul. Fix it or ur banned bud, my uncle works at Nintendo.
---
Stop troll posting, no one calls and instance by the last boss. We call by abbreviation of the instance name and wing.

Nah. I rarely stream, and I’m back in.

If you want to read books, don't read anything that was released after WoW. I have to disagree with the other guy telling you to read Chronicle, it retconned a lot of the old lore and made it much worse in my opinion.

Hunter/lock?

🤣 What an asshole
---
I sometimes wish I had better writing, this makes mine almost literally look like chicken scratch lol.
---
I hadn't play since Cata, and I resubed recently for the open beta(worth, cause I got a weekend and names) and blizz send me a gift. Maybe I already had it... Anyway, the gift is and instant lvl 100...Maybe it was for the 15th anniversary of WoW. Check your gift page, there might be one
---
i call it DM when i'm in westfall
---
i call it VC in trade chat
---
but if somebody else calls it DM in trade chat, I know what they're talking about
---
after all, there's no single dungeon called simply 'Dire Maul'
---
It will be when you think about the thousands of twitch followers
---
100 ms if ur in the east coast,  its not bad.
---
They won't be. Shaman outputs a MASSIVE amount of aoe healing, which is perfect for the amount of aoe damage you'll take. Hardly anything is tank and spank at that point, which is where a hot rolling druid would excel.
---
I use push to talk on discord. You can even require it in your voice channels.
---
Chronicle retconned all of the old lore from vanilla wow and replaced it with stupid bullshit, I have to disagree with you here.
---
Once people realize they're going to have to wait hours to play on Herod, they'll suck it up and move to Fairbanks or Thalnos.

Deadmines is DM. If you are in westfall looking for people for DM, you obviously mean Deadmines, back in the day you would shift click peoples names and see their level, if they are in the teens, they clearly do not mean Dire maul.

You are talking culture and the game play. 
---
Culture will undoubtedly be different. Game play will be the same.
---
We called them DM or VC almost interchangeably back in vanilla. Of course there were a few cringey douches that would reply “OMG YOURE GOING TO DIRE MAUL!!!??”. It’s rather obvious if someone in West fall or a level 16 mage says lfg DM that they’re trying to go to the deadmines.
---
Cygnus is pretty cool.
---
If some kind of weird "inv to asmondlayer!!!111oneoneeleven poggers" bullshit starts, you bet your ass the population will give a shit.
---
Same, I guess I never thought about it but somehow I just figured everyone would be using vent again because the ptt sounds were such a cornerstone of raiding. It's just part of the experience.
---
Too many people are going to take this seriously. Ret Paladins are nowhere near as bad as people think. Especially in 5 man dungeons.
---
Mostly it was so I don't have to rely on special characters as substitutes for letters. For reference, I had to go to #3 choice for the stress test. That's how fast every conceivable name gets taken! As for my classic main, I don't feel like connecting it to my reddit identity but I made an alt named "Arkancide". If I get time to ever level it.
---
People are not different from 2004. There are fads, but people don't stop liking thing s because a few years pass.
---
Competitive PvP only stresses people to the point that bad attitudes surface. Look around at MOBAs, COD, and anything with a ranking system. People will say ranked in Team Fortress 2 ruined the game, and that it turned players away from the community environment. Its not people that's changed its that everything has PvP ingrained into it nowadays.
---
If you could help me out. [This macro.](https://imgur.com/wmv8niA)  It simply sends pet to my target, pet follows on second press BUT if I press on a second target, it attacks. 
---
Could NOT get this working on Stress test with updated syntax. I made 20 different macros that could /petattack &amp; /petfollow, but none would attack 2nd target without a /petfollow happening before it.
---
Won’t matter if your first name is Donald
---
&gt;Maybe this was because the beta you only went to 15, but how is this going to be dealt with? When it goes live and people are saying DM it's reasonable to assume they are talking about Dire Mail
---
If you want to join the party, shift click and see their level - there is your answer. The end.

No, he just liked swimming in wealth. I think he used it to fund his Warlock epic mount quest, and then his Warrior alt.
---
Whenever he managed to get duplicate items in a day, like 2 orbs of deception, he'd hand one off to a friend. (I also got my orb of deception from him)
---
I agree BC would be the place to go. It had its quirks, but overall I think it was the best expansion gameplay wise. Not as buggy as vanilla but not as fucked up as the end of wotlk. Plus, who doesn’t love the Outlands
---
You could sell these.
---
They have a list on the official  classic WoW/Blizzard website
---
How much do you want for it?
---
Not to mention if you're LFG for Dire Maul, you put the wing.
---
Yeah, we switched to it around 2008 because one of our guild members was from Australia and another was a Mac user... at that time nothing could beat its latency and bandwidth use.
---
Considering WoW is the cause for the need of retcon, it's still pretty relevant.

I had a name flagged for being Un-rp, not vulgar, just a sugary drink with some extra letters (shrug) the trick to not actually changing it, was to leave it offline without changing it, till Wotlk came out, then it let me log on without changing it.
---
Just gotta see if I manage to make it to 60 without being forced to change it
---
You want to judge crusader first and then keep SoC up and judge. But you only do this if you have the liberty. You can't always try and judge crusader on every target you are activating GCD and wasting time.
---
So judge crusader if you have the mana and the time and then SoC.
---
Also when you HoJ make sure you have your judge up for max damage. 
---
When your opponent is low switch to SoR for instant quick damage on swing. 
---
On about the sit macro. Not sure if its a bug or if its intended. But because of batching you will /sit and stand at same time you get hit and get the benefits of being critted without actually being critted because you are technically standing during the attack.
---
You should check out esfand on youtube and twitch. I know a lot of people meme about him because he is a streamer but when it comes to being a ret paladin and making it viable this guy does his home work. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op9kWkI4F-I for the sit/reckoning

Hope you get to keep it.

**[Apologies for big post]**
---
Not sure what scripts he was using, but here's some useful stuff for you from a post I made a few days ago-
---
&gt; Here's a few very simple macros that I never play a pet class without :)
---
    /petpassive
---
    /petfollow
---
&gt; Basically an emergency command for if your pet is about to do something stupid, you change your mind on a pull, or some other situation where you just want it to come back. I usually map this to mousewheel down because it's always right there at my fingertips.
---
&gt; Use icon of your choice.
---
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
---
    /dismount
---
    /petattack
---
    /petdefensive
---
&gt; Use this instead of binding a key to the normal pet attack button. It sends your pet in to attack and also resets them to the normal defensive stance (in case you had used the first macro recently). It also dismounts you if you're mounted, just saves button presses for when you're riding along and see something you want to attack. Change the /petdefensive to /petaggressive if you enjoy living dangerously and/or hate your instance party. You can also add chat stuff, ie "/point", for flavour. There used to be a simple way to give such text a %age chance to occur but I don't remember what it was now.
---
&gt; Use icon of your choice for this one too.
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [target=pet, dead] Revive Pet; [modifier:ctrl] Revive Pet; [nopet] Call Pet; Mend Pet
---
&gt; This one is Hunter-specific. You can probably tell just by reading it but basically-
---
- if your target is your dead pet, it revives it
---
- if you hold CTRL it forces the revive cast (just as a backup/alternative to targeting the corpse)
---
- if your pet isn't present (despawned/dismissed), it calls it to you
---
- if your pet is by your side, it heals it (default action if none of the other conditions are met)
---
&gt; For this one, leave the icon as the default red "?" and it should change based on the context. ~~Disclaimer: this is actually from a Hunter alt I haven't touched since TBC, I'm not 100% sure that it will work in Classic and I don't have a Hunter to check. It's not doing anything super cheaty so if anything some of the syntax may be out of date, that's all.~~
---
I've since tested the last one in the stress test and it works perfectly.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
A few other notes on macros-
---
- You can do multiple 'things' with a single button press, **but you can only ever cast ONE spell**. So for example you could put cast Hunters Mark, pet attack, set pet defensive, /point and a /say message all in one macro, and it will do all that on a single press. If you were to then add cast Arcane Shot to the macro, it will cast whatever spell was listed first and ignore the other spells.
---
- You can put multiple spells in a single macro and use *basic* contextual logic to choose which **ONE** to cast, see my Hunter pet macro above.
---
- Opening a macro with "#showtooltip" makes the tooltip for the skill it will cast appear on mouseover. You can also make it show the icon and tooltip for some other skill by putting the skill name after it.
---
- When you're asked to choose an icon for a new macro, the red "?" icon is a dynamic one. If you try my Hunter revive/call/mend pet macro above, you'll see the icon change automatically. Works in conjunction with "#showtooltip".
---
A final word of advice from me is to careful with doing multiple things on a single macro, ie automation. My Hunter revive/call/mend pet macro is a good example of an exception, because all those things are mutually exclusive, only one of them is ever going to be possible at a given point in time - can't revive a pet that isn't dead, can't heal a pet that isn't there.
---
On the other hand, casting Hunters Mark and having your pet attack as per your example. Say you're spotted an enemy player you want to engage, and they likely haven't seen you. Your macro will send your pet to attack, but the Hunters Mark will alert the enemy to your presence. It would be far better to silently send in your pet, then cast Hunters Mark once your pet has arrived. There's also situations where you would want to Hunters Mark something but not immediately attack.
---
I don't remember where exactly, but recently I saw someone boasting about a load of Shaman macros they made that had their Lightning nukes on one button, their Shocks on one button, all fire totems on one button, all water totems on one button, etc..
---
**Don't do shit like that.**
---
Even the stock hotbars give you enough buttons for all your skills, and that's coming from someone who has mained both Shaman and Warlock. Putting 4 skills on one button means you're only seeing one icon and hiding the others. What's the remaining cooldown on Fire Nova Totem? Who knows! Automating rotations and/or using /castsequence puts you at a massive disadvantage when the situation changes unexpectedly, for example when a spell lock throws out your carefully planned cast timing, or you get adds after you just burned Chain Lightning on a single target. Keep things simple and give yourself flexibility to adapt.
---
Let me know if you have any questions :)
---
What about it doesn't make sense? Where am i wrong exactly? what do you think happens to a layer when there isn't enough players to warrant it? It gets merged with the other layers
---
I just assembled my new gaming chair today. Gates leather executive chair.
---
deadmines has always and will always be DM
---
Really glad to see you got your name. Congrats!
---
work 6am to 6pm. Cant stay up late to raid with west coasters.
---
I got calvin, wallace, and jonarbuckle.  All hunters.  Bonus points if you can figure out the names of their pets.
---
Don't pretend like it's not the least bad option we have.
---
For some servers, this will be your life for \~ a week or more after launch.
---
Exactly, also there is literally zero way everyone became toxic overnight just because they could pay $25 to do it again on another server. I am sure some people ninjad and then skipped to another server but to blame the whole of toxicity from the community solely on realm transfers, LOL
---
It’s easier to do it that way and we are lazy by heart.
---
As someone new to WoW, I don't get why the community wouldn't rather have a version of the game like Vanilla with upgraded resolution and such. Why do we need the potato graphics for the nostalgia?
---
Honestly, if it wasn't for the community, I'd be considering trying Vanilla instead as my first wow experience.
---
Classic is 1.12, late 2006 Wow. It's literally the end of the game minus content progression.
---
Does that sound the same to you as Wow launch?
---
Mate, we all played WoW classic when we didn't know anything about the game or wtf we were doing.
---
Nope, I never played classic started in Wrath, it was something I noticed a lot during the last beta test a mixture of what people called it. So I was curious if this was something that bothered people or not. I can't actually ever recall saying DM for Dire Maul, but that was a very long time ago and I think the majority of my experience when I started was very little before the dungeon finder came.
---
Ret shouldn't be a good dps in terms of pure damage output. They are meant to be a support class.
---
The weird thing though is the racial transmog is locked behind leveling your allied race, so you're also encouraged to just grind. It's odd that the mechanics encourage both grinding and buying transfers or boosts
---
wow, you put water in a bottle and printed some stuff on it
---
Try the free trial and see if u like it at all
---
i hope your being satirical when you say it is VC and not DM when the game first released it was called DM before dire mall was out and the reason people first said VC was on private servers because people advertising groups in trade chat if you are in westfall and you say DM it is deadmines because no one will advertise dire mall in westfall as for the abreviations it is DM N,W,E,TRIB and Any also same as for classic dire mall wont be out for a few months after launch 
---
tldr not only are you wrong but you are stupid
---
Agreed. There is a RP aspect to all of that in a way. Can do whatever you want for fun.
---
Oh sweet. Fairbanks or Whiteman it is!
---
Its the coloring that offends me - not that i think the new graphics are any less “potato” to brag about lol
---
You mean sacrifice, not salvation
---
The in game voice chat was introduced back in vanilla... (but no one used it).
---
Fairbanks is low key the underdog server. It’s gonna have the most authentic classic feel
---
That's adorable.
---
yeah mean High Elfs ?
---
Okay, thanks!
---
I got stuck with Téxas and Bést :(
---
Think of the blessing of might ! you already have 2 melee dps it could be great !
---
i kinda like GrobbyGang also tho...
---
Am I the only one who wants to reserve the name Pepto for a Paladin now?
---
The escort quest in barrens with the blood elf is one of those glorious and hideous models! 
---
Love it.
---
Brave. Misguided, but brave.
---
yes
---
Oneiros is going to play too. I kinda need to build a new rig, so my start might be delayed.
---
I am fucking dead lmfao
---
I got Diesel for my Warrior main so I couldn't be happier. See y'all on Herod!
---
I dont do the competitive gaming, but i agree with what your saying. Pvp brings a stress to win and people react differently than say a group quest. Pvp is my favorite thing in WoW, and i should probably stop doing random bg's as thats where i see the most toxic crap.
---
Agree, lots to do. Not a hell of a lot worth doing outside harder raids and m+.
---
Yeah my advice as a longggg time player. Pick a class that will make leveling enjoyable. Don’t focus on the end game yet because you don’t know what you’ll end up loving. 
---
Pick one of these: Druid, Hunter, Warlock or Priest. 
---
They are the easiest to level and will let you spend more time focusing on lore and the journey itself.
---
Come to zandalar guys, it's a safe hub for people who want to avoid streamers/toxic guilds etc. The RP at the start is optional.
---
Look, what else are people supposed to talk about?
---
My opinion is that you let people have their fun. Maybe people don’t like these posts, downvote and move on. 
---
No point in a thread like this ruffing feathers just because people are enjoying themselves. It’s grinchy.
---
I waited in a 10k queue for Pagle, no streamers there.  Pretty sure all the servers were crammed full.
---
Blizzard doesnt give a fuck
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THE GROUND!
---
You can easily build Mana by judging wisdom and r1 soc.  Only swap to Max rank soc to judge it when a Target is stunned.  If you are low Mana from heals or whatever, swap to seal of wisdom and judge wisdom, just auto to restore.  Blessing of wisdom isn't that important if you manage seals correctly
---
Try it out for a month. Most it’ll cost is 15$.
---
Why arnt more people freaking out about the release day being on Monday 26th instead Tuesday the 27th?
---
I reserved every Quebecois' mom's name (Guidoune) on every server.
---
I was friends with a lot of the HWL's on my server, including myself, and my father, a lot of them disappeared within a week, never to be seen again, truly saddening because I'd made great friends with them.
---
A lot came back but only after a good long break and took the game casually after.
---
Then there was my father, who kept High Warlord for over a month, because he enjoyed playing with the weapons so much he just kept playing, he held General - Warlord right up until TBC came out.
---
Pom Pom Pyro a Ho

I went from playing Star Wars: Galaxies to WoW in 2005 and WoW was so much more polished.
---
In 2019 I'm not sure a new player would be too impressed, but it was a relatively skill-based MMO at the time of its creation; and while I can't know how much time I'll have to spare for it this time around, I'm looking forward to booting it up again, for sure.
---
Nope, you cant even interact with NPCs or objects in any druid forms
---
AGH EUGH!
---
The first respec is 1g.  That spec looks good, but honestly, IMO find a good leveling build guide, which actually will probably lead to something looking similar to this anyway, and follow it.  You’ll have many days of experience under your belt with the class by the time you hit 60 for any respec and you’ll have your own opinions too from that experience.  Once you get there you can read some popular builds and guides for level 60 with all of your own knowledge to see it more clearly too.
---
Do some dungeons leveling up too.
---
For the horde!!!! 
---
Really cool setup though 👍
---
Man,
---
Good lord you got everything including my favorite songs. This is perfect.
---
I only remember a shitload of comments about the min existant advertising. Classic beeing doomed and Acti Blizz Not wanting it to be a success from all the aluminium hat wearers (is there actually a english word for conspiricy guys?)
---
I wasn't in on this one but I just LOVE taking on people way over my level on my tinks, so much fun when they come at you thinking they have an easy kill and you corpse camp them.
---
Think s old argument i remember it as VC on my server and to this day i call it VC. But its not like we can not all figure out what instance  someone is referring too. If they say DM only more often then not they mean deadmines. If someone says VC still deadmines if they say DM east then we know it us not deadmines.. you can also check the level of the individual that will be a quick clue.
---
There's no excuse for behaving like the man in this video. He needs to get a grip. He is acting like a child.

*"Hits right in the feels" "gave me chills multiple times!" "I have goosebumps I have tears of joy." "I thought I didn't want this, but holy shit I think I do." " Take me hoommmee..." "We're going home boys."*  
---
I had an emotional turmoil, what people already said here sum up it pretty well.
---
I'M READY.
---
Well be using #showtooltip and /startattack macros
---
Not /script macros
---
Who put the fork in the garage disposal?! No? Just me?
---
Moonkin druids weren't even a thing at launch as far as I can remember.
---
Perfect comparison. They are the Kardashians.
---
if I logged in during the stress test and only then, can I log in? doesnt seem like i can?
---
You can skin in bear form
---
Worse than on the beta? Isn't one of the primary complaints from the anti-layering people about people hopping layers to get an unfair advantage? I mean, you just complained about people hopping layers to avoid ganking.
---
What kind of monster hands do you have that you can reach H with your left hand?  The original X-box controllers were designed by you, weren't they?
---
"That's what classic is about, its not about nitpicking or any of that shit". I definitely am not trying to nitpick,  ive just noticed the difference on toxic behavior and it reallys troubles me. 
---
Yea i agree when playing old games agin like you said its just not the same. I think ill enjoy classic though because i missed out on most of the content. I started playing after it had been out awhile and my first mmo i had no idea what i was doing lol.
---
Do it. And unsub from this Reddit immediately.
---
&gt;The LGBTQ+ community: is intending to play on Thalnos (EST - PvP)
---
Lmao, if the LGBT movement really is about equality and being accepted as normal people this shouldn't even be a special announcement to be made.
---
Only things I really miss is Draenai and Blood Elves
---
Is it possible to claim names for the final launch or is that later/ not happening?
---
You wouldn't happen to have a link to that blue post, would ya? I can't seem to find it
---
I also had a friend that played a ton but rarely with me that handed me a krol blade. It was actually pretty cool. Was grinding ghosts in wintersrping on my rogue trying to get my first 60 and he just showed up and handed me a wrapped present through trade and it was a krol blade.
---
There is a difference between a mount and a title. I dont care about it but you just don't get it. Of course both are cosmetic but certainly you can see how a unique modeled mount is a much bigger prize and a title is still more fitting for elitist rewards. A recolor of an available mount is also something I believe is a fitting reward.
---
But yeah, old school games had old school reward systems before being more fair towards the player base.
---
He’s making a joke. The only reason people buy beastslayer is for the low level weapon glow.
---
Feels so good man, even now thinking back. Good memory to have.
---
Yes, and you will have a better time than 99% of us
---
He was too poor to afford pet training.
---
Proceeds to not directly reply to anything I wrote, gets called out for it, and then calls me out for not directly replying to him? What is cognitive dissonance? Seriously the lack of self awareness is astounding, but expected and amusing.  
---
And honestly didn't read the rest. You think too highly of yourself, but if you were actually smart you'd have some semblance of self awareness. But you don't and you wrote an entire essay that starts off patronizing me. I love the WoW community :)
---
Damn nice! 
---
Feels like a lot of Druid post here on reddit, I’m rolling Druid and was kind of hoping there wouldn’t be too many of us so you’d feel more special while topping meters in cat and maintanking naxx but I guess it’ll be actual  claw to the teeth competition :) I’m gonna just have to work harder!
---
Now we complain that we didnt get the name we wanted
---
NOT A WARLOCK?
---
Mind if I’ll do the same? :)
---
&gt;Retail feels like a job with things you need to do, and someone telling you that you need to do them.
---
Grinding for raid mats isn't much different
---
... it is on EST, but the server is located in chicago.
---
I do too!
---
You were discussing druid vs. shaman though..
---
Ultimately I agree with the crux of your argument because the content doesn't require anything close to min-maxing but if somebody is asking a question I intend to tell them the correct answer. What you're basically asking people to do is lie to random people to make you feel better. Genuinely think about your position for a second here,I'm supposed to tell somebody that moonkins are top tier dps and their raid spot is guaranteed because why exactly?
---
Will we get that plague event again? I fucking loved that.
---
Wasn't able to get my mains names that I've since the Vanilla beta. By the time I got logged into Pagle, Martok was gone. Really sad now cause I've used that name in every game I've played that you can make your own character for the last 30 years. 😭 wish I could get my name back.
---
Well you er on the side of classic+, I do too.
---
I will happily accept changes, as long as they keep classic the way it is and let you choose to transfer your character to either classic + with new content or the bc servers.
---
In 2007, I was just a small freshman at the University of Pittsburgh. In addition to being a huge wow fan, I was also a lover of basketball, playing and watching the game. One night I was playing at our University gym, warming up on a side court waiting to get into the next game. The gym was buzzing that night as James Conner and his buddies were playing and everyone wanted to get a game against him. I was too scared as I was small, weak, and Conner could easily eat me for breakfast.
---
As I'm popping threes in the corner I see Conner walking out towards the exit, which coincidentally was right behind me. As he's walking by he stops, obviously impressed by incredible abilities, and said
---
"$20 on your next shot"
---
With no hesitation, I throw that shit up. Now this wasn't any normal three pointer, I'm talking Steph Curry range, like out-of-bounds.
---
Perfect Swish.
---
I was even amazed I made it. Next thing I know he pulls out a bill out of his sweatshirt pocket and just hands it to me, without looking to see what the value of it was. A crisp $100 bill from James Conner was in my hand. Looking up to say thank you, I noticed he had disappeared, almost like Santa, he left without a trace, leaving presents for kids who were good. From that moment on, I knew James Conner was the greatest player of all time.
---
Third time I've seen the same post.
---
That is exactly the best time to play buddy
---
Who is Kevin Jordan?
---
Sucks for Alliance though, it's waaaaaay out of the way
---
Deadmines was definitely the gem of the early dungeons, but the Horde had other great moments.  The Barrens had this right of passage feel to it Westfall didn't quite have, so I guess there was a little trade off in the early zones and it balances out in the end.
---
Would you kindly send me one too?
---
As a ret main, I can't wait to grind bis and consumables, get in the raid an prove everyone right
---
Ok there sound and fury
---
That was surprisingly emotional haha. Awesome work

That was dope
---
Ready to tank my ass off for you guys! 
---
I’ll be on 9-midnight+ most nights. Plan to no-life this shit hard!
---
Always down to tank or pvp.
---
If you read my post, it's not really a gif/jif situation (the creator of the format says jif anyway so there's that one for you), but like I stated, nobody will say "LFM DM" or "LFG DM" if they mean dire maul, as there are three different parts to dire maul. You can wait and see, but deadmines will be called DM without issue, some people will insist calling it by the name of the last boss for some reason still but it won't really make any difference, and when people get to dire maul they will specify the wing in the same sentence, letting you know it isn't for deadmines.
---
Calling bullshit on the amount of people on this sub that claim they hit r14. You guys have no idea how much of an absolute grind it is and even then only a minuscule amount of people can actually achieve it per week.
---
In all seriousness, the horde v alliance storyline is such a gray area and the 2 are so different that literally everything you hear about them is boss. Just gotta find what you like and roll with it.
---
Ok you're gonna sink time into a role playing game, and you're gonna play a human??? Thats not role playing thats everyday life...boring.

https://youtu.be/pIsqXW6E3Mw
---
Awesome!  I just listened to it again since you mentioned it, it's so good!
---
Now I can be the most slippery class in the game again!
---
I'm laughing over here looking at the BiS min/max gear lists. If your a healer or even dps in classic you'll get invited to MC in all lvl 50+ questing greens. Skill is more important. Gear never mattered to much until the first real gear check in the game.... Vaelastrasz.
---
Are you shit dickin me? 30k. Doesnt include horde does it?
---
I have Hog
---
Dont Starve and Xcom arnt bad.
---
That means Ragnaros is heavily associated with flagrant racism. 
---
A symbol or name synonymous with bigotry and hate.
---
Not a hotdog.
---
goat
---
On the other hand (and it probably won't be as bad as it used to) it meant you CAN NEVER LEAVE MOLTEN CORE. 
---
Even when you're killing C'Thun, you still need to have 1/2 days set aside to slog through MC and shard everything because people need their T2 pants. 
---
6hrs of bullshit for Double Druid. Ugh. 
---
Nevermind your tank cursed with one binding, who will never, ever get to leave MC.
---
Fucking this
---
Oh God yes, you're all wonderful to play with, but you sound awful.
---
Fart around on retail
---
I'm reaching out right now on a whim.  If someone on Herod has "Pappy" I want it.  Very important, actually.  Dead serious.  Hit me up if you're willing to part ways with it.
---
Hey you resubbed get an almost maxed character from us! Just eat a frozen dick Activision.
---
Central Canadian.  40 of us are going Herod.
---
Bitch better not talk shit about my classic. Slow leveling and large worlds are a feature, not a negative
---
5 to 30 minutes is enough to both avoid ganking and also mess with your party

#showtooltip

that didn’t work? or what did you try? i used that format on the stress test and it worked on everything i tried

I was thinking of going Whitemane, but I'll avid that dumb shit
---
Grobb mob

Oh god is this guy running linux.
---
Dood looks SwEEt. What game is this?
---
For nameplate with timers I'd check weakaura strings. I believe I saw one nameplate weakaura that shows duration of debuffs if paired with omnicc.
---
Lol you don't even need nostalgia, I've always been alli and leveling there during the launch test really made me consider switching to horde for classics
---
Next time say wordplay names are lame!
---
I'll see myself out.
---
Either streamers will be on herod within a month or they will put in some short streams on feral and play herod off server. All of the hype is in non streamer servers and everyone knows feral is going to be pure cancer and unfun for everyone on it.
---
Man, I almost forgot what it was like to actually manage mana as DPS. I can't wait!
---
If you're American; VC for deadmines and DM for diremaul. If you're European; DM for deadmines and then DM North etc for diremaul since we're capable of seeing character levels and not just blatantly yell at a level 19 for looking for more DM.
---
Not that big
---
So essentially it just makes your pet attack your target, *unless* your target is the same as your pet's target, in which case it returns to you?
---
If that's the case then I'm not sure it's possible, because AFAIK there's no way to use your pet's target in a modifier.
---
Exactly my point, its unofficially going to be non-English speaking, so why would he choose that server?  
---
I have nothing against those communities but I wouldn't hinder myself with a language barrier on purpose.
---
Also what no one has mentioned yet is classic will save you money. How you ask? Because after you play classic for more then a few hours maybe not even that long, you will never be able to play anything else with the same enjoyment. So you eventually just stop buying new games!
---
Yeh it’s not really about the lag as it is 3 hour time difference.
---
Wow this has never been done before
---
That's one of problem with all the expansions and the mid point patches. Everything invalidates everything you've done before.
---
Expansions should be horizontal rather than vertical.
---
Cheers! I used the one off icy veins guide for warriors. Was more long winded than yours.
---
It is a reskin of an available mount silly. Anyone can get an AQ mount from the AQ raids. The only other difference is its ability to be used outside AQ.
---
New school games have plenty for get there first or get nothing rewards too.
---
Bro all servers will be full. Blizz wants to open more. Not have dead servers
---
Maybe half the people even bothered to early register
---
If I was you, I'd have killed myself by now. Years ago
---
Woah woah woah woah, no alliance and horde working together? You’re in for a rude awakening.  Maybe not by design, but there’s going to some devilsaur mafias popping up.
---
It's the 27th in EU
---
From my limited experience, there's no shortage of those types of people on the pservers either.
---
From my point of view the redditors are the liars!
---
Yeah but no one cares about the EU.
---
It's available to anyone who already had beta access.
---
I did it to myself twice.  I wandered from Redridge into Searing Gorge, and then later from Ashenvale into Felwood.  Got ROFL stomped by an elemental and plague wolf, respectively.
---
Get First Aid no matter what class or spec you play. Also join a guild Classic is not a game for solo players for the most part.
---
I ended up getting the name Talksic because, like my name on reddit, my name for just about everything nowadays is Im TM06. TM06 is the move toxic from Pokémon but I wasn’t able to get the name toxic unfortunately. Talksic is good though cause to random people it looks like an rp name, but is actually pronounced toxic :)
---
Sick realm, surprised your name isn’t spurgletjr. Tell asmongold and your hero’s go fuck themselves

I would like one too!

Purple Cobras - NA Fairbanks – Alliance – PvP – Semi-Hardcore – LC – Tues/Thurs 6-9 PST  Here in Purple Cobras we understand that N00bieness and Austism are genetic disorders, like baldness or basement dwelling, and it’s your fault if you don’t hate yourself enough to do something about it. Get ready to join a community that turns that undisciplined n00b that you used to be into one of the Elite. You’ll still be yourself in a legal sense, but think of it as a better, more awesome you than you could ever become without us.  Our active core is made up of Vanilla Veterans, Pserver Raiders, and BFA Elites. The goal; to mold you into the Classic powerhouse you want to be. That means we’ll provide you with the knowledge and the experience you’ll need to turn that backpeddling clicker into a macro using, addon utilizing, key binder.  With my years of experience raid leading in many facets of World of Warcraft and with our active guild roster we will be swimming in loot in no time. That said, our ultimate objective is to make effective use of each others time. This means you as an individual do not pull down the rest of the group. The expectations of our guild are: Attendance (Be here!), Be Prepared (You show up with consumables/buffs, knowledge of the fights, and with any loot requirements set), Be On Time (or Early), Be Focused (No Distractions, we are part of a team), and Our Community (make others attractive like how we made you attractive).  After promptly levelling to 60(Some of us in the first week), Purple Cobras plans to help gear out all our members in Pre-Raid BiS and help the stragglers if we can. Getting into Molten Core and Attuned for Onyxia is a priority so that you’re able to display the loot you’ve earned through us. We will also be participating in Un’goro to help fund our members with Devilsaur Sets.  
---
RECRUITMENT:  Raid Times: Tuesdays and Thursdays between 6PM PST – 9PM PST (9PM EST – 12AM EST).  These are subject to change and will likely be expanded as content is released.  We are accepting applicants, regardless of class, given they are not a “Meme” spec. If you believe you are willing to meet our basic requirements we would absolutely review your application(or chat with you) and would be excited to extend invitations to those planning on sticking around for the long haul.

I was questing in ashenvale still a really new player anyways a horde player tried to jump me he was 4 levels higher then me so i ran with no clue where i was headed. Suddenly i ended up in this new zone that felt very intimidating as i am running i see the horde is just behind then i see this horrid looking bear run down a hill and one shot the horde. So i stand there spamming the laughing emote and then suddenly that bear ends my life. Of course later i learned i was in felwood and as to why he aggroed before me guess it was luck. I do not know why but this stupid moment stands out to me its then maybe i truly realized how dangerous Azeroth was.
---
Absolutely. It's one hell of a ride. It feels tough, epic and adventurous. In many ways I wish I remembered less about it so I could have the adventure again without remembering where to go, what to prioritise etc.
---
My husband and I rolled on Myzrael, too. We're warrior + priest. What about you two?
---
I wish my family all liked one another enough to have a group chat!

ah, ya sometimes macros can be long winded for no reason, just have to make sure if there’s multiple ranks of the spell you include that. i usually shift click it right from the spell book into the macro
---
Your druid form drawings are incredible! Love it
---
I know that, but that will be 3-5 months after release, meaning I would have to deal with a 60% speed mount for that time until dire maul releases.
---
You absolutely can. The problem is that it's REALLY hard to get mana regen AND offensive stats on the same gear. 
---
So especially at lower gear levels, mana is absolutely an issue.
---
BF eh? What’s that

this is beautiful, will you upload a full picture of it?

Of all the things to get nostalgic about, not at all in love with the days of Skype and Vent. Discord is seriously the solution we didn't know existed.
---
Normally they just force a name change not a ban.
---
I wanted to add one more thing to the post, not sure anyone will see is as its been downvoted to 0 . 
---
I just joined a random bg warsong and i asked in chat who the flag carrier was gonna be. Immediately some guy calls me the "N" word. I said in chat i reported him (never done this before but i can't take the garbage anymore) and then another guy starts calling me homophobic crap so i reported him. Then them and another person wanna report me afk because im reporting these people for what they said instead of playing for those 2 minutes. This is just the point i was trying to make in my post here. There's no stopping it i know, but i thought id call it out and speak my mind and maybe some people would agree.
---
invite the  paladin /end
---
Not for a very long time, most likely never in classic.
---
If you want to get with ladies, trim the shrub, bud.
---
You picked Druid you will be laughed anyway.
---
you are not getting that name
---
I think it was hair color that changed your form not hair style, troll druids can be some colorful haired cats
---
Jesus Christ, I didn’t think I could become more excited. Thank you.
---
We have almost 5k unique accounts on the Oce Discord, and Arugal saw a queue of over 4.5k on name res launch. Needless to say the realm will be populated, you really needn't worry.

Someone's mad he didn't get his names

See I’m torn, I’d love to see classic+ come but at the same time I’d also love to see a tbc and wotlk server come out. I already play on a wotlk server bc I started playing WoW at late tbc/early wotlk so wrath has always been my favorite expansion, although after playing nost I love classic, and I loved what I got to experience of tbc so I’d love to play both I just feel like blizz is only going to do one or the other and if that’s the case I’d probably shift my vote towards tbc and wrath servers. Especially tbc because I’d love to get to experience that content now that I know a lot more about the game. Classic+ would definitely be sick and ill still be playing either way they go.
---
could be cool if dps meters would not exist.
---
Didn't you quite mess this meme format up just now?

True vanilla experience

that shit fucking error cost me my name

Is back pedaling supposed to help as well? No or less melee leeway than running striaght or strafing?
---
I got it on Thalnos just not Herod, but there is some hope in the community. Worth a try and if not, then if not.
---
I tried going back to CSGO which made sense since I played CS before WoW back in the day. First comp match I have a total troll on my team and the other team may well have two wall hackers. We lost like 16-3. I'm like oh cool same shit as always this sucks. And now I don't know what to play
---
THEN YOU ARE LOST

What realm?

The thing is there's actually no need to wait for 2 more weeks its just when they want to do it.

I only played classic a little and mostly played BC.    
---
But authentic classic wow or not, based on my conversations with friends who did a lot of classic PvP, this sounds like some shit they should overhaul.      
---
     
---
The way they described it, it had to be almost literally your entire waking life for a while.  Not to mention almost literally impossible to achieve without breaking the TOS and sharing your account.   
---
Like I understand the whole “welfare epics”!thing was a problem with later systems, but the classic system also sounds like dogshit.
---
How much?
---
Damn dude, 12 days is just too long for you huh? Lol
---
Not og enough tbh
---
I managed to get the name 'Stranger' on the EU rp-pvp server, might make a YT series called 'Stranger Dings'...
---
And a stress test weekend to boot
---
Can you do one for undead mage
---
Lot of guilds on Grobb setting up
---
What are some other examples?
---
You cannot change the druid forms in any way in Classic. Night Elves have their forms, Taurens have their own forms. There are no differences beyond this, as far as I am aware.
---
But do they speak Portuguese?  lol.
---
No one tell them.

I once dueled a 53 hunter on my 29 twink shaman and kicked his ass, the problem was hitting him for gods sake! I did have great gear, where he had greens.
---
Grobb is going to be lit fam. Can't wait to kill you RPers and then RP about how I killed you

Or the shipping tool.

It's been years since I've seen chair-related content of such high quality. Bravo. This is peak chair posting. None of the other chair posts sitting around these days can even compare.
---
Did you actually think it though before you said that? Because no, not at all.
---
grob and bloodsail
---
It’s just the recolored night elf models unfortunately. Sylvannas looks hideous
---
all 4 of them lol
---
Shiloh - Mage
---
Natura - Resto Druid
---
Chakra - rogue?
---
It’s a slippery slope mate lol, I was the same way, when they announced it I said I would never go back to WoW after all the time I soaked into it back in the day, but slowly since I’ve got more and more interested in it and a month or 2 ago I was hooked and talked all my homies into coming back too. Now I spend all day everyday on this sub or reading guides and watching videos, August 27th will be the most anticipated day in my life in years I think lol
---
You had to run in a bit to /tar Jed in actual vanilla. I remember doing this.
---
Nobody makes me bleed my own blood! NOBODY!
---
I got to 15 and memorized it for my beginning
---
I don't want to burn myself out lol
---
This. Most of us that played in classic now are working full time jobs with lives or families. I'm laughing at these guilds that are calling themselves, "hardcore" with 2 days a week for raids. My old vanilla guild in AQ and Naxx raided 6 nights a week with Saturday off for progression. What I love about Classic is how there is no rush to "beat" the game. We already know the content. This time it's all about the ride for us vanilla players that are returning. I'm going to be casual scum and I'll love it.
---
I dont know why I read „cleave significant other“ but it tool a dark turn quick.
---
I see office meme I upvote
---
Haha verry truu.. see you on the battlefield brother
---
10 year old me trying to convince a guildie he needed rehab fog doing resin rips would be disappointed by joint smoking 23 year old me. Sorry DARE
---
Hell, 12 days is too long for me as well, but at least im not going to be a dick to someone trying to pass the time in a pretty productive way....
---
They also have rez
---
26th? i thought the release date was thev27th.
---
TBH I was very happy with the draenei, goblins, worgen, blood elves. Its the panda that I dislike. They feel so cheap and uninspired.
---
Don't.
---
If I ever see someone with Rank 14 I'm going to be sending them concerned messages regarding their physical and mental health.
---
I did not specifically test this although I doubt backpedaling would help since you are still moving (so you will still trigger leeway if your target is also moving) except you are moving slower so mobs will catch up to you faster than if you just ran away. You really just want to be still until you frost nova, then you can just run away, no need for backpedaling.
---
I got Agdan as my main, Scroogemcorc as my bank alt, and Snowday if I ever decide to go mage. See you on Herod
---
I got Devil on Herod, I'm not going to give it to you.

He's talking about the person that made the thread on the wow classic forums claiming the server.
---
He's making fun of that person for thinking they have enough influence to claim an entire server when they aren't active in retail wow, and probably not in contact with many other influential people in the wow community to coornidate such a large effort.
---
I agree to be honest. I think it was just mob mentality against streamers. Someone lit a match with claiming the server and everyone threw waterbaloons full of gasoline at it. That's the only reason that the streamers chose faerlina
---
Honestly I need the name Dante on Thalnos for it. Otherwise I’m gunna main Hog
---
Guild and raid and party and player dependent

TMorph is dead. Lucid Morph, the best replacement, won’t be coming to Classic. JMorph, the new kid on the block, says they’ll be making a Classic version but explained you won’t be able to use any Retail models, just the ones already inside Classic. Both development groups also constantly remind users that their software is 100% already detected by Warden and that it’s only a matter of time before more bans come out.
---
&gt; He had a 15,000ms ping to the server
---
Ahh so Oceanic realms at 8pm every night (honour calculation).
---
You don't exactly face problems as a white guy in the gaming community. You are seen as the default and the audience to be catered to. People are vile to you because they are shitty people or you are a shitty person, not because you are a white guy. People are vile to trans people and women for simply BEING trans or women. People will react to you for personal reasons, while people will react to trans people or women for being 'other'. Do you see the difference?
---
Your cancer problem has zero relevance. It's exactly the sort of issue you can never mention and no one will harass you for it. If you were trans, you would encounter conflict for simply existing as OP has.
---
Do you not understand that it doesn't matter how a trans person acts? People are instantly going to judge them AS THEY ARE DOING IN THIS THREAD simply for being trans.
---
Damn I thought this was another stress test, oh well.
---
I guess i didnt think i needed to elaborate since....like you said, no one used it.
---
Yes, technically the 'just' overhauled it by a shitload and made it...not suck.  Whichever patch that was.
---
Looking for Rickybobby on Herod or Whitemane
---
What are you going on about? Are you okay?
---
Shoulda let everyone who helped stress test into the beta for the final week get a bit better data on numbers and stuff, also I just want to keep testing a few things lol
---
Stat weights are not what each stat provides, it's their relative strength to eachother for whatever role you're filling.
---
Lol, I love these little memories though. The “Yes! The environment just saved me!.......Oh, and now it’s just killed me” will never get old.
---
Yeah, that one.  Great for staying out of poly in a BG too =)
---
Its metaphorical!
---
hahaha that was exactly how i felt &lt;/3
---
Following the peak of Warcraft Pinterest, players hit burnout earlier and earlier in each expansion, nothing new
---
Wow... I knew there were pedants, but I've never seen one *this* bad before. Interesting.
---
1. Feral is fine as OT.      
---
2. Hunter CC is really just freezing trap. Going survival doesn't really help. You're never that desperate wyvern sting is useful (12sec 2min cd).    
---
3. Yes. Healers generate very little threat. With that begin said hunter pets do not scale at all, so I'd imagine a T3 priest going all out probably could out threat a pet but that's a pretty ridiculous situation.
---
On the Grobb discord there is several RP guilds advertising as well as in the forums.
---
Est
---
Amen. I really love playing as a draenei.
---
Wait, salvation on tank?!
---
I was in a guild that would use a turtle pet as OT in zg. I forget what boss want to say Mandokir but not sure.
---
Druids can OT raids well enough. 
---
CC is nice and a good hunter will be welcome in pretty much any group.
---
Now in cutting edge, top of the top, min/max guilds you probably won’t see any of this but it can be done.
---
Without even getting into if ret is "good" or not,you definitely should be aware of what ret actually is and that hybrids are actual hybrids in vanilla. The modern conception of a ret pally doesn't exist,pretty much your entire play style will revolve around enabling the team. With all of this in mind...No,it isn't good. You'e basically a holy paladin with less of the things that make holy paladins good.
---
"Buy classic"? What are you talking about?
---
Talk a lot of shit until a tauren walks up and slaps your girl's ass
---
I'll never forget hanging with my high level Orc Shaman friend "Oogre", killing some Murlocs in STV for fish oil, and then water walking along the coast all the way to Westfall to gank some alliance nerds
---
But why?  Why do I want to have a level 100.  I don't see the draw.
---
Its DM if your a Douchebag, the rest of us just call it VC
---
Cant help but notice a wall of butthurt

What do I mean? Is there a correlation of how close you are to the person with wether or not they are in your layer?

You don’t. No mana, and the “rotation” has no gaps between sotc/ sor

What services existed in vanilla?
---
I wouldnt trust ranked boost builds. they are janky at best.
---
best raid spec for lock is DS/Ruin or SM/Ruin
---
I thought this sounded familiar. Someone commented on this YouTube video over a year ago talking about how a lvl 1 human named Chair would go around counting all the chairs in each building... Must've been talking about you unless there's some other guy out there counting chairs lol. Guess you made an impression on some people.
---
Here's the video:

Second comment from Jim Gaither talks about you lol.

Ooh no, Thalnos
---
Makes me think there was something else to go along with it.

I have had plenty of “inappropriate” names in games (including wow) get reported. All got a name change, only ever got banned one time, and I definitely deserved the ban.

I don't remember wanting layering.

How is regrowth different on PS than on Classic? He mentions that's it's a lot worse. In what way?
---
Yeah. Scaling doesn't = myopia.

Yeah its a reflection on the state of the game more than individual expansions.

Pretty happy with that one and i also got Yk for a alt.

Most recent survey shows 55/45 horde alliance split no faction imbalance bro. Also good troll.

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

And then they wipe on first pull

Push all you want it's not happening bro
---
The bear and cat forms for Night Elves and Tauren druids does not depend on hair color in classic. There is a form model for each race.
---
you are totally right with that. i give them a month
---
I'm going back to DSL too to experience all the low speeds and bad latency yeet
---
mostly
---
More like the inevitability of the human brain and the average players lack of self moderation
---
There were Blood elves in vanilla as well. I believe they were in Azshara
---
Honestly I'd watched that server lol
---
I won't play on it but it does look like fun viewership
---
I understand where you're coming from I just disagree. I think the tight-knight aspect of keeping names and people completely unique and recognizable is more important. But I get where you're coming from.
---
Anime: overlord Mc
---
Does BC count? Mines traveling through Westfall seeing how barren and hopeless it was. Farmers at the mercy of Defias Brotherhood. Met my first guild in that zone and stuck with them for years.
---
from memory only realm transfer but even those had restrictions depending on realm and realm type
---
Up to 20k on shazz, no joke. It got to about 15k for name res and I know plenty of people who haven’t subbed yet
---
Blizzard can make sure they’ve ironed stuff out as much as possible and we get more content to watch for a few days. And yeah, it’ll get more eyes on the game. I see this as an absolute win.
---
Demonata series?
---
It blew my mind. The first few months of wow all I did was level people to about 20 and run deadmines. I don't even want to know how many times I ran it on characters I abandoned shortly after.
---
It will probably be annoying here or there, but all the major BR guilds said they are going to force their people to use English in the major channels and have consequences if they don’t, and beyond that the French Canadians are going Thalnos, but I feel like their English isn’t as bad, and after playing with both you can generally communicate you’re point just a lot of the finer details can get lost. I’d say so long as you get a decent non-Brazilian or French guild you’ll be fine, playing with them is cool, just trying to communicate during a raid or a premade bg will be a little more difficult/frustrating. Overall I’d say it won’t be that bad though, those communities just get a really bad rep from wow players because they used to be super toxic and annoying in trade/general chat, but seeing as it’s a US English server, I’d say blizz has learned from the past and will be a little better at policing it, and if not the guilds should play a good part in policing their own people. I don’t think it’ll be a bad experience, but I’d say if it is going to be you should know shortly after launch and be able to reroll before you get to invested in your character. Although that’s a tight name to lose lol

Not sure I understand

Survival is not good for 5 mans, no.
---
Are you specifically just wanting a leveling build, or an all around PvE/PvP build at max cap?  
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/5530203012201105--50502051020001](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/5530203012201105--50502051020001)  
---
This is basically what you want for a capped character for general PvE/PvP use.   
---
If you feel like you do more PvP or are interested in that more, you can move the two points in Improved Firebolt for imps into Aftermath or Cataclysm in the Destruction tree.  
---
You can also move the three points in Improved Curse of Weakness for affliction into Improved Curse of Exhaustion so you can deal with melee with a bit more ease.
---
I hope your day gets better.
---
Well me personally I wouldn't have resubbed if it wasn't for the fact that I have 350$ in blizzard credit with an extra 10 tokens and 2 million gold on my main in retail just sitting there.  Not much else ya can spend the blizz credits on amiright?
---
Deleted my herod character and made my 3 on this server. Rixtyminutes and Mortyniterun will be in the fight against the alliance scum
---
No one talked about this ones yet:  
---
\- TrinketMenu (easy swap and track your trinkets)  
---
\- ClassicCastbars (adds cast bars to target and nameplates)  
---
\- ClassicAuraDurations (adds target debuffs durations, so you can know when they are expiring)
---
a lot of guilds have push to talk only in the raid channel, it never went away
---
"Low" is supposed to entice more people, but it probably acts as more of a deterrent.
---
If we're playing the splitting hairs game, they're playable after you mind control them.
---
Well on my lvl 60 paladin that isn't the case.
---
Hair color did not change form color, not can Trolls be druids in vanilla
---
It will not be the same, the closer you can get to your nostalgia days is an rp or rp pvp server. If you dont have any obligations to play on a pvp server full of zoomers play at your closest rp or rp pvp server. Take a look at their discord and you will have a decent idea of what the community looks like. At least that's what sold me to an rp pvp server.
---
Wow :o
---
Cringe character name.
---
There’s no good solutions. Ideally they would open 100 servers, each would be filled and no one would ever quit. Unfortunately that’s not what would happen, and you’d end up with a handful of popular servers and 90 dead servers. Blizzard is probably expecting 70-80% of players to quit in the first few months given the low amount of servers per region.
---
They aren’t? They capitalised only the first word and “Blizz” which is a proper noun
---
Are you slow?

Yep, they will. His friends are all streamers and he'll be on their screens.
---
Most of these are garbage to me, but I'd take arena and LFG for my perfect game.
---
I main shaman in retail but I just cant bring myself to play shaman in classic because I dont want to be railroaded into healing in dungeons and raids since I prefer to dps, but I like to give support even as a dps.
---
I'm going Warlock because I can help with summons and cookies plus I get a neat pet.
---
Reap what you sow.
---
The “less optimal” class/spec combos take more effort to get going. I would play what you really want and just enjoy it for what it is. 
---
I hope to do feral Druid but if I either, a. Don’t have the time to put in the effort or b. Can’t find a guild willing to let me raid as feral, I have no issue going resto. Then again maybe I’ll just do my warrior alt at that point.
---
Do you know what you just did?..
---
You'll never see your friend again.
---
Shadowkillz the undead twink is no hero
---
If you have time and drive yes
---
I am still on it. Phasing, cross-realm playing and modern dungeon and raid finder tools help, but it is incredibly difficult to start a guild. Beyond that, it's just absolutely sad and lonely. Truly it is the Forgotton Coast.
---
Either a gnome warrior, rogue or warlock.
---
From that statement it doesn't sound like they are going to be inviting anyone else in, just letting those who got in previously.
---
Espionage - Human Paladin
---
(whoever took the name Espionage on a few different realms... best enjoy it :p)
---
Jokes on you.  I was an min/max elitist jerk in real vanilla, not some private server.
---
(And yeah I'm excited to do it again, min-max style.)
---
This is great!! A lot of leveling guide content creators will be able to tweak, fine-tune, and update their guides before launch!! Hehe
---
xfire was ahead of its time
---
I got DrKevorkian for my priest
---
Thanks so much!
---
Its VC. The official strategy guide has it as VC. In vanilla we called it VC
---
ＹＥＳ
---
You need to pump those numbers up. Those are rookies numbera.
---
They will open more servers if that many players are playing actively on a server.
---
^^ this.
---
Way to mooch off the other dude
---
OH NO
---
It's interesting because it makes more SENSE but it doesn't necessarily make it better as a game
---
Yep. They had a 6 month cool down too i think.
---
ALL Bosses have 1000 more armor on private servers. That's just one of the differences, there's also a huge parrry chance difference.

KTM is the addon you want, but I don't think it's done for classic yet. Expect it or something very similar very early on tho.

Increase gain, and move the mic close to your mouth as it should be. Also don't get an omnidirectional microphone.

Honestly, on my dwarf way back in the day that was half the fun. I remember going through Stonetalon on the quest for the chest piece quest and checking my six every five minutes as I ran through the Barrens.
---
Doombrew, dwarf hunter
---
Heck ya man, go get em!
---
I don't. But I don't have an omnidirectional microphone, and it's on a mic boom so I place it right up to my mouth. So I can have the gain really high.
---
Still enough to have a relatively populated server, especially if you take into account that original Vanilla was plus or minus around the 3k mark per server. We're not NA, we'll never have the same population.
---
This sort of crap wasn't really that widespread back during vanilla days.. Internet culture these days is kinda cringey in general, though. I guess it was bound to leak into WoW
---
If Im not mistaken you should get shoul shard also when player dies under drain soul.
---
Awesome man, feel free to friend me on Discord if you want to check it all out before launch. Otherwise, I'll hopefully see you on the other side!
---
Nope :) but what a great game!
---
Not to mention the arena system (which is the standard for competitive pvp since tbc) pits you against every team in your battlegroup/ region and actually requires you to win a significant amount more than you lose in order to obtain the best rewards.

Yes! It's actually the first book I read in the series. It stands completely on its own and it probably has the best ending I have ever read. Its been so long yet the ending has stayed with me to this today. I love that book, I can't remember the rest of the series clearly but man Bec will always have a place in my heart

---
vs   
---
https://youtu.be/SbmEZUIgOAI?t=720 - pserver speedrun patchwerk kill by fury warrior at over 1700dps
---
More than fine. It's probably the best Paladin spec for dungeons. Blessings, off-heals, stuns, can take a few hits, and they can even help resurrect the dead (for those Druid healers). If my healer isn't a Paladin, then I will actively seek out a Ret for my groups.
---
I even think one Ret is fine for raids too. The key word there is *one*. You need a certain number of dedicated healers. You can't really afford to have 2 or 3 of your Paladins swinging their weapons unless you're just stacked with healers (rarely happens).
---
&gt;  I know they can't main tank raids, but how viable are bear tanks at off tanking in raids?  
---
This is not true and especially during the early phases they will be desirable MT's, if you actually farm consumables and mcp's you can generate the best threat and it is not too difficult to mass up a good amount of armor.
---
It is definitely possible to MT as a druid in raids but mcp farming is sort of necessary if that's a put off.
---
I was thinkin more like Roger Wilco, it had even shittier voice quality 😁

It's during the week so that they have staff in the office to fix stuff if things go wrong.

2500 was also the cap for original vanilla servers so yeah, layering will be here for a long while or servers will be overcrowded
---
I am hosting my own matrix-synapse server which I intend to try and get completely up and running for my guild.
---
It's FOSS, very similar to discord in ux and features, only it has support for end to end encryption so absolutely no one but the participants know what's going on.
---
The client for the server is usually riot. Https://riot.im

What MMORPGS are you familiar with?
---
for real, the vent logo guy's mic is *way* too close to its lips
---
You buff the raid and get free rides through it putting in minimal effort, oh and you destroy people in PvP.
---
I mean....its not wrong LUL
---
Have to take into account drop off aswell. But i also know not everyone planning to play classic are on forums ect.
---
Just edited the post, OSRS, Rohan Blood Feud, BDO, the best ones I played
---
Best way to experience it man.  Everyone's getting a fresh start and it really doesn't matter how much exp you have.  
---
It's such a unique game at this point that you would be doing yourself a disservice by skipping it if you like MMO's.
---
Do you need the last word? Fine by me haha, looks like the conversation is over anyways. If you need that friend feel free to DM me, I'm playing on Pagle we can quest together or something :)
---
It's going to be piss easy to build an ideal group if you are looking for dps.
---
He's talking about the caption in the ad, not OP.
---
And how can you be sure it won't be dead in 2 months? Seems to make more sense if they added a few now and let people make characters early
---
Unnecessary, dude.
---
lol
---
I got a better name ;)
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
Your ruining the classic experience for yourself if you get to choose your own name, without having to use use foreign characters.
---
Wouldn't worry. I've been putting together a guild for Arugal and we've got plenty of people showing interest every day. I'm assuming many people didn't bother to resub just to grab names, so launch day and the first month as a whole I'd argue we see a gigantic influx of players.
---
I think the warrior population will drop off sharply around 30-40 when people that never played warriors before start getting fatigued.
---
.....
---
they probably will upscale capacity as they did with some other realms I guess
---
It sounds like they'll just keep making as many layers as necessary. If that's true even an 11k queue could go fast.
---
Rolled one before and actually enjoyed leveling. Everytime I roll another class I find myself drooling over playing a warrior again.
---
Will have a lot of friends playing also so that makes grouping up a tad easier aswell.
---
&gt; there will be so many warriors at 60 that its hard to find groups.
---
There's always 6 groups looking for a warrior tank. Some will even pay to have you come with them.
---
But what you need to worry about is raids.
---
It's pretty crowded with warriors so raid spots will be a problem.
---
give him his name back!
---
It's weird that he asked for help with viability then wants to argue about it.
---
Mcp farming is this pri... unofficial server talk?
---
$10?  I feel sorry for you that you have to think twice before spending that.
---
True enough that moderation in volume is often lost on passionate-to-a-fault communities.
---
haha that me
---
With friends it will ease a lot of the growing pains. I say go for it.
---
yeee
---
lolvya stoletheshowwww
---
What kind of dogshit post is this
---
Got it for my alt!
---
&gt;I just think its weird that this is what players want. A game that restricts you to certain specs if you are trying to do the best.
---
I'm in the same boat as you, I want all specs and classes to be useful, but there are always only going to be so many "best" ways of doing anything.  That's actually one of the reasons I generally run dungeons instead of raids, the game (and many others) is much more diverse and "fun" when death isn't on the line
---
Not only hispanic people, it's taught like that in France and/or most of its former colonies(Italy, Spain,Portugal, etc). I just wanted to point out that the analogy might not be that good because that's a very relative thing for a lot of people.
---
And to all the people downvoting me just because i said America is a continent jeez stop being crybabies, as i said i guess it just depends on where we went to school.
---
maybe, but yesterday evening the pop was medium and now its full so it could be possible that they just downscaled the servers...
---
This bitch arts
---
The obvious answer, however that required copious amounts of pre-fight farming and or gold. Which got compounded when you also needed to farm materials or money for Resistance potions and Flasks.
---
Other classes had much better ways of managing their mana in raid fights than Paladins did.
---
What does "LF1" mean ?
---
Short answer : yes
---
Long answer: hell yeeeah!
---
Leatrix Plus (Classic) and Vendor Price are all I need until I get more abilities and bag space. Probably well into my 20's.
---
MAYBE auctionator. Maybe.
---
I had forgotten about this amazing post.
---
Jaina the undead Warlock
---
People got Garrosh and other big characters so i dont think any are
---
Know how to tank and they'll roll out the red carpet.
---
You do mean retail right? Because in classic you have to be level 2
---
Detail Classic, LunaUnitFrames, prat3, tiptac, omnicc, questie, vendorprice, selljunk and weakauras
---
thanks. 
---
Also is there any info on what servers will be like? Mostly I'm just looking for a 50/50 server or an alliance pve focused one if it's possible to know that.
---
It is when you factor in how many people haven't heard about it or bothered to join. I have 9 other friends who'll be playing on OCE and none of them are on the discord.
---
I have "Tyson", "Autism", "Scooter". 
---
Im on EU Shazzrah, if you're interested on playing there :)
---
I’ve got a group of 5 all in our late 20s rolling on Fairbanks... we could be interested
---
Everybody wants to roll PVP... As long as the faction imbalance is heavily in their favor.
---
Hope you arent alliance scum......
---
They will be packed, don't worry. 1 PvP server won't be enough.
---
&gt; it's absolutely nothing like a server merge 
---
&gt; because inside jokes and guild names
---
Are you seriously this stupid or?
---
Every guild needs a housecat.
---
I literally built a new computer last week to get back into this. 
---
Tossed it up for about a year before I just pulled the pin.
---
Nop, but most of those people were level 1s, and its just total characters seen, 1 character != 1 person, and I had over 50 hrs played on the stress test
---
Leatrix has fast looting baked in. Is the separate one even better somehow?
---
Insert comparison of empty ironforge vs nost peak pop ironforge—-
---
Questy is better than AAP (in its current incarnation, at least).
---
Questy + Leatrix Plus (for auto quest accept/turning etc).
---
I don't
---
Yeah but keep in mind that each player has 3 chars.
---
LOL catfished by trannies
---
Arent these targeted ads?
---
Well, the problem is - without massive intake of new employees, time and money wow development team can't create a lot of content from level 1 to max AND enough content to retain players on max level. Look at bfa - it barely had enough content on release without really doing anything relevant to leveling experience.
---
Classic Blizzard underestimating vanilla
---
Its about the number of subs having their singular character there
---
Alex is a big part of the reason we have classic in the first place
---
To be fair: most threads by new people explicitly ask „what‘s best for x“ or „is x or y bettet at z?“ and then you always have some dude answering „play what you like. :)“ in the comments, when the OP (new or not) clearly wanted an answer that takes performance potential into consideration.
---
That‘s every bit as annoying.
---
The Highmountain are sick, leave them alone!
---
But isn't it still kind of the same on retail? The zones only start scaling with your level when you reach their minimal required level. So if you are level 10 and wander to stv, you are going to have a bad time.
---
Only thing I noticed different is the mob level inside one zone. In classic, there is a lot more danger to visit a questhub that you should only go to after a certain progression inside its zone. That's what I'm missing aswell.
---
It has nothing to do with scaling, leveling in 80-90 was super fast for a long time. Required xp on all lvls was nerfed, because otherwise it will just take to much time to level.
---
i.e. as long as they're likely to win and unlikely to get ganked. That sums up WoW's "World PvP" quite nicely.
---
Could also go with Noodle for a windserpent
---
Your hypocrisy makes me happy and now I know why I don't have to take you seriously anymore.
---
Thank you.
---
Clearly two bears in love but tragically separated by a wall.
---
Someone didn't get their name!
---
This. Most satisfying thing in the stress test was clearing half of SFK with my guildies. Yes, stress test as lvl 15, doing a 22-30 dungeon. Didnt finish but killed half the bosses.
---
And an innervate button.
---
Legion was so smooth, my brain has completely forgotten the launch.
---
D3 was mostly broken on American servers, I was fine on EU.
---
I just cried like a little bitch.
---
WoW has been a big part of my life for 10 years now. I came in mid-bc and spent half of that xpac leveling my first toon. I got a small taste of classic at that time because onyxia and naxx were still kind of hard and people were still running them on level 60's. I always regretted not getting into the game at release.
---
I'm over the moon to be a part of this. This will be the strongest gaming addiction I'll have since I started 10 years ago. No other game has compared.
---
Also going to get one PC from 2001 and old internet connection back. Gonna love 15fps and disconnect every 30mins  
---
\#nochanges
---
I've playee on both PVE and PVP servers.
---
Camping is not as common or as bad as most people make it out to be, and if it is, just switch toons or take a smoke break. It's not the end of the world.
---
PVE has its own charms. My favorite thing to do was stealth and skin mobs Allies killed before they could click. I've gotten angry whispers, and those are always fun.
---
Nope, warlocks can actually level faster by selling their armor and dagger at lvl 1 to get early immolate.
---
They didn't actually have caps back in vanilla.
---
The only cap was how the server load, which is why queues were a thing. They didn't only go down because someone logged out and opened a slot, but because the server load changed.
---
Last two steps already taken care of long ago
---
&gt;seeing as osrs and rs3 are separate
---
Yeah, and both never make it high up on the category page because of it. That was a dumb decision.
---
It’s been 15 years since the vanilla launch. A bunch of the people who will play wouldn’t have even been born yet.
---
Online gaming culture has also changed a lot since I played during vanilla. I’m also a lot older and wiser myself. You can’t expect the game to be the same culturally and that probably means attitudes will be different to what they were back then. 
---
I think you better prepare yourself that this will be different and the people will have definitely changed. Wether it will be a good thing or a bad thing is yet to be seen. If this makes you anxious, I suggest you have a back up single player game in mind.
---
Don't think theres a decent one yet, but i expect there will be soon as it's a very important addon.
---
Played hunter in vanilla, and I'm torn between that and shaman as I've found a long for healing since then.
---
Tauren Warrior named Hercules
---
I literally created a fresh warlock. Sold everything and bought immolate at lvl 1.
---

---
My realm list just says "Incompatible" for every realm.
---
Is Luna unit frames available ? If not is there one just like it?
---
That was me in TBC, then when I finally accepted that didn't work, I tried to tank with resilience gear from PvP.
---
"You're just having a bad day; there are lots of nice people in WoW."
---
There are definitely "nice people" who play WoW, i never mentioned or insinuated there weren't. My point was that the online gaming community is no doubt more toxic than when the original WoW was launched and that people who played this game originally (or are trying now) are not going to get the same experience because of that.
---
Ah yes, that sweet WotLK pre-patch. I remember doing Shattered Halls HC with a T6 warrior who was losing his shit because my PvP/Karazhan geared Ret with Gorehowl was out-dpsing him.
---
It was, of course, completely busted and they nerfed them again later.
---
That's the trick. PvE servers still have PvP events, but they're opt-in. Many players won't do that, but many will. In actual "Vanilla" I spent more than half my time PvPing even though I was on a PvE server. 
---
I'm torn because I want that same level of "fun", without having to have my leveling experience be at someone elses mercy. 
---
TL:DR
---
I get wanting to avoid PvP while leveling, but wanting to have it as an option.
---
Dont worry got a wife and two preschool kids, that kills just about everything related to gaming :D
---
"Did you reserve your name?"
---
"No."
---
"...Oh."
---
I have my opinion sure, but it is more funny how defensive people are getting that it is a certainty. I just don't give a rats ass either way, and most of the white knighting doesn't seem to have much to offer other than it will happen -- I just wanted a discussion, but thanks for trying.
---
and I thought I knew this game
---
Yeah, figure most people who are going to play classic aren't saving names 2 weeks before launch anyway.
---
I wasn’t any different from you and so many others. Wanted to watch classic vids, watched his, learned this. That’s the real reason why I’m passionate in sharing this: because we deserve a better class of streamer. Not some criminal narcissist. The day he and Soda (who wants to run the game like a GM) buggers off, the game will be the better for it. 
---
As for how true it is, you make it sound like you couldn’t spend 2 minutes googling to find out. You should.

The Brutallus warlock experience: Curse of Elements -&gt;  Shadow Bolt... and literally nothing else.
---
I didnt know much when I started, so I went tauren. It's not stun resist, but war stomp was nice for making sure you got the FD trap because most rogues wouldnt waste a trinket on it.
---
I was just thinking the other day that the mythic+ dungeons are exactly this, and the only reason anyone subjects themselves to them is because there is this idea built around it that if you're good enough you'll be famous for it.
---
i must have bloomed early.
---
TBC and WotLK were bad for the long term health of the game in some of the features they introduced. Grindings tokens to get BiS gear, heirloom items making levelling alts much easier, flying mounts, mounts with vendors on them, daily quests, LFG and hand out epics started getting introduced
---
As a tank i dont care. Im not carrying shitdps who fights me for loot. No invite.
---
Play ret pally. Have fun playing ret pally. Do not expect to get picked up in groups.

Just to be clear, you edited this after I commented. You're not correcting me, you're just saying what you meant.

They're welcome to play and exist like everyone else... as long as it's away from the other children.
---
You don't even need to install the starter pack. I didn't have enough space for retail WoW so I was fretting about needing an external hard drive.
---
Tried again the day after but noticed there was a drop down and there was WoW classic to download.
---
I am in Nova Scotia going to Thalnos or Grobbulus probably. I am even thinking about EU to avoid Americans and their Trump/Wall chat.
---
Ofc people can play how they want! Nobody can stop you, however that also goes for party/raid leaders and how they build their group comp
---
i personally love how no ones even mentioning prot paladins
---
So between the 2 of you, you could not figure out how to get on google or search for a blizzard post?
---
I mean it seems like I'm trying to buy a car but asking flight attendants on how I should go about buying one...
---
Classic has always only required an active sub.
---
Me and the boys are gonna be getting wasted at a nerd convention in Atlanta that weekend... 
---
I imagine the servers are going to be crap that weekend anyways. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'll get in when I get in. Lol
---
You know you don't need to buy anything anymore? You just have to pay a sub and you have everything untill last expansion, if you wanna play retail and you wanna be lvl120 you only need BFA Expansion to buy. If you wanna play Classic WoW you only need to buy a sub. No more base game buy need.
---
A fully optimized feral (power shifting plus helm, and crowd pummelers) can put out some pretty solid dps.
---
Orc warrior named Orcnbeans
---
My brother is an orc shaman named Shoxnprox
---

---
okay so holy pallys are decent healers, and ret keeps getting hated on for raiding. but how come no one talks about prot pallys?
---
Horse shit.   There's plenty of advertising they can do that's basically free.
---
True
---
I hate hunters because of their cc, but in 3s most of my comps I play beat heavy cc comps like Cupid and rmx
---
&gt; twitch prime is free to anyone with a prime account so they are doing it at no cost to themeslf
---
Well, you are still paying for it. Or your mom is. :)
---
And he didnt just get prime subs, the screen went like hitting a jackpot from all kinds of subs and donations. How many of his viewers just "happened to have" free prime sub up at that moment. I tend to use it every time its available.
---
You must be fun at a Party. Do you even know the Rick &amp; Morty lifestyle?

---
Ret Paladin as your main DPS is a bad idea. Ret Paladin as a supplemental DPS is the best support class a dungeon group can get. It's the ultimate "we might not be the fastest group, but it's going to be smooth and safe all the way" move.
---
Ret Pally rhetoric is perfect for the game. They aren't optimal to raid with and people should know that.
---
$2? I know a mage who could've gotten it to you for free!
---
You run out of mana and die quicker, it’s definitely harder.
---
With spell batching being in 400ms windows - I don't think latency is going to be that big of a deal, really. Anything under 100 will feel 'normal'.
---
(fwiw, 300ms in vanilla wow was green-bar latency)
---
Which is why classic offers a different chance for blizzard. If enough players keep at it, eventually they will learn a different strategy and course correct retail or add content to classic.
---
Correct :)
---
what?
---
So much this
---
Yeah, ok. That was pretty good.

---
Red light, Alliance background. This disturbs me.
---
i assume you consecrate as well for extra damage, which is pretty expensive
---
No one has the numbers, unfortunately. I think we can assume they're the numbers that Blizz expects (as they haven't announced new servers yet).
---
People can play however they want, but someone dreaming of being a shaman tank is going to have a real bad time in Classic

GET OUT! I was so sure to lvl my mage first and now i see your sheet and am unsure again!!!! Thanks for NOTHING!

btw, nice sheet you have there! ;)

In eu its the midnight between 26th and 27th
---
Have a portfolio?!
---
26th NA, don't know the time tho. 
---
27th EU, at 0:00.
---
Make some effort and just use Google for once. It's very easy to access information.
---
I agree so much, I honestly think that because the game is so much more difficult it forces you to be engaged and is therefore a lot more FUN to play.. In retail the only way I ever used to play was by zoning out HARD while Netflix/Youtube was in the background
---
Yeah we forced people to use this
---
Imagine only wanting people to play the way you play
---
Idk if no arena is a good thing...
---
&gt;I've been hearing a lot about how good bear druids are at tanking 5 man content. I know they can't main tank raids, but how viable are bear tanks at off tanking in raids? Or is it helpful to have a DPS feral druid with tank gear for the occasional off-tanking duty for fights like Garr and Majordomo that have lots of adds?
---
Are survival hunters that focus on CC helpful for 5 man content? I remember CC being much more important in vanilla and I used to play a hunter that would tie up 2-3 mobs at a time on 5 man content. I'm planning on playing the hunter more for PvP, but I always enjoyed focusing on CC in 5 man instances.
---
Can a tanky hunter pet like a turtle reliably hold aggro over a healer?
---
1. feral druid can main tank, but requires a bit more time to get to that point.
---
2. There is the odd fight where CC is needed but not a priority.
---
3. Yes
---
To Crossrooooaaads...
---
Lmao this is some good shit that I didn't get into until like 2010 tbh.
---
Hit me with that bodom, arch enemy, dimmu trifecta
---
Luckily my boss is gonna play too.
---
Honest question I am not trolling, why ret? Holy is the best healer spec in the game. Best buffs, best heals, vs. Ret which is essentially a very low dps warrior. What is the appeal of actively gimping yourself?
---
You had me in the first half, not gunna lie
---
...how is that relevant?
---
Undead Rogue. Say hi to your new stabdad!

It is. No one gives a fuck if you rp or not as long as you don't troll people.
---
Fuck I miss exorcism and holy wrath
---
Multiple low pop servers still
---
Do most players understand that the experience on a RP PvP server is very similar to a PvP server?
---
Do most players understand that you can have World PvP on a PvE server? Especially now that we have a discord for each it's easier than ever to organize WPvP, like Tarren Mill fights, on a PvE server.
---
I'm sure loads on people rolling on the pure PvP servers have made an informed choice, but it still seems like a significant number of people picking PvP believe the difference between what you can do on different server types is larger than in reality. perhaps some are worried to be called "not normal" for playing on a RP or "Normal" server! :D
---
There's a big difference between rp server mentality and rp pvp mentality. Also alliance has a stronger preference to RP than horde. So you hardly notice it.
---
Now with people who just wanna avoid toxic guilds like exiled, progress, apes etc. finding home on the RP PvP server it's even less noticable.  
---
Also if you check the servers discord you will see that everyone is just more mature and polite without much RP going around.
---
I say give look at each servers discord before you chose your home.  Remever that you will stay there, maybe a meme server will not feel like home in your long run.
---

Yeah that's pretty stupid. What kind of moron would even assume such a thing?
---
"I think you better prepare yourself that this will be different and the people will have definitely changed. Wether it will be a good thing or a bad thing is yet to be seen. If this makes you anxious, I suggest you have a back up single player game in mind."
---
I guess the reason i made this post in the first place was i see alot of old players coming back to play classic, and the post that i see on here from them they are all so excited to "bring back the old days" And yet its going to be so different because of that new culture.  
---
I guess anyone who has still been doing online gaming since that time period knows well what to expect. If not then here's a warning. 
---
If you ask in chat for a battleground or instance group and you get called a f*g or c*nt or "N" word,  welcome to the new world of warcraft and dont get mad,  just move along.
---
If this could get posted a few thousand more times in the next couple of days that'd be awesome.
---
The haste enchants definitely aren't worth it but at least there are several haste talents! I hadn't even looked back at the Vanilla talent trees until last night. Of course, this isn't going to make 8/27 get here any sooner, unfortunately.
---
no ty ret, ill stick with people who arent looking to get carried
---
There's still a low pvp realm. EU has both full.
---
it might be worth mentioning that name reservation is an especially poor population marker in this case, as both RP realms essentially "broke" for the first ~40 minutes of name reservation and no one was able to get in! some people likely gave up assuming their names were taken after the first few minutes (i was almost one of these people haha, thankfully i discovered nobody else could get in either!)
---
I’ve got Teeth, Dentures, and Cavity if you want any of em.
---
Looks like you got plenty left.
---
You don't see this much passion in retail.
---
EU has two english PvP servers.
---
You're giving their stream free content either way lol.
---
Aaaaand one more time! 
---
By the end of the day, I bet there will be about 20 more posts about servers being full.
---
I think it's just a meme for gullible people at this point. Surely people don't think there's 10,000 people staring at a login screen at 2am in USA 2 days after character creation launched?
---
Never played a private server and I remember Deadmines being called VC. This was during the BC pre-patch rather than Vanilla proper, but still. It didn't start on private servers.
---
Yeah, lvl 45 gaurds as compared to the elite lvl 55's in places like... uh, memory fails - the horde outpost so conveniently positioned right next to the sunken temple that takes alliance 45 minutes of travel to get to
---
Lmaooooo 💯
---
*Nice*

For Discord at least the mics by default use auto adjusting sensitivity. They open automatically only when you talk, not when there's background noise. In my experience it's pretty spot on of you set it up right. But mechanical keyboards and game speakers still set it off...
---
I initially set up my Legion guild's discord server with PTT literally required to speak in the raid channel, because Discord offered that as an option. I made a special bright pink role for "Snowflake who can't use PTT" for the people who bitched to get permission to use voice activation.
---
Got a couple of good Malazan names for my mage: Kruppe and Adaephon  (for Quick Ben).
---
Got Flanders for my rogue, an old staple of mine.
---
I love how you think you have to pay 70 dollars when a simple google search shows you classic will only require you to have an active sub. Would you also like to know why some advertising/blue posts say the 27th and others the 26th for release?
---
lol u got me
---
Do flat earthers believe in timezones?
---
Great idea. I have couple of thoughts about appearance. First of all I'd try to get rid of that blue color. It's very close to default color of Android Apps and make them look pretty cheap. I'd try something like yellow which makes people more thing about world of warcraft. Also even banner image is pretty cool it is from Warldords of Draenor.
---
But overall features work pretty nice and app is fast. Feature I really would like to see is kinda "shopping list" that I can store into my phone (doesn't need to be server or anything). I'd like to store what skills I decided to buy and not buy. Maybe even add up prices so I can check "If I visit trainer at level 14, I need 4s 50c to get all skills I want to have). Also having talent order stored would be pretty nice, like in [https://www.bobo-talents.com/](https://www.bobo-talents.com/)
---
I also managed to reserve 4. When the servers launched i could make them.
---
To reproduce just make a character and keep the Enter key pressed through all the errors and in a minute the character will be created.
---
If anything it's actually the complete opposite of a special case for PVE only. Korea is probably the most competitive region for video games in the world, so not having a PVP server was incredibly headscratching as someone from the west. Maybe it's just because I used to idolize Drakedog and such back in the day watching his youtube videos and maybe my view is skewed, but if any place in the world seems like PVP is the natural assumption of a realm type, it would be Korea.

So are you saying that ret palas doesn't struggle to do more damage than the tanks while offer nothing a holy pala can also offer?

That's all well and good, but we have to play with Kiwis, region lock them out I reckon.

I'm a software engineer I do a lot of audiobooks, but I def will still binge read a bit. Chaos seed is really enjoyable when it's not being super cringey. Check out Brandon Sanderson he has a bunch of books all set in the same universe, each series with its own really cool magic. I'd start with Elantris and Warbreaker(both standalone novels but warbreaker is must read before the 2nd Stormlight book) then go on to the first 3 Mistborn books then on to my favorite series Stormlight Archives.
---
Nice sheet though!
---
&gt; if youre going all the way down the enh tree, why would you not get stormstrike as 19/31/0
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; I know you want the 100% extra crit for all spell damage, but if youre gonna do that, you might as well get lightning reach too. And 5 talents in getting chain lightning faster cast.
---
20/30/0 is the highest dps spec achievable by a shaman.
---
Lol, bumping doesn't do anything on Reddit
---
I would guess as easy-to-level alts for farming and pvp.
---
They should not have been :(
---
well be fine :)

This is relatable content. I haven't played in years and my highest character is at 110. My guild was a tight group from Vanilla through WotLK. Although only a few still play currently, we get together from all across the country every summer for a long weekend reunion. This year we had our get together last weekend and everyone is hyped up for Classic. And now we must wait...
---
LGBT is a country  ???  Who cares about sexuality in a vidéo game and thé srver they play on!!! 2005 was si great because we were  a gamers community. This propaganda makes me sick.Are they going to play with gay only?ridiculous. I won't play on their Server ,thèse people are fascists
---
Thank you! Guess its just fill in the cracks and meet new people and help them. You rock!
---
This, I understood why they had it but now with good internet and computers its just stupid to have it
---
Level scaling in ESO has actually made the game much more enjoyable as ALL content is ALWAYS relevant. Period. 
---
With WoW you have dead zones nobody bothers with and so much bloat that smart people question if resources could have been better allocated. But this issue goes all the way back to classic.
---
On a side note. Leafing through atlasloot while flying is one of my favorite things. Looking at gear I want to get based on stats or looks.

The medium realm Thalnos is basicly blacklisted  out of fear of being stuck playing with non-english speakers.(not making comentary on whether this is a valid fear or not)

For dungeons that's how I played too.

For raids however it's different.

So, back to the Stone Age then?

It’s amazing how so many of us were there since og beta and launch and yet have completely different views on how vanilla actually was.

Jesus its a good thing I played other mmos before and after wow, would hate to walk around with blinders on all the time.

I completely forgot about spell ranks that you can find in the world. Awesome!

So the germans are logged in looking at their characters but not the french?

It have showed full since they opened. What are the germans doing for all this time?

For those who miss skittish week

Nice One.  The Wallpaper simply points out an important thing classic is about and what I am missing:
---
Hearthing back to closy placed like Ironforge and Taverns in Stormwind after a long questing grind or chasing the enemy faction in the wide world of Azeroth..
---
Crafting stuff and potions and managing auctionhouse
---
I wanted to go grob but some coworkers were weirded out by it being RP. RP servers are hilarious and have the best pvp. No faith in the economy
---
It doesn't work like that.
---
I don't believe that is the case. No way 4 servers worth of people are full now but during the night of creation opening only herod was full. Seems unlikely.
---
I wish modern WoW still had tokens lol.
---
I much preferred it to the slot machine we have now, where even if you finally got the drop it didn't titan forge with a socket so it's worthless. It's way too much like Diablo now except you can't farm the gear nearly as quick.

Same, I got the name Onslaught for my warrior, I'm pretty hyped to PVP on it
---
Yep, none taken as well. Been burnt out for the last 6 weeks or so struggling to avoid wasting any PTO. I'm only taking a week though at release. Then another week towards the end of Sept. 
---
I took a week for BFA and frankly that's about the limit my body can take of 24/7 gaming. 2 weeks would be danger zone. Be careful everyone!
---
Gnome mage named "Gorkigonk", gnome warrior named "Glimirn" and a dwarf rogue named "Thardim".
---
She’s a hunter and I’m a priest. We plan on taking our time and leveling slowly, since we only have a couple nights a week we can play together.
---
I had my main transferred off. In the process my benediction went with him too :(
---
I have watched gozu. 
---
Very talented rogue.  
---
Payo is pretty bad in my honesty opinion, but he has a weird culture on that stream lol
---
I used to farm shards in pvp
---
It’s not that bad, but certainly requires focus. You should look into melee dungeon leveling groups as warriors will probably get the most benifit from dungeon leveling. Keep your weapon up-to-date and get as many ways to heal yourself as possible and you should be fine.
---
You can just look it up. It depends on your hardware, so we can't really tell you what is recommended for you to play smoothly if we don't know what you are playing with.
---
I think most people don't care so much about the damage, but the fact that Ret gameplay amounts to Judge-&gt;Seal-&gt;wait 15 seconds-&gt;Judge-&gt;Seal while auto-attacking.
---
The lack of proper gameplay for so many classes/specs is probably what will decimate the server population long before the grind will. Good micro makes grind bearable. But if you don't even have any buttons to press because "game design" didn't factor into the decision back in 2004, then it's just a matter of time until patience runs out.
---
Even with the modern laptops released? Like are dedicated graphics an absolute necessity for classic wow?
---
My job here is done, cya
---
If there is no option (all servers retained players) a new one can be opened.
---
They’ll be coming.
---
I got Leeroy, thinking it wouldn’t work. I was wrong, and now have a main that’s forced into human (was going dwarf)
---
Now I’ll never get invited to a raid.
---
&gt; I am in a discord right now for a guild that is planning to raid with a "bring whatever you want" mentality, with the invite post specifically mentioning boomkin and retadins.
---
&gt; So it still definitely exists. Whether we'll clear any content remains to be seen.
---
As long as you can read guides this should not be an issue.
---
For me, and how I have tried to explain it to others, is it comes down to your character.
---
In retail, your character is a homogeneous goo. You are only slightly different than any other character. You only have slightly different things to do. And those things to do reset every 3-6 months, taking away whatever individualism you gained. If you ask someone in retail what the name of their shoulders are, they won't know. They probably don't even know the name of their weapon.
---
In classic, your character is an individual. You aren't like any classes, you aren't even like others of your own class. You can go at your own pace, you can do what is important to you (raiding, pvp, crafting, dungeons, etc) and improve on that. Maybe you play a class where you can become known as 'that lockpicking / portal guy.' You know you have a Dal'Rends you farmed UBRS for 52 times. Your progress won't get taken away from you and you will always have something to work toward, instead of being jumped ahead to the start of the next milestone.
---
Even if you have very limited playtime, you can watch your character grow because levelling is an investment. The average /played is 10-11 days to 60. If you can only play 8 hours a week, you have 33+ weeks of content before you are even level 60.
---
It is going to be a long 13 days.
---
What? I thought the Elves In Azshara were HighBorne (AKA Nagas)

I'm on vacation until the 29th. My girlfriend will be with friends 31st-1st. So i have loads of time to play for myself and with my best friend on that weekend.

I was playing on oceanic server during stress test because of the low pop. I had about 250 ms but there was no noticeable lag.
---
He's undead. If he's Forsaken, that means he is part of Sylvanas's faction. He's a high ranking member of the Scarlet Crusade who fell to the undead plague. This is a no-no because the Scarlet Crusade as a whole is supposed to be immune to the plague via special blessings and ritual; being immune to turning undead is part of how the Crusade draws in members.
---
True but I was just being facetious because I'm tired. But being OCE, I doubt we will have overcrowding or a new server.
---
There are people playing on those still. We could use another pvp server instead of one of the pve servers though.
---
On German servers can you create both factions on PvP or do you literally choose one and that’s it because there are no other pvp servers?

I was playing in Iraq in 2009 and I had major ping like that too. Though I got my first character to max level and actually managed to get some ICC boss kills in too. PVP in Wintergrasp was...interesting.
---
It's a dell xps 13 with integrated graphics (HD 630 I'm pretty sure) I dont want 200+ fps I just want to know if I'd be able to run it at stable fps even if it's on the lowest settings possible
---
It's a lot of fun. Secondary skills are very useful. You will really appreciate weapon upgrades. So many different aspects of the game come into play with warriors. There's a lot to think about. Hamstring is such a great skill. Helps you run away from bad situations ;-)
---
Sent you a PM.
---
See, I definitely love the wpvp of vanilla and I’m super excited for it, but something about arena, especially into the higher brackets where people are skilled, feels so much more challenging and strategic which I really like. Wpvp is definitely hella fun but I feel like after so long you’re either ganking, getting ganked, dueling the other faction or doing a bg with you’re entire toolkit(consumes prof items etc.)
---
Don’t confuse timezone with physical hosting location. Blizzard only hosts realms in Chicago and Los Angeles, but sometimes EST realms are hosted in LA and sometimes PST realms are hosted in Chicago. 
---
It would make sense that given the opportunity to create new realms, Blizzard would choose the data center that best aligns with the labeled timezone, but we simply don’t know yet.
---
Best case for you is that Herod ends up in LA. Worst case is that Herod ends up in Chicago. Both outcomes are completely playable and you’re unlikely to notice any difference. 
---
I’ll be running traceroutes for Herod the moment the game launches and will post here and in the Herod Discord to let everyone know where it’s actually located.
---
Classic will run fine on a potato.

I used regular black Staedtler liners in 3 different thicknesses. (.05mm, .2mm, 1mm)

Lmao I leveled my paladin when seal of command got that buff that day. 65-70 guild took me straight into BT on it that night. I was keeping up with the raid that day, it was INSANEEEEE the damage ret put out for that first week of the patch. 😭😭
---
I don't think you understand how classic pvp is
---
I did it first time round 15 years ago before I knew better.
---
It's definitely one of the harder classes to solo level... But... If you get to know a small group and you play together it's really fun.
---
People tend to naturally look to the warrior to "lead" a lot of content in classic.  So that's another aspect of the role
---
If only epic died...
---
Yes you can.
---
That’s s heirloom mount you’re technically getting driven by a chauffeur and it only goes 20% not 60%. Still ridiculous tho
---
I actually used Rickhards intro when I met one of my long time wow friends. The whole "prince of darkness, lord of....and a mayor of a small village up the coast." That was a start of a long friendship.
---
So by what people in here say,  they downscale the servers?? that way people cant join on them? Wheres the reasoning behind that? Shouldnt they open MORE slots for people when the servers are beeing "Full"already? I mean where do they expect the german speaking people to be going to?? When Everything they offer us is already full....
---
&gt; Same goes for the retri paladin we brought. I did more damage than both of them combined. It’s a mockery to bring such garbage to a raid
---
I would understand this, if it stopped you from killing the boss but that is not the case. The required amount of dps to kill a boss is abysmal, you would need someone to purposefully do badly.
---
The new dungeon scaling and level replaying feature that will be in 8.2.5 is what made me uninstall. Game is completely messed up and while I stayed for the lore, I'm done. Classic is where it's at!
---
Haha the BC Warlock experience really
---
Guys! GUYS! Guys, which of these names should I go with? I just can't decide:

Fn  
---
Conservatory  
---
Thæx
---
Bears can main tank in raids though(maybe not 1 or 2 fights) and easily Ot all encounters. Just need to do your homework and prep your bear more than a warr. Higher threat means you can dps more which means your healers will have to heal less. I've also read info stating powershifting was smooth during beta meaning bears are going to be more reliable than on pservers.
---
you will certainly see them in classic, most people will level their pallies as ret
---
but what you wont see is hordes of them in end game raids raiding as ret
---
sure, you will find the guilds that will take 1 as a charity case or a reward for loyalty- my guild has an old dude who cant handle healing but he has been with us since day 1 so he can stay ret and no one cares.
---
The fact remains, however, that in classic the paladin delivers more utility as a healer. it isnt cruel or "minmaxing" to acknowledge this basic fact.
---
i know that people these days have an aversion to facts, but the fact is they cannot justify taking up dps raid spots
---
I entered on the first 10 seconds and then it bugged for me. (Every time I clicked on my realm the whole wow application closed)

I feel like cowwoman is more popular among horde druids these days? Ever since people started experimenting with the exact hitbox/hurtbox sizes

I had just turned 60 on my first character and still pretty new to the game. I had a friend that was really into raising and he let me get on his account every now and then. At the time he was in the top raiding guild on his server and were clearing naxx. I hopped on to do some pvp and got a raid invite and somehow ended up getting a summon and before I knew it I was healing nax with just basic knowledge of a shaman in PvP. We cleared a couple wings and were done for the night. I’m sure I had to have been the lowest on healing but my buddy said nobody noticed.
---
I spent a good bit of time playing with people from a French Canadian guild (Fleur de Lys on Lothar, I think) back in vanilla. It was the first time it hit me that there were a bunch of people on the same continent as me who speak French (granted, I was 12-13).
---
No, they are not.
---
I fully intend to fund my level 40 mount through the deviate market
---
I used regular black Staedtler liners in 3 different thicknesses. .05mm, .2mm, 1mm
---
Thanks for reading, I agree actually with most everything you said. "Just remember" was more of a meme than serious advice.
---
I agree on flasking. Its not worth for tier 1 + 2. I tried to be neutral in that regard, but I suppose its better to advise against it, since gold and mats are so scarce early on.
---
In regards to my ragnaros section, I was drunk finishing that part of the guide a few days ago and I forgot to go back and edit it. I'll change it to be more accurate
---
What itemization do you suggest for flash heal spam
---
Damn got me hype
---
He sure is, YouTube comments say he got hired by Blizzard a while back. If that's true, more than deserved!
---
Love all of his trailers, so epic.

You guys know you can take a screenshot in that fucking page, right ? :P

most servers will have an abnormal amount of players at the start.

[This is what Blizz said about layering in the past](https://youtu.be/EVb4p4QNQEo?t=219)

I personally doubt it. Especially after the shady shit they've done in the last expansions...

\&gt;no pandas, wolf people, goblins, blood elves, draenai
---
The only thing I regret about Classic is that I won't get to play a thicc goblina. That's OK, though. I have my orc warrior chick.
---
That reminds me I need a Drakedog playlist.
---
off-topic;
---
but isn't the whole hybrid dps thing being unviable a bit over exaggerated?
---
what's the minimum dps required to down Ragnaros before he enrages?
---
i'm going to guess it's something so low that having a raid filled to the brim with hybrid classes will still be enough
---
As a first toon, if you want to see the lore, etc, warrior probably isn't the best choice. I grinded 4 warriors to max mostly in dungeons. Questing, Unless you can find a healer, as a beginner, you will be pulling mostly 1 mob at a time then having to eat every other mob. It can get pretty tedious, especially if you forget to bring food.
---
No worries! I really would love a copy if you're able to.
---
using shaman tank as an example is basically a strawman, you can tank 5 mans with a hunter pet for god's sake, nobody cares about those. Link me a video of a shaman tanking hakkar, 4 horsemen, ragnaros, jindo, ony, insert bossname here.
---
That theory is identical with lots of differences.
---
Society nukes it self after some time, society doesn’t leave their planet cause it is perfect, society leaves their plant and dies while trying to find new planet. Etc.

---
Pretty much - there are some exceptions though  
---
Feral druids (kitty or tank) can bring aspect of the pack as well as viable off tanks in an emergency. As well as boomies bringing a 3% crit  
---
Shadow priests directly buffing warlock damage  
---
Enhance imp totems + nightfall (even though hunters are better at it and resto can spec imp totems)  
---
Rets unfortunately don't bring anything a holy pally doesnt except an aura to buff holy damage
---
Thats what I did, after seeing name reservation event I took the safer route. Will try to play casually first 2 days while working and take 29-30 off!
---
How are you going to dump your mana pool in 15 seconds? Being generous, and using the 15sec mark to freshly cast all spells to get them on cd right then: the maximum you can cast in that time is 3 consecrations, 2 exorcisms, 3 seal + judge combos. That's ~3000 Mana, which even without any regen occuring in that timeframe around 66-75% of the manapool. More realistically 15 seconds are 1 exorcism, 2 Seal/Judge combos and 2 Consecrations, which is just 1900 Mana, ~30-50% of the mana pool.
---
The "it's only the first few weeks" didn't magically evolve as a statement from the devs to "only phase 1". In the interviews they gave they said layering would only be there in the furst few weeks to stem the influx of players **or** until P1 ends at the longest, since they **have** to be flexible about that statement as nobody can know tue exact amount of players trying to play Classic for the first few weeks.
---
Okay so what the person before said is not TRUE. So it doesnt mean that there are that many people LOGGED IN AT THE MOMENT.  It does mean that there are already so many characters created. "High number of players congregating" doesnt really state if it counts only logged in players or once created characters but 2nd one is way more likely, since its frkin 8 in the morning here and they are full thanks for clearing that for me shiqznima &lt;3 thanks alot
---
What kink even is this?
---
I mean, the obvious sexual imagery aside, I can't unsee this image, and I can't figure out why. I mean, I know the hammer's supposed to be a dick, but all I see is a cute zombie girl singing karaoke with her hammer as a "mic", while making an attempt at a sexually provocative pose, and it's just so adorable.

Pretty much this. But wow is better to get into when your friends are pulling you in. It can take a little bit for the addiction to kick in if you are an adult.
---
What if you're from a country where those characters aren't foreign?
---
Per Blizzards announcement they are relative values... they tell you nothing about total population. There are no "threshold" values.
---
I thought it was just me for the longest time, losing my love of the game, can't find people to actually connect with, get that sense of community again, rather than just log on, do my daily "duties," toss a comment into guild chat and answer a question, sit idle for 20 minutes listening to guild recruitment and level-up/raid run spam in trade, and then log out. I can't even put my finger exactly where it all went wrong; I feel like I log in just hoping that spark of fun will reignite, but it never does. It's bittersweet, and it makes me sad.
---
I really hope classic will be everything we all hope it will be, myself included. I'm still a little skeptical, but I'm sure I'd be quitting retail again soon in waiting for whatever horror-show expansion they come up with next that will entertain us all for another three months and then peter out again as our excitement wanes and the monotony resumes. Maybe it's all gone to shit. Maybe we'll never find that fun that we once had, collaborating towards achievements, being excited to see that purple frame around your item drop, finally getting that boss down after weeks of learning the mechanics. Maybe that's the point of nostalgia, to stay in the past and serve as a constant reminder of better times without ever fulfilling that satisfaction again...but I hope not. Maybe this has become existential and semi-dramatic - it probably has. :P Thanks, rum and cokes!
---
Anyways, looking forward to it; hoping not to be disappointed, but I'm keeping my standards low, heh.
---
not sure what aspect of this comment is meant to be serious
---
Well, they might very well be full now, I go in a few minutes after they opened for name reservation and they were already high, so that's really last time I checked.
---
I should check when I get home, we only have two EN PVP realms in all of Europe, so most likely they are full by now.
---
T19 (nighthold) is a close second imo, mainly because it's clearly inspired by T2

You don't. You use a damage spec to heal group content.
---
Use secondairy profs like fishing cooking and first aid
---
Herb and alch help alot as well unlike other classes you will need to swap zones more, ideally you will want to be a lvl or 2 higher then the mobs you fight.
---
If possible plan your weapon upgrades it makes a world of difference and always have a one handed weapon and shield on you for dungeons and weapon swapping for example bash.

Never again.

Find a healer friend and cling onto them like a fly on shit or buy lots of food, eat every 2-3 kills and always max out first aid.

It’s not impossible but it ain’t easy.

hahaha xDD that made me laugh WAAY too hard haha xD

Eh? Ret was fine in tbc.
---
Jesus man calm down. Why did Golemagg go from “high” at the start to medium later? Did thousands of people delete their characters?

And you really don’t think Blizzard have a plan for if servers get actually full (locked)? Of course they are monitoring this whole situation closely and will be ready to roll out new servers when necessary

i think you are correct
---
people just dont get how hardcore some people are
---
The only thing i'm sure as a new classic player is to avoid both Herod and Faerlina, they will be filled with neckbeards toxic tryhards that lives on the past, one with streamers fanboys and the other with haters, both comunities are displaying a very childish behavior, this drama is actually disgusting, but im glad you guys are doing this so you all stack and circle jerk on these 2 servers and the rest gets to have a decent experience on other servers.
---
Anything further than the T, G, V line is criminal and weird.
---
There's 4 low pop servers though?
---
Just play it if you feel like it. Don't bother about time.

i aware, but i use the reddit app a lot more, i didn't want to get a perfect clean photo. i just wanted to share a photo bc im happy about my names.
---
&gt;Couldn't prot paladins be given a taunt, druid tanks given something, that can put them close to on par with warriors?
---
They don't need a buff, they just need to be approached with more effort and due diligence in order to accomplish what warriors can do.

Ret pallies played as spelladins can put out some quite nice numbers. They do however take very specific gear and consumables, but they are totally viable.
---
it's not stupid if you're planning on a LAN with friends. if we can play, we play, otherwise we do something else while servers are fuckering.
---
yessir!

Aaaaaaand one more! Come one, we can reach 100 posts talking about full servers before the end of the day!

If it really means that much to you then just play on Thalnos.
---
Especially if they don't read up on guides and learn how to make it work. But I guess that could apply to everything?
---
I can't recall exactly, but I think I've seen people compare druid with leader of the pack compared with another rogue/warrior and druid with boomkin aura vs another mage, and it was better to just bring another rogue/warrior and another mage.  
---
For shadow priest, it's better for 1 healer to spec into shadow weaving and keep it up.  
---
Of course, this is min-maxing. In reality, you'd fill your raid's last spots with off-meta specs if need be.
---
Oh. I missed that announcement. Thanks for the info.  
---
However, relative values can still be threshold values.
---
Concecration is a good ability to spec into, and gives you another ability to click. Too bad it costs so much mana. And hey, once in a while you also get to cast the glorious Hammer of Wrath, which looks quite cool.
---
Damn, that's actually a good idea.
---
Looks like plenty of servers.
---
Ofcourse this isn't the only stupid thing that they filter as "mature language", but it is funny.
---
I was yolt earlier that "Dr" was mature language somehow
---
Mercy B-cup
---
Hey, this isn't the FFXIV sub...
---
They're doing it to purposely even out populations.  It doesn't mean the servers are going to explode if another person rolls there.  They've specifically said that they will notify us about populations via the server screen, and it's exactly what they're doing.

Easy.

When I watched a few clips trying to work out who the fuck Asmongold was and why I should care, he claimed he would have all the content completed in 2wks.
---
&gt; What a delusional comment.
---
Indeed...
---
Fairbanks will be the server of the community. I played on a relatively low pop server back in the day and everyone knew eachother. Everyone is zerging for their thot, streamer, brazilian, and anti-streamer servers, but they are missing out on the real vanilla experience in fairbanks.
---
&gt; Yeah I do think they have their place and in some fights they can actually be superior to warriors. But on the whole I was under the impression they are inferior due to lack of gear specifically for tank druids, and their inability to block.
---
Nah, that is an old vanilla negative mindset. From people seeing one downside and assuming its insurmountable.
---
The benefit that you gain does not offset the net dps loss from bringing the meme spec rather than another mage.
---
I woke up this morning and was immediately pissed that it's still not the 27th :(
---
Sorry man if it sounded offensive really wasnt my intention. Iam just trying to be objective here, iam not cryin about it (even if it may sound like it) So you just assumed that its the "current" player number because it was at high at start and medium later? I can see why you thought that. But it seems that this is not how it works or otherwise this wouldnt make sense right now atm as i told you before (people working here 8in the morning etc on a thursday) 
---
And for Blizzards plans... I Have high hopes that they add more servers to be honest. But my reason behind this post is just informative sry if it came any other way round

There were a lot of servers and a lot of weeks, and 2 sides per week.

This is also a hub for people who particularly like the game.

mhm not sure if layering is the same as just increasing server capacity. Today server's are mostly completely virtual making up- or downscaling easy
---
Human lock : Fáust / Gnome Mage: Chromeo (he likes needy girls) / Human Priest: Nothic
---
Canadian players, contrasted to Brazilians, are much better wow players on average.
---
Not going to dig around for it but I thought I saw videos saying that servers would hold around 10k people for these classic servers.

---
&gt; What itemization do you suggest for flash heal spam
---
Because you are simply doing full spam, it makes more sense to prio more stats like INT and crit over what you normally would against +healing, spirit and mp5.
---
Partially because you are using flash heal, so much lower coefficient for +healing in general, you want to sustain as high rank spam (have to adjust depending on fight) as you can (int gives you more cast and bit more crit) and heal as much as you can (crit). Crit + spam is there ofc to have high uptime for +armor buff too.
---
Hard to say exact values, im sure there are graphs of this over time, priests have really good theorycrafting excel sheets available.
---
Since the first days will probably be crazy, I'll take a long weekend instead, sat/sun/mon.

Because we're 2 weeks away from release and retail is in off-season. Who would've thought.

Devils advocate since I have a younger brother.

Your brother will have a miserable time on a pvp server. You have more leeway here and it's more about spending time with him.

At the end of the day wPvP won't be more fun than having fun with your bro.

Take the hit man he'll really appreciate it.

No they dont, hunters do spamming wing clip or warriors hamstring.

Who knows if that even works on classic amyway.
---
Arena did serious damage to WoW PvP. It forced homogenisation, and it turned the focus away from huge battles to small scuffles with your own faction.
---
I wouldn't have an issue with arena if the game didn't end up getting balanced around it, and you were not forced into it for gear. I find it incredibly boring so having no choice but arena or have sub-par gear was a huge mistake imo.
---
There's no way more than 1% of ferals is going to spend literally dozens of hours a week farming pummlers. In a raid environment you go through those things so fast it ain't funny
---
Because online users isn't who is currently browsing it's subscribed and online on reddit.
---
i dont think anyone is disagreing with your but all talent trees/spells are in their 1.12 forms
---
A guy posted earlier that he got the name "Whitemane" as a ff reference.
---
So it's not a blanket thing on any name containing white, it's just blocking the specific 5 letter word.
---
Kinda silly imo
---
Ofc they are.
---
I mean, I think a lot of people here is returning to the game after leaving in TBC/WotLK. I am.
---
It's not ganking if they kill you just once or twice, is it? Die twice, call friend, layer out. It's simple.
---
idk you said you couldn't escape layering for an unknown time after pvp. lol imagine running all the way to sfk alone because you can't meet your friend on the same layer due to the timer but you keep getting killed. Now that's the true vanilla experience
---
I remember one f-ing dude in my raid group. A mage. He was the only one to never use push to talk. I can still hear this dudes breathing and even eating as we raided through MC which we had on farm status. We kept in pleading with him to switch to push to talk, the dude kept on making BS excuses, I think he may have been kicked out of the guild eventually.
---
Laughed way to loud just by reading "Schland" hahaha, ty for that
---
Yea maybe you’re right. You can probably test it like this:
---
Delete 1 character, then try make a character on Everlook. If it’s actually full, it should say something like “only accounts with characters already on this realm can create a new character”
---
Personal experience. Everyone keeps parroting a lot of misinformation that originates from youtubers playing on pservers.
---
Most warriors will refuse to tank, they want to be fury or Arms PvP.dontou know how you get gear as a warrior? You tank.  There’s going to be a duck Ton of under geared warriors and even less viable tanks.
---
Apart from the Horde.

Haha jokes on you I don't have a dad

It's a great thing, no homogenisation of the classes. PvP is all about War, not sandpit fights with your own factions. Less ridiculously OP specs/classes/combos.
---
They should have gone straight for rated BG's.
---
You’re probably right, I’m not expecting to get much done in the first couple of weeks! I hope the servers are stable at least.
---
What is the convention you’re going to?
---
You will be fine if you don't level as prot, you can also easily tank dungeons as fury or arms, would only consider going prot for better tanking or solo when you get shield slam.

The game isn't free either

Quests: Lock, paladin. Hunters get a very difficult class quest chain later on with a nice quiver as a reward. Warriors get the Hurricane chain in their 30s, any warrior having it before 40 will sit in AB for a week or so. Priests get some nice flavor quests early on and their racial ability quests are unique.
---
Oh, that is weird then. I mean a server name having white in the name isn't bad, I just figured they didn't want players creating their own name including white for obvious reasons. Idk why they did it the way they did, though.
---
Shazz for life
---
I hated scaling the moment I read about it. The whole idea of a MMORPG and if how WoW was, is that you increase in level and that you get stronger.
---
A mob that was a threat before is now a joke/easier since you have become better at what you do. Scaling ruins that whole aspect and you never feel like you are getting stronger.
---
Luckily they introduced scaling at a time where I pretty much wasn't playing anymore.
---
Troll post lol
---
Vanilla didn't have the likely outcome of tourists quitting in a short period of time.  There's still going to be a massive server of people to interact with.
---
Boom was better than ret imo.
---
Are u noob?
---
This might sound cliché but you could commission these sheets for all the classes, if the price was fair Id buy a good print lf this easily!
---
It depends, druids and shamans have really painful/nice class quests. Also warlocks have some entertaining ones.
---
As I said, it depends on how much you like their lore and walking long distances.
---
Say hi to the spiritresser for me when i use my fire reflecting trinket on you
---
The server will be fine. They are probably showing in comparison to each other, and there was never any doubting that PvP servers were going to be severely more populated than Rp-PvP servers. As long as there's at least 2-3k on the server it'll be just fine.
---
i hope you visit walmart soon
---
Jesus Christ. The population thing only shows who’s logged in at that particular time. How many times does this need to be explained.
---
Good n' you?
---
Yea you need to get rid of the layering eventually, so it will just turn into long server queues... and you will have wished you rolled on a lower population server
---
We discussed this thing some weeks ago. Filling 40 slots aint hard, filling the healer spots IS
---
max cape :P
---
Can you post the full version? This will be very usefull for me as i’m gonna play a druid. You are awesome!
---
Make sure you'll stick with your friends and find a guild with good people and you are safe from this sh*t. Of course you'll see these types of interaction here and there.. better ignore them and just interact with people who are not toxic... You can't fix stupid
---
I can't wait for my first DM tanking run with all the aoe retail scrubs.
---
good times.
---
pretty sure it's 25% lol
---
Clearly didn't see my BC hunter with some 100ish keybinds!
---
Did u find any guild that time zone be similar? Or some kinda Japanese guild's?
---
having layering when world bosses get introduced ruins the game. Straight up. All the layering fear or taking extra black lotus aside. Unlimited powerful epics that should spawn once per server per week destroys the game.
---
My bad, it is too haha.
---
Means he’s not getting laid
---
Which means they're playing the game and most of us have nothing better to do than sit around shitposting on the subreddit.
---
Wait until launch, this subreddit will be a lot less active.
---
have at it!
---
Both say full. All the PVE and RP servers say low.
---
Doesn't surprise me. It sounds like with every expansion they tried to remove a big chunk of what actually made the game enjoyable for the sake of convenience.
---
Yeah but wheres all the hundreds of thousands that signed the rp pvp petition??? Did people sign it and them not roll rppvp
---
Did anyone else find this song from this video  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPv9rQFuXTo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPv9rQFuXTo) ?
---
Thx for information.
---
Tried getting either **Jam**, **Baker** or **Punji** on **Shazzrah** but all were taken :(
---
Anyone got any of them and feel like helping a fella out? &lt;3
---
Just watch this

---
I saw a item with a 1% increase in crit chance on stress. Made me feel warm inside to see 1% increase (or more) again instead of a dumb rating that was used to nerf that item when leveling in newer expansions.
---
Thanks for your opinion
---
Thank you so much. It helps a lot.
---
I didn't sorry :( Im still not sure if I'll be playing Whitemane or on EU with my buddies
---
They kinda were.
---
I am not sure. The second a streamer stops a game, his followers stop too. In the past this has led to visible population problems.
---
Ever seen Esfand, Drakova and Killerduki guides? They explicitly tell you "dont do anything else than dps if youre taken as dps".
---
Hola
---
Simple answer, Yes.
---
I signed the petition because I wanted Rp-PvPers to have their server. I don't plan on rolling Rp-PvP. I'm sure there are many that are the same.
---
Thanks :)
---
Was there hundreds of thousands? I don't think so.   
---
Also, people sign petitions to support each other even if they do not plan on rolling there
---
classic doesn't drop until august 26th
---
It's not difficult. Just time consuming vs other classes, when you have to constantly bandage/eat and do instance runs for a better weapon.
---
Pink haired female Gnome mage - candycrusher
---
Gnome rogue - onenightstab
---
Dwarf Warrior - rapedwarf
---
Played patch 1.12 in vanilla when it was live.
---
Hmm let me rephrase. The classic community has more active redditor accounts than retail. Most of us browse reddit on our phones when we can't play either way.
---
What makes a warrior fatigued at 30-40 compared to other classes? To me, warriors start getting much stronger at those levels
---
Druid design is best design

Just get the black war tiger from pvp

It is just a character from an anime, but a super powerful mage / undead character
---
The subreddit server survey has it as being decently popular here. With a pretty even faction split too. 
---
But if you want to pretend it is dead, go right ahead.
---
BC Ret paladin was my height of keybinds but my tiny girl hands prevented that many!
---
Thanks buddy
---
Or go the tryhard route and chug blues like theres no tomorrow
---
That's the plaaaaccceee...
---
Probably starting with Mistborn 4 to finish the story. I'm not sure, maybe Malazan or something gritty next. Fantasy my genre though esp. while leveling.
---
Good point haha
---
Blizzard also have to take into consideration that they will need to remove layering before Phase 2 begins. That is where I see a big problem.
---
We and Blizzard cant have the mentality that "we have layering so its OK." When Layering is in fact only a temporary thing to ease the launch.
---
There is a large amount of people that haven't even re-subbed yet.
---
Not as much if you play one.
---
This has been done in a much more comprehensive poll.
---
Those few are the ones who should be rewarded, keep it at 10 hours.
---
I farmed with/for my guild mate in vanilla, he was the only one to get the mount out of the entire server, at least this time around it will be a lot easier for more people to get it with what information we have available.
---
Think that's the consensus!
---
Rc bad green man good
---
typical classic shill, have fun not being able to proc reckoning by /sitting in the middle of combat. i'll be over here having an *authentic* vanilla experience.
---
anyway, when's the next FRESH server launch? my last one died after 19 days because the guy running it started selling a shirt that one-shots raid bosses for $400
---
My friend went for R14, he said he started dreaming about grinding AV. It sounded horrible, think he gave up at like 12, just couldn't take more AV.
---
1 if a class can heal most people have the mindset that it should be healing no exceptions.
---
2  questie &amp;leatrix
---
3 nah you will be fine. 
---
Dps warriors, rogues, mage, warlock,hunter.
---
Healer Priest, paladin, shaman, Druid

Tank warrior, Druid.

We're the bane of that guys experience.

meeting stones would like to have a word with you - while they form your group out of 5 dps classes

It would make for a good undead mage, but most people probably wont catch the reference.
---
It has nothing to do with racism, because americans are as diverse as brazilians. It is mostly a language barrier issue
---
Hahah good points sir
---
It'S certainly possible. The MC bosses, which curse aren't very dangerous and if you feel the need to remove a curse, you can use https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion
---
Lucifrons curse doubles spell cost. You can likely just ignore this, the fight is so short (~60-75sec), it won't play a role.
---
Magmadar may be hard, frenzy can't be removed and fear also is very bad. You likely need a well geared prot pala to do this.
---
Gehennas, the cruse reduces healing, which is very bad, but it's again an easy fight otherwise. With good players, you should be able to ignore the curse except on the tank.
---
Garr, there are no problems.
---
Geddon, dmg on the raid may be quite high due to only melee dps, but doable.
---
Shazzrah is hard to assess for me. Raid dmg will be very high, so I don't know whether you can ignore the curse. Since you also can't remove his dmg reduce buff, he'll live longer than Lucifron and Gehennas. You may need the potions here.
---
Sulfuron. Nothing special, I don't remember whether you can stun the adds, if you can't it may take a bit, because you can't interrupt the heals, but otherwise easy boss.
---
Golemagg, no problems at all.
---
Majordomo, may be interesting as you can't really cc all the mobs. You can use repentance chains and hoj chains to the cc all the healers, but this quite difficult to execute. An inteeresting challenge.
---
Ragnaros, this one is going to be nightmare. Hand of Ragnaros targets mana users, so will constantly hit the melee and knock several away in addition to the knockback from wrath of ragnaros. Worst part about is the submerge phase. The sons will drain the mana of all the paladins, so they'll be extremely hard to handle and you go into the next phase with no mana on anybody but the healers. Killing Rag before the submerge is also very hard due to ret paladins and the constant knockbacks.
---
This is actually a really cool lore tidbit I had no idea about. Makes sense why they shoved him in a hidden chamber to the side, I thought they punished him and left him to rot, but this is crazy interesting!\~
---
i remember a retri paladin in our old vanilla guild
---
he actually did quite well on DPS in 5man dungeons. of course he was wearing full epic gear, so it might be a scaling issue.. 
---
he healed in raids
---
Hardest decision Asmongold fans will ever make. Will they make an alliance character to protect their daddy or a horde character to grief him. Or do they creat a second account to be able to have one of each.
---
Afaik, servers show pop related to how many people that are actually online at the moment. Most people have created their characters by now, thus the servers are marked as low.
---
Fix layering/remove it

T2,5&gt;R13&gt;T0.5&gt;R10

Thats the only gear suitable for ret dps and not going OOM every pull

Hey guys habts ihr eine Ahnung wie Cross realm pvp  auf den deutschen servern funktionieren wird? Sind ja nur 2.
---
No you just get in a huge line aka “que”
---
What do you mean by active redditor accounts? Doesn't it only track if an account is active on that subreddit?
---
Well if you have some videos of pallies tanking Naxx I would love to see that shit
---
Isn't that from rank 11? Won't that be an insane grind?
---
&gt;item level
---
No thanks
---
Yes.
---
Except boomkins and shamans
---
I'd actually love that hahahaha. My idea is Gnomes must make a good rogue for being hard to click 😂
---
I did as well, but people seem to forget Blizzard is really greedy in 2019 so I expect it sadly even though I know it’s not “suppose” to happen eventually.
---
&gt; no pandas, wolf people, goblins, blood elves, draenai 
---
I'm against convenience mechanics (pretty much everything else you listed) but I'm not against things like this. I just want the classic game to start with and the newer content, dungeons and zones redesigned around those classic mechanics where appropriate down the line. 
---
When we're done with all the phase drops, and people are starting to get bored with the cap on progression, that's what players are going to want. Whether they realise it yet or not.
---
Turning that shit off was the first thing I did when setting up ventrilo. PTT for life, though, don't want to accidentally bother anyone.
---
I remember on ED my enhancement shaman was always the top damage dealer in a 5 man and I'd save enough mana for at least a greater heal in case the healer went oom on a large pull. Having even a rank 1 Earthshock ready was really nice as well. I think I got to dps one time in UBRS too, and to my surprise the dps was still pretty nice even, but past that, though I only healed, I assume you definitely fall off from lack of hit, spell hit and mana issues when other classes are going deep in their stride.
---
One newborn, a three year old, new company in September and a wife is going to keep me from playing more than 30 minutes per day. I'm guessing that I will log in and then walk around for a bit, before I have to log off again.

So having a "social life" in game will be out of the question!
---
I'm going to roll a Warrior on the Alliance side with my friends but I don't know what race to go with. I mainly want to pvp and do some pve for gear. Any suggestions? So far I like how Humans amd Dwarves look but like I said i want something that's good for pvp =)
---
Hello Archeon, great post! What about a R1 SotC and R1 SoC? Wouldn’t it be even better than the SoC SoR? As it will be way more mana efficient and would greatly increase the SoC proc?
---
haha true. But BOTW is the kind of game that you can "out play" really higher level content if you are really good. It is an action adventure series, not really an RPG. That does make it a lot easier to design a non-scaling world.
---
At some points humans would need hints to know which names are available though.
---
In the end it becomes a problem of finding a valid password-name among all those combinations.

The dude who made that username is infamous for trying to troll people who just want to avoid him and his fanbase. I agree that he's a dick, but bringing attention to him just makes his ego even extend that little bit further.

You really think he's gonna survive long on the highest-pop server of the bunch when so many of those people picked Herod specifically because they hate his guts? No, hes gonna be corpse camped for ages and be told to "g o T o RE T a IL". Which, honestly, he most likely will after he milks Classic for all it's got.
---
I'm not saying it's bad to use pots or professions like engineering in world pvp or if you are being ganked. Everything helps, right. 
---
I'm just saying for dueling it was kinda frowned upon using pots and other consumables unless agreed to beforehand. 
---
World PVP is fair game
---
And blizzard has run World of Warcraft for 15 years.
---
They know that.
---
There are 21 people in my doscord rolling horde on fairbanks. 4/21 paid to reserve the name. Too small a survey pool to draw any real info from but it's enough for me personally not to worry about its population.

It's a real picture from 2013, it happened in Poland which is the cesspool of Catholic brainlets.

I'm not making this up, see "Polish Priests" on tumblr.

get the facts straight.

/r/classicwow: "everything is viable anywhere in the game." L M A O

I played on an RP-PVP server for years and never had any interest in role-playing. It was just a nice, relaxed server with a lot of fun community events :)
---
The Grob community seems to be fairly solid i would not read to much into how populated the servers actually are by what the realm list sayd. Because its just going by names created on that server a lot of people grabbed names on multiple servers even though they do not plan on playing on them all.
---
Nobody actually RPs in RPPVP.
---
Same here. Starting from the US closed beta I always played on PvP servers up to now. But this time I will play PVE because I want to enjoy leveling and I simply dont have the time to deal with ganking or spend time on world pvp. When I feel the urge to PVP BGs will do just fine I guess. :)
---
Dumb question, how do you get the class icon on your name?
---
In some respects the fifa games feel like an anomaly and are largely apples to oranges in this comparison. The target audience for fifa games are conditioned to expect yearly releases, and a lot of sports gamers aren't "core" gamers to begin with. Some people just buy fifa every year and that's it. And i imagine most don't even touch the mtx or expect it to last since next year's game is around the corner. In a way they are conditioned to not care about their digital purchases which is why it's even more baffling people buy it ever year.
---
A WoW 2 or warframe 2 would probably cause riots in the digital streets. People basically expect these games to just be added on to and built upon for decades to come because that's how they're marketed. And alienating your audience with those expectations is recipe for disaster.
---
Audience expectation and conditioning is the key thing here.
---
Many people know that pvp server would be the high pop places and wanted to reserve names. If there was several chars all servers would be high

I tested it for a bit. Its very marginal solo but in duos it was noticeably more efficient just dotting everything up and letting your partner help finish them
---
Pretty sure Thalnos is the LGBT server, lots of BR and FR guilds rolling there too
---
Well Herod is full and most of my group is still waiting till launch to roll on it. So they better get ready. A minority spent money to reserve name changes. 2/10 people in my group to give a number.
---
I havent had internet for a couple of days, hoepfully my names will still be there lol
---
&gt;  warriors so raid spots 
---
This is not true at all. raid spots WILL NOT be crowded
---
someone has never played classic before
---
Lol hundreds of thousands haha
---
Ah okay, I misunderstood it a bit then. Thanks for clearing it up! Have a nice day and see you in Classic!
---
Not wow related, but makes for a good title;
---
&lt;Dummy Thicc&gt;
---
No, however it's not directly tied to population, just how many are logged into the character screen at any given time. 
---
Normally it would compare the amount of logged in players to the server concurrency cap which was around 3000 during vanilla and will most likely be in Classic as well. With layering enabled it's impossible to guess how the system works.
---
its no secret a ton of people signed it in support to help the people who wanted it, but had no actual desire to play it themselves.
---
Unless you spend hundreds of gold worth of consumables per raid while the top dps specs spend none and also don't do their rotations properly... you'll do like a quarter of warriors/rogues/mages.
---
Leveling is way harder but endgame is easier
---
Majority 80% + atheist or non-believers :)
---
Nein, natürlich nicht. Ich war bei vanilla vor cross realm battlegrounds dabei und 3-4h wartezeit war nicht sonderlich lustig. Da es in classic ja auch kommen wird, hab ich mich gefragt, ob anders sprachige server in bgs dazu kommen oder ob es bei den 2 servern bleibt
---
Entirely depends on how well I'll be able to sleep in the days before. So either sleep during the day and get out of bed at 10 PM to play until noon or stay awake until midnight, get a few hours of playtime in (basically try to get to level 10-12) and then go to bed.
---
I'm am advocate for Classic + (with at least one regular 1.12 server always open).
---
As long as there are set principals, like a constitution of sorts, it'd be great to see what could happen.
---
It's quite easy actually.. Personally, I've played PvP on retail because friends were there, and got fed up with it. I don't really enjoy PvP, never really did battlegrounds or any of that sort, I always preferred dungeons, leveling and casual raids -- and I fully intend rolling PvE for these reasons! FOR THE HORDE
---
I think the number of beds will be proportionally the same as chairs. Like, even if there are more chairs in the game than beds, I think it'll still follow the same order you listed above. 
---
Except I suspect Undercity might have zero beds, while Thunderbluff might have like one somewhere.
---
This is presuming those other meta classes aren't trying as well. If they're pushing dps there's really nothing a ret can do to avoid doing a quarter or less of their dps
---
Because im not some perpetually ass-mad twitter victim?
---
Don't it really wasn't worth it 15 years ago and it's still not really worth it now.
---
I thought the max was 3, is it possible that 2 of them will get deleted?
---
Correct
---
Terf might get flagged for renaming tho
---
Tokens for gear was a good system and infinitely better than the random gear lottery that is in the game today.
---
Tell him to bring his laptop
---
My guild used...
---
the ingame chat.
---
that's it.
---
no voice comms
---
Eh. Somewhat right.
---
Ret got improvements every patch with the big one coming in 2.3 (so before Sunwell), which made ret really competitive. But at no point in tbc ret was in such a bad spot as the spec was in vanilla.
---
YEAH, SPORTS! DO THE THING, GET THE POINTS!
---
Well, most people playing the game on retail would not be online on Reddit. It'll be the same when classic launches. Yes, some people will be on Reddit when they can't play, but not everyone and different people work/play at different times.
---
All joking aside, doesn’t blizzard have a moral responsibility not to re-implement this system?    
---
Even attempting these top ranks necessitates a number of really shitty life choices.
---
Ohhhh yeah
---
I think feral can be OK to bring because with powershifting/MCPs they can do respectable DPS in addition to their utility, but yeah boomkins are pretty not good
---
It worked during Classic Beta, but I haven't seen any tests done during the last stress test.
---
I also main Alliance but my lighting is red. Blue is just too harsh to play with in the background. Red adds a nice accent without distracting from the monitor.
---
I like how after FFXI I was surprised you did not lose XP when you died in WoW :p
---
The difference is is that there aren't any good retail private servers whereas vanilla private servers will be better than ever. Blizzard knows this.

All I'm saying is, before looking to solve problems, britain should solve its own problems. It's hypocritical to want to leave the EU because of perceived undemocratic practices in the EU, when Britain itself is the worst democracy in Europe.

I don't deny, that the EU has problems, but the solution is to reform and fix them, not break away from the community.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cq6dge/both_eu_pvp_servers_are_full_its_impossible_to/). 
---
I second this very accurate statement
---
Doesn't matter. The Hand on top is the important one.
---
Tbh wait for it. People who want their peace and a pvp realm at the same time will roll there.
---
Also remember that low doesnt mean deserted. 10k people shows "low" on the server status, meanwhile one of the most populated and lively private servers had 10-15k people.
---
A year earlier people didn't want to play on a server with 10k people cause it was a clusterfuck but now for some reason not having 50k+ people means your server is dead. Dunno what people are thinking.
---
Most responses for that servey were recorded last Friday. It's not too accurate.
---
Magic Conch: Reserve your name, then do nothing.
---
Thanks everyone for the answers
---
Agreed. The whole “slippery slope” argument ignores the possibility of such a set of principals to keep the game true to the vanilla experience
---
Yeah but the numbers are constant man it's not just at this hour. Sure it could be hype, but the point still stands that there are more active reddit accounts following classic than there are active redditor accounts following retail.
---
Wenn du dich jetzt für ein BG anmeldest wirst du nur mit entweder Everlook bzw Lucifron (je nachdem auf welchem Server du spielst) Spielern zusammen kommen. Cross-bgs, raids etc gab es nicht in vanilla und wird es in classic auch nicht geben.
---
Because that's what kids who's parent's don't vaccinate them look like?
---
That won't happen. The server with the most cancer besides the streamer one will 100% be whitemane. Whitemane was a mistake to name a realm. 1 google search for "Whitemane" and you'll understand how bad it will become.
---
They actually think it’s gonna flop and 90% community will give up half way through leveling process.
---
Man, the problem I have with PvP servers is, it will be fun for a few years but ultimately as players reach cap and get geared it will become a complete gank fest. It might even become toxic. There will come a point with Classic where content does stop to a degree and once players have exhausted themselves with it they will resort to ganking.
---
Phase two is also going to suck massive nutz for players who are levelling on PvP realms because honor will be a thing but BGs wont be around yet.
---
I dont think rolling on PvP servers for classic is gonna be for everyone.
---
Ja gut, denke aber man kann die vor-x-realm bg Zeit in Vanilla jetzt nicht mit Lucifron und Everlook vergleichen. Es sind 2 Server, aber eben immernoch der komplette deutschsprachige Raum. Wumpe ob du uns alle X-realm zusammenhaust von 10 Servern oder 2.
---
Its very fun play warrior. Even better in a duo. If your friend can go heal or off heal you guys will level in no time

Bro the Grob discord is one of the largest server discord’s right now. Grobb will be just fine. Game hasn’t even launch yet and a lot of people havnt even resubbed yet cause we have 2 weeks still.

i got mine too!

---
Back in the day it was a pve game. With all the knowledge they have today, pve content will be cleared very fast. So it leaves alot of free time for pvp, seems a logic choice that players go for the strongest pvp racials.
---
Doch doch, das ist so angekündigt. Cross-realm BGs kamen mit 1.12 in Vanilla.
---
Glad Oceanic is still looking even I have a feeling more of the alliance players aren't on the sub or responding to the survey.
---
This is the part of the player base that's good to see still alive. Helping each other
---
Grobbulus is sitting at a good 50/50 split i hope it stays true.
---

I agree with you.  People are excited and any shitposting is fine by me as the hours tick slowly down.
---
What sort of posts do people expect in this sub?  Lore? Theorycrafting? I don't get it.  People need to lighten the fuck up.
---
Here's a concept - if you don't want to read a post then don't click on it.
---
I actually look forward to WoW without achievements. I have a love/hate relationship with them. 95% are a pointless waste of time, introduced to make you do stupid shit or do an extra grind without much reward besides "hey, another achievement." But I still feel compelled to do them and I resent it.
---
No, only names are enforced
---
I was utterly determined to get to westfall as a level 12 troll hunter to tame one of the boars there because i liked the colors
---
However i didn't realize you could swim there from STV, so I walked/died my way all the way from fucking undercity...
---
then when i got there the boar was level 14, turns out thottbot had the levels wrong so i couldent even tame it :(
---
I stopped at R13, didn’t even consider grinding to R14, fuck that.
---
This is unrealistic.... They are the size of a fully grown adult.
---
I agree with this, I made a post about this earlier and everyone was saying it's a reflection of how many people are logged in at the time, but I don't see how that many people would be logged in so long after the name reservation opened.
---
Base 5% + 25% racial = 30%~
---
You could just grind the winterspring frostsaber.
---
I'm just calling you a dumb straight white guy lol
---
I’ve been playing old school runescape since the day it came out. As long as blizzard makes the updates polled and actually listens to the community, new updates will be good for the game.
---
Debuff limit makes vindication a no-go
---
It's funny because mop was also the most "war"craft based expansion. It had the first real villian and overarching horde v alliance plot out of any expansion.
---
It's not necessarily about PVP. People like me simply want to play on a highly populated server and thus are forced into those 2 even if we hate PVP.
---
At this point “what ifs...” don’t matter. We’re two weeks away from launch and the content plan was released over a month ago, it’s not going to change.
---
Joana. (leveling route)

Just level up and enjoy world PVP. If layering doesn't suck, you'll find some good battles starting in Hillsbrad Foothills. 
---
I can feel it already.
---
Quite a number of assumptions going round about rets in general. I play ret but I know I'm not a pure dps spec. I'm off-dps with utility and I pay it as such (kings, off heals, bop a healer to drop threat etc). The utility is great for 5 mans. I wouldn't expect to get into any raids really unless it was further down the line and an alt run etc.
---
Please remember there are a handful of us rets with common sense out there!!
---
It's also very fun in pvp by the way.
---
*insert girls laughing meme*
---
I love the fact that we wont have battlegrounds till phase 3 that will make phase two feel like Vanilla did when we got honor but had no BGs the world pvp was a lot of fun at that time.
---
You just had to choose a picture of colonialist forces defending against African tribespeople? Kinda racist vibe tbh, especially with Brazil there.
---
Not all of us jumped at the chance to waste two weeks of a sub just so we could get a "popular name".
---
Got Arathia, Tor and Jameson on EU RPPvP server. Pretty happy with that. :)
---
Still baffled how in a world filled with fishmen, dogmen, cowmen, ratmen, genius midgets, just to name a few, it's the PANDA MEN people draw the line on. Maybe the issue is this weird bandwagon mentality, not the race, and people really just need to take that stick out of their arse.
---
I don't care about current retail, but it's not pandaren that is the issue. Hell, MoP was pretty alright in comparison, good class design, and the last time I had fun with PvP in modern wow.
---
Dann sorry dafür. Hoffe aber, dass wenn dann nur die 2 deutschen Realms zusammen kommen. Eines der tollen Sachen damals war gewisse Charaktere vom PVP her zu kennen und immer wieder auf sie zu treffen. Je größer der BG-Playerpool wird desto unwahrscheinlicher wird das.
---
Um, ok, you have 2 8 sec cds you can use and against undead another 15sec cd. You also have an execute ability you can use every 6 sec when the mob is below 20%. You need to manage your mana well, have pots at the ready.
---
How is pressing frostbolt and 2 3min cds or just straight up shadowbolts more engaging?
---
Well I played OSRS for many years before finally quitting because it felt like it was Runescape 2.9 and not Runescape 2.1.  Early on people would heavily vote against things that seemed against the spirit of the game or were only for getting things faster but bad for the game in the long-term. Long before I quit just about everything would pass with flying colors in a poll. It was so stupid how you could also see the results of what others had voted before you even selected your choice. A lot of people constantly said they would just vote for whatever had the higher amount and despite petitions to get rid of that afaik it's still in the game.
---
WoW would also have to have something like you at least have a lvl 60 before you can vote on anything or else retail players could always just vote for things out of spite or because they don't quite like the current patch of retail but "Would play Classic if it was much more similar to retail." I'd rather not see polling at all though. It was such a consistent shitshow in OSRS.
---
Whether its better or worse is debatable but not having Bg's in phase 1 and 2 will encourage grow a wpvp culture and trends. So even with out vendors adding Bg's early would have a pretty significant impact atleast on PVP servers. Personally think they made the right decision in their phased release to grow the server comunity and faction interaction especially in phase 2 when layer will hopefully be completely stripped away. Alternatively I would recomend throwing in some extra dungeon runs even if you outlevel them slightly.
---
i remember the wotlk pre patch in TBC and rets went insane due to Divine Storm lol.
---
Rets did so much DPS in Hyial at the add waves.
---
I grew up in a small town in the us that had a big Portuguese speaking population. I watched a friend who spoke spanish trying to haggle with a guy who spoke Portuguese over a jetski. My buddy left paying full price. Apparently Portuguese speakers can understand spanish but not visa versa.

RP-PvP Servers are a blast! Most guilds are RP lite and PVP focused. If you are NA and looking for a home check us out at  [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/frostwolf-militia-h-rp-pvp-grobbulus/252090](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/frostwolf-militia-h-rp-pvp-grobbulus/252090).

I will be on this server. As a rule of thumb, font ride through people. Don’t kill their immersion. Don’t follow people making fun of them. For me its all about leveling and immersion. In cities i walk (riding full speed in a city, not as an rp player) in General i Express myself through Emoticons and emote. When I see you I don't know certain details because my Char cannot no them without getting told. I always log out in a hammock and I eat at fireplaces. My Char has a backstory to him which explains his intentions. As a shaman I am a spiritual guide to my brethren and will offer help on those issues.

Technically, horde and alliance are working together for the war effort. That's months of gathering shit together.

This is what I'm hoping for. Keeping the mechanics of the game the same (likely not increasing level cap bc we know how that went), but add community voted content. 
---
I know a lot of people want them to add BC abd WotLK servers, but I think splitting the playerbase between 4 servers will cause the whole thing to collapse. Community voted content with the vanilla game as a foundation will keep those who want the vanilla experience happy while adding new experiences to keep people playing.
---
Eh what keyboard layout do you have? H is easily reachable with my left index finger.

If you're willing to share your work through a scan or something, I'm sure that myself and a bunch of others would set at as desktop background, have it open on a secondary monitor, etc.   
---
Too bad you're NE ;)   
---
Really cool! Impressive how you've made the forms looks cooler / more realistic, but still so recognisable :)
---
Don’t forget that when you get to BWL you need to cast PW:S right before the breathe on Nefarion. That would wipe my raid a lot and I was the only priest that seemed to remember to do it because on Alliance priests generally only raid heal and so they never worry about the tanks since it’s assumed the paladins have them covered. Then again I just flash heal spammed using healerassist since it told me the lowest HP person from MC-AQ40 so I’m not the best when it comes to advice on the subject.
---
Why not just release all raids at once too. stupid idea gets stupid response
---
A ret paladin presses buttons as well.
---
A warrior hits bloodthirst every 6 and whirlwind every 10 seconds plus dumps rage on heroic strike and does a quick overpower when possible and uses execute on low mobs. That's engaging gameplay.
---
But a paladin, who has two 8 sec cd spells, a 15sec cd spell against undead and an execute is somehow considered sleeping pill gameplay compared to pressing the same button every 3sec for minutes.
---
Fine, sure. 
---
But when you have 30 dps looking to get into a group for the last slot, nobody is looking at a ret paladin.
---
Grobbulus welcomes you.
---
For vanilla, I always thought Druid's had a really cool class design. They simply just got shafted hard on the gear department. Warlock's are really cool as well and you can just do some really fun things that other classes don't really have anything comparable to, like Infernals, Doomguards and enslaving powerful elite demons. Not to mention drain tank grinding is pretty fun.
---
I’m going to see my lord and savior Bassnectar. Made plans for the weekend before I knew Classic was coming out...

I mean that, and they simply do not do competitive DPS at all in raids.

Ret paladins are doing 200 dps while mages/warriors and Rogues are doing 600.

---
This shouldn't be something that you need explained. The TLDR of it is that with 40 slots, most guilds won't mind having a few extra people to fill in the gap.. whether thats 1-2 extra healers, an extra tank just there to hit things, or an offspec dps. You're asking your question from the perspective of min-max, when it should be obvious that they could care less about what is 'min-max'

Meanwhile you run the other Herod discord that is confirmed to have a moderator promoting cross faction collusion between the horde and the alliance, and the server admin is trying to control all of the server discords with a classicdiscord domain name.

I actually had an easier time lvling my warrior in vanilla compared to many other classes. They are however extremely gear dependant so you gotta farm instances or do blacksmithing to get some. Classes that scale on gear have a huge advantage compared to classes that dont, provided you actually get that gear.
---
Insanely good. And really nice of you to do other classes next, since we still have plenty of time to kill until launch, am I right? :D
---
Viable dps yes, but you will never outdps a mage/rogue/hunter/warrior putting the same effort on performance and consumables as you

Reserving loot is a thing I wish didn't make it over to Classic from pservers. I can understand a valued position like a tank wanting to reserve something they need, but so many people just completely take the piss with it.

Like what classes to pick to avoid loot overlap? As horde I guess you could do well with like warrior, mage/lock, hunter, rogue, healer. The healer would all depend on what their class was. Certain accessories would be shared between classes. Hunter and rogue may at times have some general overlap.Would be pretty easy and straight forward to figure out unless the warrior wants to go fury.
---
As an NA Grob Mobster, I feel such camaraderie with Zandalar Tribe.
---
Difference is most other abilities does instant damage. Paladin is just auto attack modifiers, unless you're judging Righteousness or fighting undead.
---
Do they don't press a lot of buttons, nor do those buttons really do much. At least warriors are managing rage as well. I'm probably gonna have a paladin alt, but it *is* a really boring, half-baked combat system.
---
OP take this with a bag of salt, because I've never seen a pserver where level 60 warriors are 'short on supply'. If anything, they're like 40% of the population of 60's or thereabouts. So yeah, if you don't want to take forever to gear up you likely want to pass on a warrior unless you want to tank and are fairly confident you can find a tanking spot in a guild. 
---
Unless you mean only 5 mans in which case it's the easiest thing ever if you're willing to tank.
---
1 pve server was enough

I know people are afraid of slippery slopes, but the other option is they keep working on balance within a vanilla context and make ret better.

Noob
---
Hating Pandaren is a meme and many people here will gladly jump on a band-waggon if it lets them shit on retail.
---
You can have open mic , or a mechanical keyboard..but not both..
---
Maybe because you don't know if the people wanting an RP/PvP server were just a vocal minority of the player base (e.g. there are a lot more people who want RP/PvP) or all the players who wants RP/PvP
---
Maybe because RPers are a bit more relaxed and didn't all stay up until midnight to create a character they can't play for two weeks.
---
But maybe, just MAYBE, because the game hasn't been released yet, and it will take a while to fill some of them up.
---
Stop getting your knickers in a knot.

I had a Chinese guild master in Vanilla on EU Turalyon. Not a serious guild at all since the guild master played 18 hours a day and spent 12-14 of those just farming gold. His english wasn't great but to my understanding he was a non affiliated gold farmer who was lucky enough to own his own computer. He sold the gold to whatever site paid him the most instead of sitting in a site owned sweatshop farming gold on a site owned account 16 hours a day or more if demand was high. 
---
Apparently some of the gold sites didn't even pay in money towards the end of Vanilla, they'd take in homeless people who got paid in rice and a roof over their head (sleeping on the floor of the shop) which annoyed him because once that started happening it was harder to get paid. People died in those places, probably from malnutrition and exhaustion. Dystopian as fuck.
---
He might've been full of shit, his name sounded sorta Chinese though and he was basically always online farming gold or doing PvP when he had free time. Wish I remembered his name so I could check out his armory, all I remember is he was a human mage.
---
yeah dont even bop healer to save from mobs aggroing\\LoH tank if he gets extremelly low nah fuck that just crush that meters and then blame tank\\healer
---
It still works then. There may be a few accessories or trinkets that the warrior and rogue might both be interested in but largely the warrior will be interested in his own loot pool. So the key overlap will be a scant few items between the hunter and rogue which they can easily work out between each other.
---
&gt; bad for the long term health of the game
---
If WoW hadn't changed it would not exist today and neither would Classic.
---
You should ask them. I thought you were alleging Prot Pallies couldn’t tank naxx at all. Is the video evidence not sufficient? There’s also videos of Druids main tanking naxx bosses, but of course only warriors can tank 😂

I work and go to uni and basically have similar time issues as you xD I wanted to complete all dungeons, get the Tier 1 set at least, max my professions and all the reps.

Awesome and fantastic work! Thank you very much.

Are you asking me if a video of a guy tanking 25m Naxx in WOTLK is sufficient proof of how paladin tanks fared in Naxx in Vanilla?
---
Do you have water on the brain?
---
Aye retail i could do while half afk watching porn. It’s like a mobile clicker game compared to vanilla. No sense of danger
---
Ah thanks! Already found it. Def hopping on board that wagon
---
oh man, wasn't concussive shot in vanilla also like super low cd where you could literally keep it on the target forever and they couldn't do shit because it was daze and not regular slow? or is the classic patch the one where they nerfed it already?
---
also does hunter still have deadzone? that used to be annoying...
---
That’ll hit home with a few people I think! It’s strange how easy it is to miss the point where the fun drains away and the chore starts, and then you keep going because that’s ‘what you’re supposed to do right?!’. Thank god for realisation :) enjoy classic mate!

Dont underestimate the existing experience with the coming content. 
---
With time I am sure even with casual hours you'll be able to properly raid and progress through MC / BWL in random groups.
---
Yes but mage water is always body temperature and smells faintly of asparagus.
---
Anything “below” serious raiding. I want to do great in dungeons, and get the dungeon sets. Casual raiding has usually been not worth it for me, so I will most likely avoid it completely.
---
Aside from that some “goals” will be to get a bunch of neat fun items like the whistle, and level fishing.
---
Then it’s time for alts :)
---
In a similar situation to yourself so dungeon set 1 was originally my goal, now I feel like I should push myself to dungeon set 2!
---
Yikes you keep editing your comment. I can feel the desperation from here. I don’t blame you though. If I said *only* warriors could tank and someone linked me a video of a Druid tanking naxx, I’d be pretty embarrassed too. 
---
As for the rest of your comment, there are countless videos on YouTube showing both Pallies and Druids main tanking Ony, BWL, MC and even Naxx. 
---
Give it a rest already.
---
Certainly a wise way to go forward my friend! Hope it’s all we’ve cracked it up to be, cheers!
---
Laiki is the bank alt xD
---
I hope the classic+ (in a sense of any alteration to prior expansion progess) discussion is held by blizzard. I'd be open to tbc/wotlk scaled down to 60 and major limitations on things like flying, no dungeon finder, no varying difficulties, etc
---
The wow community is retarded though.  You need somebody that can give the people what they need, not what they necessarily want.
---
I wouldn't mind people being able to choose, but the list from which they can choose would have to be carefully curated.
---
Otherwise we gonna end up with flying and LFR.

I still don’t understand the name or why there is such a fuzz about it... is it because the ex? Or what is causing it?

Surely they are going to have more servers for Launch? This is a joke right?
---
You can view RP-PvP realms as regular PvP ones with an added layer of immersion. If you enjoy a casual RP encounter here and there, as well as a more mature community compared to the rest of PvP realms, you'll probably have a good time on Zandalar Tribe.
---
I believe this video nicely explains the philosophy behind RP-PvP realms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9roQePm8w
---
what are you even talking about? are you trying to replicate like lvl 20-ish dungeon group in phase 4-5? in p1 you will get so many whispers you would be picking classes assuming you only have 1dps slot(usually you have only healer\\tank slots open btw)
---
Better to play against, theres crossrealm bg you wont get faced that much and if you are looking to rank in pvp enemy faction doesnt matter when it comes to honor
---
It's simple.
---
1. Get a good headset
---
2. Lock your doors
---
3. Start the game, pick a class and login
---
4. Start leveling while emersing yourself in the beautiful music.
---
Forget all that everyone is saying here and make sure that you create your own experience (alone or with a friend).
---
In the first season of wotlk ret/disc was a super popular comp.  I got top 5 running mage/mage because half the teams were ret/disc and ret/disc cannot beat mage/mage.
---
Good point, as long as it is not weapons that overlap, I think the group will do fine.
---
And mage is the only class (other than warrior) that we have locked in, we want that water and those portals ;)
---
Hey guys I got my troll warrior named Kajhindo and my undead priest named Lament
---
I love how you people resort to name calling the moment you’re proven wrong. You said to link you a video of a pally tanking in naxx, I did. We’ll see a lot more Pally and Druid tanks this time around 😂 
---
lmfao
---
Hunters get a quest chain where they not only get a quiver but a bow and a weapon. All 3 in one quest chain from MC.
---
Priest get Anathema (also from MC) which is a Long quest chain for a great weapon which you can Change from Healing weapon to shadow dps weapon.
---
both German servers where full since the name reservation was opened
---
Getting to 60 before the majority of players will give you a huge advantage. That's why people want to do it. it's extremely simple. If you are fast enough at leveling to get a sub 6 day 60 time then its not your first time leveling a character in vanilla. Insisting that unless you are *taking your time* and *stopping to smell the flowers* that you are missing out is, frankly, condescending.
---
Longest 2 weeks of my life
---

Rude -Rogue

Goal -undecided third class lock/mage/hunter

I agree. This is really something, that should have been changed. At the very least, they should implemented a floor, e.g. you cannot lose ranks, so once you are at Rank 12, you always have at least 50000 RP, no matter how long you don't pvp. This would at least allow you to take breaks. 
---
Or better, just make fixed honor values mean a certain contribution, so you don't have the aspect of competing with your own faction anymore.
---
Have fun, do some raids, get 10 and wpvp.
---
You meant corpse run?
---
“Oh shit the add respawned I can’t get back to the group!”
---
“Let me put that CC on my hot bar... what 1 min cooldown!?”
---
“Why can’t you hold aggro properly tank?”
---
So start making some threads
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhtprnN5Abs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhtprnN5Abs)
---
And? Same goes for every class. Warriors are probably in like the top half of most enjoyable classes to level once you get to mid 40's. The only really boring class I've heard several people complain about that I know have actually gotten characters to 60 in WoW is paladins for people who leveled one without knowing about the /sit reckoning build. Aside from personal preference there's nothing that really makes warriors a pain or inherently boring to level outside of the early levels. You could say you just prefer spell casters, but that's not just a warrior problem, you probably aren't going to like leveling a rogue or feral druid either.
---
People talking up getting a warrior to 60 as some big achievement in itself only generally spout that because it's an absurdly good class and they want to feel justified in having it and not seeing it ever get nerfed in anyway.
---
no... but if they end up without enough servers, they won't have a choice and invade the french again. hide your baguettes.
---
Yup I went all in with the little gold I had and bought tokens. I was thinking that the token prices would go up after classic and I might not be able to get 5 tokens for 1M later.
---
You have a wife?
---
absolutly, check out the quest chain for dungeon set 2, it requires tons of high level mats and around 60g and running lots of dungeons. It is "easy" to obtain as long as one puts forth the time and effort. there are a few youtube guides out there for the set too.
---
Death knights. Am I a joke to You?
---
Does that make the people that don't want to play on Faerlina streamists?

I’d think it would not be a hard cap, but rather based on their estimates of tourists leaving. If their estimates are that 70% would leave a month in, they would probably  “cap” the server and layers for that server so in the end it adds up to a healthy population.
---
And yet it tells me I need a active account.
---
So edgy
---
never die in wow (game)
---
Levels until 40 has always been the worst imo. 40+ and especially 50+ feels like a walk in the park compared to below 40. I really like 50+ zones and brd farming.
---
Community polled patches are what this would need to work, the boomer community will be united against any changes unfortunately, unless an original classic server will always be up for those who enjoy that to stay there
---
DUDE make me one!? :D
---
If it was a simple layering issue they were looking for then yeah sure. My guess is they have more issues around the 40-45 area that they want to double check. They know that opening up the test realms would have a flood of people coming in, but obviously thats no what they're looking for.

See, this is the part I just don't get. What is it about pandaren that pisses so many people off? Pandaren have been in the universe and even playable since WC3, even if they didn't play a major role. Why are they less "fantasy" compared to bull people or wolf people or pig people or any of the other animal-people that WoW is practically lousy with?
---
Only real difference I see is that the light doesn't move around the hand properly.  Looks fine to me.
---
"feeling threatened by groups of mobes"
---
Exactly the reasona why vanilla is so fun and engaging while retail is shit. On retail you just pull everything in sigh, pop all CDs and wipe the floor with 6-10 mobs while watching a tv show on another monitor.
---
Still do not understand why theres even lvling in retail...
---
Could you by any chance perform a different test for me? I would really like to know how much the mobs from Scarlet Monastery melee hit a clothie for (mage would be ideal). A pre-made 40 is alright to test this with. Maybe take off a bit of gear to mimic say lvl 35 for Library and so on.
---
Exactly the same as it works on a PvP server, then.
---
It doesn't mean they're actually full.  The label is there to encourage people to create characters on servers that are not marked full.
---
Sounds busy! Hopefully you can get some gaming time in.
---
Phew, hopefully I have a good time then!
---
How dare he want to play the game he paid for!! god damn entitled kids these days..

Came here to post athene, legend
---
It's when you care about efficiency is where you'll get burnt out, just play at your own pace, every class is viable to level to 60. Some are admittedly faster but don't let that affect your decision
---
Better than the blood elves put in to appeal to virgin male teenagers.
---
Or maybe we can all get off this high horse and just enjoy the game?
---
I'm the same, I'm going to take my time too. :)
---
Their logic is weird, but im sure theyll release new realms once theres a 20k queue per realm
---
But then people will cry about name reservation xd
---
/u/Ridikiscali  
---
WTF?!?!
---
They should just change either Pyrewood Village or Mirage Raceway to PvP, 1 Normal Server should be enough.
---
Cool! Hope you enjoy it :)
---
I'm the same!
---
I mean more people than that are probably watching their ship spin in circle on EVE at this very moment so yeah maybe.
---
I had the exact same thought man. I don't mean to circle jerk this but damn we're smart cookies
---
Thanks so much for this add-on, I really appreciate you taking the time and sharing it. Looking forward to trying it out on release!
---
Also don't get bogged down in people's personal requests for adjustments, you've done your part. Everyone always has something they want added and it's easy to find yourself trying to accommodate them.
---
- A simple unit frame, something like Perl Classic would be spot on. I used zPerl in the stress test but it wasn't quite there.
---
- A DoT timer would be nice. Decided to play Druid first instead of SM/DS Warlock as originally planned, but would still love some nice timers.
---
- Mob health display.
---
- Possibly a hotbar mod.
---
- Maaaaybe Titan, just because I did originally have that when it was super popular back in the day.
---
Definitely not any quest addons or anything else that simplifies game tasks. I'll log into retail if I want any of that nonsense.
---
Okay, thanks for the reply! I like my own company anyway so should be good.
---
If we brought 2 retri and 2 boomkin and some other meme specc shit like a survival hunter and a tankadin, bye bye 4HM+ maybe even Thadd or loath
---
Could you imagine a 40 man raid with all hotmics? That shit should be classified as torture.
---
Grobbulus looks better by the day but all my friends are going Herod 😭
---
I'm EU and probably gonna go Alliance :/. Thanks though mate.
---
It's not actually an RP realm - so it is indeed not worth rolling on for RPers.
---
"Locked" servers aren't really locked, either. If it's the same as the stress tests, realms showed up as locked but you could still log into them. Queues weren't even that long, I think the longest it took me was around 10 minutes to log into a "locked" server.
---
Sounds cool :)
---
I mean, I personally think it's fine, but I'm also not some leet pvper that wants the absolute lowest latency. I played with NA ping on servers hosted in France and I didn't really mind. East to West would be even less ping than that.
---
But why though?
---
Should have looked better, it really says that too. 😀

Blizzard has never had a fucking clue of how to properly do a hybrid class, druids especially.    
---
Their version of “versatility” was always “be able to go respec and put on new gear and then be a different thing.”  That of course is very problematic, because shit is fucked either way.     
---
If a paladin can tank as well as a warrior, dps as well as a mage, and heal as well as a priest... why wouldn’t everybody play a paladin (or a Druid or whatever).  Why play a mage if a moonkin can mage just as well, but can also respec and use other gear to switch roles?     
---
But the other side is fucked as well.  Say you compensate for that by making ret do less damage than a rogue, prot tank worse than a warrior, and holy heal worse than a priest.  Well now why would anybody play a hybrid if it means you are free to take your choice of any of three mediocre roles?    
---
The real solution is to make things like druids “mediocre to decent” mages, rogues, warriors, and priests... AT ONCE.   The strength of a Druid shouldn’t be the strength of its roles, but the ability to shift to any of the 4 forms on demand as the situation calls for.  The versatility should be the reason for being a Druid.    
---
Instead, things like Druids just end up being delayed character selection, where you can level to max level and then make your choice.
---
Nice, sounds great.
---
22$ shipping, yikes.
---
Rp-PvP is sometimes referred to Rp-light. If you want to mainly focus on Rp, go on an Rp server. If you want the full experience the game can offer, Rp, Open World PvP, Instanced PvP and Endgame PvE, go on an Rp-PvP server.
---
Rp will definetely work as long as the community is not flooded by a massive amounts of Trolls.
---
I will actually gladly make time for him and show him around a bit. After all, he's not visiting me, they just wanted to see the city. And I think I have 2-3h to spare.
---
Plus, he's not a gamer, and I doubt his gf is one.

27th at 0:00 on Paris/Berlin timezone. In London it will be at 23:00.

Someone was allowed to make bonersauce though
---
I’m out of the loop, what’s the big deal everyone’s made about Thex as a name
---
I have similar concerns, however I believe if they limited "changes" to added content such as some difficult 10man raids namely Karazhan &amp; perhaps even Zul'Aman it could add nice some longevity to the game as well as changing up the gear meta.
---
It's 4:30am and all the servers are still full/medium lol. I think we can firmly say it's not people sitting at the login screen.
---
*cries in shadow priest*
---
And that didn't stop wpvp in the slightest. Dominating stv or searing gorge was way more valuable when lvling then any amount of honor.
---
i was rather fortunate that my sub ended 20 hours after char creation opened   
---
wasnt even planned or anything, just regular re-sub  
---
now ill just take some time off until launch
---
Can you make me one for a undead rogue, I'll pay.
---
lol...
---
On the locked servers you couldn’t create a character unless you already had one on that realm though
---
Good plan!! :) have a nice journey then, the rogue with engineering will be amazing at pvp.
---
Was only like $6 shipping for me ion the US.
---
it a pretty big reason alot of us played BDO.
---
Probably to avoid White &lt;Power&gt; and other related race baiting shit people would try to pull if given the chance.
---
It wasn't funny the first time why would it be funny the 5th time?
---
You use $1400 on your computer, but then bottleneck yourself with cheap 60Hz monitors? That doesn't make any sense
---
He was warned multiple times that beta was random for people who had accounts from classic and for streamers. In paying money for it he took a chance. That’s on him.
---
Where was it advertised?
---
Hey Cromer, thanks for the reply :) ;  in regards to SotC + SoC twisting I wasnt actually able to test its implementation due to level constraints during the beta, and so to this end its effectivity is something we will have to confirm at launch. The questions which would be raised here would be; would the damage modifier of SoCr affect the SoC procs? ideally it wouldnt which would make it extremely effective but if it did that would be something to consider, furthermore given the attack speed modifier vs weapon speed and GCD's how many attacks would be clipped from twists as a result? this would be contingent upon the weapon you were using and its relative speed.
---
To this end SoC + SoR twisting would prove the most effective rotation if it is possible; this being due to zero clipping of swings, sotc not affecting soc in regards to damage production and the removal of attack speed modifiers allowing for the introduction of other abilities such as consectation into the rotation; which would result in a gross increase in dps. This being said this is all speculation until classic release ;) .
---
I plan on playing pretty semi-casual, like 1-2 hours on every other weekday and maybe 4-5 hours on Weekend days.
---
My Goal is pretty quick raid progress in a semi hardcore semi casual guild with 1 raidday in p1-3 and max 2 raiddays when aq launches. 
---
I also try to push for r10 but as i did this before on lightbringer im not sure if i can do that agian, maybe it gets easier on the Blizzard realms who knows.
---
Not sure if ill stick to the end of Progression and do naxx but with the right guild its really not that much of an effort anyway. You can basically raidlogg it with 2 raidnights a week
---
Who's doing the cooking and cleaning the next half year? Seems to me it's the worst time to be single.

I’ve thought the same thing about the OSRS community, but there are some people that have actual good ideas. Now that the average age is 20+ for both games, logical well thought out ideas and open discussion is the norm when trying to get the developers to listen. Ofc you have a ton of shitposting and garbage memes, but the good ideas almost always stand out

Nope closest thing you’re gonna get to that mount is the winterspring frostsaber mount

From central Florida I got 50 ping to an east coast server on bfa and 80 to a west coast server.

Nice work! This almost makes me wish I was playing a druid haha
---
This plus the ninja weapons episode

Ofc it's "country dependant", but it just hurts to see that being from Europe :(
---
You're just going to love Classic bosses dropping ~3 items for a 40-man raid then.
---
If i remember, i can do it later. Not going to take that long as you can just make the char, you have mount and mage teleport (if it puts you in orgrimmar, like my orc shaman did when i created it this morning).
---
Yeah, and? Why isnt he allowed to be upset about it? Sure its on him, but why cant he feel dissappointed?
---
I saw it on /r/pcgaming
---
The descriptors are the same ones for retail, aren't they? Wouldn't it be natural for Blizzard to ignore those if they expect an exodus after the first couple of weeks or months? Isn't that the whole point of their strategy in how they handle classic servers?
---
Thx, just ordered.
---
Heavy breathing.
---
you realise d2 does not get released before Phase 5 or 6?
---
&gt;At least ppl realise EA is a shitty company.
---
Like they did in in 2012
---
Lower ranked spells are faster, keep a rank 1 frostbolt on your bar for a quick cast slow debuff
---
I'm in a similar situation, and expect to "really" play one night a week only, and then occasionally playing for an hour here and there when it makes sense. (Kid is gonna be 3 months old when the game comes out, so no clear daily schedule yet). Sometimes I might get a weekend to play if my wife goes to her parents and brings the kid, or something. 
---
I'm lucky to be in a guild already with a lot friends that will have more time than me. That will be a big help as I won't have to fight for a guild invite or raid spot in the same way as someone playing alone. In addition, my friends will probably be able to / willing to help me out a bit here and there. It should be mentioned that we're all fairly experienced Vanilla players.  
---
For the first phases, it won't take a lot of play time to get to raid, most likely. So while my leveling will definitely take longer, and getting my pre-raid BiS (or even getting close), will be a challenge, I expect to be able to raid one night a week for 3-4 hours, which should be enough to clear MC and Ony, and come BWL, I'll see what happens. MC and Ony won't require expensive consumables either, so not much prep time.   
---
Besides from that 1 night a week of raiding (raiding is a really big part of the game for me, hence it being my priority) - I will try to get my professions rolling, and slowly getting gold to buy the BoE items I need, and maybe eventually my epic mount.   
---
Once phase 3 comes around I will probably spend a lot of my time playing BGs, to try to get 4-piece blue PVP set (as I druid I just need the bonus). The BG format is probably gonna suit my playtimes well, as I'll be able to play for let's say 20 minutes, but actually get something done.   
---
If I end up with raid gear from MC and Ony, AND the 4-piece blue PVP set bonus, I'd be pretty set.  
---
AQ40 and Naxx I don't expect to raid really, though I would love to at least get to try them both, as I never stuck around on a private server long enough for those to be released.   
---
I will mention to you that the dungeon 2 set is not gonna be available for the first good while of the game (phase 5 as far as I can tell), so you might need something to strive for before then :)   
---
Ooze priest on youtube has some cool videos on prioritising your time through the different phases as a dad-gamer with 10-20 hours a week. Sounds like he's going pretty hardcore himself, but a lot of the tips are great.
---
You only get reputation rewards from specific battleground faction vendors, the items are bought for gold once you reach the required reputation level, not for honor points like in the expansions.
---
Iirc you can't rly lvl through BGs, and they won't be released untill phase 2 anyway.
---
I mean if you have 10k queues on both realms constantly they will either open new realms or lose so much players that they will have just enough for those realms
---
Not particularly, but for it is used rarely for some farming. Especially large groups of lower level mobs.
---
And here i am on Arugal, still low pop :(
---
Welcome to our world is all I have to say to that.
---
All (both) EU non language spesific PvP realms had over 11k queues for the first hour of name reservation. Launch day is gonna be nuts unless they give us more server over this side of the pond.
---
ahhh... judgments off the gcd ;p you can judge on cd, which offers you even more attacks and procs.
---
Yeah its weird, she's definitely a rare post cata and does have a loot table for greens so I think maybe technically not a rare yet as she may have been forgotten by blizzard? A good challenge nontheless
---
But it's also a large portion of endgame content. To tell a new player that they're good to play ret in raids and that it's "viable" is SUPER misleading and will only hurt them later on once they trudge to 60 with it. Imagine spending 4 months leveling to 60 and then not even be able to raid efficiently without swapping playstyles entirely
---
not seen filthy frank in a while
---
Importing works yes but otherwise to restore settings it seemed to require game exit for the first time. After your character has been created then copying any settings works just fine with a /reload.
---
If we didn’t have full bis roided fury and wbuffs I doubt this setup would have worked
---
There's no Canada like French Canada!
---
Youre right. But I think those people asking in the first place are the result of the bis mentality taking over so hard in this sub. It has new players asking ”what is best” instead of what is cool and enjoyable for me?
---
it's definitely a small annoyance with the drops, but the big upside is that you can specifically target quests that rewards good mail/plate rewards and all three will benefit from that.
---
I can’t imagine I’ll have even got to level 50 by the time phase 5 or 6 are out. Little time and a love for alts!
---
Is that what a virgins room looks like?
---
They can expect them from me lol
---
It is definately more difficult.
---
Honor works differently in Classic than in BC+. You have to grind your rank (which updates weekly depending on the amount of Honor you have compared to the rest of the players in your Faction) to get access to PvP gear, which varies in usefulness depending on your class. Rare PvP gear is relatively easy to farm, even in solo que, farming Epic PvP gear is pretty much a job-like commitment for a few months.
---
What?  There's no BGs at all in Classic?  Or does Phase 1 just mean they haven't implemented everything yet?
---
Religion is a mysterious thing
---
Friendly reminder - Classic will be playable on the 26th if you're in the Americas. 5pm CST for me!

[Global Release Times](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/PYV9W9Y8ZDNR1557767427825.jpg)
---
It does seem daft. A new or returning player has to level to max, farm for ages and do a quest just to be able to play a new race
---
As bad as lot of retail is, believing Classic will destroy it is delusional.
---
I managed to reserve my retails names for classic wow, good times.
---
Interesting point, if you dont have another name reservation on that server. Is it enough that you had made a char there, do you need to LOGIN on one or do you need actual chars to be on the server.
---
I have no idea. It could easily be that you can still make chars there and the FULL is just to try push new people to other servers (well, in case of EU, what are you expected to do, if you want to play on a English PVP server...).
---
Im sure we are going to get some blueposts soon about this. I would wait remaking your char until we do.
---
Thanks so much for the replies so far! So happy to see so many people enthusiastic to play the game despite some of blizzards decisions over the last few years. One other thing I should note is that I’m very experienced with the game in general (acct created in nov 05) and I recently played through to level 40 on a Pserver. I estimate my /played will be around 7-8 days since I will be fairly focused and rehearsed but not quite cutting edge. Thanks again and happy leveling!

Oh ok cool.  I wasn't really aware of the phases until now.  I'll have to look them up.  I hope phase 2 doesn't take too long.  I really enjoy the BGs.
---
am I the only one thinking people should really be using the vanilla Jaina?
---
My name, Christopher, is remarkable. My mam told me so.
---
Maybe have one go DPS clothie instead? I don't see any situation where 2 warriors is desireable, outside of raids.
---
I ain't NA, I ain't paying for a beta test that won't change anything
---
Holy shit I must have missed that in all the hype recently. That’s awesome! Thank you
---
No BGs untill phase 3. Phase 2 is world PvP fiesta
---
There will be 6 content phases in classic so Blizzard can roll out content at a similar pace and timing to how it released in vanilla. The game will launch in phase 1, where there will be no battlegrounds or honor system. Phase 2 will introduce pvp incentives and gear iirc

I gotta admit, it would be pretty sweet to be able to explore Azeroth as a vanilla-style pandaren monk.

I have for long stopped comparing Vanilla and retail. At this point they are two completely different games which just happen in same universe. Almost everything has changed. And I do still enjoy both games. Retail has a lot of good things which Classic is lacking. And Classic has a lot of huge things that have vanished from retail. At this point it's like comparing XCOM and Call of Duty. Both have guns but gameplay is completely different.
---
Get a mild pre-workout like C4 or ON Gold Standard. I like Beta-pump Red Alert personally.
---
Great work!
---
No, the majority of people who dip their toe into world pvp get hooked. it is what has happened with private servers over the last decade. The demand for PVE slowly vanished.
---
Yeah I haven't had any issues, unless the Discord service drops out and everyone is kicked. Quality of the audio is as good as the other services but inviting people in couldn't be easier.

this is exactly my sentiment. I did the PvP thing while leveling back in vanilla, and it was fun, but now I can guarantee if I got ganked i'd be pissed off 110% of the time

Hahaha, so good! Worth the deceit!

„Alternate realms.“ best thong was that they posted that in german as well.

Regardless off the gameplay of the expansion: what was your favourite loggin screen? For me it was classic and tbc comes rly close.

Awesome, that sounds great. I hope you guys have a ball playing it together.

If anyone has Kipz on Golemagg I'll suck yo dick for it.

Good call on Viscidius. Probably should put in there about Nature Resistance gear for Huhuran, too. Things like trinkets from Uldaman are BiS for melee on Huhuran.
---
wow that sucks that it took you that long to complete it....i know drop rate plays a role but damn!
---
Of course they are. All four servers don't magically all hit full the same minute by coincidence. It's based on characters reserved not people sitting at the login though. There's no chance at all it would sit at 'full' or 'medium' 24/7 if was was based on current logins.

Are you an experienced Druid? I mean.. are those information high value or simply your personal preferences/opinion?
---
Just lay down and let it happen baby.
---
Naah, shazzrah was lagging so much that it didnt manage to create the chars completely before you made another. Thats why it went over the 3 limit.
---
It's the worst PvE spec in the entire game. If you have one memespec DPS player in your raid, your total raid DPS might go down by 1-2%. If you have an awful tank, you will straight up wipe.
---
Prot paladin has shitty mitigation (both due to worse talents/abilities and lack of suitable gear compared to warrior), bad threat generation, bad sustain, no taunt and no defensive cooldowns.
---
I don't think it will matter much for leveling until much later on when potentially the warriors will have to fight for drops on pre raid bis etc. As long as they are fine with that your good to go. As a holy paladin your gonna be taking alot of different armour types of your looking at getting the best healing gear pre raid.
---
That ''Green linen shirt'' is really cool aswell.
---
The smart way to do it is to coordinate a high honor value that some random won't hit, then have everyone aim for that exact amount of honor. There could be 200 people aiming for R14 at the same time on both factions and you'll all get max points if you all have the same honor at the end of the week. It's just really hard to coordinate and if a few people mess it up, it runs it for everyone.
---
Played a couple days for stress which is when I resubbed.  Well worth the 7.50 or whatever it was.  Name reservation is just a bonus and it was cool hanging out with guildies during the process and a good foreshadow for the real release.  Also ... 7.50 is not nearly as much to me as it would have been 10-15 years ago.
---
it'll probably take me close to that time to get to 60, get all reps to max, and obtain all dungeon set 1. and if i do complete it earlier than set 2 is out then i'll try to find an accomidating raid group or i'll level an alt.
---
The only chance to really do this, if your not in the beta, was in the stress test last weekend unfortunately.
---
Launcher maybe. But if you consider twitter and fb for free you don‘t know anything about social media marketing.
---
If you're spending 6 hours to clear Molten Core while you're killing C'thun you're doing something wrong. :) 
---
If a guild can kill C'thun their MC clear time should atleast be down to 1 hour max.
---
&gt; have a nice journey
---
same to you :D
---
It’ll be even worse in classic tbh. In tbc and wotlk the best PvP gear was from arena but the bg stuff was atleast useful to gear through arenas and then you can use your new gear in bg’s.
---
In classic the blue PvP set is about on par with the epics from Mc. But will be easily outclassed by bwl gear. Bwl gear will be pretty easy to get. Your epic PvP set is extremely hard to get and will be atleast as good / slightly better then tier 2 depending on class / spec. The problem is though this gear is extremely hard to get compared to tier 2 and will be grossly outclassed when people start getting tier 3 and in many cases tier 2.5. 
---
The tbc system was actually a large improvement for pvpers over the old classic system as many of us really had little interest in pve content but simply did it so we could PvP.
---
Uhm, no. Naming rules alone is enough to deter any sane human being. Add the rp on top of that and you see why it is as it is.

Holy shit, that first song. Haven’t heard it in at least 10 years, and I used to listen to it all the time when playing WoW. Nice playlist!

Doesn't Divine Shield Also remove curse?

Pro hunters make sure to deal with anything that the healer pulls. Healers will love you if you do that.
---
Well that escalated quickly.

If you all think loot is really important i'm sure it'll cause an issue or two. But nothing drops once you can always run things over again and gear your team.
---
How about a website with a countdown? Anyone wanna sponsor a domain? I can provide the code.

What do you think they're gonna do? Close down retail? Turn off LFR?
---
Fuck dude i wanted gorguts so bad
---
I'm surprised a place like Blizzard doesn't have a way to simulate 50k player bots. Just enough functionality to trigger layering in various ways for tests.
---
I believe he turned the opportunity down

Same armour type is fine as long as main stat/resource used is different, works best. Eg.STR plate &amp; INT Plate.

You can do that for sure. 
---
The big + with consumes and world buffs is cuting down the time spent raiding. One thing with vanilla is that raids don't stop being relevant. Some gear from MC is stil BIS until Naxx, so even if you're guild is clearing AQ40 you also want to be clearing MC. So by using consumes and world buffs you should in theory be able to cut down the time spent clearing raids, and not have to keep adding raid days as new content comes out.

I wonder how many who plays Retail also logged in to reserve their Retail name, but don't really plan to play Classic?

It says it ends on Friday, but does anyone know what time it ends on Friday?

Same goes for shaman ghost wolf.
---
What server/faction are you rolling on?
---
So I know where to avoid going so I don’t run into you.
---
What the fuck, that would be messed up. I have friends that haven't reserved names yet and others who reserved a name for another friend. This would mean that the other friend could not play with us because he can't make a character on our reserved realm?

THIS IS A PSA SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT "GOOD PVPERS" SHITPOSTING FAERLINA.
---
Hey if I wanted to pick on pver's and casuals who want a "Authentic Classic Experience" Id go to herod too! Sadly I think I'd have more fun fighting better players that don't give a damn about "Streamer followers"
---
All I hear is complaining about streamer zergs and blah blah blah. 
---
If you think you are so good at pvp and want to shit talk 24/7 there  is an open invitation by all these current blizzcon champions and rank 1 players to step up on faerlina. Don't hide behind "Authentic Classic Experince" as an excuse. You going to do the same griefing to casuals trying to enjoy the game that would happen to you on faerlina. 
---
TL;DR Big boys go to faerlina. Casuals / Whiners / Bullies go to Herod.

I feel the same, I wouldn't play in an all Danish guild, but I don't mind having Danes in a guild. As long as they all put on their "international" mask, and not their Danish one, it's all good.

No but atleast they should understand what the players want in a mmorpg.

Don't have teleport mate, that's 42.

Chat will be toxic no matter where you go. Luckily there's a finite number of people on servers, so eventually you'll just have all the trolls and edgy kids on ignore.

Oh boy, what an unexpected turnout.

Instant corruption, amped CoDoom to help with instant SB procs, but yeah. You're a sb gunner until you get enough gear to switch to destro.
---
never heard of curse of doom being used for raids with the limited amount of debuff slots, isn't it usually, Curse of Elements, Curse of Shadows, and Curse of Recklessness that gets prio? while going affli also severely hurts if you don't get to use corruption due to nightfall procs.

Nothing short of amazing. Adding early name reservations was likely a way for Blizzard to gauge early interest and see if more servers where needed, hence why so few were announced. Rejoice EU community and big props to Blizzard for adding this before the game comes out.
---
inb4 I'm literally Hitler for stating an unpopular opinion
---
Since you're such a snowflake, I'm assuming you're going to roll on a Normal or RP server, so I wouldn't worry too much about running in to me
---

---
Then you are reposting it your self, wich is even worst.
---
This is great to know, thank you... had assumed Herod would be physically east coast. Thanks.
---
Hopefully I have a better experience with the character creation this time.
---
Yeah this seems like the kind of shit that leads to those occasional news articles where somebody plays for like 36 straight hours and then dies.    
---
Not to mention that a key part of hitting max level is often violating the TOS and account sharing.
---
It's one of the most powerful debuffs, which should simultaneously cause significant/minor drops in armor, damage, block, party, crit, and it is automaticly applied. Why exactly would it not always be up? I know there is a limit, but that doesn't explain this.
---
Because the majority of reddit users are on mobile and not actually pc. You can't play wow on your phone. But you know what dude I don't need to convince you. Believe what you want.
---
Health stones, people love the green candy. More shards needed.
---
In raids, your job will basically be to CoS / CoE, Shadowbolt and dotting the off-tanked mobs.  
---
When you show up to a raid, bring **at least** 20 shards and continue getting shards as needed when you're killing trash. Ideally Warlocks should always show up on time to raids to be able to summon anyone not there.
---
Don't forget to supply Soulstone and Healthstones throughout the entire raid too.
---
because you cant talk to girls irl and meet a wife that way?
---
You seem to care a lot about subreddits and their mentality. Bad idea.
---
u forgot bosh!
---
One of my earliest WoW memories was jumping off the cliff that surrounds the Orc starting zone and ending up in Ratchet. Exploring STV as a level 2-3 was fun! XD
---
Do we get another name reservation slot? Because I dont think a lot of people will delete one of their chars with a cool name in order to risk not getting it on a new realm.
---
That's funny when I think about all of those people saying Blizzard knows the best, two realms are enough, layering will solve everything and so on. Well here you go.
---
They're opening a new English PvP server (Gehennas)
---
gegner sind von anderen realms, d.h. du kannst auch gegen franzosen und engländer spielen
---
What if they run out of Flamewakers?
---
I remember playing Holy Paladin at the end of Wotlk, you could literally solo Warsong Gultch.
---
Well, thats something Blizz has to now figure out. They shot themself in the foot by only announcing so few servers at the first place. 
---
But they CANNOT keep the two first servers locked, its gonna be a shit show.
---
That's just this sub though right? Won't it be insanely biased?
---
I never posted it originally, I sent it in a group text message app to my friends, lol.
---
get off vent or i'll have you bent
---
You don't seem to get it. This is the 2004 version, not the 2004 remade and updated. Stop trying to make it something a handful of people want. It's like wanting to add new pokemon to red version. Just stop. Get over it
---
Ya exactly! Im gonna play a Druid at 60 and probably be HofW NS spec but if I’m healing and tank dies I’ll battle Tess it switch to tanking, same if I’m cat dps and tank or healer dies, or healer need innervate, organs keep fearie fire up and so on the list is endless for hybrids
---
Surprise to literally no one. This server should have been announced with the other 2. Now entire communities and guilds have to discuss whether to move or not and start the speculation game all over again.
---
But of course Blizzard knew better than us according to some people.
---
You can sell stuff you loot to vendors. I didn't learn that untill lvl 37 😅
---
You forgot some things.
---
No life.
---
No fun.
---
Depends on how many locks you have, weakest ones get to prioritize CoElements/Shadows, I had the highest dps and tightest rotations as a lock so I got to amp CoDoom. Nightfall still procs off of Corruption and it's still capped at PPM.
---
thanks mate, seems direct from Blizz is still best price I assume they put the gametime cards up do to the launch
---
Decided I wanted to play a Druid but make it relevant in so way or form to either the class or race I was going, Tauren.
---
Managed to make it a combo of both. I am a Male Tauren Druid called Malfurihorn.
---
Even Queef is blocked.
---
I still think they know best. They looked at the numbers and decided to spin up another server. You think it was because they saw it on Reddit?
---
Seriously I can imagine this guy just walking up to a used car dealership and being like hmmmm I'll take this one

---
Non RP names bruh.
---
You will be reported and forced to name change. Speaking from experience from retail.
---
Lets take a moment of silence to those who yet again claimed blizzard knew best.
---
Well, druid tanking is superior to warriors as MT on many encounters due to threat. Even with thunderfury, you wont be generating enough threat as a warrior with SNB so you will be going fury prot in order to compete with threat. That means the warrior will be taking way more damage than the druid while generating aprox. the same amount of threat (even if the warrior is SNB, he will be taking more damage per hit compared to druids due to the armour difference. The druid is however susceptible to crits and crush, which arent really a problem considering the much higher armour and health values. The warrior is likewise susceptible to crush and crit if hes not wearing a shield (and while shield block isnt up).
---
Why are the German and English servers constantly full then?
---
All are welcome in Zandalar Tribe, the one  PVP server left. Come for the low queues, stay for the atmosphere!   
---
But seriously, considering both servers are full and the amount of drama and going back and forth (Gole will get APES, Shazz will get \[insert non-English speaking community\], Gole will get streamer \[Name\], etc) I'm be very happy to enter a nice server with no insanity.

Yes not a straight repost, wonder where you got the idea from tho xD
---
Only melb fegs say cunny ya slippery gypsy
---
Shame there's only 10 of you. Another PvP realm would've made a lot more sense.
---
Well if they insist in layering and small amount of realms it will surely drop
---
Then hopefully the name you wanted wasn’t taken by a heathen from a different country who uses the letters in the wrong way.
---
This is really cool! As a fellow Night Elf Druid, I'll be using this for sure. Those form sketches....wow! :)
---
Ret paladins were only fixed in WOTLK. In wow vanilla it was the only role they couldn't do properly in PVE.
---
Fine for PVP burst damage and 'bubble boy', but in long term consistent dps to a boss, they're garbage.
---
Nobody has mentioned faerie fire, this is a raid wide de-buff.
---
THIS! RP-PVP  is not what everyone thinks. There is no RP in world channels, and you only have to RP if YOU want to. Just dont be a dick to those that do and you are fine! RP Servers in live to this day see the healthiest player base and communities. You get a more mature playerbase, less "Fad Players" that will leave after a month, and... its still PVP. Player organised RP events are fun as hell as well.   
---
They really are great servers.
---
Herod, actually. 
---
And if I’m a snowflake, it’s only because your a douche.
---
Wow! This is ace! Thanks 🙏

We did believe they know best.. we believed they would open up more servers if necessary.. and they did just that.

I doubt it. Though getting your name on the new realm probably won't be nearly as tough as the other realms before since I assume most people will stick to their initial realm.
---
fresh
---
&gt;When you show up to a raid, bring at least 20 shards and continue getting shards as needed when you're killing trash.

Stupid question, do you need to get the killing blow when you are using drain soul on a target in order to get a shard?

No Korn? I am disappointed.

Battle res, pinkpaws, hots, innervate.
---
What's your most recent MMO, or favorite of all time?  Because Classic WoW is a very different monster than most modern MMOs.
---
They did. They opened with fewer servers than needed to gauge interest and opened new servers before launch to accommodate. Sounds like a great plan to me.
---
That's a great tip! I also found out today that most spells activate a global cooldown (GCD) of 1.5 seconds. So if you intend to sit and spam a lower rank spell over a long period of time, a 1.0 sec frostbolt can be cast the same amount of times as a 1.5 sec frostbolt. I think this is most relevant for elemental shamans who can toss out a 0.5 second rank 1 lightning bolt.

---
Since it's 40man you need everything, but as you said dps is shit and tanking is way too average to be considered. 
---
Most of the time you'll see a druid he'll a healer, it's a good healer even if average and consistent, by that i mean that a druid will make it smoother for other healers via those HoTs and spamming "big shots" if needed
---
But most of the time druid's spot is juste here for them to apply Lucioles (can't remember the english name) debuff which is a really usefull armor debuff
---
That’s right, it’s not,
---
The man is legend.
---
What did you think they were gonna bless you with? Wisdom? The only reason any pally would do that is to be a troll, and at that point this post isn't gonna stop em.
---
I’m now compelled to do something like this for the hunter i plan on rolling...or lock. Oh shit.
---
What worked, the transfer or the treachery?
---
The issue with Draenai and Blood Elves is that they can be shaman and paladin.
---
Doomsayers btfo.
---
Makes me wish I was leveling a drood instead of a priest! 😊
---
&gt; no summoning stones
---
we have em, they're called Warlocks.
---
Thats what Im thinking aswell. I kinda worry that this means Gehennas will be severely under populated in comparison to Golemagg and Shazzrah
---
Naming rules are lax enough of you don't want to have a completely moronic character name. Even then you probably get to keep your dumb name unless you actively rile people up to report you. And not like anyone is forced to rp, some people just choose to. I've played on a rp-pvp realm for years with zero interest in rp'ing and with many characters with really dumb names (who wouldn't name their priest "probing the patient" or straight up name their character "metajoke") with zero issues. The biggest plus about rolling there is that people who have a kneejerk reaction to the realm type won't be rolling there.
---
This is neat, I had no idea! Are there other class/ability combo's that can recreate a similar thing? For example, could I jump off a cliff and charge an enemy on a Warrior before I land to negate fall damage?
---
this drawing talent makes me hating myself for being shit at drawing

---
The true vanilla experience.
---
Don't forget their guild, &lt;Five of me in Org&gt;.
---
Out of those things i find certain additions to be excellent. The only thing they went beyond common sense with was class design. Everything else was totally ok.
---
and if they didn't add another server they also knew best? Is there any situation where they don't know "best"?
---
I'm guessing they increased queue threshold since no one actually logs in to the world. I was in a 10k queue, then I switched after getting in and there was no queue at all.
---
In that case the solution is to not release new expansions, instead conclude the story. Start a new project.
---
There's no point in keeping content that can't be kept relevant. I assume new players need to go through the old content to level up, give the new players the same leveling experience the old players got.
---
People have reserved their names, plans have been made. 
---
Sure you can move the communities, but it will have to be a joint effort. Let's hope the spaniards will move and make it their own server :)
---
If you have a subscription, yes. Just install the client, log on and create your character(s) on yours server of choice :)

Gotta start somewhere. This guys about 70% decked out all ready. Unless you’re talking about the other kind of twink you’re into 😉

Well, I'll tell you this.

I've got a female character called "Imaguy" and I still got creepy messages. 
---
At the end of the day you can ignore people, so just play as you want and have as much fun as you can.
---
If you just dinged and havent gotten your weapon skill up those 5 levels yet, getting them faster is definitely helping.
---
You’re doing Thrall’s work. Bless your heart.
---

It was completely obvious this was going to be their approach.  Everyone throwing their toys out of the pram needs to have a word with themselves.
---
Can anyone tell me why the zone is called Azshara? I've never done that zone
---
In private servers have had a couple of issues but not too bad. I’ll probs make both genders and see what happens
---
and who was saying blizz knows whats its doing?
---
People will assume that you are a guy no matter the gender of your character. Play whatever you enjoy looking at. You might enjoy the animations of a certain race/gender or the way the armor looks.
---
Hope spanish players will go there
---
I think a possibility for some is that they immediately connect it to the Kung Fu Panda movies which tarnishes their idea of what good fantasy is. (I don't agree with this sentiment)
---
Game shouldn't start at max level. It should start at level 1.
---
You're in the ClassicWoW Sub. Are you saying that you don't like the leveling in Classic WoW?
---
I listed them in my post. Communities already decided on servers based on the released information. Now a "surprise" server pops up and everyone is like "what now?" The fact there's only a couple of hours to make a decision to reserve a new name is just unprofessional.
---
Again, everyone who knows how big the EU wow scene is knew 2 servers wasn't enough. Everyone except blizzard.
---
He was a youtuber, he was semi-popular, he started to stream, his stream highlights got uploaded, he got bigger and bigger as people from youtube enjoyed his content went to twitch to watch it live. This repeated and now he is one of thee most popular twitch streamers and is able to bring WoW into the top 5 games on twitch by himself. 
---
If you are asking that sarcastically, well people like things and this has no relation to whether you like them.
---
Excersizing you’re right to bear arms
---
It's less than 9 hours until the naming reservation for the new server starts. 
---
And my point was that the entire situation could've been avoided if Blizzard had a slither of foresight, not that my guild would be unable to react to the changes.
---
If you never played WoW before, the best thing to do would be to go in blind. That is the true classic experience. Pick a race and class on what you think seems fun.
---
But just to give you some info just incase, the only thing I would suggest to make leveling more chill/easy is: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24994-Questie.html
---
By default, you get a quest and you need to discover for yourself where you need to be or what item to pick etc.
---
The quest does mention where you need to be, but Questie shows you in the minimap and worldmap where you need to be.
---
If you don't mind reading quests, skip Questie and go all pure.
---
If you like to read quests and then want to go where you need to be without 5m or so figuring things out, Questie is a great help.
---
I myself played in vanilla and only around level 23 or so I discovered Thottbot and it made life easier and more fun for me.
---
2 realms for both FR and DE are enough
---
In the real world you are judging something else than command or righteousness once per boss encounter unless the fight requires you to not attack the boss for 10sec. You don't constantly switch between light, crusader on the mob. That's an incredible waste of mana, in 99% of the fights, you will pick one of those debuffs and then only judge JoC or JoR.
---
Consecration is a talent every single ret paladin will have in pve. So what's the argument? You might as well argue Bloodthirst is a talent, so it doesn't really count. And that's the baseline you have consecration and jdugement, two 8 sec cds. That's the same as Bloodthirst + Whirlwind. You also have an execute. So compared to a warrior you are only missing the heroic strike rage dump, which the warrior loses in the execute phase and the overpower reaction.
---
So even with just consec and judgement, I still don't see how ret is more boring than a mage or lock.
---
&gt;Maybe 
---
You think?  Of course it was.
---
On a PvP server you can do a pre-emptive attack. On a PvE server they're safe behind their lack of PvP flag.
---
If you roll night elf female everybody will assume you are a dude anyway.
---
At least the european french are quarantined to their own servers
---
They are perfect rp names.
---
They literally said they were going to do that in an interview
---
I mean they have to aquire a budget and of course someone's job is to make sure the logistics work out. Blizzard didn't become a multi billion dollar company by making super risky financial decisions.
---
Yeah, noticed... if only they would have done this at the start. Now people are set in certain servers with names reserved. But maybe the demand is SO DAMN HIGH that they actually need multiple new servers, but every server thats added later might as well be named "this one dies first".

I want to play alliance druid and the male night elf model kinda sucks. So I play female. The more I think about it I pretty much pick female for every race on the alliance and the opposite for horde.

If you can't get a hold of your guild then don't move servers? There are plenty of solo players or small groups of friends that will and it will still alleviate the pressure.
---
As a legitimate female you can probably extort hundreds of gold for desperate virgins no matter what your character looks like. Use what god gave you, sister (your voice, that is).
---
Real horde players never wanted the sodomy association. It was forced upon us
---
Don't be an idiot.  They were waiting to gauge interest (from name reservations) before deciding whether to add more.  You'd have preferred 20 dead servers instead of 4 or 5 full ones?
---
If this new server also fills up they'll add another.
---
Well, we are talking about raid rotiations. Warriors also have nothing until whirlwind at 36. Judgement gets strong, once you get some spelldmg under your belt and consecration is a staple in raids.
---
While levelling mana efficiency is key anyway and yes, that's more boring then.
---
good one
---
This guy is literally a walking "Naxx is WotLK" meme.
---
As he said, you're competing with your own faction.
---
Playtime is a given. The competitive aspect comes on top of that.
---
Red is also Ironforge's color, so it kind of matches the IF print on the wall.
---
I can't remember off the top of my head, but there were options to turn stuff on and off. You can download it and try it and see what you can accomplish with it. Worst case scenario, you can just remove it and move on.
---
I've been playing female characters for 11 years and just once a low lv pally asked me if I'd be his girlfriend. In fact, most people think I am male (which is true) by default.
---
Told My GF that i Will break Up with her for 1 month so i can play, she agreed to 2 weeks
---
Play a Druid if you want more flexibility, play a warrior if you wanna smash in PvE, play a mage if you love PvP, play a hunter or lock for easy leveling, play a priest or pally if you want people to love you, play a shammy if you wanna heal in bgs. Play what you love, if you try something and it doesn’t suit you switch. It’s a long game and there are ups and downs along the way for any class. Bottom line play classic and as long as you have friends to play with and you feel like you fill your roll you will be satisfied!
---
Yes, I introduced two friends into it who did just this.
---
You'll usually be alright more people = more people that want to gank you but also more people that want to gank the ganker
---
I saw that Joana stated the avg player will take 30 days of play time to hit max level. I felt like I was still very new to the game and it only took me 14 days of playtime. I’m hoping this time around 10 days played will be efficient.
---
Not even using dial up? So rich!
---
This. Stay away from this reddit its getting pretty toxic
---
Worst part will probably be queues logging in during peak times. I remember the early days trying to login before raids on Sunday evenings for example being absolute hell. 
---
Pretty much a catch 22 though, as no one wants to be on a dead sever if/when people start quitting the game.
---
Unless you reserved your name, and you didn't reserve it on the new server.

(To be it doesn't matter, but to some it does)

Never played past cata, loved pandas in WC3, and love pandas IRL. However, I have this in-explainable dislike of Pandas in WoW. Maybe it's their neutrality in a game that is defined by conflict? Like we have horde v alliance as well as intra-faction struggles for power, and then there's ...pandas?

More than 20 days?!

Yet if everyone who thought like you actually went on a pve server they'd be high pop as well.
---
It works for me, but will post the text as well
---
Hey at least this one has a cool name. I haven't reserved my name yet so I'll most likely go there lol.
---
Warlock is a good choice although from what I've heard elemental and even enhance can have decent viability in raids with their array of buffs and utility. But yeah warlock guarantees you that dps spot lol
---
wow i love your writing style! I could honestly use this as a poster for my room!! &lt;3
---
Don't try to level in phase 2 lol
---
Well, it's a start. Now they should add another pvp server for english, german and french and it looks reasonable. I.e. 4 english, 2 german, 2 french pvp servers.
---
I’m gonna be playing on the WhiteMan, best of luck to you!
---
it means pre raid BiS
---
raid leaders fault for bringing a ret
---
Gehennas won't really be underpopulated, just when compared to the absolute shitfest that Golemagg and Shazzrah will be in terms of population.

There was a post where someone checked the skill speed with int and without. There is almost no difference.

Why the fuck is this getting downvoted? This is great news! One step further away from screwing up Classic!
---
They’ll probably go alliance since all PvP realms will be horde majority
---
Warcraft Classic...

"other people can't have fun if it's not the type of fun I want to have!"

You see that all the pve servers are listed as low pop too, right?

why are you arguing with someone on the internet at 5 am server time? Go to sleep.
---
Ahh, so you're the individual that took Spectre, making me use Spectral.

eehh pretty much everyone is reevaluating their positions.

&gt; I also received a PM from a lad that is a bit upset that I've given away  'an inside secret'. He's also a prolific speed leveler - most of you  will know him, but for privacy reasons I shant disclose. 
---
Athene for sure.
---
I have closed beta as well, could do the same.
---
A lot of people will delete their characters on Shazzrah and Golemagg and recreate them on Gehennas.
---
They almost have.
---
Lucifron is the german pvp realm.
---
Gehennas and Shazzrah for english.
---
Sulfuron Harbinger is the french pvp server.
---
Only Majordomo Executus left.
---
This is the prime example of them knowing what they are doing...
---
They had numbers in place, they watched those numbers and decided they needed more.
---
Penis? I'm talking about Staves. Like Atiesh.
---
Get out of my good christian subreddit
---
Nothing at all is another alternative.
---
It's 1 AP in cat form, he forgot to mention that, along with a note of 1 Strength = 2.5 AP w/ Heart of the Wild talent. It's what makes feral druids so strong, that massive AP gain from Strength!
---
You get an upvote for absolutely nailing the Warlock action bar
---
You completely misunderstood what I said even in my second comment, but it's ok, that happens sometimes. So again, I'm not talking about Blizzard, I'm talking
---
Its brilliant they have listened and have considered adding a 3rd pvp realm. The decision would have been gauged around the folks that reserved their names the other night.
---
There's still those that wont resub until the 27th yet though! So I guess they may cross that bridge once they get there with adding another realm?
---
Lol you sound so pretentious. How about anyone is more than welcome because you don’t get to pick who plays where...
---
depends on the person really, in my case it is all about the looks and animations for example, I prefer human male as warrior, but think the mage gear looks bad on male characters compared to females.  
---
If I were to make a rogue, I would make it female for nightelves, and male for dwarves.
---
It's not even worth thinking about until release. It's APES. They could end up on any of the 3. Shit, they might even take over the 1 RP-PVP realm.
---
Grobgang
---
The conflicting information is what we have. Expect any official info from them to be a ruse (until the actual release).
---
They might not know themselves.
---
Holy pala or mage for raid leading?
---
Enjoy playing both and cant decide between them. 
---
The fact that I am raid leader doesnt matter other than that it might help me pick which class.
---
(As a note: been raid leading for years and our core has been playing together since 2012 so have a good team relationship.)
---
30 days? That sounds like an insane overestimation. I played classic back in the day and I remember on my rank 11 warrior I had just about 1 month /played. I leveled solo and didn't know anything. Grinded the PvP ranks solo as well, not in any premades. 
---
 Granted I didn't do much PvE at 60, still grinding up to rank 11 was no joke and took plenty of time. Couldn't have had only 1 month played if an average just to get to 60 was 30 days. I wasn't following any guides and played the slowest leveling class in the game.
---
Holy f you are taking me back here - totally forgot Ventrilo existed.
---
Horde or Ally?

PLEASE SEND HELP.
---
people buying names deserve to be scammed
---
Great to hear for EU brothers &amp; sisters
---
Better to be cautious in creating too many realms initially and act on confirmed interest
---
Might be worth a post on /r/wowaddons
---
The 2 EU pvp servers had 15k queues for name reservation 5min after they opened.  There was a 10k queue 1 hour later.  There was infact at one point a queue, to see the realm list lol!
---
I'm in and I have never streamed.
---
Stop with this shit.
---
You should take commissions for these for how people want to level specifically!  I know I'd happily pay $10-$20 bucks or so for a specific character sheet!\~
---
I do wonder how the population will be, I doubt many of the bigger pre-established guilds will want to switch now. I’ve got my names already on Shazzrah but the absolute hell hole that is the server discord is really putting me off actually rolling there.
---
thats actually a solid strategy im using similar skinn-&gt;drop for craftign on my own toons.
---
That's a cool name... Would be a shame if something happened to it!
---
Amped CoDoom?
---
Switch to destro? Every warlock raiding build has 21 points in destro for ruin. You aren't suggesting conflag fire lock right?
---
Hello spanish guild communities! Would you like to be in a 10-20k que with brexit and vikings in an english only server? No? Then this is your chance to establish yourselves!
---
^^pleases ^^take ^^it ^^for ^^the ^^sake ^^of ^^ques
---
I hold madseason and frostdamus above all.
---
YEEEEES
---
Allfather, Thunderaan, and God.
---
Well its 2 fuckingweeks left to lrelease, If all these communities could decide on a server in 2 48hours im sure they can manage to do it in 2 weeks as well.
---
There really is no pleasing this crowd is it
---
I think this is according to their plan, mate. Releasing more servers as necessary.
---
Send you a PM
---
Lol this shit. They can literally do nothing wrong. Just pick a fucking server
---
Great news! I was already worried since I've been on a business trip this week and unavailable to reserve names or choose a realm.
---
Needs a warrior one!
---
Yeah I thought the same. I did use the piss out of thottbot and was able to get whispers for dungeon invites all the time but I don’t remember  flying through the levels much faster than anyone else.
---
There will be apes everywhere...
---
Me and 7 of my friends are going ally on Mankrik. Even if the allies are heavily outnumbered, keep in mind how huge the servers are and we’re listed as a medium server pop now. There will be 10s of thousands of people on Mankrik. Even if only 10k are on the server and 75% of them are horde, that’s still 2500 allies.
---
I'm not paying for a character creation. Will I still be able to create a character on popular realms on release day? Don't have desire to play on a dead server.
---
Yeaaaahhh duuude, Pandaren are so bad that only women, children or weebs can like them. Real **ALPHA** males don't like pandas. If you like them then you're an inferior beta male, no better than a children or a women.
---
Jesus Christ dude, what is this, macho 101? Stuck in the 20th century perhaps?
---
Ngl I didn't like pandas at first and now they're just "meh" to me. Not because I thought that they weren't manly enough though. I had trouble with the eastern/asian theme that came with them, in the Warcraft universe that mostly had generic european/american inspired medieval fantasy. I thought they didn't fit.
---
With the years I realized that wow always had various themes going with the different races. In fact, we already had Asian themes in vanilla, hell there's literally a samurai armor set and katanas every now and then. Also, orc blademasters are completely inspired by asian culture. Turns out they're not so out of place.
---
The problem:
---
* SFK's level-range means nobody will have a mount and probably hasn't quested in Hillsbrad yet. This means in the majority of cases every group member has to make the entire journey from the start.
---
* The class-quest is very important, so you can't just ignore the dungeon. So it's "mandatory", but so far out of the way that many won't want to do a second run.
---
* Horde doesn't have the same problem. They can just ignore Dead Mines or Gnomeregan.
---
Yeah I just checked it on a p server, I mainly played bears so I was 99% agi didn't give AP. But yes cat form gains 1 AP.
---
&gt; A bear offtank deals more damage than a ret pala
---
That's fantasy. You are talking about a tank specced and geared feral dealing more damage than a dps specced paladin. Even a dps specced and geared feral is behind a ret pala without mcp and powershifting. Perhaps you mean, you deal more dps than an offtank prot pala? That would be true.
---
There's already another post on frontpage
---
I thought this was one of those urban wow myths, that int increased weapon levelling speed.
---
They know what their doing :)
---
 Nothing short of miracle by activision blizzard. Listen ya'll haters, blizzard just added 50% more of Eu-PVP realms. They do listen and care. Literally everyone hated blizzard, but now they proved them all wrong by purchasing more hardware. Can we get some salutes in the chat for blizzard, the company that truly listens, they back. o7
---
Is this what's available at each level or what you should choose at each level, to save some gold?
---
Lol no
---
 I want to play hardcore at first then semi, love pve and tanking, been a MT from Lk until mid pandaria when I quit. Warriors have cool rotations even as dps in case I dont get to be MT, tanking is nice but I hear they demand so much time and gold for consumables, and they are bad at farming on top of it, I dont want to give my life to wow again. How many hours per week will I need to dedicate just for farm prep for raid as a warrior and talent switching for pvp?
---
My next pick is mage... They have AOE farming and really cool at pvp which I'll do a lot on classic as well. They have a boring rotation for pve raiding tho. Do I literally just spam frostbolt or is that a meme? Even if just spam frostbolt is there any cool mechanics that I need to do as rdps? Will I be bored raiding as mage? Never played vanilla but have plenty of experience in wow
---
oh while levelling for sure, however a standard rotation would definitely including judgement for additional attacks ;)
---
I mean I was still trying to log in to Shaz at 11:50, 50 mins after launch and it had a 15k queue.  So no.
---
What do you gain by saying something so pointless? If you disagree at least tell me why you think they are going to have a better time on that server than they would with anonymity.
---
I want to play a warrior but the statistics kind of frighten me (18%). Am I able to get groups for dungeons/raids as a fury warrior in early phase 1 (heard they start shining at the end of vanilla).
---
now we should get an extra character slot to reserve?
---
I hate to say it but if the last 15 years counts as evidence he’s probably right...
---
You people: "I KNOW for a fact that two servers won't be enough, we need at least 30 for EU alone"
---
Those people: "If Blizzard feels two servers are enough, it will be. If they don't think it's enough, they will open more".
---
So those people are still right and you're still wrong.
---
Now announce a new pvp server for US EST. Do it you cowards.
---
Lol no... bfa was solid after an hour.
---
A couple servers were down for 24hr, but Monday night is going to be fantastic!
---
Nope! We always used Teamspeak!
---
&gt;  You'll try to log in over and over again for the next 10 or 15 minutes and finally able to log in. You'll disconnect immediately. Then about 30 minutes later you'll be able to log in and play. 
---
Bfa and legion expansions were playable from the start. see no reason this will change
---
&gt; After about 2 minutes there will be 1000 other characters around you and you won't be able to kill anything.
---
They have sharding in zones of a certain population is reached, so while the world will be crowded you will not be fighting for the same boar with 1000 people just 5 or so.
---
Spain just announced that they will be moving to Gehennas.
---
Pallies can top healing meters fwiw. That stupidly fast cast time works well with +healing gear!
---
Gotta say I played on Argent Dawn EU back in Wrath because there was always community events going on, like running old raids (obviously this was before transmog so was rarer on PvP/PvE realms)
---
That been said SHAZZ FOR LIFE BABY

Dark Pact afflic lock is extremely viable for raids, and if played correctly should outdps destro builds early.

Nope. It says it in the intellegence tooltip in the paperdoll

a "gigantic hassle" you say?

A lot of people will move, and people who didn't reserve their name (a.k.a "most people") will pick their server on launch and probably won't pick the ones that are full.

Warlocks m8, you need to buy yourself a personal warlock

Based on the pinned [Server Demographics Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cp111a), it's close to 55:45 in favor of the Alliance.
---
If this is your first time, you are not supposed to know. This is the kind of thing that made classic so great. So much exploration and stuff to find out. 
---
If you never played WoW or started after Classic or TBC, try out the game without Questie. Imo you'll have a better experience exploring the game than rushing to 60. 
---
If you've seen the contant as often as I have rushing is just the easy way out, but if I could erase my memory of WoW i would do it without a 2nd thought.

Didn’t know that. Thanks for sharing!

---
&gt;Instant corruption
---
Absolutely not, guilds will not allow Warlocks to take up debuff slots with corruption dots.
---
Consecrate is a level 20 holy talent, so if you are full retri you need to be level 60 to obtain it. If you are not running a hybrid spec build.
---
Yeah because blizzard have never let down the community before...
---
Why dont you just take a look at the data?   
---
From 2009 to 2013, their stock price went from $12.8 to $10.6  
---
From 2013 to 2018, their stock price went from $10.6 to $83.2  
---
Now.. Can you guess at what time did blizzard introduce ingame shop? Yes, in 2013 Can you also tell me at what point in wows history did it start to lose players? Quick math and you got the result. Money &lt; Quality.
---
This is why I, also, am rolling ele.
---
Dark pact in raids? You're going to waste globals just to gain 150 mana when you could use life tap? How could you possibly outdps a warlock with ruin who isn't also wasting globals?
---
&gt; but isn't the whole hybrid dps thing being unviable a bit over exaggerated? 
---
The confusion is mostly because there are generally two ways to use the term "unviable".
---
One way it is an exaggeration because Vanilla PvE is braindead easy for the first few raids and even Naxx is braindead by modern gaming standards, it is just gated behind numbers rather than mechanics. From this perspective you can easily bring a lot of hybrids or other "unviable" specs and still complete the raid.
---
Now, the other perspective is that of being efficient. It is not just small differences, some classes literally do double the DPS of other classes. So the real question is, are you okay spending 5 hours doing a raid if it could be done in 2? Are you okay with doing a PuG where there is a chance of really bad players and not at least try to optimize with classes to counter bad players? Later on in AQ40 and even more Naxx you start to become gated numbers and it is much easier to bring meta classes than trying to gear up "unviable", since they need much better gear to reach the same numbers.
---
Personally I think for most people it will be okay to raid with "unviable" specs, but not too many, as casuals also generally have less time to play and thus don't want the raid to take too many hours due to poor DPS.
---
This shold include "where should I play" now me thinks.
---
Is engineering as big of advantage for a facemelter as it is say a warrior in PVP or can I get away without it relatively unphased?
---
One can only wish...I also hope for a better cool name. Don't like Lucifron.
---
Good luck with that.

Two PvP servers will hold less players than N-private server did alone. It was painfully obvious that two were too few. To hold the active ONLINE population of the largest private server they'd need 4 servers as it had 16k peak online players. One classic server should be about 5k active players with the world being designed for like 3k players online at the same time.
---
The Norwegian discord channel for the classic community alone has 3k members and Norway is a tiny country online wise in europe. 2 PvP servers means they expect at the most like 12k active players on classic PvP realms for english speakers which i mean... come on... 12k people? I've never thought we'd reach millions of players but like 100k isn't far fetched for me.

To me, holy is better than mage to raid lead. Half of the pleasure to play a DPS is to do the dps meter race, which is harder to combine with lead
---
I've raid lead as MT and as war fury, and it's was easier as MT.
---
It gives a whole bunch of useful stuff!
---
At least they did it before release. I think that's a good sign and yeah, that shows they still know what they are doing, because that tells us that they knew what they were doing and were ready.

This didn't happen in Vanilla, so no, your fears are not justified.

I agree that the name reservation was a good way to feel for Blizzard if the amount of servers they made was correct but the problem I'm seeing is that anyone with a WoW sub can reserve a name (and believe me a lot of them have). How many retail players will have reserved a name just because they can, not even knowing if they'll actually play? And how many retail players will play classic for the fresh feel and quit after a week/month to go back to retail? No one knows, not even Blizzard, so these numbers are in some way flawed...
---
What I do know is that merging servers is something to be avoided at all costs. I hope it doesn't happen that after a few months one or more of these servers is too low populated and a merger is due.
---
I like how Blizzard does a financial 'gift' to the players by including Classic into the regular subscription but it has its downsides...

Ele sham plz
---
The reasoning was "if two servers aren't enough, they will open more". Which they did. You still lose, which shouldn't come as a surprise to you because making the argument that you (with no data and no clue) know more than Blizzard (with all the data) is simply a really, really, really stupid argument to make. You lose it by default.

Tap relies on hp, healers aren't always popping heals on lock groups. You'll tap too, but you have dark pact as well for when you can't while destro sits there with their thumb up their asses. If you think afflic can't outdps a ruin lock in early raids, that's fine.
---
What makes you think that? Microtransactions and in-game stores in the way we have them now with convenience services and cosmetic items are still relatively new compared to when WC3 and Vanilla was launched.
---
Im glad someone else thought the same as me. Seems like a big trollfest on the discord with random racist and/or immature comments all over.
---
Did you guys not play in the beta
---
You should re read the post. This is exactly what I said Blizzards plan was. Blizzard knows more than you.
---
This. It encourages people to steal names and sell them.
---
[30M]People will probably be creepy if your make a habbit of announcing your age and gender before you start talking.
---
Just make sure you're boiling your pepsi.
---
100% agree, I would pay for a Undead Priest one.
---
7-12 on a lv 1 is a higher average than I reported to blizzard on stress test so they might have taken a second look.
---
please make warrior or mage i will print it out and hang onto my wall:)
---
Depends on how packed the area. When there are 10-15 players running around I won't bother blessing them, as I want to level as well and not spend my time blessing strangers. If I see a signle person or a small group or just meet you while running to a spot, sure I'll throw a bom or bow (if you have mana)
---
Thats like taking a van gogh painting, adding a branch to a tree and be like "i made this"
---
If you'd honestly say that it's "part of their plan" to have severe queues at release when they've implemented massive controversial counter-measures to inhibit exactly that then I don't think we can get anywhere at all. Have a good day mate, hope it's gonna be sunny where you live.

---
If you know your class, you can do really well in PVP against most classes. 
---
Leveling is really simple.
---
Soloing at max level is really good.
---
You won’t do as much damage in PVE most other classes at equal skill level.
---
Ammo and Pet happiness is quite tedious.
---
I debated it to be honest, I'm playing with just my Brother so we need to find more people to raid with and discord is great for that.
---
But I've played enough unofficial servers to know that server discords are complete trash.
---
Same reason why you would want to go to the realm forums back in the day. Find guilds or groups on your server, find people offering crafting services for rare recipes, keep up with other guilds progress, or just chat with people from your server.

I think the complaint is more about how dramatic people get when on top of their soapboxes and how matter-of-fact they are with their speculations and assumptions.
---
You're exactly right, though, about backlash. The severity of the backlash just sometimes doesn't fit the crime.
---
I’m the main tank in my guild, I get a free legendary don’t worry about that 😂

So.. it didn't kill it? It sounds like they're getting the best of both worlds, the whales and the poor no lifers.
---
U misunderstood
---
Maybe a break up isn't the best word for it, before you know it she went off fucking 5 other dudes while you level. "We were broken up"
---
I'm thinking perhaps them and the other unofficial language communities will remain on their decided serverpicks and this new one can be english only. Seems difficult for big communities to decide collectively to change.
---
isn't the other half of the streamers literally going on herod?
---
i know that most streamers are going on either of the 2 servers you named.
---
That's to prohibit the dead from rising after it hits the target. It makes sense if you think about it.
---
TBC best
---
Ok, it was perhaps a bit much to claim that in early survival gear, you would outdps a ret pala in dps gear as a bear. But around AQ gear, most of the best mitigation gear is also amazing dps gear, and with eternal rage from tanking the numbers are really close, and if you use a bunch of MCP's beardruid WILL come out on top.  
---
The spec for offtank bear and catdps is basically [the same](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxxosfddtV), only losing 5/5 Feral Aggresion, and you'll rarely use Ferocious Bite anyway (I did pick a dps heavy offtank spec). So the point about spec is pretty moot.  
---
With powershifting and **without** MCP, you can definitely beat ret paladins in catform as an offtank for individual fights (you'll obviously be using dps gear, any feral druid carrying only one gearset around is a disgrace to the class).
---
Can confirm as someone with mostly female characters. If you go for a female in-character name, people will assume you're female. If you go for Xlegolasx or Moocow, people will assume you're a male. Never really saw anyone be creepy about it on any paid MMO, just F2P and private servers.
---
Dropped mine off yesterday. Let's go.

even with a 30+ minute queue if the servers stay up I guess I'll call it a win.

Could you test the difference between the add-ons in terms of their looting speeds:
---
-Leatrix Plus
---
-Fasterlooting
---
It's only controversial to the top like 5% of the community. I can assure you that most people are happy about this. Take care, though :)
---
I have to say, me and all of my friends have not reserverd our names or played the stress test. But we have been waiting for this moment since WOTLK, i hope Blizzard realizes there is A LOT of us.
---
We need to see what the drop off of players is before the decide to add/remove realms
---
god me too
---
I agree with that. Achievements feel the same way daily quests do. Stuff that you feel obligated to do, instead of having a good time.
---
lolwhat people can sell names? I have Magician and Creep on Golemagg, someone pay my mortgage pls

Nah it’s dead. It’s like it had a bad heart attack stage 90... it’s just a waiting game now

---
They're essentially just another community place like reddit or the WoW forums. I had a look into the Golemagg discord and its fairly relaxed people chatting. Shazzrah on the other hand is just full of racism, and copy pasting memes every half a second.
---
When people see their server have ques on launch day, the new server will fill up so fast
---
What is wrong with spanish players?

That doesn't seem right. From cambridge dictionary:

Cool story bro, Enjoy your life :)
---
Down even downvote this guy, that’s what he wants.
---
I doubt 3 servers will be anywhere near enough. I mean is it unreasonable to think that there is going to be( just throwing out a number) at least say 150k people interested in playing on an English PvP server at launch? That would be 50k people per server. Even with layering that seems a bit crazy. I mean the economy of such a server will be messed up beyond belief. Auction House flooded and prices rock bottom because of competition. Even if population lowers it will still have caused a lot of problems.
---
I thought Alliance was skewed in vanilla because the game autoselected Alliance when you first booted it up. You had to choose to be Horde. Am I wrong?

Yes. All the spaniards. And ALL the scandinavians are in shazzrah. And ALL the brits.
---
PvP realms are the most popular by far. After that I think PvE and RP-PvP realms.
---
Ah yes, finally saw how terribly wrong they were in having TWO relevant servers for almost the entirety of Europe. 
---
"Oh boy Blizzard listened to us!" no they didn't.
---
Also keep in mind there are players like myself who don't want to re-sub just for name reservation and is waiting for actual release before populating servers.

Funny enough 0/10 is the same rating people will give classic wow once they realize it doesn't have the basic functionality of retail. Enjoy the LFG spam. LoOkInG fOR 1 tAnK.

You’re slightly early for Sh!t-post Saturday, but rest assured the community will not sleep until your message of hope and inspiration is conveyed to Blizzard.
---
Tbh. i think there will be potential for one pretty high pop server, if they somewhat maintain it.
---
Looks like someone was so busy buffing warriors they forgot to use it on themselves!
---
I actually paid money to prevent some people I know from take their names which, in my opinion, has a great value that justifies wasting half a monthly subscription.
---
I'm in a similar boat as you (dabbled a bit during Cataclysm) and here are my reasons for wanting to play classic:
---
Immersion - Your character is a living, breathing element in the game's universe. On one hand, your actions and contributions matter; more so for endgame goals which require days or even weeks of player collaboration. If you decide to play on a PvP server, you'll have to actively compete for resources against friends and foes alike.
---
Progression - There are only 60 levels, and (almost) each one will feel like a great accomplishment. Skills are plenty, but your gold is not; this means that you will feel rewarded/punished for the decisions you make while leveling up. Different classes also get different, game-changing power spikes at different levels due to the talent tree system. This helps solidify class identity; two characters of the same class may play very differently despite having similar gear or levels.
---
Community - You'll be playing a game that is VERY different from anything in today's market. It's a game born out of love that was developed untarnished by the ultimate desire for maximizing profit margins. You can't buy levels, convenience, or deck yourself out with store-bought cosmetics. The players who stick it out a few months post-launch will most likely be old school gaming enthusiasts.
---
Nice that they add servers. 
---
But am I the only one who is going PVE? 
---
Both are still on low, have no clue which I’m going to pick. 
---
Going to suck if the one you pick remains low.
---
I had a 11k queue 30 mins after the launch and got in after 5 mins. You're lying or kept resetting your queue.
---
Just pointing out the toxicity of this subreddit. Some here have such an irrational hatred for streamers that I can't wrap my head around. Genuinely believe some just hate how the Internet is now and wish they were back in 2004
---
"official"
---
I didn't know Blizzard provided discords for all of their servers.
---
Sup Reddit. I am a yearlong Horde player who started back in 2004. I have yet to experience the side of the Alliance, hence I'd like to join team blue this time around - atleast I think I do. However, the majority of my acquaintances want to team up with the Horde. We form a 40-man guild. So has it come down to friends vs. faction? How am I to decide?
---
To clarify: My best friend goes wherever I go. He'll play a warlock and I a warrior. We intend to do some battlegrounds as well as raiding, but nothing serious. We're going on a PvP-server.
---
Obviously there's some nostalgia with teaming up with the Horde. Actually I get a slight feeling of betrayal when thinking of leaving the Horde, sigh. The character models are superior to those of the Alliance. Their whole narrative and faction unity seems greater (e.g. Lok'tar Ogar and For The Horde).
---
So help a fellow neckbeard. What am I to do?
---
TL;DR: Vanilla veteran who haven't played for the Alliance. Wants to know which faction to represent in Classic.
---
"little" was the end of the sentence. There was no noun there.
---
Good to see, I'll be sticking with shahraz though, looks like itll be highest pop
---
Boars eat everything including mage food
---
This. It was 11k when i started and then heared in discord it was up to 14k by the time I was down to 7k. many many accounts are slotted for Herod. Pretty sure we'll have queues post layering if not during launch.
---
Horde = PVP Server 
---
Alli = PVE Server
---
Hab meine Namen auch bereits auf Lucifron gesichert :) FOR THE HORDE

I'm aware of that; last I used it though, you needed to get a (free) license from TS and agree to their terms or something. And I believe it limited the amount of total users too.

---
Oh I do quite vigorously
---
Well, I am happy just with it helping release date to not have long queues.
---
If there is no new content then no.
---
If I were you I'd go to Classic WoW Guilds discord (it was linked somewhere in this subreddit, you can google it) and find a guild that will suit you  -- there's a ton of guilds advertising themselves there, find one that will suit your gameplay style (laid back, semi-hardcore, hardcore?), timezone, raiding schedule, make sure they need a tank. There's a huge chance that most of the guilds will focus on dungeon leveling since it will be faster than questing during first couple of weeks after launch.
---
It's super easy to find a guild that has couple dozen experienced players already and people are friendly because they are there for a long run.
---
woot what are those horns  on the left o\_O Cenarius, is that you?
---
What did you expect, people who make these discords so quick crave the attention.
---
Maybe your parents shouldn't have named you after mature language
---
Of course not, random players are always going to be the majority, but there are still thousands of people who have organized things for Golemagg and Shazzrah, in comparison Gehennas will likely be filled with more people who aren't part of premade guilds or bigger communities since many of them have already committed to one of the two other servers.
---
It might not be "fun" when you picture being ganked while you're out farming on a pvp realm. But this makes the world alive and dangerous. And it will be for everyone.
---
This if you're not a pvper yourself might encourage you to prepare before going out in the world, e.g Stack up on potions or group up with friends to not become an easy target.
---
Pvp is the only choice for me.
---
Unofficial languange server is totally different. There propably a majority is spanish speakers, as unfortunate it is for the english speaking players. Here the spanish will a super small percentage due to the small amount of servers
---
It does
---
So is the only reason Mankrik is high is because of memes or is it an "official" community to some groups?
---
Beta access as well, no streamer. Obviously streamers will have access as they generate hype for the product. Apart from that it seems to be mainly people who have been playing vanilla back then
---
... both
---
to be fair, I consider myself pretty clued in but guess i'm not. I guess this one went over my head, my bad.
---
Thats gonna be fun for a while. Till everyone has naxx gear.
---
Ragnaros was used for retail, i think Onyxia is too but not sure
---
I can do all of that within the game already. From my experience, back in the day when I played (2006-2010), people who actually enjoyed the game just played the game and made friends and all of that *within* the game, those who went to forums etc. spent more time there complaining and memeing than actually playing so...I intend to do the same this time around as well
---
Right. Well tbh, I kinda want to stay away from those ”coalitions” and such so I’m starting to consider taking my guild to Gehennas.
---
Well then, maybe I can get my stress-test name now.. and since Gehennas was the stress-test server's name it would be on the same server as well.
---
RP-PvP no matter the region.
---
Unless you want to play with 13 year old trolls and racists. 
---
Just taking a cursory glance at the PvP server discords should tell you enough, now compare it to Grob or ZT on their respective regions.
---
I don't think that will be a problem. There are already too few warriors compared to their end game roles. 25% of a 40 man raid are warriors, so that's already 7% higher than the pick rate.
---
I almost forgot they put pokemon in retail.
---
True brits roll Golemagg
---
Newbies who google the game don't give a shit about reddit discussions about details like layering or number of realms.
---
The only reason anyone might assume that it's going to be trash is if criticism isn't listened to or actively discouraged.
---
I remember back in vanilla I had to log in right after I got home from work if I wanted to play later that day. 
---
So I got home, logged in, took a shower, ate some food then started to play. 
---
If you logged in later you had to wait. 
---
Could be 1 hour or more, sometimes faster if you were lucky. 
---
And my server wasn’t one of the really popular ones, some had it worse.
---
We are most probably going to Gehennas as well
---
Did not "shit on" women and weebs. Women like furry, cute creatures. That's not too outrageous, is it?
---
Called you a snowflake because you felt so triggered that you wanted to know my server to avoid me. That was hilarious to me so, yes, I decided to trigger you even more.
---
I don't think I was openly hostile to anyone, only you (for the reason stated above). I apologise if I did come off that way to everyone else.
---
We get it dude, I'm an asshole, douche, hitler and whatever else you can think of. How does you calling me these names help the discussion in any way?
---
&gt; I’m still not sure what professions should I get while leveling. 
---
Fresh start, all you want to have is Skinning and nothing else, it'll help you get your gold stash up for the level 40 mount. Trying to gather during launch week, even herbs (which is much easier than mining) is going to be miserable,  much easier with a mount anyway.  Vendor the leather up until Rugged, then stash a few on your banking alt for later when the AH gets going.
---
Subjective
---
The Devs said that they won't use names that are already in use for Retail servers so at least Onyxia and Ragnaros are out too.
---
I have no problem with saying "Two PVP servers isn't enough, they should add more".  It's the comments like "Blizzard fucked up, they have no idea what they're doing, how could they possibly think this is OK?? etc etc" that I can't stand.  To these people, nothing Blizzard do would be acceptable.  Start with 10 PVP realms? "OMG we are going to have so many dead servers after a month";  I really think some people on this sub are genuinely mentally deficient in lacking even a modicum of restraint or critical thinking.

This keeps happening all the time, and it's not only the Spanish, but the French are one hell of a group to do this too.

Wait , you have never played classic before and get to experience it as if its new....
---
Thats the dream!
---
Le ~~cookies~~ Titanforges are ready.
---
&gt; You'd have preferred 20 dead servers instead of 4 or 5 full ones?
---
This is something i dont understand. 
---
We are talking about 2 servers compared to 3 or 4 servers. NOT FUCKING 20. Why do you have to make the comparison to a number nobody is talking about. If you are trying to make a sensible point, thats foolproof way to make sure nobody takes it seriously.
---
Is this made worth mematic?
---
Set on paladin, been leveling and practicing he class the last few months on pservers and stress test but little bit concerned by the census. Realistically how many people will give up on leveling palas?
---
Horse armor released 2006, I don't think that's a very strong argument.

Also, east coast America. We use profanity fucking politely.

Thanks for the replies, never figured Classic would’ve been so much different than retail.

Crap, guess it's time to get back on the wagon then.

You dont have to delete your old char to get same name char on other server

If it's too personal you don't need to answer, but why couldn't you take time off? Is it because blizzard announced stuff too late?

Better to underestimate and add more than overestimate and need to merge servers week 3.
---
Not gonna lie, tried retail after 9 years of being gone and I thought it was cool as heck.
---
Only problem is, it plays like an arcade / action game, not so much an MMO.
---
I literally got one level on a "boosted" priest and was handed an artifact weapon. I mean it's cool as heck, but I didn't really deserve an artifact (or a level 100 character.).

Also every random dungeon  queue I get into no one really talks at all. They're just automatons that just "work." I feel like I'm playing with bots almost. 
---
But it's still cool. Still really 'effing cool. I was killing mobs and the dagger started whispering cryptic stuff. All the NPC's have dialogue.
---
I am kinda bored of the rotation.
---
Hopped on my old level 85 Cata full gladiator geared rogue. Can't backstab, no gouge. Wut.
---
I mean.. theres not really any logic to that comment.. Why dont you donate your apartment rent money to a cancer charity and live outside in a box?
---
I've made it to have track of your banker alt's inventory online. You should just talk to any banker npc to export your inventory (item id's and quantity) to google sheets page you can copy to your drive at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZzkpWI0wNriGf4btzAdqnqEMhrZQnKvgVm5Eo7zxwE0/edit?usp=sharing
---
I was Horde in Vanilla and while we didn't have to do Dead Mines the trip to getting there is one of my favorite memories. 
---
It's my number 1 complaint against the dungeon finder teleporting you around. Those trips were a fun adventure in themselves!
---
Honestly I hope they both do well! I’m more inclined to Classic right now but apart from paying for Expansions 2 games for one sub fee is pretty cool. Also Classic doesn’t have Blood Elves yet so when we get them I will shift further into the classic camp.
---
My family wants to go camping.
---
yeah. fucking. right.

Should we tell him about 45 to 60?

unexpected comment

Awesome :)
---
Are people really buying bands? In that cause WTS Hitman / Mental / Easylife on Shaz EU lol.
---
It's such a meme buzzword.
---
Emotional outbursts are annoying to read, but in cases like these they still serve their purpose of forcing an issue to be handled or looked into.
---
In other words, overreaction serves the game better than underreaction.
---
check the WTB name and WTS name channels on the shazzrah discord, lots of examples there.

Tauren Druid named Appa
---
i like the thought behind paying a lot of gold for an expensive animal, but blizzard actually patched that during vanilla wow and made it so that the animal is the cheap part at only 100g with the riding skill being the majority of the cost. (900g for riding according to a google search, i remembered it as 600, but guess that was the bc price). but yes, the gold farming as a whole was better than the pathfinder achievement. the only thing i think is a plus is that the achievement is account wide, so you only have to do it once, whereas you have to farm the gold multiple times if you plan to play multiple characters in classic wow.
---
Now this is quality content
---
I cant believe this low effort trolling works on this sub so well
---
This is so good. Thank you!   
---
Been a Tauren Druid for over a decade on live. But, the few IRL friends I have that want to play Classic want to go Alliance. So, NElf Druid it is! This will be extremely useful :)
---
Why would you pay 320 euros for a name? What's wrong with you?
---
Herod gonna have a 2 hours queue, I can already tell.
---
I rather read a (funny) thread about names then such poisoned posts like this.
---
I think he means that you have to delete one char (if you have 3) to create another one, but it's dumb to delete the one that has your best nick.
---
You do understand that name reservation is purely to get more data ?
---
I dont see problems with servers merging. They did that with my server in vanilla and it worked fine.
---
Put your hand on a hot pan and it gets burned.. you learn not to do that again.  Play with a Brazilian in wow and you get burned.. you learn not to do that again (although, I admit it took a good 20+ Brazilians before I was willing to admit the trend).  Watch a streamer mob run by and realize you don't ever want to be a part of that and don't want to see it in your game.  It's really not that difficult of a concept to understand.  Has nothing to do with taking one self too seriously.  Both of these elements have produced negative results historically while playing with so why would you expose yourself to these if you could avoid it.
---
People just have an irrational hate of everything on this subreddit i think. I dont really care about streamers so I just dont watch them or care about their every move. Theres also the extreme hate for everything blizzard does when the game hasnt even been released yet which is up there with streamer hate I reckon aha
---
(Funny)
---
There can be only one
---
I hope they just come out with a TBC server only and leave classic.
---
BFA BAD CLASSIC GOOD GIVE UPVOTES
---
Still undecided on Warrior Race. I reckon I like Alliance models more, but horde racials are looking attractive, plus no Paladin competition. 
---
I like Dwarf, Human, Orc, Undead &amp; Tauren.
---
Haha.

Funny.

At least make an effort.  0/10

So fucking awesome wish i had this for my hunter..

Thanks for being thoughtful, it’s ok. I work for a small company that relies on staff being there, as we grow it will ease, but for now I have to put in the hard yards to help grow it!

I’ll be playing every night though. :-)

1. culture shock because pandas and kung-fu and yin&amp;yang are asian influences in an otherwise western fantasy based game.   
---
2. kung-fu panda was out around the same time so the association is obvious and instantly makes people think "pandaren= kid shit"   
---
I personally enjoyed the change-up in aesthetic, but  i can see why some would be rubbed the wrong way
---
This begs the question - why the duck are you on this sub complaining about travel times if you're not playing Classic??
---
People who try to diminish other's enjoyment directly in their face because "lul not for me I guess" really get to me.
---
Would be amazing if u did warrior 👍🏻😎
---
If possible you can plan around it :) For example, get yourself in the queue before you make yourself dinner/watch a TV show/whatever, so that way you're not really losing out on precious game time.
---
With 5G and a laptop it’s doable. :p
---
Thex
---
Ive also heard the vanilla world is designed for 2.5k to 3k. But now with phasing does that statement still stand? It feels like that should give the world more room.
---
I am in no way in favor of phasing, just thinking that those 2004 numbers feels outdated with these 2019 changes.
---
Can you make a new post please with Gehennas?
---
If Spelladin works like it does in some private servers, it will be in line with top DPS for MC, like 600+ DPS while mages are in the 500s and warlocks in the 300s. The "optimal" raid comps everyone talks about are based on Naxx. Even if it isn't accurate with p-servers, Ret can do decent damage in early raids, competitive with the lower pure dps classes. Would I keep going with ret? Probably not after BWL because the scaling just isn't there from what we know, but the first few raids are 100% fine with ret.
---
Sh we don't want the normies to know about the secret clubhouse
---
Oh boy, gee whiz, would you look at that...

No wonder some of you guys need classic. Even using google is a challenge for some of you.

Will do.

The mad Titan did it.

**Congratulations, you're a prohpet.**

You must be one of those flat-eathers that calls 'FAKE!' on any pictures that contradict their own belief. This screenshot was taken from the battle.net website.
---
The case might be that Blizzard is either inconsistent in their communication, the rules might have changed over time, or the rules might be different for the EU (because in the EU, the language of the realms is explicitly flagged as 'English')
---
I know it's not a lot to go on, I'd rather have an official forum post on this too, but I'm sure as hell never getting one on the EU-forums (can't remember the last time we got a blue post).
---
Because Faerlina is going to be a server with a normal population, just like Herod. We get streamers, Herod gets elitists, Thalnos gets Brazilians. All servers get normal people, too. 
---
Kinda hard to back up your case for no hype for  Faerlina when it’s listed as ‘Full’ right now. Everyone I know is going to Faerlina and none of us watch streamers.
---
I agree, we will see a drop in players after a month, but it will be 20% max. Rest will stay and have a blast. And yes Vanilla was not perfect, but it was much better and rewarding than retail. WoW's sub has gone downhill ever since Cataclysm and the only reason Blizzard are giving us Classic (and possibly later TBC and WoTLK) is they can maintain a healthy amount of player before retail implodes.
---
I've heard that it takes hundreds of hours of efficient gameplay. I'm a bit scared but also excited lol
---
Well said.  I’ll give it a second chance.
---
You got me in the first half. Good one.
---
Toxicity* still reigns in Shazzrah. FTFW
---
Share results when you are done pls.
---
Right? Some people pay $15 a month to play a video game instead of donating $15 a month to a cancer charity. What selfish assholes!
---
Lol googled it now. True! And wth, got season 8 was pretty good ?
---
Please, continue to virtue signal. Hope that karma is really worth how dumb and childish you look right now :)
---
Layering isn't permanent. Once layering is removed after phase 1, the same rules of 2.5k to 3k still apply.
---
Would you be interested in money to do me one? I'd like to hang something like this in my office.
---
Hey thanks for the detailed reply. I will definitely look into it!
---
Was the name "Imafuckingtool" by any chance?
---
I played Tauren male sham in vanilla - but now after playing to stress test the posture of it makes me physically ache. I really hate looking at it -- same goes for male orcs, and especially male trolls. No idea why the art director allowed the hunch backs across THREE OG horde races. So I've been female tauren for a long time. Imo the most underrated race/sex super low key voice and the largest weapon models in proportion to their body size make them pretty sweet for melee.
---
There s one in BRD
---
You do not need to be character all the time the only people that say that are Elitist roleplayers who seem to want to gatekeep everyone to play as they do.
---
Alliance scum! /s
---
Great job!
---
Yeah read that too. They also said they made it so that layering was kicking in super early on the stress test servers to test it.
---
I’m so psycho I’m gonna level a priest!!!
---
You realize priests and shaman also have a 1.5 cast time healing spell with the same coefficient on + healing? (42.85) so you have to realize that is not the sole reason why they dominate hps charts
---
True brits roll Golemagg.

---
strange you  seem to be the kind of person that likes attention ,  or why would you add 25f in the title? 
---
oh yeah right...( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It aint even out yet lmao
---
Cuz I'm addicted to this game pretty much.
---
Even with BFA I would still sub, even if it was to jump around for a bit and complete a couple of world quests.
---
Also cuz 13 euros is such an insignificant amount that its pretty much irrelevant....
---
Just spend the gold to respec once, don't do that to yourself!
---
Why are you in 2 month old dead posts? Get a life moron.
---
Nah man, its the new scandinavian server, already announced
---
Any status other than "Locked" means you can login, create characters and play on the realm. Full simply means that the server is full and you'll have to queue to get in.

Sick mog tho not gonna lie

I have actually never considered this but you are selling this well to me...
---
Blizzard is not starting from Patch 1.0
---
We are skipping to the very last patch of Vanilla. 
---
All class changes, bug fixes, nerfs, etc will be in the game at launch.
---
Blizzard is going to gate some content in the beginning though. For example, Nax will not be out day 1.
---
Former Grand Marshall Human, and R12 UD Warrior. Loved the process up to the final push where it took too much dedication. Had a great premade, great support, and a great server who would work together to promote people into R14. I didn't give up after R14, I just didn't PvP quite as much. Eventually rolled into a Paladin healer to help a friend push.
---
Ahh. I wonder what the queues will be like then on Shazzrah. At name res we had 10500 in queue, hard to imagine almost 1/3 being inside the game and 2/3 outside just waiting :/
---
It is not a patch for patch detailed re-release. The content in question is basically dungeon/raid content and items (not item stats, items).
---
They had stated that wallclimbing etc would be disabled but people still scramble around like idiots in BGs so apparently they failed there. We will see when it is released I guess.
---
Yet you have them to thank for pretty much any progress on Blizz's end. It's like you haven't been paying attention the past three years.
---
I figured I'll try using those for bear stuns. If I don't see much effect I'll respec into something else from that tier, I like all the early feral talents!
---
It's unlikely to be honest. In Vanilla the Defias Brotherhood server was always well populated and active. Plus this time round there is only 1 RP-PVP server so there is less distribution of players, they are all together.
---
Not the most popular but not super rare either. But based on your mana and plate requirements it is the only one that fits.
---
My hope is that it will influence the game designers drastically and they get back to more RPG in the next expansions
---
I thought I knew what this was going to be ... and I was not disappointed.
---
Yes, it's possible to toggle quest icons on both map and minimap.
---
cringe
---
That’s what I’m taking about those quest I remember we’re ridiculous took me a month for the paladin one
---
In the naxx endgame I solo'd two blood DKs in arena as holy with mediocre PvE gear.
---
Ret was amazing. Ran into iceblood tower in AV and slaughtered 5 alliance players without issue.
---
Thanks for all the replies! What about endgame PVE/PVP and raids?
---
Brexit to gehennas!
---
Just double the amount of realms in total, Blizzard, and you will save a lot of trouble during launch. The amount of queues during launch week is going to be ridiculous right now.
---
I could see the Scandinavian community moving to the new one
---
I cannot even put into words the excess of how retarded you are.
---
I am sure we will have paid realm transfers and name changes i would be shocked if we did not.
---
Undead, undead, undead, I have 3 subs running atm even though i havent played for a while, so i will try to see if i can level 3 characters at the same time.
---
Warrior, Priest and mage is the idea simultaneously, because i used to play warrior, priest, rogue and hunter in classic however, i do remember i for sure need some heals on the warrior as i level to cut down leveling time, and i also remember the high value of mage portals to get around so, I will attempt to multibox them without multibox software. Probably gonna end up grinding all the way to 60 because thats what i found most efficient back in classic anyway. 
---
Not gonna spoil any names because i am not sure I will go for it, but some of them are the same names i used back in classic. I might also go for a orc trifecta of warrior + hunter + shaman and level that, but my shaman name was already reserved by someone so I was a bit sad.
---
I like your build. It's really pvp focused. I think they are down voting cuz it's not good for raids.
---
Britons never never never will transfer server!
---
golehhazrah is what I heard

I mean, you already have people who will straight up buy gold from gold farmers... That battle has been lost.

Sure, the thing I said is sexist, but it doesn't make it less true, does it?
---
I, personally, have nothing against furry weebs. People can enjoy what they want to enjoy. You're so eager to be offended by words and, again, sorry for the generalization, but your continent is the only one that's offended by words. 
---
Anyway, dude. I hope you enjoy Classic and have a nice sleep. Don't let the streamers bite.
---
Never thought about that. Thanks for the reply. I think this is the best way to do it. Is there any mayor benefit to have tailoring while leveling ? And in Classic there was no passive increase of dropped cloth from mobs ( guess this was added in wrath ?).
---
Friends
---
Nonsense idea. having too many servers is way way worse than too few.
---
just imagine. this is the what the classic player base is going to consist of.
---
You don’t know what that word means
---
surpisedpikachu.jpg
---
Absolutely terrible idea
---
Love the desk! and everything else :D
---
Retail is hot garbage
---
I wasn’t going to respond to them but you did a great job
---
I wouldn't object if i was just a side game. Runescape has an arena you can fight and make bets in. Not sure that part is a great idea but I do see the fun
---
You can't layer login servers you clown lmao
---
It better not be, I was promised Scandinavian's on Shazzrah!
---
Which server is for English/Scandinavian? I was planning on rolling on Shazzrah but I havn't created a character yet.
---
BFA is a million times better than classic so it has that going for it.
---
Pretty sure it was Wrath outside of crafting yourself gear not really plus paying for the prof training and skill training can become a big gold sink when leveling.
---
I could be won over to a system where there were zones too high to go into, but zones that you'd out leveled scaled up so that the mobs were at least always green to you?
---
There is no challenge in retail. You wouldn't make it past level 10 in classic.
---
It’s my fourth year at Center, been traveling across the country to see him recently, it’s been a great experience and excuse to travel
---
Yes and I guess that's what prompted then to release another server. To most it was obvious there were too few right at the announcement. I'm surprised they are THAT pessimistic about classic player count.
---
But they woke up a bit now I'd bet because the people reserving names have a high probability to not leave the game after a month. I doubt there were many so called tourists online reserving their name.
---
I dont have an addon, but know this secret hack command you can use: "/p how many more do you need?"
---
See I liked that they got me doing things I wouldn't otherwise and found them fun. I can certainly see your pov though
---
This was 100% a pserver thing. In Vanilla you reached cap in no time after levelup.
---
Unless that is 9 am, sounds like you have a life
---
He's going off pre-established, non-layered blizzard values, that vanilla was reportedly designed for. The common consensus was that the game was designed for a concurrent pop of 3k-5k.  
---
Presumably, Blizzard is not making any changes to server caps so it's logical to think anything over 5k would be over cap, therefore require queues. This is an eventuality because layering cannot be in the game when phase 2 gets released.
---
Golehhenazrah*
---
That's definitely a server I intend to play at.
---
To be fair you sound like you probably were pretty low on meters and someone should have talked to you. They probably assumed you didn’t have hit cap. Even casual guilds would look into people that were consistently low on dps
---
That was directed at the popular thread that was on this sub a few days ago. It was saying that we should not complain because Blizzard knows exactly what they are doing with the number of servers.
---
That was before the name registration.
---
So I am actually agreeing with you. It is just that they (obviously) try to keep the monetary risk as low as possible by opening as few servers as needed.
---
Somethings never change... and some things do. I think just about everyone has moved on to discord and has no plans to return.
---
Yeah, just wait to play the AQ opening on a PvP realm. It's a glorious shit fest mix of PvE and PvP.   
---
That was just so glorious. When it didn't crash. Had my main stuck on a boat for the entirety of the event.   
---
Had to play it using my reroll parked at Cenarion Hold for rep grind. Still fun though.
---
Yes please!
---
Im not in and i have never streamed.
---
What do we do now?
---
THANK YOU!
---
https://youtu.be/n4TyqYsC26g &lt;--- This.
---
I had 4 level 60's in classic. You probably got to level 5 then quit and came back years later when they actually fixed the game.
---
This is why you're likely a sad, sad, virgin
---
afaik the best way to level (at least up to level 40ish) is to go 2h fury, this will help mitigate the rage starvation you'll experience leveling as arms, and also wont cause you to miss literally 60% of your hits as you would if you went dual wield fury.
---
I had this shirt in high school!
---
Haha we are living together so ute chill
---
Shazzrah
---
BFA is the way it is because Blizzard didn't have the necessary discretion to choose what would benefit the game.
---
All backlash does is present the perceived issue and generate - Blizzard makes the call, or communicates their argument for why it is/isn't a good idea.

---
Also good luck regarding your workplace - that's 100% higher priority, and those nights will still be awesome. Enjoy the rest of pre-launch, it's a wonderful time to be alive!
---
you mean classic blizzard not to care about EU
---
It's honestly not bad. Just keep questing and try not to do too easy of quests.
---
Mine is fairly easy to get but all my alts are adaptations of the original, so I have Witherus but also Witherushock for a shaman for example
---
And you get offended by words and facts.
---
See? Now we both know something about each other.
---
Christ
---
Yes for PvP I believe it’s worth it. Adds a chance to escape if you mess up. Also really good unshift hit NG then apply dots while you’re kiting waiting for ng to pop and when it does go for a Regrowth and rejuivnate and back into bear or cat. It just adds to the long list of tools. It’s even better when they blow a trinket to get rid of that, then hit em with warstomp and entangle THEN do all of what I listed above (but heals first instead of dots).
---
&gt;Next x-pac will defiently be a Facebook game.
---
Funny. When classic fails and this player base begs for it again I hope you enjoy the mobile version of classic.
---
Can't wait for all the 45-60 bugs we'll run into.

both PVP servers are full, new one will be full aswell MARK MY WORD or don't i'm just a shit poster.

&gt; Not understanding difference between data and knowledge is just the kind of thing I would expect from your average salty redditor.

Pretty ironic statement coming from you, don't you think? 
---
&gt; Keep living life in ignorance though, I know your kind is perfectly satisfied with it.
---
Unlike the mighty Rafoel, who studied the blade when "we" were merely normal people and is now slicing through the mindless ramblings of Blizzard like a katana with his razor sharp intellect and his musty trillby. For truly ignorant is the sheep that believe actual quantifiable data taken from analyzing the amount of traffic generated can hold a candle to the allmighty hunch of a level 30 dweeb.
---
Jajajaja, tarde. Aquí vienen las lecciones gratis de español.
---
Please tell me you’re rolling alliance 😈
---
Coming from one of the 2 players left on classic in a month.
---
To be fair, lets not act like people didn't want it back then either. People will generally chose convenience in the heat of the moment and after years of piling changes they realize that something's off, and then it's entirely Blizzard's fault again.
---
That's why listening to the community can be a double-edged sword.

Blizz did their part though. I think four servers for each NA and EU would be good, but all the people waiting in que at launch will be mad they didn’t take the chance
---
He will just layer hop and move on with his business. Corpsecamping will not be a thing
---
Since they are doing 40-45 for now I would not be surprised if they are doing all the 40 to 60 areas tested out before live. In addition to trying to showing layering not a big issues.
---
Hopefully someone can get a picture of a full Ogrimmar.
---
Yes I think they should add them to give you a break.
---
Imagine still playing retail.
---
I usually go by the animations I like more. In classic for exemple, I love the male undead casting animations.
---
In retail on the other hand, they're all the same now, so I play female characters.
---
Leveling up and feeling the same or weaker, is bad game design
---
Imagine thinking classic was good.
---
This was literally the plan from the start. This is the perfect way to do it.
---
We cleared WC up to Verdant who was impossible, basically 1 shotting our tank. Still tough, and a slow crawl, but fun challenge.

Shazzrah.

"Dont you think blizzards knows best?"

This is funny.
---
Yeah, I'm considering starting there as well, just because I think it'll have less communities that have been previously established. I'm just going to play with two friends of mine, so it'd be nice to join a guild that's not carried over from either retail or private servers.
---
Last I heard, it was Shazzrah, no idea if the new server, will change that
---
At least retail doesn't make these cringe ass vow posts.
---
This is so streamers can advertise the game, catering to assholes once again.
---
I hear that, it’s hard to give 100% for more than that. I hope you get into it enough to thoroughly enjoy it, but not too much for your priorities to shift!

Thanks heaps, I appreciate that a lot. You too! :-)

Do you have any other interest in roles outside of healing? (Guessing healing for Paladin) if so, then if it is DPS do shadowpriest, of tanking Paladin. If PvP, then priest.
---
...
---
Name changes weren't in vanilla though
---
do it!  Seems like it's going to be a great time/experience!
---
Jealous! I’m going to be Han Soloing for the release weekend.
---
game comes out on Monday if you are NA

Obligatory Rammstein lyrics in anything German related

I like your pun!

Did you not read what he said ? He's nostalgic. Hell I came here in the first place not really thinking seriously I'd play Classic WoW for more than casual play.  
---
Actually finding myself to be considering doing it the other way around. Casually playing BFA and seriously play Classic.
---
Do me a favor and test ElvUI
---
https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/tree/development
---
i hit 60 in 8 days played following joanas guide while being ganked a lot and doing few dungeons just to spice things up (so i wasnt following the guide 100%)
---
&gt;Does that mean that all my 15 lvl chars from there will be on live?
---
nope.
---
Not sure, it's been updated with a new beta version since the end of the last test. During the test I had to make sure i was using the latest alpha release for 1.13 that was only visible under "all files" otherwise it didn't work.
---
What about warlock closets though ?
---
Are you rolling Horde or Alliance?
---
Both are good for groups for different reasons. But it depends on playstyle or theme. For mage you will probably do frost and very much a spellcaster. Warlock has pets, a unique mount quest and dots if you want to do that. But, mage has free food and water and teleports. So I guess it is what parts of their kit and playstyles you enjoy more. If that is still not enough, flip a coin lol
---
&gt;Bitter, scared, and dependant.
---
Of what? A shitty version of a retail game? I'm just disappointed that blizzard wasted money on this. This is why activision/blizzard is only making money from mobile games these days.
---
&gt;Time to move on.
---
Coming from a player begging for wow classic.
---
Didn't you just make two?
---
It's not possible to transfer gold.
---
Hey thanks a lot guys, gotta represent.
---
PS. apparently i will have to find and kill you Bridgeman
---
Looks like you need more lebensraum
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Im a casual player and have the most fun in leveling a rogue. But id like to be useful in a group as well in the endgame (probably not raiding) and im not sure if a rogue suits that in vanilla. :&lt;
---
I know I'm going to main warlock, because I love the class fantasy so much. However, I'm really struggling for my second character between priest and shaman. 
---
I played both of these classes in retail, and got a priest up to 40 on a private server. Wand leveling really took it out of me, but i imagine as while leveling as enhance would be just as numbing. 
---
Goal would be to pvp heal at 60. I love supporting in games, and I'm a long time healer in MMOs.
---
If you care about "BIS" min/max-ing, Tailor is mandatory until you craft yourself that BoP epic robe. For PvP/max damage the second profession would be engineering. Enchanting is also really good but it's a pain to level up and you'll be starved for gold unless you can sell your enchants. So it's something I wouldn't recommend using unless you really know what you're doing. 
---
A somewhat "safer" option will be Herb/Alchemy, since you can farm your materials yourself and sell all kinds of flasks, potions and later on arcanite. 
---
You can also go Mining/Engineering since you're, just with the Herb/Alchemy combo above, mostly self sufficent. You'll be able to make all kinds of fun gadgets(teleports, jumper cables to rezz players, repairbot for which your raid will love you, etc.), explosives and even some good trinkets (Arcanite Dragonling and Mechanical Chicken i.e. ). But if you take any gathering professions you'll either outlevel them pretty quick or be forced to chase down every node you come across, even if you have to fight a dozen enemies to get to it. 
---
But in the end you can also go with 2 gathering professions just to make some gold, no one's gonna kill you or throw you out of your guild for it. Just go with what you think fits/feels fun or interesting to you. Just focus on enjoying the game! :)
---
I don't know if they would be able to do this. It may affect the economy if they did. I was horrified when I played WoW a few months ago, and green and blue items were hundreds of gold. Economy is totally ruined. Classic needs to be as it always used to be
---
In the first pic, Classic guide. Is that a leveling guide kind of like Vanilla Guide for Private servers?
---
For me it comes down to class flavor. Even though the warlock will do less damage(especially in the earlier phases)  I really enjoy their class fantasy and quests. They also add more unique support in the way of healthstones/soulstones/summons/curses.  I would play both to 20 or so and see which feels better as they are both great classes.
---
I am disabled ex-military, single, 34 with a pension, and I'm a paladin who's going to be specced PvP holy.

irony
---
I thought WC was actually really difficult at level 15. Deadmines felt overall easier, possibly because there weren't druids sleeping tanks. I got in huge beef with a shaman in a WC run who refused to interrupt. I explained clearly that white hands meant sleep, which always hit him as the 2nd highest threat target. He got all sarcastic about it, and the next time he got slept I told him "white hands is sleep btw", and he totally lost it. I had to ignore him just to finish the run without things falling apart.  
---
I think Verdant might have been doable with the Kresh shield. Our last attempt I lived a long time, but our DPS wasn't up to par and I didn't have DPS consumables for the rest of the raid.
---
In one hour we go back to normal mod mode.
---
But nobody expects them.
---
Oh I'm going there for sure. Screw these premade private server powergamers. I wanna form new bonds and friendships and start from 0
---
This actually resonates with me because on the 28th is my relationship's anniversary :'(
---
Elemental shaman or survival Hunter seem like the natural choices.
---
Never enjoyed Arena all that much, always felt like a neutered form of PvP where lame strats come out on top (pillar chasing, samey comps, healer mana battles, dispel fights)  
---
Maybe if 2v2 and 3v3 didn't exist and it was only 5v5, Arena would be a bit more interesting...
---
The usefulness of the internet to industry, commerce, finance, government, as well as recreational domestic use, was obvious from the start. No one who understood the technology underestimated its potential applications and usefulness; more often the reverse was true actually and the more fanciful claims about the possibilities of an online utopia have proven incompatilble with how people actually use the technology -- this is where I see VR. 
---
Maybe when there are zero-weight wireless headsets with 0 latency wireless cloud computing in a ubiquitous online environment or... something... then it will realle take off. But there are just so many ifs and buts. VR gaming is basically not a form of recreation that I can see appealing to people long term, I don't see the advantages over the currently established models for the purpose of having fun. There are no real uses for VR outside some gimmicky training applications that can be more easily, cheaply and usefully delivered using multi-functional tech or without any tech at all -- and I include what I take to be the main driver of interest in VR, the sex industry, in that remark :)  
---
I often think about Brown University's early VR Cave, a kind of Holodeck attempt back in the 00s, when people are advocating VR as the future of this or that. It was talked up as a military training platform, as a limitless innovative arts environment, all this fanciful nonsense, and had 10s and even 100s of millions of $ thrown at it over the years, but absolutely nothing useful ever got done using it -- though a few hype merchants made their careers out of it I guess.
---
Why ? Wotlk Frost Tanking was fun tho.

---
The 30th, the day on this meme made me think about it.
---
personally i'll be going Tailoring / Enchant (until i get the first wand) then drop Ench for skinning (gold income) once i get the epic robe (truefaith for me) i need i'll be dropping Tailoring and Skinning and go Mining and Engineering.  
---
(Staying tailoring and something else is also viable as you can farm Felcloth and make Mooncloth.)
---
Most important is that you get them G's to get that level 40 mount and level 60 mount. If you're going roll a lock keep in mind that it's possible that the epic mount questline only comes out at phase 2 so just try and get the g's to get a epic mount if wanted ofc.
---
Yikes.
---
More Lebensraum
---
You specifically talk about wow though. Scaling is super prominent in nearly every modern AAA rpg. Only wow has the too many expansions excuse, what about new releases like anthem?
---
It could really screw up the economy of classic it would be nice if Blizzard would come out and say that it violates the TOS that would not stop everyone but a good chunk people have a lot of time and money invested into there retail accounts many would not risk it if it violates the TOS.
---
Is this what they call high quality OC?
---
This is awesome dude. I'd love to see more.
---
Just saw. Crazy!
---
I queued in at 11,005 and I was in within 10 minutes.
---
Sounds interesting, but I couldn't get omniCC to work at all. the addon was working and i could bring up an options menu, but it did nothing.
---
why does every article and post same serverSSSSSS when it's 1 server.
---
Resto druids weren't super popular in the first season but we did alright against them in general.  It was harder for us to shut down but we could steal the hots and have way more longevity than we did against other healers.
---
I get my expansions around that time a little mixed but iirc  dks had ibf and trinket and once those were gone they die in a deep freeze. Ams and amz are fine but they're not reactive we'll kill you 100-0 in deepfreeze with a blanket on the druid.  It takes a long time for a dk to kill a mage stealing hots without connecting in melee range which you'll literally never do vs 2 mages.
---
Even against top 10 teams that had faced us before people underestimate the damage that 2 frost mages put out.  If blizzard does a wotlk remake I'm definitely playing mage/mage in 2s again
---
I cheesed the AH super hard, getting the BS plan for Runed Copper Beastplate (near BiS mail chest) early, and selling a bunch. I also bought out the recipe every time I saw it posted to limit competition.  I then moved onto Big Bronze Daggers, and sold probably around 50-60 of them at 6-7g a pop.  
---
I did give a lot of gold away to people who needed it, and most of the money went towards the insanely priced consumables and food I was using to try and kill Verdant.
---
Yes let's advise strangers to make poor life decisions in favor of a 15 year old video game. I'm sure there will be plenty of time to play during the first weeks before the hype dies down and nobody cares about the game again, nothing worth risking your job over.
---
Yeah I'm really wanting to play on zandalar because of this but all my friends are playing on shaz so in going to have to put up with the idiots on there
---
 Hopefully the discord won't be representative of the whole server
---
Whats more fun for you... as a casual player, thats what counts, right?
---
Still no keyring, macros don't work when you relog until you open the macro panel, charge animation still wrong. Lots of layering bugs.
---
or we have to go to the French servers
---
Please no, we need more servers, I don't want the English realms being invaded by people refusing to speak English.
---
I went to a RP server once before in classic and was told to leave unless I RP'ed 'at all times'. Never went back :/
---
Gotta get them AFK macros set up ASAP.
---
I won’t eat hot dogs either!
---
Dude, stay off the drugs.
---
Seriously, I had two R13s, was involved in multiple world first in Classic, had 5 lvl 60s, but one of my friends who has only played since WoD that doesn't raid, yet streams 5 hours a day to about 400 people was invited. He hasn't even played beta, because he has no interest in classic. There is a reason classic is so good, and it was because they invited multiple EQ guilds(including mine) to Beta to make sure the game worked, this time they only invited streamers and random fodder for streamers to kill.
---
Idk man we've been locked in to Shazz since they revealed the names.
---
It would be a big project to coordinate a Scandinavian change, and since we don't really speak the same language, I doubt that the gains would be as big as say a slavic server migration.
---
SEE YOU THERE
---
 Can we stop with the course language here? It's not only unsafe for  children who may be browsering here, it also makes you look extxremely  unentellegent, because it shows that the only way your able to  communicate and make you're point is too use foul language like this.  Smart peeple can make they're points without having to resort to such  harmful terminology. Grow up, we're not in high school anymore, we're in  the reel world and you damn well better behave like it or else I will  punch some suckers lights out.
---
How would transferring gold from retail to classic even be possible? It would be like transferring gold to the Sims from Retail.
---
yeah and the date and time is 3pm PDT the 26th
---
\`CEST\` stands for \`Central European Summer Time\`, i'm fairly sure europe works with that time standard as well
---
Maybe i am wrong i thought they were.
---
Yes it doesn't impact you at all other than the time it takes to create a character of course.
---
are you going to set up shop in the middle of your major city and craft right there on the spot or just do the AH?
---
how does it make sense? You kill an enemy and level up, and suddenly every enemy around you grow stronger?
---
I was able to get deadmines cleared but didn't have enough time to attempt a wailing caverns run. I would have loved to do that one. 
---
Before doing deadmines two friends and I attempted to do a few of the Tower of Althalaxx quests in Ashvenvale to get the Staff of the Purifier and a ring. We had me (priest), a 15 mage, and a 15 rogue. In the end we had to kill a level 24 warlock who summons voidwalkers and has a succubus. I died at the very end but was able to swiftly corpse run (thanks, wisp form!) And still loot his body in time! I really enjoyed the challenges we tried to overcome as level 15s.
---
The other two are medium/high already and just from name saving. Come release when a tonne more people start they will go for the lower pop
---
Cant they just add more layers? Isnt that the whole point of there small amount of servers at launch.
---
At this point if i were in the US, i would just go on the streamer server, at least the streamers and their communities speak english.
---
And they wont stay forever, some will, but the biggest ones will fuck off once some new flashy game gets released.
---

---
Most discords are cancer anyway. Why would anyone even care about a realm discord?
---
Goats. space goats.
---
Like the realm discord channels? Is there one for Herod?
---
Yup!  Pretty dissapointed that everyone that didn't want to be with a streamer or the brazillians were driven into one server.  The server will be awesome, I'm sure.  But we were definitely funneled there and the population is going to be enormous.  Even if they come out with another server -- all my friends, our guilds, friends of friends, we're all there it would be a coordination nightmare to try to get all of us onto another server so we'll be staying on Herod no matter what.  Two hour queues are nothing compared to not being able to play with you friends/family/guilds for the whole game.
---
I do like [mix&amp;matching](https://i.imgur.com/FzOXqGm.png) on retail to create my own look.
---
That said, Judgement is one of the only sets in the game that cannot be improved.
---
What is the estimated drop off? People keep saying there will be a lot but I don't think it will be significant for at least 4-5 months.
---
The last time I felt this way I was coming home from a camping trip with the family.  Once I unpacked I had to drive another 30 minutes to the nearest Babbages to pick up my pre-ordered Vanilla CE box.
---
I've actually been skimming my launch strategy guide in preperation, too.
---
S5 Druids went down like barely before a scythe it was all DK/Holy Paladin or Surv Hunter/Resto Shaman for healer comps.
---
Why do you feel entitled to complain and “force communication”? I don’t understand at all.
---
It’s a service. Either you like it and you pay for it...or you pick one of the competitors. If a company chooses to go onto reddit for open source market research, that’s fine - why wouldn’t they? It’s free ~~real estate~~ money.
---
Coming here to “force a reaction” is wild to me. Blizzard doesn’t have to react to any of this. If they want the help, then the onus is on them to seek it, but never the reverse.

---
absolutely right
---
Two things: the Grob sub is almost 1300 strong, and there will be people like me, who made a last minute executive decision to roll RP this time since Ive always heard great things about those servers.
---
french pvp and pve are still low. both of them. why would they need more? Germany for sure. both their servers are full. english needs 2 more pvp servers.
---
Ah shit, here we go again with the name reservation posts.
---
Also that lady of the statue with tits out in naga zones...
---
Most likely not
---
When will more slots open? I really don't want to be stuck on low pop when the good servers filled up in a day. Been waiting years for this game and am very frustrated with bizzard right now.

Great. I can avoid those ”coalitions” and tryhards.

I like pet battles too

That's really nice

Spell power ret paladin with blade of hanna and T2.5 can reach over 1k dps.

---
The regular ret dps from just AA with seal on is great for people that like putting in ~0 effort. So a ret paladin casting one spell every 30 seconds is better than a rogue using an ability every 30 seconds. 
---
Fair comparison I know, thanks. Also, that dps was tested on a pserver so it might not have the same effect on classic.
---
It was called ganklist back in the day
---
I liked arenas :c
---
I updated the post by removing the /script ones and now just need to find alternatives to fill those empty macro spots if possible and modify any of the current 1-24 macros to work better or confirm of they will 100% work in classic release.
---
Also keep in mind, WoW barely use any data, so you could just find any outlet (library is probably good), plug your phone in for tethering.
---
You're also welcome on Shazzrah if you want to join us? I speak a little German ;)
---
Speaking of azshara
---
That zone is so damn comfy in vanilla. There's not that many quests, but that just means there's no one there and you can enjoy the cool scenery all by yourself
---
&gt; What i would want is to play on a server where some ppl RP from time to time but it's more of an extra thing
---
This is basically how RP-PVP servers function. Nobody is expected to RP, just respect those that do. People jump in and out of RP frequently but it's not required. It's incredibly immersive without forcing it on you. I have played on RP-PVP servers since day one and never had a problem with communication OOC (out of character) - Honestly, I think you would enjoy it.
---
Best class for gearing up solo during phase 1 and 2? That is farming gold/mats and buy stuff from AH or craft.
---
I will be playing odd hours and with many interupts so 5-mans and raids are not an option.
---
I have Set and Ra
---
Yeah but don't you remember we should treat everything they say as opposite
---
Gay
---
Spirit is the highest tier stat for all classes
---
Are you trolling or something? You're not even responding to what he said just using the most cliche 15 year old conservative responses that you can find in any politics thread
---
Don't get the argument tho. Isn't Blizzard pretty much admitting they fucked up by underestimating the EU pop?
---
well duh, it wasn’t full because you deleted a character. GigaBrain
---
Nice! Thank you
---
no one cares?
---
The most important thing about wow classic is to play whatever class/race you prefer. You will be spending a lot of time on each character so go for whatever is fun for you.
---
That being said it better to have one of the warriors prepare to go tank and the other for dps after lvl 50 or so. This way you will have tank/heal/dps ready to go dungeons on lvl 60.
---
You will then roll on different items, so nps.
---
I'm 100% correct sadly, best of luck to you lil dude.
---
Im actually having a hard time choosing between the two. On one hand, I really want to play classic for the adventure and The RPG. On the other hand I love the superior raiding and dungeons of retail... Ill start with classic to see how I feel after a few weeks though.
---
Blizzard will do everything they can to prevent this.  You have to remember, most people at Blizzard today didn't make vanilla - they made Legion and BFA, etc.  So having everyone leave retail to play Classic would be a total egg-on-face moment, especially after the culture in previous years of openly mocking vanilla.
---
That, and retail has MTX so it's more of a cash cow.
---
Yup just need to avoid a lot of the community and 'meta' and god it would be so much fun discovering this world for the first time.
---
Based on what? Seems kind of random to say.
---
Okay kid. You need to go to school.
---
Theres just one problem, layering has to go.. so what happens when 500k are still playing in 6 months? Oh, right.. either we add 10 new servers or we wait 50k in queue to play. Its clear as day that 2 servers for eu would never be enough.
---
I'm going Prot/Holy hybrid to spam dungeons, padding out two gearsets.
---
Once I'm done I'll be switching to ret for PvP.
---
And better latency...
---
excellent skill at graphic design!
---
Hahaha, I love it. Best of luck with the move, and have fun 'finishing things up' at the old house. :p
---
WC3 maybe or rdr2 on the ps4 has an amazing storyline (if u can spare the 60$)
---
I downloaded Elvui classic from their Git during the stress test and it worked great already. Even imported my profile from retail and had no issues in the hour or so I played
---
Hahaha yeah! ;)
---
Level boost to 40?!? #NOCHANGES
---
They clearly don't know when to add realms for if they did they would've made more PVP servers from the start, like we told them. This company has no idea what's coming for them on the 27th. This launch is going to be such a shitshow.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
---
Was there a few days ago, total ripoff.
---
You might be able to avoid certain players, but toxicity... i dont think so. Just give it a day or two.
---
That's great! I hope you guys have fun playing. I am envious!
---
but my gear..
---
Its fine people in this sub have the memory of goldfish.
---
Herod is insanely popular and I have no idea how bad or not bad the queue will be each day. Less than 10% of Thalnos is brazilian, and probably half of that 10% speaks english anyways. Thalnos won't have issues. 
---
FYI - None of the servers will end up ghost towns, even RP. Old servers had like 3k people. Once(if) they remove layering and merge, it's hundreds of thousands per server. Even if 95% of the population leaves, you're still over 3k and trust me 3k is lively.
---
Just pick the server where your friends are at, and enjoy. Cheers.
---
Got most of my info online, from various videos and sites for example:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-druid-class-overview
---
and
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNHSOBkCYBk
---
Doesn't matter, you clown. The fact people are not playing the game and are stuck in the character selection and the servers still shat themselves says enough.
---
Forgive me bc I havent looked yet or used Atlas before. Do I just type atlasquest into twitch mods or is there a specific version I need to download for this mod? 
---
I have this completed as a spreadsheet but an addon would be much easier, thank you
---
I get what you’re saying, but I think you missed my point. There are only three servers. Pick your poison. Whatever seems least bad to you is where you should play. For me, that’s streamers. For you, it’s obviously not.
---
Just to help out:  Agility is basically useless for feral druids when leveling, try to stack str/stam rather than agi/stam which is unfortunately what you'll find on a lot of gear (that's meant for rogues).
---
Agility only gives 1 AP in cat form, whereas str gives 2 ap in both cat and bear.
---
One of the reasons you get a lot of feral druid at level 30-40 or so complaining about bad damage is becuase they've not been stacking strength and have been taking rogue gear and have a tonne of agility which barely benefits them at all.
---
haha so if you wanna play pvp, youre fucked. you gotta go to MERICA servers
---
yuh

I let gold farmers whisper me because I'm lonely

Fury Warrior - Gandwen
---
Got the same as my Fury warrior I started back in 2004, and still play today
---
Hey, shill, you said sharding, the term they are using is layering, which was good when announced but turns out to just be surprise mechanics. Sharding is that thing they said they weren't going to add and despite 50+ posts showing it happening it still isn't enabled on the servers.
---
Not sure what that has to do with me asking that person giving out unspecified info about server capacity, but werk
---
Looks like the community knows best and not Blizzard after all
---
it's not "free" since it requires an abundance of mats but I agree the quest is extremely fun and unique.  By far one of my favorite vanilla memories since I rolled a warlock and had no idea what to expect out of an MMO.

Download as zip and then unpack to the add-ons folder. You can import your profile as well from retail if you have it
---
This is the Alliance Red Light district where the Night Elves and Orcs come together to do bad things.
---
Curse is still a thing, but its moulded with the twitch app now, much prefer to download straight from curseforge site.
---
There will be another extra server or two come release most likely.
---
Mage or warlock? Would be on Horde most likely.
---
**Mage pros**
---
* Flashy pvp specs
---
* Can make and give out food/water + portals
---
* Good DPS with innate threat reduction
---
* Good at grinding
---
* Polymorph
---
**Mage cons**
---
* Undead or troll
---
* Tier sets look bad compared to warlock
---
* Struggles against warlocks 1v1
---
**Warlock pros**
---
* Buttery smooth levelling
---
* Can summon/soulstone + make healthstones
---
* Good DPS later + curses for raids
---
* Free 40 mount
---
* Tier sets look awesome
---
* Orc
---
* Beats most classes in wpvp during levelling
---
**Warlock cons**
---
* Accidentally taunting with shadowbolt
---
* Has to ask mages for food/water
---
* No polymorph for dungeons
---
* Pvp specs (SL or NF/conflag) aren't as flashy as elemental mage
---
Anything I missed? I love both classes but I'm torn on what to pick.
---
How many talents are in each talent tree. (14 in balance tree, 32 in feral, 5 in restoration)
---
It's just a quick way to describe to someone in semi-detail what your spec is.
---
There was never a public/open beta so that would be redundant.
---
That's fair.
---
&gt; no horde and alliance working together
---
Bring it on
---
its bob
---
I'm omw to work as you rant on the internet about a videogames downfall so your addiction isn't threatened...

Amazing.

I hope this will be the outlaw realm, without any of this:

"Was fun playing with you. Oh, my guild? It's swedes only sorry"
---
You get the rare chance to rename your character
---
Yeah I'm sure it's gonna suck for half an hour in stranglethorn vale every two weeks as well as on launch
---
Back in the day when Grim Batol Eu was one of the largest serves, it was slowly turned to shit by all the Portugal players (or Tugas as we knew em) by them just spamming portugese.
---
Having a server turn to garbage by people speaking their own language can happen.
---
haha, it's in german (or a mix of german and english terms) and made specifically for my gf. list of differences from BfA to classic (I know there are more, but wanted to cover the basics)
---
\- no dungeon finder
---
\- LFR
---
\- no achievments
---
\- no mount/toy tab
---
\- gold is much more important, and harder to farm
---
\- professions are actually viable (all of them)
---
\- spells cost reagents (for example buffs, brezz)
---
\- bis lists to help with gearing
---
\- dungeons are way different (no 20-30 min rush tubes like they are now)
---
\- spellranks (buying spells, move them to action bar and so on)
---
\- downranking explained
---
\- skill trees
---
\- weapon skills
---
\- respec costs money
---
\- no sum stones
---
In my opinion everyone who rolls here does not have to be into RP. 
---
However, if you think you will have a problem respecting people who want to RP and you want to have the freedom to yell stuff out of character then yeah, rp-pvp is not for you.
---
Yeah, also once you give in to demands of convenience, then when do you stop.. And if you stop, how do you as developer know which complaining about the game is justified and which would make the game worse over the years. 
---
Also think that the community had a very huge part to play with the downfall of WoW. Glad that the Classic Community ticks a little bit different, i hope that wont change too much down the road of classic.
---
A lot of people are worried about the lifetime and population of this new server, but the chances are really high that it will go full like Gole and Shazz. If not during name reservation, then during launch. I wouldn't be surprised if we got 2 new servers during launch considering how many people still have yet to sub to create characters.
---
99% of the people in beta aren't streamers.
---
Genuinely cried watching that.   
---
And I don't cry easily. Last time I shed a tear on anything was the first few notes of the end credits of Ocarina Of Time on N64. Not kidding.
---
So basically if someone didn’t reserve name, he won’t be able to play after launch? That’s retarded lol
---
sound advice.  i forgot it will be a while before hotbars are even close to full..
---
Get to school little kid.
---
You summed it up very well. Classic is bringing people back to when it was a journey and an experience and you had to/should have interacted with people you come across in the game. To me, retail turned into a rush to get what you wanted to do/get. No more journey, just an end point.
---
Hi. This is actually great. Is this available in addon form? If so, where can we get it?
---
Any you by any chance a complete moron who is unaware of the fact that they've contradicted themself in their own post?
---
Easy. Put your mains on Herod, and then make some alts of the other faction on another server (I chose Whitemane)
---
Queues on Herod too long? Play your alts and experience the other side
---
I also think a lot of people are forgetting how fucking long flight times are too. Remember flying from Orgrimmar down to Silithus? Yeah have fun with that!
---
&gt;Less than 10% of Thalnos is brazilian
---
Source? Everyone keeps saying this with absolutely NO concrete evidence.
---
Man, it warms my heart to see a fellow Izzet mage in the classic wow subreddit
---
No server is full, all that references is meaning you will have to join a login queue.
---
Golemagg is smaller than Shazz atm
---
You absolute legend
---
Was just listening to Are you dead yet? First time since wotlk.
---
I also recommend checking MadSeasonShow's youtube.  By far my favorite content creator for classic info.
---
&gt;What is the risk of moving?
---

since i had to subscribe to get access to name reservation, i've downloaded it to see how it was. not for me anymore.

Shazzrah's population is already on "full":

---
Same for Golemagg, will be interesting for sure.
---
Imagine replying to bait.
---
Long time Tool fan, that new 10 minute song just didn't do it for me. I'd rather listen to aenema another thousand times.
---
Breathe....
---
Nobody is playing the game yet because it hasn't been released yet you fucking ape. Sit down.
---
Everquest 1999.. they still have official servers going through live content over again :)
---
Surely it's better to add a realm than to remove one?
---
Hunter or Mage. 
---
- Hunter has the easiest time leveling solo and can farm decently well at 60 without needing much gear. Uses his pet to tank stuff for him, so low downtimes. Can solo a lot of harder stuff other classes can't. 
---
- Mage is a bit harder, but if you're good at it AoE farming will beat Hunter's performance by a lot. Also free food/water + portals.
---
Depending on server economy, maybe you can make an argument for Druid as gatherer due to shapeshift.
---
IMO whichever you like. He/She will be Your companion after all.
---
Nothing wrong with being conservative on estimates.
---
It's not hard to open new realms but you don't want to open to many.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cq8o8b/so_i_never_played_vanilla_wow_apart_from_the/). 
---
Well tbh as long as the non roleplayers are able to follow the rp server rules (name is the bigges one I personally care about), they're more than welcome to stay, I'd rather have an active server with a bunch of non-roleplayers than a dead one with only roleplayers.
---
Immaturity you mean?
---
"yes", but from what i understood, lua gets compiled to C at runtime so it works better with game since theyre coded in c++ and are performance reliant.
---
That's the point of a server being full, stopping new people from joining it. The server is at its capacity.
---
Not true - That’s “Locked”. I made new chars yesterday on full servers and it just warned me that I might be hit with a queue.
---
Bears are VERY viable for almost all raid bosses. Look up Skarm or SkarmTank. Dude is filled with tanking knowledge and has tanked all the way up through KT as a feral Druid.
---
This setup is fuckin gorgeous. Well done!
---
All i have to say to these name threads: "Can i still be Garth?"
---
Different servers, and different versions of the game. It's impossible to do.
---

---
Resto druid! You can level in feral spec and switch to healing gear for dungeons. Super versatile and excellent WSG flag carriers.
---
Bad idea.
---
Please dont, we dont want a dead RP server, so unless you are a troll or immature prick, please stay!
---
Server community is caused by these walls. You can't cross realm.
---
But Platinum what's the best hunter pet.
---
I one time called customer service because at the time I was into f2p twinks and all of my looms and gold was on my lv 100. They gave me a free 5 days of game time to mail all of the stuff I needed to my f2p toon :))
---
ele/enh can be great in PvP at least.
---
This but un-ironically.
---
I think the implication is that they first played classic together but didn't start dating until 2007 so they did t get to actually experience real WoW as lovers.
---
Also, we're disregarding that at some point he was a 18 year old dating a 15 year old. 🤣😲
---
Lol i had permission at 19
---
What if you miss launch by a few months?
---
FUCK YEAH! Can't wait to have them :)
---
Thank you for taking the time to write that response, appreciate it!  
---
I'm not gonna lie though, this made it even more harder to decide haha :)  
---
I'll probably end up flipping a coin at launch.
---
Some of us have Wow pokemon. I still have the collectors edition from '04 so i get either a panda or a little devil.
---
GMAERS RISE UP

My wife is out of town for conference and I have 14 days of PTO dropped for this. Her only demand is that I ship all my cloth to her mage so she can get her tailoring maxed when she gets back.

I am taking time for daily bike rides so my legs aren't jelly on my commute after two weeks off but other than that I am Pharis the troll hunter for two weeks.

---
lol ok. So you are telling me a that a billion dollar company does not know how to manage their product? Good one.  
---
Listen i'm not trying to defend Blizzard but this statement is ridiculous. Obviously Blizzard knows when it makes sense to add more realms, this community just happend to call it before Blizzard could make an official announcement.
---
You good?
---
Most people really don't care. Also, people will call you man or dude sometimes. Don't be that person who is like 'Hehe, not a dude! u\_u'' and you should be fine. Voice chat I had some creepy shit but 99% are people wanting to play a game.
---
I doubt this works the same
---
sure, just add me ingame!
---
Check out  Skarm Tanking - he’s a good source regarding Druid tanking and viability in Classic WoW ;) 
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ
---
I dunno, I think i got it when leveling a druid on pserver and googling around.
---
Another one of these quirks is that spirit is low key actually one of the best stats to stack as a warrior if you're solo leveling because it massively increases your kill to downtime ratio vs if you just stacked strength for damage.
---
Can confirm that Black was filtered too.
---
I would say Druid is more versatile for world pvp due to stealth and movement.
---
I want to focus mostly on PVP. I play a ret pally on retail and played outlaw rogue for m+ season 2. 
---
I'm thinking rogue/mage or priest for healing. What's the skill ceiling for rogue/mage in pvp? I am a decent to good player, but I know I'm not great.
---
I managed to secure TokenBlack the irony
---
Where am I saying it had anything to do with it? All I said was that we were right from the start.
---
is this on a private server?
---
The firewall will block them but it is easy to get around as thousands of Chinese play EvE on the global server tranquillity by dodging it.
---
But if you speak the lingo and want to raid you may as well play on the local server.
---
Ah well, just blame Blizzarrd
---
Hahaha, yes, thanks for the info, havent seen it yet, thanks for telling me. Cheers :)
---
you think you do but you don't!
---
I'm staying on Swolemagg.
---
They targeted gamers.
---
Gamers.
---
We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.
---
We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.
---
We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.
---
Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.
---
Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?
---
These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. 
---
Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.
---
Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.
---
Gnome Mage, "Boomshtick"
---
You don't have to RP on an RP server.
---
RP people benefit from a more full world so you are posting this with tenhead energy.
---
As a tank, you'll never struggle to get into dungeons. 
---
As a dps, there is always a surplus and you might get people expecting you to tank or complain you're a dps spec (ignore them).
---
You can still do it
---
Apparently they're staying put.
---
lmao loving that word

So, go on new pvp server, level, then transfer off ?

---
Sorry to break your immersion in the hivemind of degenerate incels.
---
my guild decided to stay with the Scandis on Shazz
---
Sounds like you may have more fun as mage. The reason why i always go heal/tank is due to the fact that i cant stand watching someone do my job poorly, so i always end up back in those roles. If you think it would bother you to wait around for tanks, and have shitty ones, go mage. If it's more fun for you to be needed and lead groups, do that.
---
I wasn't ready for such a personal attack this early in the day.
---
Holy pala for sure
---
LC barely slows you down. You create a loot council (...) of a few players that decides on who gets the loot, while the rest keeps on clearing the raid. Being 35 instead of 40 people for a few minutes doesn't hurt much.
---
It can create drama if people are immature, but that's about it. I never had problem with loot councils. A proper council cares about what helps the raid most. DKP is about what an individual players wants most. For a raid, the first is definitely the better attitude.
---
I wouldn't mind to be honest since it would make it easier to raid as arms warrior for me lol.
---
Just like your non existent nightfall procs **because warlocks are not allowed to use corruption in raids**
---
If you had any knowledge about vanilla raiding you would know that Immolate, Corruption and Curse of Agony are **strictly forbidden.**
---
That's like when they let you top up and upgrade banned accounts
---
my god so many epic IASIP crossovers have happened recently
---
I'm lucky that both me and SO play. Although he has to work that day... poor guy.
---
Someone modify this for Taurens, please!
---
Stole? You got a patent for that „bat“ Name?
---
Ah that explains it.  I didnt get any keys (and honestly dont really remember when keyring was added/removed) or use macros.  Charge seemed fine to me but I also cant remember exactly what it looked like 13ish years ago.  Layering bugs definitely though.  Happened to guildies quite a bit possibly due to the sticky feature that they tried adding to stop layer hoping.
---
Also hunters are needed for their Tranq shot in MC and skinning Onyxia (for BWL cape)
---
Won’t happen in classic cause honor system not out til phase 2
---
There is an arena. The only one that has ever mattered, the STV arena. Just gotta make the trip every 3 hours.

Struggling to lift his old crt monitor onto the table at McDonalds
---
Gonna keep reposting this ? Lol
---
All loot systems are subject to cronyism and cartels, you just need to make sure to be on the right side of the fence.
---
I think you are forgetting one thing... LOOT TRADING IN RAIDS. You can literally have one guy pick up EVERYTHING and distribute loot after the raid, if you choose to.
---
He isn't defending blizzard he's disagreeing with your random claim its dead you plonker.
---
i believe it is ranged damage, because if you wear a quiver you actually attack faster with your wand (this is a pserver thing and not sure it will be the same in classic)
---
You're making it seem like a bigger deal than it is.
---
These guilds will survive and if you don't get your name you'll live. 
---
Pick a new one.
---
No I think they changed that for name creation to the number of unique accounts on the server. But im only guessing here.
---
Warrior or warlock? Which race at alliance? Which profession?
---
1. Mainly for world pvp, but I would like to dps raids as well. I will have pocket healer.
---
Grob
---
&gt; We need more servers in advance
---
I just want to note that a new pvp server was announced today for EU.
---
Its the best way for leader/officers/friends to gear up first, so they start out strong on meters and continue to hog the loot for themselves =)
---
Ofc, there will be exceptions.
---
Last one had an error. :)
---
yes please give it a try
---
Could you also compare them with SpeedyAutoLoot?
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/speedyautoloot
---
Also, I see 2 versions of Faster Looting on curse, which one did you find faster?
---
100% this kind of shit is horrible for he health of the game and community.
---
Is classic wow gonna be free? Or do I need an active subscription to be able to play it
---
I will miss the brewfest drill that was a port straight to BRD bar :/
---
First one is right
---
Ahh I see. Thanks. Yeah you’re not joking. I’ve played since vanilla, but very very laxed and never really up to date. I know of Rag server, but idk why it was bad. I played on ShatteredHand and Arthas.
---
Yeah I've seen people recommending Fury and then swapping at 40, waste of gold Arms all the way.
---
Nice video, valid points.
---
Still leaning towards Druid :).
---
Charge, check. Roots, check. Heals, check. Fast movement, check. Stealth, check. Able to tank, check.
---
I'm probably only gonna play one class in classic and I want to be able to do everything!
---
GUYS!!! It's almost like Blizzard have a plan and are executing it! :D
---
... Bunch of whiners..
---
Last message, I swear. Looks like there was an update to unitframes.lua so seems possible that party/raid frames are fixed.
---
Actually you don't furthermore you only need journey man riding for it.
---
Plus the furbolg you farm for them drop beads for timbermaw rep and runecloth that you later turn for other reps when that becomes available
---
Amazing... Do you take commissions? I'd love to have one for an Orc Warrior.
---
i'd be interested in this name on Whitemane. Don't have any names on Herod at the moment though, DM me lets work something out
---
Shouldn't you be able to powershift again in vanilla?
---
and bringing meme specs actually makes filling healer spots harder, because now they have more competition on offspec loot
---
You don't know that. I can just as easily say if WoW kept all the same mechanics and just added more content it would be better off today.
---
Why don't you like death knights?
---
Very obscure. Surprised anyone caught on to it on this subreddit
---
If you roll PvP, you can transfer to a PvE server if you really want to.
---
If you roll PvE, you are stuck unless you want to put hundreds of hours into leveling and gearing a new character.
---
you need a sub to the main game in order to play classic
---
Deciding between Shaman or Priest - intending to raid and pvp, healing at end game.
---
Pros of Priest:
---
* Benediction/Anathema
---
* Mind Control
---
* Can farm DM Lashers with Holy Nova
---
Pros of Shaman
---
* 30/0/21 spec seems great for PvP and also good enough for healing
---
* Windfury Totem
---
* Chain Lightning and Chain Heal seem great in both pvp and pve
---
Any advice on either of these two?
---
One of my main fears is that I might start getting the itch to play Shadow. I feel like you can't really go Shadow and still properly raid heal, but I feel that the 30/0/21 spec for Shaman can still chain heal like the best of them. Maybe someone can correct me on this?
---
This feels like more of an attack on hunter mentality vs. whether I can get a 2 year old to play my WoW character...
---
There's Draenei in the Swamp of Sorrows too.
---
European servers work on CEST
---
I bet they might be surprised it happened so fast but they did say they have more servers ready to launch if it is required. They did plan this well and that's why we got new server so fast.
---
The ratio of people who choose pvp vs pve. I am saying it is about 9 to 1.
---
After they get a taste of world pvp and some start rerolling it would change to 8-2 or maybe (probably not), maybe 7-3.
---
good luck
---
Gibt's nen "offiziellen" Discord für die deutschen Server/ deutsche Classic Community?
---
I dont think those people will play Classic. Retail has Worgen, void elves, HD models, transmog. Those things are much more important to the ERP crowd that sits in Goldshire Inn all day.
---
Hell yea, I just got out of a 5 yr living together relationship. The timing couldn’t be better
---
This comment is super underrated. That shit is hilarious.
---
There's a whole list of them on the Golemagg discord, so I'm guessing they're going there.
---
Leveling a warrior isn't nearly as difficult as people say it is.
---
\- Grab first aid and be liberal with bandages. Cooking is also handy.
---
\- Pick up herbalism and alchemy so you have a steady stream of potions and elixirs. Most elixirs early on are geared towards warriors, strength boosts, armor boosts and HP regen.
---
\- Know when it's time to grab a new weapon. Every few levels check online to see where you can get your next big upgrade.
---
\- Don't go crazy with pulling tons of mobs.
---
\- Remember that rend is worth using, despite what some people tell you, especially against humanoids since it helps you confirm damage while they are running away.
---
Cheers for the recommendation. I'll give his videos a look.
---
&gt; but the absolute hell hole that is the server discord is
---
You have to embrace the shazzposting
---
Arms can tank anything - and i mean tank with. 2h from 1-40 from what we saw on beta.  Probably all the way up to 60. 
---
You want to go for sweeping strikes ASAP. And once you have it, your paladin would stop spending mana on DPS other than keeping Seal up and using the mana to keep you - the warrior - at a healthy Level of HP to keep chain pulling without any pause.  
---
That is id you plan to rush the leveling.  Else just do ya thang.
---
&gt; assert
---
&gt; /əˈsəːt/
---
&gt; verb
---
&gt; state a fact or belief confidently and forcefully.
---
I see no contradiction. :D 
---
All I did was look at the up-rise in private server population and growing popularity of classic in streams and online/offline discourse. I made an educated guess based on prior knowledge.
---
Yup, focus wasn't added until Cata I think
---
If no horde queue BGs, then no BGs are available.

Is that confirmed?

Haven't played demon hunters because i stopped playing WoW at the beginning of WoD but i really liked monks. I think they were a fun class.
---
Ya liek wat a toal noob eh?
---
In PvP will I be at a noticeable disadvantage playing undead lock instead of orc? Everywhere I read basically says hardiness is super op and orc is the best choice.
---
Wow this was a great trailer.
---
My friend is going Undead Rogue on Herod and I wanted to make something to compliment him while questing and doing wPvP. My top class picks are currently Hunter, Druid, Shaman, or Warlock. Druid seems to have some natural utility that would go well with a Rogue, but how about Hunter it the other classes I mentioned? How will those classes gameplay work with a rogue?
---
Use the search bar and I am sure you'll find those links.
---
The hint for Allied Races was there all along!
---
Those players are also less likely to stick around, which will contribute to ghost town effect.
---
That's me in a nutshell. Most of my characters are from vanilla and TBC. My Priest, Warrior and Druid are day one release characters, my Shaman and Paladin are early TBC space goats. My youngest main server alt is my Mage, who I created at some point during Wrath.
---
You really grow attached to these characters over the years, replacing them with a younger version feels needlessly cruel.
---
Shadow Priests can melt faces in PvP.
---
Holy Pallies are amazing as healers in raids.  Very mana efficient, and brings lots of utility and support in the form of blessings.
---
Ignore the dicks. Thank you for sharing!

LOVED THIS back in the days! Back in 2005-2006 this circulated as an .mp3 file which ppl send on IRC. The times pre Youtube or any kind of streaming! ;)

Ingame AH scanning addons have been around since vanilla. The web API isn't really necessary, it just provides better and more consistently updated data that doesn't require people to spend 15-30 minutes at an AH for a scan. If anything, missing it will make things worse.
---
Unclick your box that limits fps in foreground and background.
---
It makes perfect sense. The primary language on Thalnos will not be English , and Faerlina has been dubbed the big streamer server which comes with its own issues. Most people on Herod felt forced to make the choice but honestly, I'm looking forward to the chaos
---
And warrior
---
I would love to hear your reasoning behind fury untill lvl 40, both with and without a healer.
---
Please do mention whether or not your information is based on private server experience or only from actual vanilla leveling experience!
---
To be honest, that's what I feared a bit. I haven't played the original Vanilla WoW, but do you know how viable Feral-focused druids was in terms of healing, in comparison to a Restoration-focused druid?
---
No love for Ambassador Flamelash.
---
Flamelash. It even sounds cool for a realm name.
---
Im a Hunter, Level 2, and we‘re about to explore the Tower of Azora!
---
Same here.  As much as I'm excited for classic my dream is for a tbc server later. I just moved everything about it. The heroic dungeons were a nice bonus for the people that couldn't for raiding around their schedule. I could definitely do without arenas though. Took away from BGs.
---
Really happy this ended up being the selected server. So far all other communities have been super welcoming and Thalnos will definitely be a great server for Classic :)
---
The only comp you´re gonna see is Pala/Warri and no q´s on horde side.

As someone who reserved names on Fairbanks, I am wondering if it is actually beneficial or not to be on a lower pop server vs a high pop. Less competition for resources, but queues might be longer for pvp though and more difficult finding dungeon groups. May be more difficult to find 40 people for a raid group, but less competition for world bosses for guilds...
---
Wasn't this posted here yesterday?
---
I found your first problem here. It's voll, not full. You're welcome.
---
I would be soooooooo happy if you made one for my undead shadow priest.
---
Lol, I'm gonna message you for LFG

Witcher 3 10th playthrough
---
My thoughts exactly, to much text to write tho:)
---
So I need to pay a sub to play a 20 year old game? What's the point then? Why would anyone pay money to play it? Just for the good old times? There are plenty of vanilla pirate servers
---
Noooo see I have to work towards my exam during the time off, if I fail my exams I can lose my job!
---
Then after the September 2nd exam I am back to full time work September 3rd and my gf comes home the following weekend!! All

new server announced: "Lebensraum"
---
....*Russia loses a PvP server*.....
---
/world is a player created channel.
---
No, but they were available before BC I think, so it is on the table.
---
I'm personally just envious about those that get to play.
---
\*Cries in (b)oomkin.\*
---
&gt;Is the exact same difficulty as the one before.
---
AND THE WORST THING IS THAT ITS IS ALWAYS ABSOLUTE BEGINNER EASY MODE DIFFICULTY 
---
sorry for caps, unintentional, but i decided to keep them after discovery
---
Np dude! Best of luck :D
---
If its any consolation, you can make bandages in ghostwolf.
---
"stuck in frost nova"
---
You can watch Southpark for free in any country if I remember it right
---
I remember deathknights were a trainwreck op class. Apparently there’s more new classes in the current game, monks, pandas, whatever. Not going near any of that shit.
---
Pepsi and not energy drinks or coffee (for those who like that) what is this anti-coca cola propaganda?!?
---
I was joking. But is it seriously scandinavian server? Im from Finland so im intrested :D
---
People that don’t want to wait for half an hour every time they log in the first week will just reroll on Thalnos.
---
Remind me 1 day
---
I watch the guy occasionally when I want to see beta play because he is the only one ALWAYS on. He reacts to videos put out by content creators I now know of only because of seeing the reaction from Asmon (MadSeasonShow is top notch). I don't think he is the most liked, but if you like his type of streaming, he knocks it out of the park. I think he is the most popular with an amazing love/hate balance that gets viewers across both aisles. He's the Kim K of WoW streaming. He wants reactions, not likes or dislikes, because reactions can be monetized.
---
Will try that
---
Just report all trash
---
My guild and I migrated back in the day away from Burning Legion because of non-stop polish in the general chat. I like polish people, but I doubt they have become much much better at English since back then.
---
Traxex on Shazzarah
---
Can you hear that?
---
User joined your channel.
---
:D
---
Are you in the US? Because they always said the reservation was on the 12th, but as it's worldwide it was 11th in the West part of the planet
---
Sir then what about this build for pure leveling and world pvp. https://m.imgur.com/a/hbPvkrs
---
To maximize switching and omen of clarity for sustaining oneself. I don't think going hotw NS is the best thing. NS has such a long cool down and the talents in resto are terrible compared to the very relevant balance talents imo.
---
I like Alliance for PvP because they are the underdogs. More fun for me because when I execute my strategies and win that is more satisfying.
---
The noobs who roll Horde because they are minmaxing racials make me laugh. They think they’re so good but they aren’t they just have OP racials. Ally is the strategy faction, horde is the faction for people who are sore losers.
---
I would pick a gathering profession early on, especially when considering fresh servers when all these materials are in demand, then relearn it to something else later.
---
Music is the drug ;)
---
You have to consider that there is 5-10x as many People actively purchasing items from the AH too though.
---
Yeah I might, I have alot of catching up to do in retail though and between two kids and job there simply isnt time for both atm.
---
also download questie. i know a lot of people will you no to and its not vanilla like. but all of us during vanilla era instead of having an addon would have to go on [thotbot.com](https://thotbot.com) to check a quest location, so just get the addon so that you can quest normally. other than that enjoy this amazing TRUE mmorpg.
---
:door: SPAM :door: THIS :door: DOORWAY :door: TO :door: BAN :door: THE :door: UK :door:
---
Then I will report the GM too
---
Yes they will be layered.. but after layering, what happens then?
---
I know that’s why we have subscriptions in order to play stress test.
---
Which server?
---
And stop that "Spaniard" non-sense, it makes u look really... "Britanniard"
---
They said 13th for name res and 27th for launch because on those dates, the entire world will have access. Since time zones are a real thing, some people in the world (NA) will still be on the previous day's date, hence name res for NA being the 12th, and launch for NA being the 26th.
---
The shazzrah subreddit is civil:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ShazzrahPvP/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShazzrahPvP/)
---
You can at least heal into AQ40 as shadow and no one is going to care.
---
I had 3 lvl 60s by the end of vanilla.  I only remember where I dinged on one of them: It was the northern peninsula of Azshara.  Such a magical place;  I can't wait to go back.  I plan to ding 60 there again.
---
You are on /r/classicwow so obviously yes retail sucks
---
Heh, fair :P
---
Would be so cool to have a realm full of laidback casuals. Sadly it will never happen.
---
My bf doesn't wanna play Classic but he's got his own games so no distractions for me on launch week :D
---
That census is probably even less accurate. It was done right after the streamers announced that they wouldn't be going on Thalnos. At that time I was planning on going on Thalnos and indicated as much. Since then the Brazilians told us they would be playing on Thalnos which made a lot of people leave (increasing the percentage of Brazilians) and then the streamers told us they would be on Faerlina which would make even more people leave Thalnos for Faerlina (because before they might've stayed on Thalnos thinking that staying on the BR server would be better than having a chance at being with the streamers, but once they knew what server the streamers would be on they could choose the other server).
---
so don't go there?
---
Thanks I appreciate it... I already know how to build a rogue, but I just want one made like his druid one cuz its cool as fuck!?!?!
---
It's an unofficial discord. In-game chat will be better moderated and reporting people actually has an effect so I wouldn't worry too much. Probably still gonna be some bad things in there but nothing the size of discord or twitch chat
---
Not even gonna lie, WOTLK unholy was a higher skillcap than most recall and was incredibly fun.
---
What's best for the guild &gt; what's best for the individual, always. LC if done right will not be an issue.
---
I just jumped into a pserver to find the ones in Org. Besides the throne where's the other one?
---
Often times it's almost impossible to have all quests before setting foot into a dungeon. Certain times the last quest might be red while the first ones are already green and in danger of turning grey ^^
---
Don't be too bothered, as long as you have 2 or 3 quests, the run will be worth it.
---
Why fury with a heal? You want sweeping strikes asap
---
to me 2 eu pvp servers seemed too low when they annonced it and reserveing names confirmed it. like it was clear as day that people wanna pvp in classic.
---
I'm stuck between my two favorites, shaman and Warlock.
---
Honestly I'm just wondering which has best quality of life throughout the game?
---
The only downside to warlock for me is that I can only do dps. But for shaman I'm stuck with resto for raids right?
---
This is dynamically calculated. I logged in the middle of the night and all servers (for all languages) were "Low" except for Shazzrah.
---
When we were creating characters, all English servers went to "Medium" or "High" except Zandalar Tribe.
---
Sadly this screen cannot be used for population metrics either...
---
Hi, /u/Aibbon

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cq94ni/good_morning_all_questionwhats_the_faction_ratio/). 
---
Yeah, joined, checked a few channels and left. When there is a gathering of a few thousand people in a live chat room it is always going to turn to shit. Disappointing because I liked the idea of the class channels and guides etc.
---
I got Connor on shazzrah eu, how much u talkin
---
I think I'll stick to ingame chat for the time being

They didn't move it by a single minute. Lrn2timezone.

---

---
Retail kids on Shazz confirmed.
---
I'm gonna play with some of my friends and we would like to have different classes. The ones already claimed are Warlock and Hunter. My goal is to raid Naxx as a dps and by listening to people on reddit, the only viable classes are; Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Hunter(Maybe one) and Warlock. I have been watching some indepth guides on elemental and feral, and those people seem hopeful, but i don't know. I also plan to pvp after clearing a tier, anyone got a good shout?  
---
As a side point, does anybody know what the class distribution is going to be?
---
I had not heard about something like that ever happening except for during name-reservation.
---
I do, however, remember something similar from actual launch. I was not exactly locked out but since I didn't want the queues (which lasted 40-50 minutes at that time) I also rolled another character on a fresh server and didn't play on the same server as my guild for the first week or so.
---
So even with no real-lockout, I'm a bit afraid that this might happen again and it's queue or reroll.
---
Many people have had the same issue. You have to press enter once you've changed the value otherwise it won't update. I'm reworking the config window so it's easier to use
---
Yeah, doesn't happen often, but when it happens, I always tip the hat and offer greetings to fellow vet.  
---
There are people still playing that kept their character as they were for fun though. Can't remember on which server but there's a Mage in full T3 fear wielding an Atiesh still around. Doesn't play it much since there no 60 community anymore but he keeps it as is.
---
Yeah but that flight felt like you were on an epic journey.  You were leaving the safe haven of the capital city to fly into an uncharted region for adventure.
---
With BFA it feels like you aren't doing anything special, just running errands around town like it is a chore.
---
Don’t know for sure but probably balance druid
---
To be honest, I think they instead listened to the reduction in subscriptions.
---
Lots of veterans are on Golemagg avoiding retails kids.
---
Honestly teenage me learned a lot playing the game. English for one, which I’ve used to travel the world and for my uni studies. I also made a ton of friends from all over and have visited and been visited by them many times. For some reason spending a lot of time on a game is negative, but it’s no different than spending a lot of time on any hobby (assuming the game doesn’t employ psychological tricks/gambling mechanics, and you have a healthy compulsion system - but then gaming is still better than casinos etc.)
---
I would predict that rogues will be slightly more popular than the census data shows. People who bother filling those out are generally more prepared and knowledgeable than many casual players, and know that rogues in 1.12 aren't quite the gods they are remembered as from the entire duration of vanilla. More casual and spontaneous players won't know that.
---
Executus is a server on retail. Don't know if they will re use the name
---
I forgot to add the humor flair but I was pretty sad for like 17 seconds until I got the name Bilbo.
---
Sometimes if people /beg I’ll let them live. If they’re willing to beg, then they’re probably really not wanting to die.  
---
But if you /spit or /shoo, oh boy, I’m setting out that campfire.
---
[I was right indeed](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/coja9q/layering_seriously_needs_to_get_fixed_before/ewl8cyk/). The closer we are to release, the more info they have on population and how many more servers to add.
---
Rogue/ Mage have a considerable skillcap. Nelf rogue is possibly the toughest thing to master right next to Hunters.
---
herod is gonna be dog lol u made a good choice
---
I did bitch give my all your good boy points or your name will be forever tarnished with my piss.
---
You totally could've got these names at launch lol
---
I mean my guild and at least 10~ other NA guilds are all in a discord agreeing on playing there so I'm not even mildly concerned about it.
---
Perfect thanks!
---
Don't worry about Wednesday, your biggest problem is getting back to work on Thursday.
---
This is actually quite accurate.
---
Hell, Pandaren have more integrity and spine than the entire Night Elf race
---
I'm sure Corgibuttz passes the smell test.  ;) 
---
(Who doesn't like the smell of corgibuttz?)
---
Pandas are ridiculous animals, that's why. Fishmen, Dogmen, Cowmen, Ratmen, Bearmen and genious midgets are all based on real life effective organisms or combinations thereoff.
---
Pandas in themselves are stupid animals, and so the pandaren is a stupid race. 
---
When you have a predator body, you eat meat! NOT BAMBOO! You're only absorbing 2-5% of the energy content! You can't break it down, you're a bear for gods sake! Act like it!
---
Hunter is the best solo class and has the fastest grind to 60 if done correctly.
---
I think arena makes good gear way too easy to get imo.
---
Ohh no! Now I see what you're saying! Definitely focus on your exams first, it might be hard with Classic in the back of your mind, but if you set a date to play in your head after, it won't be so bad!
---
Bad luck this time around. :(
---
It is a fact that on average your happiness in your relationship goes down as soon as you have kids and will only increase after they left the house. ;)
---
Or I'll name him Enigma and follow him around asking stupid questions for 3 hours.
---
Stay on Shazz! The Nordic community will decide in 15 minutes. Will update this message with an answer
---
Everything is better with friends. WoW Classic will pull him in just fine, it’s retail that fails at that without friends because the leveling isn’t compelling.
---
This is beautiful how does this not have 5k+ upvotes and on the front page of reddit already??
---
If you want all of this, go Combat Rogue.
---
That's what i decided on in the end, pink seems the safest choice :)
---
Pretty happy with what I got. [https://i.imgur.com/PevWDj6.png](https://i.imgur.com/PevWDj6.png)
---
r/woooosh
---
Unless the server is dead, there will be an endless number of dps.
---
Ofc it's not, just think about it for a second.
---
It's like going on 4chan and asking if everyone is like that.
---
I don't think they're even surprised.  They went with a conservative estimate and checked it against the numbers on monday and realised it was too conservative.  They probably expected to add another server and had it ready to go and were just checking to see if the numbers actually required it.
---
Not to mention it also discouraged world pvp.
---
Sure I might still go to STV and battle opposing 60s killing my factions lowbies at nessingwary but I'll probably just be spending most of my time in org (or outside the gates dueling) waiting for the arena queue to pop
---
some of us kept playing
---
i supped PVPing but i raided more with Op weapons
---
true, forgot abiut that
---
Hey this is awesome looking! I think rebirth is a much later game spell lvl 20 seems way too low. I believe it was a lvl 50 something
---
time it so that when carmen says "We can play the game" the servers go live. lol
---
I'm really seeing it as a wild west realm as well. People who are just wanting to play the game, forge new communities, and aren't commited to existing guilds/coalitions. Plus at least from everyone I've spoken to, no one wants to pick up a sub just for name reservation, I don't think this server will have any issues with population.
---
Hit 60, do some pug raids, solo farm princess runs in Mara, pvp, level alts, and pvp. All this while being a dad with a 50 hours a week job.
---
What about all the communities already being established on Shazzrah / Golemagg?
---
Ah yes a man of culture as well I see
---
There is not, it's a player created channel.
---
exactly why i was thinking haha.
---
Boomer Community? Forgot wow was released just after the moon landing.
---
Mate like 50k people tried to get on Herod. Layers hold about 2500-3000 players. Low and high pop are relative measurements relax.
---
There are also long chains that requires you to do the same dungeon 3-4 times.
---
I value quests and will complete them all, these tools help people with such purpose :)
---
I wore it especially the head in raids but raids I would wear my healing set but all other times was judgement
---
Big brain
---
What names do you people use that other people can sell the names to you?
---
https://discord.gg/5g7v7Q8 DE WoW Classic
---
https://discord.gg/C8DxGTy Everlook EU
---
Und in einem der beiden ist sicher auch ein Link zum Lucifron Discord. Den sehe ich aber gerade nicht, weil ich ja selbst drauf bin. :D
---
HHHmmm... ~~first world~~ vanilla alliance problems. At least you have a class that can bubble hearth.
---
BC: loved my tankadin (couldn't heal worth spit but I was tanking raids long before the health buff patch).
---
This is a really underrated game
---
Yeah so if your not using a shaman healer you invite a enhance shaman for windfury
---
Uhhh, just go play retail when brewfest is live? We are all going to have active subs and it doesn't require the latest expansion.
---
is this true or not true can someone tell me. Am giant noob in Classic
---
Coalition said when they were deciding then decided spazzrah.
---
Spazzrah is just the meme kids and people who didn't research properly, and many others I just feel sorry for having seen the discord.
---
Get out while you can.
---
oh cmon fuck off i didnt even hsd the chance to sign in because im in vacation. Guess ill have to play on the english server FeelsBadMan
---
I've never had an issue with loot council all the way up to killing kt.
---
Playing with same guys again so we'll use that again as it's most efficient.
---
I’ve booked the week off work and unintentionally split up with my girlfriend of 2 years.... I’m ready.
---
Well druids have class quests and specific talents to take. Rogues really don’t except a pickpocket quest I think and our poisons quest.
---
Maybe they will, if there is a need for it. Do you think that by typing it here, you will be right and Blizzard wrong? They are constantly saying they will release more realms if there is a demand...
---
Kiddie logic.
---
Word! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xZhQpyr2FBw
---
Here in America we speak *American!* And generally we shorten everything to the point of nonsensicality. Grob gets the point across and saves your ‘B’ key an extra pummeling.
---
push to talk is still mandatory in my guild in the main raiding channel. you can force it on in discord
---
other casual channels its off
---
This is a copy pasta right?
---
This is completely wrong.  If you look at the code for both addons, it's practically the same code.  There are subtle differences (I would call them cosmetic) but nothing that would affect the speed between the two.
---
Both Leatrix Plus and Faster Looting will run at the same speed.
---
Oh, no way. Lotus won’t be found at any r
---
I hope they will add the 4th PvP realm. I will start playing after work, 27th, so about 6 PM, and by that time there might be a fesh server. At any rate, when I will be sitting at my PC, I will just choose the youngest server for sure.
---
I always head over to Orc starting zone and get Sakarofh.
---
I'm going to recreate my vanilla dwarf BM huntard. :D
---
It changes when you logout.
---
I raised this issue a long time ago and people told me that it wouldn't be a problem.
---
I subbed for the stress test because I couldn’t wait any longer - the cherry on top was getting to reserve my name. Sure I “threw away” the equivalent of a pint of craft beer in money but I’m really not concerned about that.
---
Ya there is but avoid that swamp at all costs.
---
You literally need a Chemo after going on the discord since Kids retails are rolling on Shazz. 
---
Veterans are on Golemagg, server will be the closest Vanilla experience.
---
You're doing this on purpose now, aren't you... I was swaying towards hunter right before this post.
---
I might take a ret paladin, but they would be lowest priority on gear.
---
The warriors will make much better use of any plate that drops.
---
Hon hon hon le cringe
---
let's go les boys
---
No, 'Full' is only a warning for you so you know that you can expect queue times. You can ALWAYS make new chars on a server, doesn't matter how packed it is.
---
Karazhan good times man good times..
---
Those servers are completely voll!
---
Yeah I forgot the 3/5 Lightning Reflexes and 2 Imp Sprint. Wrote this up before I left for work.
---
Im not deleting it..
---
.. for less than 20.000€
---
&gt; Those who want to pay their sub with gold should try farming retail IMO, it's a hell lot easier.
---
Mind elaborating on that please? I'm just curious, don't even have BfA, nor a high level character on retail, but I've seen on wowhead that tokens go for 150k gold or so.. is that really easy-ish to farm? How does that farming typically look like and how long does it take?
---
&gt; The lack of proper gameplay for so many classes/specs is probably what will decimate the server population long before the grind will.
---
definitely not haha. People won't grind enough to even get to the point where they would be complaining about this
---

---
Trying to decide between priest and rogue? I'll probably only have an hour or two a day to play with more time on the weekends but nothing consistent so finding a raiding guild won't be realistically an option. More just PUG's which is mostly what I've done since Wrath anyway.
---
Reason I'm looking at priest is they seem the easiest to find groups with by far with my limited and inconsistent play time. I'm worried about solo play though in the sense of farming up gold and generally just having to be a healer full time.
---
Rogue seems the most fun but not sure about the ability to find groups when not super geared but the casual bg's and world pvp seems much better.
---
What are your thoughts for a solo roller?
---
You‘re just getting shit by the other comments but I actually understand that this could help. Nobody likes to ask the same question 100 times. I‘d also be interested.
---
Steer clear big tuna head for open waters
---
Do you know that? Do you work at Blizzard?
---
he's not wrong in terms of playerbase vs any other reasonably played game that exists. I'm very excited for classic but we can't be delusional here
---
No badge gear that helped you catch up to the current highest raid tier a week after hitting level cap too!
---
It's just a meme spawned around my name. Happenstance.
---
&gt;  bring the community together 
---
He doesn't know.
---
I would look for "Sarkoth"
---
Which is why I'm going Zandalar, babyyyy!
---
I'm on the same boat as you! What region will you play on?
---
Where?
---
Maccies at night with all the drunks coming in an abusing you would be worst lok
---
Yeah, i think you are right. 
---
There is a lot of hype for the PVP servers. 
---
Let’s hope both of them are going to be fine. 
---
Just out of curiosity, which one are you picking and is there a reason why?
---
&lt;STDs Are BOP&gt;
---
Thank god, I thought it was just me
---
I tried making a bunch of number names, twentytwo, fortynine fiftyfive and either Blizz does not let you create number names or those were already taken. But I doubt someone took those random numbers
---
lmfao yikes
---
To be honest right now. It really doesn't matter where you go. This whole "let country's X community decide where they roll" is so silly. 
---
You dont know how those servers will look like at release or a few weeks/months in. Its just a huge gamble. 
---
You will have spaniards, english, nordish, german, italian people on all servers. There is no server thats "more toxic" than others. 
---
All you can do is choose a server you and your friends/guild members go and you're fine.
---
I'd like to get enemy cast bars working.
---
Don't stand in the fire....
---
Start with a Paladin, its a fun easy class to get used to the interface. Then choose a class after you have seen some gameplay and roll a new toon.
---
Did he play coz of name or game? Jeez.
---
Never underestimate this place's ability to turn literally everything into a slight against them. Few communities compare to the Blizzard community's persecution complex.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/ShazzrahPvP/
---
Prot war is good.
---
But don’t underestimate the power of playing something new!!
---
Scandis might still swap though. Their announcement said that their choice was Shazzrah but if more servers pop up they might change their mind.
---
Legendary? Never heard of him
---
Yeah really... Instead of taking the 2 minutes to look up the information this guy would rather take 10 after wasting his money to try and get it back.
---
French group of friends are rolling on Golemagg. Discord is way more mature.  
---
Kids retails are rolling on Shazz. 
---
This is my actual plan - to begin accumulating rested XP on my rogue alt, and also to begin professions on him.  I'll probably get my warrior to 5, then my rogue to 5, then park the rogue in TB or Org.  Then I'll resume leveling warrior.
---
I feel for the guy, but the "may not play" feels a bit extreme.
---
This looks straight out of an adventure book. Awesome OP!
---
The money is what makes or breaks a company
---
Probably Oceania. You? Have you decided on a class and race ?
---
Gehennas
---
Just tell others you are new and are happy about tips on how to improve and many players will actually help you.
---
Noone minds a newbie who is willing to learn.
---
I made a female gnome warrior with pink hair called bitcoin
---
That doesn't mean it will have the same amount of items as those are x5-10 aswell. If anything. This has extra impact for the AH to process 5-10x more sales aswell.
---
Say sike right now. . .
---
Kids chose Shazz. 
---
&gt;And yes I got the names I wanted.
---
1) Don't look up anything beyond descriptions in character selection.
---
2) After you log in, follow the exclamation marks.
---
3) Enjoy
---
Thousands of early WoW players would kill for a chance to do it like this.
---
Seriously, I’m having so much fun with it.
---
&gt; Golemagg is EU pvp as well
---
Looking through the EU lfguild discord I am seriously beginning to doubt this.  Everyone is recruiting for Shazzrah.
---
Opposite: I didn't think I was going to come back to the game. Found out old friends that I played with in Vanilla are returning so am jumping in as well (and excited).... my honeymoon is Aug 27 through Sep 5
---
Will do!
---
Id suggest shaman if your duo leveling with a warrior. Great duo, you can keep him alive and you both smack pretty hard. Eventually you get windfury totem which is huge for warriors. Then at late game he can tank and you can heal and you are always set for 5 mans. GL!
---
Lol thanks.   
---
I was thinking about trying a Shaman character. But if you think Paladin would be the best choice I will consider it. Thanks :)
---
2/10

Why? What’s wrong with the LFM tab? Really?

HAHAHHAHA

When WOTLK first came out, divine storm would almost one shot someone basically. It was a strange time. But I do miss the whole Northrend vibe now that I think about it.
---
Hi boys and girls, I could use some advice.
---
I plan on playing a gnome mage and dual boxing. I was originally planning on running a pally with my mage as they're good teammates, and he could tank while I aoe stuff down, but it felt pretty janky. I know that two mages is OP, but there isn't really a long term benefit to that. Any advice on what class I should pear with my mage?
---
Thanks!
---
I'll be playing on EU :( probably going to play a priest, haven't decided rave yet
---
Amen to that. I can wait til BC comes out though.
---
and the people joining their group know this.. and accept the terms.. dont like it? make a group of your own where nothing is reserved
---
from what i hear many pserver player going there, u will prolly get stomped if ur new
---
I’m just skipping dragoncon or only going Saturday.
---
Game comes out Monday night, I’m taking the week off, can run up to dragoncon spend approx. 8 hours there and come back.
---
Or skip it entirely and just wait for next year.
---
Say sike right fucking now.
---
Yes be sure to check out the barrens chat on the discord.....
---
there's 15 different servers and my ign isn't taxoro.
---
I mean I understand the want not to spam trade or sit in trade (made a whole freaking discord channel to avoid that) but it was part of the vanillia experience. But the biggest problem is it's a cascading effect you want lfm built in someone else wants some other random shit and it grows from there. I dont disagree with you at all I joined in BC when the game had something like that minus the ilvl shit it just displayed your class, lvl and name that was all.
---
Reputation matters in Vanillia.
---
Fair enough, just believe people are conflating the dungeon finder/LFR travesties...
---
Childhood.
---
Needs more non English speakers defecating on the tracks
---
Thanks I'll look into that one :)
---
&gt;no free legendaries, no free epics
---
Those were never free, they only named them epic and painted purple what was basically an uncommon or rare at best. After the novelty was off they one upped it with legendary that was again more of an uncommon item. Some players are more concerned about the"brand" than what the thing actually does. Like buying apple products etc. Naturally it worked quite well but it also tarnished the actual epic loot and made that less rewarding. Perfect example for casualization of the game.
---
Fake. You are supposed to be human hunter
---
Gnome Mages in classic are 'basic'
---
oh i don't care about that. I know he made a troll account on there. He's too vain to play anything other than his nameplate.
---
You'll get *some* rep, but not nearly enough to get to Exalted. You'll need the cloth turn-ins no matter what, but they don't come until Phase 2(I think)
---
Yes I was most definitely over exaggerating. But I’d assume people on this reddit asking these questions and talking about this are a bit more serious and looking for a more serious experience which may be harder to come by on this specific server if it’s over ran by South Americans like people are thinking it may be.
---
Yeah, I don't think there's a big rapper right now named Knowledge
---
Too fast, only stam, pass!

Caveman format on the times, but gives a good overview.
---
Hey all I pretty much decided on rolling priest, however I'm stuck on what race to pick because I'm going horde. I see everyone say undead is better but recently videos and posts are showing that troll's shadowguard is OP compared to DP. Help me!
---
I don't think it does actually, but it still will be in classic when it launches.
---
I mean, they did just open a other server for EU...
---
Memoria - takes screenshot everytime you ding. It's nice to havethose pics later on trust me
---
This post is “go fish” for classic wow names lol
---
I will, but its not the same.
---
Well seeing as this is a post about being horde I'm assuming we won't be facing any shamans or will of the forsaken.  Of that list the only one I would be concerned about is the ele sham.  No in a 1v1 a spriest/rogue/mage/warrior can not easily be a well geared sm/ruin lock 1v1 if they don't have wotf..  Sure they could beat you if they get lucky or get the jump on you, but easily?  No fucking way bud.
---
You communicate through text both ways, the UI just gives you a better way to sort and organize the possible party members...
---
This may be too specific for this kind of topic, so feel free to downvote or mod the comment away if it is.  
---
I'm looking for someone who has relevant experience with Pitbull4 unit frames. It was my UI addon of choice back in the day, but I installed the latest version on retail and I found it to be, I don't know.. buggy I guess. The target frame rarely reflected what I was actually targeting, for example. Like I would target an NPC, then press F1 to switch target to myself, but the target frame would still show the NPC.  
---
Does anyone know why that is? Or a better question.. Did you manage to use Pitbull in Classic without similar issues?
---
The [latest version of ClassicCastbars](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24925-ClassicCastbars.html) worked for me on the last Stress Test.
---
Got one bar you can move and integrate into your UI and one on each nameplate of casting enemies.
---
true, and that's a valid point. That doesn't make it big though on the scale we're talking about with classic
---
Now do troll shaman!
---
Well I'm sorry for being right. If being correct makes me disabled what are you then?
---
I saw the rest of this guys post, he is cheering on china to kill people in hong kong
---
&gt; Yet you have them to thank for pretty much any progress on Blizz's end.
---
That was you, right?
---
In retail you only play one patch. How is that more content?
---
Every true german vanilla player will choose Gayhannes anyways.
---
Id say balance is OK at open world pvp and bgs, especially larger ones. If they can stand and freecast they can be decent, but yes.. balance is probably the worst spec in the whole game overall.
---
You can play a ret pala. It's not an optimal dps spec and you will be noticeably behind other dps specs, but it's absolutely good enough to clear the content.
---
Thanks, I love how everyone in Europe is taking the piss out of everyone else . kinda reminds me of town rivalries at home.
---
so from 5 to 15 mins?
---
I tried all three, and prefered this one. Hiding the inventory popup made it a more seamless experience for me.
---
The faster looting code itself seems similar.
---
No. No I will not.
---
Weakauras is amazing and probably the most important in your list.  Unfortunately I haven't used it in years so I'm somewhat in the same boat.
---
Apart from that, another reply below has the others - weaponswingtimer and energywatch.
---
STOP ASKING THINGS THAT I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING, JUST AS YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR FUCKING THEORIES. WHAT IS CONFUSING ABOUT THIS????
---
Walked to the HR lady, said I wanted time off work for holliday. She asked where I was going. I said Azeroth and she looked strange at me. I said I plan to play a video game for 2 weeks straight. She looked even more shocked at me.
---
Not to crazy.
---
Reputation would still matter... this isn’t automatically combining groups.
---
And I don’t buy slippery slope arguments.
---
Blizzard did add a way for addons to retrieve the entire AH list without having to scan it all. So thats a plus over vanilla...Theres however still likely to be a bit slow at times i guess.
---
Someone is salty they didn't get Xlegolasxx (I beat you to it!)
---
&gt;no wow pokemon
---
What, there are no gnomes??
---
Yea! I usually am 7-8 days when I hit 60. But I spend a good 12 hours alone just doing Auction House sales, crafting, another 12-24 doing dungeons with friends. I think 6 is realistic for a non-pro if you were ahead of the pack. Which is tough to do.
---
Yeah, because you can do some more trolling with an actual troll. :D
---
I rented a teamspeak server. Message me if you want to join it during launch and chill on horde side Grobbulus.
---
Feral druid dream.
---
&gt;They probably expected to add another server and had it ready to go and were just checking to see if the numbers actually required it.
---
They already said this before releasing any servers, and some people here still goes "Wooo we did it Reddit!".
---
Could go about this a whole different way, but instead A) makes himself look like a child, and B) he just gave whoever has the name a TON of power. They now know he might not play without the name, so he'd probably be willing to pay a pretty penny.
---
Yea I realize that just wanted to see peoples opinions.
---
5% French Canadians  
---
5% Br/Portugese
---
The drama is im the fact that loot will go to friends first and foremost regardless of who is being more efficient
---
TBC was stack haste and mp5 and cast FoL as fast as possible for mana efficiency. Holy Light was slow big heal, FoL was tiny incremental heals.
---
Where do I get in contact with these guys? As a hardcore/top pvper in vanilla/tbc/wotlk I'd love to join them and get some premades going.
---
Any chance you can use a addon and add the cords, great Work!
---
Why join a discussion talking about it if you're not interested in thinking about it lol, I guess you're here to win a discussion or farm karma or something? xd
---
Oh I see, pretty much responsible = solely responsible for every single good thing.
---
Any other definitions you've arbitrarily changed to argue from your silly position or is that it? Have a good day dude, I don't have time for this.
---
Paladin healing is very good, if you have decent gear you’ll always be invited. As for leveling if you’re not doing group leveling or instance leveling you should just go ret as you can heal specced as ret as long as you have a healing gear set.
---
Gayhannes - unofficial german server
---
i wonder how many people will quit because of queue times that would have otherwise stayed for months if they didnt have to wait 2 hours to get to play
---
4chan choose it as there servers, also have heard it being to close to "whiteman" so racist may flock there. So that is why people are thinking that
---
I hope so
---
Make more please!!
---
The funny part here isn't the image, it's the people trying to make it look like a smart business decision is somehow wrong?
---
Guess you don't worry about how business works when you wear a name tag.
---
Evidence?
---
Did you mean idol? Yea I agree with why you'd dislike but that just comes with needing to police people live i think. He's really not equipped well emotionally for it.
---
The person I was replying to said
---
Two PvP servers will hold less players than N-private server did alone.
---
They even doubled down on their bullshit, as you are, for no reason. I just.. lol Stop. Spewing. Bullshit. As. Fact.
---
Do you want to be the guy in groups/wpvp that blows people up, or is more supporty? What are your friends playing (Since they are part of your decision)? keep asking yourself the right questions :D
---
In EvE Online it was quite mandatory since we frequently had voice chats filled with 400 people at once listening to one guy call targets.
---
Not everyones a filthy casual.
---
Here's a better take. Buff everyone you pass by with anything you can buff, regardless of class.
---
I feel like balance having lower damage than any other caster while not even being able to heal in that form makes is bad even in bg’s.
---
In world pvp, I guess if you don’t use Owl form, it’s ok, but barely better than just being resto and doing the same thing so eh
---
I moved to prot paladin for ulduar and played it through all the rest of retail --- still transmog the 10 man set from there - it was glorious
---
My actual point here is that there is a solid size NA player base heading to thalnos most of which are for private server guilds who I assume won’t be going anywhere and more than likely it wouldn’t be hard to join that community as a NA whether or not you’re in one of the guilds.
---
Y’all underselling Ret in Vanilla PvP
---
thanks :D
---
Just go with what you want, honestly. People say all these race/class combos matter (and to an extent I they do) but it really boils down to minor differences by the time you hit end game. Pick a profession combo that is going to benefit you. For example, if you chose a caster class then enchanting and tailoring go hand in hand. You can make your own gear, enchant it, and sell mats for cash. At the minimum you are going to want something that provides a source of income because getting gold is going to be difficult. Keep in mind you won’t be getting your first mount until level 40, and even then the gold to actually get it is hard to get. Most people don’t get their mount at 40, it’s later on. And that’s just your slow mount. Patience is going to be your best friend, especially these first few weeks of launch. Vanilla is a lot harder is most aspects than retail is. Little quest mobs are gonna kick your ass and if you aren’t careful to watch, mobs will come up and wreck you. There isn’t going to be that run to the target, kill it, kill everything else that got pulled no problem. You pull extra stuff it most likely means death. That’s not even talking about actual dungeons where mechanics in early dungeons are definitely relevant. You also are going to have to quest to level. There won’t be any dungeon smashing or spam pvp matches to level. Dungeons take hours anyways, so prepare for that lol. Find a good friend group to party up with, or a guild to join. Vanilla was very strong on community and communication. The game gets pretty hard, so having some friends to help out and enjoy it with will make it even better. I’ve seen people on Facebook and here already making guilds and plans to play together.
---
The coordinates for every node? That would take another week. ._.
---
Maybe next time I guess.
---
I also didn't factor in cell phone friendliness, since I haven't owned a phone since the old school flat Nokia dumb phone days. Like, pre-flip phone era. So out of touch. ;_;
---
How does this compare to Questie? What are the big differences?
---
Iirc you couldn't trade back in vanilla
---
they don't teleport you to the dungeon - nor do they look for a tank and a heal. But they are the first version of LFG
---
though thanks to their nature people basically never used them
---
orcs can run over a hill in their starting zone and end up in ratchet all in about 2 minutes, and rachet has a bank and auction house, making it the fastest by faaaaar
---
As pserver player im gonna tell you , you can't play properly on release date you would better take a day off a day after release
---
Can you explain why you are against it besides the slippery slope argument?
---
The LFM tab improved the game, Classic was not perfect.
---
WoW should have seasons, so you can start fresh.
---
The WoW “expansion” model is flawed because it removes old content, thereby not actually “expanding” the game in the first place.
---
Oh, it's me.
---

---
Low in vanilla was probably a lot less than low is now. I think the only way to know is to wait until we get closer to release, or at release.
---
Ah ok, thanks. Must be remembering the timings a little wrong
---
It would only affect you if you went on streamer server so he's probably chill with you no?
---
I'm not sure what the concensus is on here, but a month or two ago there was a lot of discussion about whether or not the raids were really as highly tuned as people remember. People vote things like how internet connections weren't as fast back then, as well as the fact that many people were not really pulling their weight back then. This might explain the prevalence of DKP, since they didn't want to give loot to people not contributing. In that sense, maybe ret would be more viable than you think. 
---
That being said, look up shockadin builds. I don't remember if it was a vanilla thing or not.
---
Since blizzard isn't giving any figures, pulled out of his ass?
---
ah for some reason this reminded me of Duty propaganda in Stalker
---
I’m doing Tauren Hunter and no one can stop me.
---
Yeah, because the sane thing to do is name your character after a pokemon and spam twitch emotes in trade.
---
Yes but with discord furries parse your logs and sell them to advertisers. Also Teamspeak allows that functionality.
---
Personally I haven't created any yet, just trying to build realm hype!

much hype, so excite!

I don't see the mafias being as much of an issue. More servers, more regions, I think they might try but won't be nearly as successful.

Very simple. UD for pvp, troll for pve.
---
Questie is fantastic - say what you will about the default UI and reading the quests and all that, but for someone who wants to spend their time in game efficiently (not wandering around), Questie fills the gap without giving you the hand holding that retail does with quest tracking.
---
Other addons that have been great so far - TukUI seems to work pretty well, and gives me the customizability I like from a UI addon - I haven't messed with much else, would love to see a MP5 weakaura so I can track when I'm in and out of the 5second rule as a caster, but its not necessary, since I can count.
---
This is perfect. Definitely going to use it.
---
Now do another NA East that isn’t streamers/BR/SA/full
---
Probably the biggest nerd convention in the US besides Comic-Con and Pax
---
I wouldn't count out warlocks because of no utility. They mainly do dps but also have a lot of job security in raids. They have some helpful things that most raid groups will look for.

Am I the only one that gets kind of mad when people shit on Pandas?  I love vanilla WoW but when I started playing directly after beating Warcraft III to see the continuation of the story I was kind of pissed there was no Lich King in the world, no Pandaren Brewmasters (that was my favorite hero in WCIII even though I played Undead)  I remember being a little upset that the only reference to them was in the Chen Stormstout quest in the Baren's when you find his keg.
---
Theres exactly one good thing about the Azshara fight, and thats actually before it.
---
So my guild on retail is shit, and honestly i dont enjoy the game enough/have the time/desire to join a different one.
---
Last night we got to Azshara (normal, lol) for the first time.  Its also the first time our GM was back in a couple months due to some lame Navy shit he does (joking, its his job).  By pure accident i discovered that if you /flirt with her you turn hostile to the raid group for 15 seconds.
---
....So naturally with about 6 seconds left on the debuff i moved away a bit and launched a couple of chaos bolts at my dippy GM.  He was clueless as to what was going on and it was fucking glorious.
---
Especially when i did it for the 3rd time and he was *still* clueless.
---
....Is it the 26th yet?  Im sad that my wow time has come down to doing fights i dont want to just to mess with an old friend.
---
Ilvl is the most shitty fucking gamedestroying thing ever. Condenses all the gear down to one little number and destroys immersion. I will seriously block anyone who even mentions ilvl.
---
Like most sane people predicted, Blizzard is adding realms. This is sound marketing.
---
Thanks! I can see the word thief in there also, strange why it and the words you mentioned are blocked ?
---
I had just setup my 1440p 144hz monitor so i wasnt sure if it was game error or user error just yet lol but yeah i mean unlike some other games i wasnt getting TOO much from the extra fps 
---
But, since thats the rig a solid number of players will be using, im sure Bliz will get a handle on anything thats wonky

Is it true for shaman healing BGs? I am alting shaman to do exactly that but hadn’t seen anywhere that they are actually good, this made me so excited!

Okay I played on RP / RPPVP for most of my wow career and no one cares if you ride through them. Saying stuff like that just makes people not want to come to Grobbulus. 
---
OP, the wpvp battles will be great. Just don't grief rpers and you're good to come here.
---
Arthas was for sure a really great villain. And I played WC3 so it was special to me.. that said BC had around 10m sub and wow was on an upward trajectory since launch.. it was as soon the changes happen that it when downwards.

Cheers man! [https://classicdb.ch/?item=7001](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7001)

I’ll be so glad to be a nobody adventurer again, just trying to help out my faction. WoW nowadays has so little if the RPG elements Classic had.  I got bored being forced to be the garrison commander, the class order hall leader, the savior of the world, etc.
---
I don't think a single fact actually came out of his mouth.
---
Look for me on the battlefield. Faction: horde Name: Flacid
---
Never touched WoW before and i'm looking forward to the launch.  I know that I am playing as Horde and I know I am playing on a pvp server due to a community coming to WoW.
---
I'm torn between an Orc Warrior and a Druid. 
---
Druid seems the most interesting to me, I like the idea that it can technically be dps, tank or healer. I've read that they are good for pvp. However I've also seen that Druid is a class that has trouble joining groups.
---
Warrior. Firstly, I would go with Orc for the stun resistance since im playing on a pvp server and for the general RPGness of it.  Outside of that, I like the idea of playing a class that won't have difficulty finding groups. Most people seem to say it is hard to level which is a concern since I won't know what i'm doing.
---
Outside of this choice and the relevant profession choices, I doubt that I'll look too deep into most other aspects of the game until I actually get to them, I like the idea of doing lots of things blind for the first time, but I don't want to regret my class choice when or if I'm max level.

I didn't even realise they were rapper names haha. I was referring to Uzi lol
---
The picture on the left really doesn't appeal to me. It just looks like any other mmo, it's not the wow i fell in love with. (and that's okay too, just my opinion)
---
Nice one! Enjoy your time while you can, should be a great week(?) for you!
---
1. As a healer, the priest is the number 1 class for dungeon/raid. So you'll be needed.
---
2. There are advantages, but I'll call them negligeable.
---
3. The non-max-level content is a huge part of the game back then. Now people are more into rushing to max level. But you have the feeling of the "journey" to level to max level whereas it is not present anymore on retail.
---
4. Questing is the number 1 thing you do. You can also do some dungeon to gain some xp and win some great rewards. For a newbie, I'll say 7 to 10 days (in game time) to reach level max.
---
5. It is in a really good shape imo. There is only the layering topic that bring some debates. But overall I think it'll be successful.
---
6. Big YES. I'd pay to forget everything and rediscover the game again. I would not be surprise that future mmo/expansion will go back to classic mecanisms/way of things.

Based on discord numbers it seems to be around 56% horde, 44% ally. The survey indicates about the same, but that's a bit more out of date.

---
He gave correct information of what the consensus is based on and made sure to mention that his following statement was a speculation, none of what he said is hard fact and he didn't pretend it to be either.
---
At this point you sound more like you're just going "Lalalala can't hear you!" really.
---
Though I'd have to ask where you're getting information to base these speculations as false? I can understand accepting the developers being more knowledgable and trusting them in doing a correct choice, but I'm going to guess these people have read/researched developer commentary regarding classic more than you have as well. Dismissing their speculations is just as disrespectful as them dismissing the developers competence.
---
That the average original classic server was intended for a 3k pop has been the go-to information for many, many years, until we hear about things such as dynamic spawning it's fair to assume that they haven't done many changes to how things work from back then.
---
I haven't heard of it before, sounds like fun though!
---
I hope you have a great time!
---
An idea, if not to much work, would be to add the class name in parentheses after those class specific quest. It would be a simple fix for such a great list.
---
Are you being serious ? ....it’s not my fault besides , do some research ...”Toke Black” is the name of a SOUTH PARK CHARACTER !

I was going to suggest a coffeeshop but a library isnt a bad idea at all! Do you have any friends or anything IRL that will be playing, perhaps you could spend some time with them?
---
Anyone knows a minimap addon like carbonite?
---
Yes i do.
---
I think this is more about in comparison to other classes
---
Why would liking to talk prevent you from playing multiplayer games...?
---
&gt; No one who understood the technology underestimated its potential applications and usefulness; more often the reverse was true actually and its revolutionary character was overestimated
---
Yes, this is true. Most people thought it was a fad and a minority realized it's worth.
---
&gt; Maybe when there are zero-weight wireless headsets with 0 latency wireless cloud computing in a ubiquitous online environment or... something... then it will really take off. 
---
That's just throwing words around. 0 latency is physically impossible, but it's also completely unneeded since the brain has latency, specifically 20ms for most people and down to 7ms for the most aware individuals. VR right now hits 20ms. You could swap out the displays today for 1000Hz displays and you'd just about hit 7ms so that's all physically possible, and again very few people even need 7ms.
---
&gt;  I just don't see the advantages over the currently established models for the purpose of having fun, especially having fun using a device you can also use for other stuff which VR is nowhere near.
---
may be your right.
---
"Streamers only gg bliz" is how they found a way.  Even if that's not true in the slightest.
---
Man I hope this community becomes way less entitled and whiny once the game actually releases. I'm hoping its all just pent up energy needing an outlet.
---
I mean I agree to an extent, but if someone isn’t geared enough for the dungeon why should I waste my time? 
---
What’s the difference between ilvl and character level exactly? They both stand for power level.
---
How original
---
Nah, plus cross faction coorsination is bannable. The reason it got so big on pservers is server admin got money from the sales.
---
Lots of pserver guilds including mine have used TS for years. CSGO pros all still use TS.
---
tbh, realm forums were probably my absolute favorite part of classic wow. Why would you NOT want to join a server discord??
---
No job no gf, its gonna be aaaaall week nonstop
---
Item-level in Vanilla = best joke 2k19
---
Im actually almost glad i started in Wrath.  The story made a lot more sense than BC, the game was a bit more fleshed out, etc.
---
I had never played the other Warcraft games, so when i bought WC3 and went back and played it i really enjoyed seeing the story of Arthas and it really kind of put everything together.  
---
...plus im not sure it would have been good for me to be playing wow when i was in high school/college lol.  I was playing a shitty KMMO and that was bad enough for my grades.
---
Besides, now i get to go back and experience the original, so its a bit of the best of both worlds :)
---
Yes ...Catatafish .... Episode Bass to mouth... all of those names are from South Park
---
1. Rogue
---
2. Priest
---
3. Priest
---
4. Subjective
---
Yeah, raids, dungeons you will not wear your tier2 unless you are trolling
---
only to find out it's a level 1 bank alt ...
---
overly complaining is annoying, but "akchtually, anyone who complains is mentally deficient, I'm so highly enlightened for thinking everything is perfect." is just as annoying and douchey. 
---
Makes me feel like I'm in a class with one kid complaining about homework with another saying "teacher gives us homework, because teacher knows best. where is your lesson plan."
---
Where did it say 60hz?

It's called a PvE server.
---
Hunters and mages are the best dmg in tier 1 and 2
---
It mostly has to do with how easily they get hit %

Also hunters bis is tier 1 and 2 where for most other classes that isnt the case.  They are pretty gear efficient in raids tbh

Never need to go to a city tbh

I’m proud of you and for Azeroth but dude cover your tracks. Don’t let the employer know time off is for gaming XD say you have a terminally ill pen pal in Malaysia and this how you guys are reconnecting before he hearthstones to the afterlife.
---
It’s probably a little more dynamic as a mage if you can AoE grind, but at launch I’m planning single target spec, so mostly frost bolts.
---
Highest Skillcap  
---
Rogue&gt;&gt;&gt;Priest&gt;Paladin - Rogue is easy to learn, hard to master. Priest and Paladin quite straight forward.
---
Least trouble finding group  
---
Paladin&gt;Priest&gt;Rogue - but they are all realy sought after, everyone wants you either way
---
Least trouble gearing  
---
Paladin&gt;&gt;&gt;Priest&gt;Rogue - Paladins can take almost whatever, and plate healing gear is all for them. Priest share alot with other casters and healers, rogues share quite alot with other melee dips (warr). I would not say either rogue or priest is easy to gear. 
---
The most fun playstyle  
---
While this is very individual. Rogue&gt;Priest&gt;&gt;&gt;Paladin - Rogue has one of the best PVE rotation with lots of variations, priests have a huge pool of spells that could be used,  but paladin only buffs and cast flash of light.
---
he looks totally normal lol
---
Some lines are too long and i dont wanna change the entire frame but i was thinking of a class icon.
---
I might fix that later today.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Still not close enough.
---
I want that car to be up my ass already D:
---
I see Josh, I updoot.
---
Never played WoW before but love Elder Scrolls Online and am max level there with multiple characters. What class should I play in Classsic? I’m going to be solo for literally everything but group content like dungeons and roads, and would like to try PvP a bit as well.
---
No problem. Another great read would be the Bradygames world of Warcraft Master Guide. Ill see if I can find a pdf for you
---
Thanks! I will nonetheless give it a try!
---
yeah I dont care, already have all social medias
---
Even 4g would work
---
Re: 2 I'd call them negligible except for Dwarf's Fear Ward.  It's just too good to pass up if rolling Alliance Priest.
---
To explain to OP, every priest race has their own form of religion.  Which effectively just gives each race a spell or two that is unique to them.  You can just google "wow classic priest racials" to find out if there's one you prefer over the others.
---
Love your podcast, listen at work all the time. Excited to hear your warlock discussion. Cheers from NA :)
---
I hate to sound like that guy but cycling wakes me up so much more than any coffee in the morning. It is easy to keep up with it so far.
---
&gt;don't talk shit
---
Gonna be hard when he's being sponsored by an adult diaper brand
---
Could you cite the section of the TOS/EULA that bars this sort of action? It’d be no different from a kill on sight list, which no one was banned for, ever.
---
I love you both
---
&gt; but if someone isn’t geared enough for the dungeon why should I waste my time?
---
That's the beauty. You don't know if they are good and bad before you played with them. You build a REPUTATION by being good. Note that being good doesn't have to mean you have good gear. It can mean you kept the group alive with a well times shield or you saved the day with a battlerez. Or you were just a friendly and nice person. 
---
Ilvl takes away all that. None of that will matter when everyone just values you on that fucking number.
---
A PDF would be fantastic!!!
---
Yeah I play a pally and they're the easiest class to learn. Shaman on the other hand can get quite unwieldy with how many totems will occupy your bars.
---
I would also recommend one of the pet classes (hunter or warlock). You do have a pet action bar on your interface(and feeding your pet for as hunter), but they have a very easy leveling experience.
---
I’m talking more for a fresh server/character. At lvl 5 what funds are you going to have to buy a wand? You probably won’t have enough money to buy one at lvl 10 on a fresh server. 
---
Your best bet is to craft, disenchant, and make your own wand, or try trading cloth/leather+money for a wand.
---
Early on people look to make a profit on low lvl wands. Either you suck up the cost or get the quest wand at 14
---
Way to save the best for last in the episode!
---
Mostly I just wanted to throw you that bobo-talents link because it shows the progression of the points at the bottom. Useful for leveling questions like this.
---
So Thalnos is going to have Brazilians speaking Portuguese and French-Canadians speaking French.
---
Are there going to be any English speakers on the server?
---
Yeah, I liked balance in WOTLK a little but better, but if it was between TBC and the hardcore raiding space and balance in Wrath I would choose TBC every time. 
---
Just wish flying wasn’t a thing.
---
https://discord.gg/8mgV2D
---
So Thalnos is the new Zul'jin for us french canadians? Sweet!
---
I remember my warrior getting absolutely wrecked by ret paladins in wotlk
---
LW Hunter thinking the TBC preview talents tree is used for classic *Confusion intensifies*
---
In my experience retail players do not give a shit about classic
---
Damn the first part of the quest starts inside BFD from an Argent Dawn guy though?
---
You're still not actually contributing to the discussion.  Just bitching about someone who actually put in effort.  If you think you can do better, then DO better and present it.
---
This is so true it hurts.
---
Oh man, I hope so! I am planning on heading over there anyway for pure nostalgia’s sake. Here’s hoping it works out! Otherwise it’s going to be a hell of a lot of morrowgrain. &gt;.&lt;
---
It looks so ugly lol

If it's stupid but it works,  it isn't stupid.

Damn it... haha

Yea im unsure as to whether that quest is available though?
---
On Herod 
---
Orangesoda - Undead Mage (main)
---
Grapesoda - Troll Hunter (alt)
---
Dirtysoda - Tauren Druid (group character I’m playing with my buddies when we are all online)
---
I think it’s safe to say that engineering will at least help you win a close fight that you might have otherwise had a 50/50 shot at. As a warrior think about having an extra ranged dps ability plus stun (grenades) or extra root (net o matic) or Speed increase (rocket boots or helmet). Those can definitely turn the tide, not to mention all the utility trinkets for specific matchups.
---
Sure take away the ilvl from the tab. What’s wrong with character name, class, level and location?
---
On a PvP you’ll have more chance getting grief by the opposite faction while questing, but it’s part of the charms and you’ll have more interactions with people imo. And just for the world pvp event it is worth it. One of my best gaming moments.  
---
It all come down to you, but it’s named World of WARcraft after all :)
---
--The best class for a casual who would like to experience raiding?--
---
So I'm going to play with a group of friends who all have a limited weekly playtime. I'm thinking it's gonna take us like half a year to get to level 60.
---
We're in it for the long run.
---
I've been playing WoW on and off since Vanilla and I have always gravitated towards tanks (exclusively maining a Brewmaster tank since 2014).
---
My decision is between Warrior (with the intention to tank dungeons and maaaybe off tank raids) and a Holy Paladin.
---
Considering my limited play time which of these two would give me the greatest shot at experiencing raiding in Classic?
---
Again, I don't ever want to / expect to main tank and I'm not interested in topping the healing meters.
---
I just want to, eventually,  have the possibility to experience raiding.
---
Which one of these classes are most intense when it comes to microing, gathering consumables and being gear dependent? 
---
Last point: if Paladins were viable tanks I would pick Paladin in a heartbeat. I really, really like the class fantasy.
---
Would be so happy for any insight!
---
The best solo classes are by far Warlocks and hunters because of their pets. They are also both really good at pvp.
---
I updated my favourite bag addon, AdiBags, for Classic during the stress test. I'm hoping the maintainer of the official version accepts my changes and puts out a Classic version on all the relevant channels, but if anyone wants to use it in the meantime they can get it at this link:

---
Guild Wars 2 has scaling mobs at the level cap, but for the leveling process there are defined zones with level ranges.
---
through extensive player testing, they confirmed their suspicion that an entirely open world with scaling (up AND down) provided no sense of direction, and resulted in aimless gameplay. players were unenthusiastic, felt no sense of progression or incrementing challenge, and disengaged.
---
i can *somewhat* understand why scaling mobs to your level makes sense to maintain a challenge (and allow you to group with lower level characters). 
---
but i prefer a hard level cap. Put a level 60 elite mob in the middle of the Barrens or Dun Morogh please ... teach players that those are BAD and you need to avoid them.
---
the Fel Reaver surprise in TBC was one of my favorite moments in gaming. everyone in guild chat 'have you met IT yet in hellfire pen?' 'what do you mean' (15min later) 'OOOOooohhh.'.
---
Trying to decide on a healer alt. I've had a priest main since vanilla through most xpacs, and looking for something different. I'm a bit undecided between druid and shaman. I will be playing semi-casually, and I enjoy BGs, and dungeons mostly. I'll probably do some alt raids eventually, but it's not my focus for this character. 
---
I think either will be perfectly fine for the pve content I'll do, but I'm more curious how they fare in different pvp circumstances. How do they do in solo world pvp? What about their roles in BGs? And what classes gives each the hardest time?
---
&gt;Two PvP servers will hold less players than N-private server did alone. (no where do they claim this to be a theory)
---
me: where did you learn this info?
---
you: so a troll, or someone that can't handle different opinions. My bad.
---
You got it, bud lol big brain over there

I won’t be no-lifing. Job, marriage, and kids do not allow. 
---
My goal is 12 hours a week.
---
An hour over lunch during the work day, four hours on Wednesday nights, and three more hours where they can be found. 
---
If I were single, it would be three or four times that amount, easily. 
---
But I’m not.
---
I guess I should have specified, any kind of non class related stuff. Having people travel through the world makes it feel more alive and generally opens up for more PvP opportunities.
---
That's much of the problem with retail. Many of the trappings in mobile and facebook games were implemented into WoW, while much of what made it fun, such as community and a real sense of progression and player agency, were stripped out. Now it's all about mechanics designed around upkeep that the player must maintain or else fall behind.
---
Disgusting. This is how democracy dies...
---
Neither is 1.12 AV.. Whats your point? 
---
Do you want you pets to despawn because they cant follow you fast enough when mounted? 
---
Do you want to have to resummon your pet every time you die in a BG?
---
Which patch is the patch that you personally are happy with? Or just send over a list of all the bitch of each one you like and i'll get right onto blizzard to build a special little snowflake version of WoW just for you.
---
Ugh I'm jealous, my guy and me are fighting with ourselves just to take off 1 day lol, neither of us have vacation time T-T we refuse to wait for each other to level lol
---
Our rets, hpals, and prots were beast in my guild. Absolute studs.
---
I don't get it...
---
My advice would be... Enjoy the journey together. Progressional raiding won't really be a thing for a bit once the rushers hit 60 as they'll still have to gear up and get everything going. I'd put more of a focus on enjoying it rather than rushing to 60 and burning out before any content is do-able. 
---
But, as it is, it sounds like you two have a pretty solid plan of how to level
---
**[NA][Alliance][PVE with a dash of PVP]**
---
**Semi-hardcore player, with a hardcore mentality, looking for a guild**
---
**Details**
---
* Server: Herod
---
* Location: EST
---
* Available days: Any combination of Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and sunday.
---
* 30 years old, work a 9-5 job
---
* Class/role: DPS Warrior
---
* Primarily a PVE player however I do love PVP as well. I made it to rank 10 in the original rank 14 grind and hit 2400 RBG in Legion.
---
* Was a hardcore raider from the very beginning days of Molten Core and cleared everything to Sapphiron in Naxx.
---
For now, I can really only commit to semi-hardcore playtime. I would absolutely love to go hardcore but sadly I am no longer in highschool and have other obligations. While playtime may have suffered a bit I have maintained my hardcore mindset over the years and it has never waned to this day. I still raided up until recently. I stepped down from modern WoW raiding with a full clear of Heroic BoD, CoS and Eternal Palace. Mythic doesn't interest me much due to the current state of the game and I have raided in other games such as Final Fantasy XIV.
---
I can be reached here on reddit or via discord @ Arte#4321
---
They will. Mark my words
---
You don't have a lot of downtime as a raider unless you're either like top100 in the world, or play the game as a fulltime job
---
I was so sad when i realized Brewfest wasnt in Classic :(
---
That’s where I disagree - the classes you’re worried about will be stunning you, not fearing you.
---
Warlocks already excel against mages and priests relative to other classes.
---
Warlocks have a hard time with geared  warriors and rogues.
---
I would rather minimize my large disadvantage against a class like a rogue than marginally increase utility against classes I already beat like a mage/spriest
---
Some sort of MP5 tracker - with the 5second rule being a huge part of the healing meta (casting and cancelling) I'd love to be able to see what my mana regen looks like at all times. this is probably better handled by a weakaura of somesort, but idk anything about addon creation really.
---
Thanks for the recommendation. 
---
And yea, Chaos Seed does have some super cringe unnecessary dialog and jokes, as if a 13 yr old wrote it. I'm on book 4, mostly am able to mentally block those bits out now lol.
---
Yes! At least sum1 who thinks like me!
---
even if i die to an elite in reatil, the respawn in 15 seconds away, and i just press a button for insta-group and we zerg it down.
---
zero challenge, meaningless reward, no friends made.
---
There is also a blood elf in ratchet.
---
Just tool a glimpse but seems like a joke video.
---
The mods remove any posts in Spanish, but will fully tolerate blatantly racist shit as long as it's in English. Truly a beacon of free speech.
---
Prot Pally, Shaman Elemental, Beastmaster Hunter, Survival Hunter....the list will go on.....I mean if you are a carebear casual you can play any spec....but not many serious guilds will bring those specs for progression. Hell, there’s probably 7-8 specs I wouldn’t heal or tank for in an endgame dungeon unless I knew the player.
---
if you think you can get op every week after maintenance, sure oooor we could all just use LookingForGroup just like we use to in vanilla and zero issues with wanna be chat nazis
---
Yeah, the flying gimmick wasn't really needed (though I enjoyed the nether drake grind side of things) I was also not a fan of arenas and the way they led the need for the dreaded hyper balance that ended up ruining the game for me but yeah! Those were all in wotlk as well anyway :P
---
Doing both my man.
---
This is actually kinda hard to answer IMO, hyrbid classes tend to be good for solo play imo because they can do everything and have a generally defensive playstyle somewhat. But in classic they have the hybrid tax and are objectively not as "powerful" as pure DPS classes.
---
Well, first, that's just a single Youtuber. Finding one person who says otherwise usually isn't enough to say "so ye."
---
But he could very well be right, and it's entirely possible that agility is better, but he doesn't actually show the relevant math on his video to know. You'd have to find the baseline dps increase from a single point of strength vs. single point of agility. 
---
If this were a math class, he just skipped like 3 steps to arrive at the conclusion agi &gt; strength. 
---
Again, he could be totally right. But he doesn't adequately explain why.
---
i went from org to ashenvale, got destroyed by a spider. Tried to recruit people to kill the "spider boss" until it was pointed out to me that it wasn't a boss
---
tysm kind person
---
Just do it yourself. Dont stress about it enjoy it as much as possible. It should be fun not sheets and guides. You are a mmo player you will manage on your own.
---
You could tank 5 mans as a pally leveling and then heal raids at 60
---
Just fyi, being smack in the middle of the bell curve means you'll have the most competition while leveling, not the least.
---
Imo, abandon the Ele/Frost aoe idea completely. At 30h played a week, you're going to be in the zerg. Evenings and week ends are peak server population, too. Go single target frost spec and enh if you really want efficiency, that's your best bet.
---
That is good enough for me. Thank you!
---
Nope. Playing classic is probably the best way to get into it.

Good luck, and see you in Azeroth!

If you want to play Troll and talk down all classes except Shaman, perhaps give it a thought.   
---
Good lvl'ing in Enhancement (a bit of a ramp up first few lvl's, but hey what class is awesome from lvl1?)  
---
World pvp is only decent but then again its decent in every spec. Shamans can be a blast to play with high RNG and awesome crits :)
---
What else is there to do before launch?
---
So far, Danish folk don't seem too keen on moving. There's been talk about how much of a hassle it'll be to get word out to an entire community that spans numerous countries and languages. Worried a bunch of Scandinavians won't hear about it in time.
---
I won't have launch days off, but I'm looking at a minor surgery on my shoulder. Should stick me home on paid medical for about 2 weeks. Gonna be very nice to get that time to keep my arm still, but move the mouse a bit and kill kill kill! MWUAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I'm in the exact same position as you (feel the same way about retail &amp; classic.) I'm taking a break from retail raiding (top500 guild) to play classic. The way I see it, Classic is only going to happen once, this is the most hype moment. Retail raiding will always be there. I don't mind missing the back end of one tier to play classic
---
Keep sucking that corporate dick, I' m sure they really care about you lil zoom
---
Hunters are an excellent solo class but from what I've read they do not scale well into the end game in Classic.
---
Yeah, I’m saying it’s worth the cost. Just buy a wand and nothing else. Find a guildy or trade some linen cloth to someone.
---
My biggest fear as a warlock in a 1v1 is another warlock not a rogue.  Rogues and warriors are really no issue if you have the correct pet AND they are not undead.
---
Then they went full retard with the goblin crap in cata.  monorail/rollercoast transport ffs.
---
Are racial passives a thing in WoW? If so what horde race is ideal for hunter?
---
I'm jealous. I want to roll a tauren hunter but I've always been a prot warrior so I will remain a prot warrior :( enjoy the experience for the both of us.
---
Shut you u Spanish lover
---
The game is easy to get into, don't stress over it.
---
Now will you be at a a huge disadvantage in comparison on people who played this game for thousands of hours back in the days and again on private servers? obviously but there's nothing you can do that to accept it and just have fun to discover things.
---
Hmmm, thought i checked there. Mustn't have looked hard enough
---
I really hope they're taking into account the players who aren't currently subbed and will sub up just before the 26th.
---
Let's agree to disagree.  KoA was a failed attempt at an mmo and everything about it is generic, boring filler as a singleplayer game.
---
Pick one of these actually good RPGs instead: https://rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=11193

I honestly couldn't sit back and just not post anything because it's the cringiest fucking thing I've ever seen.
---
The entire population almost 14,000 of these 4chan losers are spamming copypasta, shitposting about the other servers and shouting for the Spanarids to be banned.
---
I get that the server was setup for good intentions of trading and grouping but honestly this place makes me all the more happier to roll on Gehennas.
---
If you're set on playing on Shazzrah avoid this place at all costs because it's fucking sickening.

Well, some people take 2 weeks off work to watch TV or go to the beach for the same amount of time so...

One should get skinning, no competition in that profession. And I've read and saw many that advice you to vendor almost all early skins. The AH will be drowned in skins, with almost no demand, which means it's likely you will end up losing your ah deposit without selling it.
---
 I'd follow Joana's guide as you said, but, since you can heal, try to do each dungeon atleast once to do all the quests in there to be ahead of the Joana curve
---
Yeah that was the stress test, not the beta.
---
As an average American it seems positive that it doesn't matter.
---
stress test was not the same client as the closed beta
---
The game that got me to stop using ptt was street fighter 4. Until then, I was a diehard ptt guy, but when you're trying to talk to your buddy while you're playing, and both of your hands are fully occupied by the heavy arcade box on your lap, it's super difficult.
---
After that, you just figure out how to make voice activation only activate when you're talking and you're good
---
Love dreamer! :) I'm Rem, Reve, &amp; Reverie on Grob.
---
If you like ranged with pets then Hunter or Warlock. If you like ranged without pet, then mage.
---
If you like melee for leveling and then having primarily healing options but others if you put work into it, look into Druid who are also great solo.
---
Those are the easiest solo classes IMO.
---
Like you I am torn.  My only reason for not wanting tbc or wotlk servers is that the last patch of each of those expansions really messed with things.  So many catch up mechanics and welfare epics.  Even if they phased the servers like Classic it would end in a bad place.
---
&gt; Is Rogue that much better then feral cat in PVP/PVE for raw damage?
---
Yes. Druids can definitely compete with some DPS with powershifting, cosumables, manual crowd pummeler farming, pre BiS farming for gear etc. But if you put in that same level of effort to your rogue, the rogue will always outshine the druid for pure damage.
---
Druid however brings battle rez, innervate, LoTP for melee, occassional heals. HoTW/NS is a solid spec for 5 man tanking and healing raids, not the best, but a solid choice.
---
I played both in Vanilla, rogue to 60 then druid to 60. Ended uo playing the druid more as I could jump to tank, solo in cat and heal if needed. I spent a **lot** on respecs. The rogue was still my favourite to pvp with.
---
Lot of text but - PvP rogue hands down, druids don't have burst or cooldowns that make it fun. PvE, easy mode - rogue, more involvement - druid.
---
Hope that helps.
---
But not all those people are available for a whole dungeon...

Skinning is definitely tempting. I'm planning on going mining/engineering for PvP, and she's planning on tailoring/enchanting, but I could definitely have engineering take a back seat and sell/bank early mats, and just vendor a ton of skins. Would help with early mats for her tailoring too.

Ganked - Orc rogue
---
Influenza - Undead lock
---
Multitool - Tauren druid
---
Damn I forgot about RFD/RFK.
---
1.) All group content requires at least one healer. Priests are generally considered to be the best general purpose healers, but other classes that can heal (druids, shaman's, and paladins) excel in specific areas where priests can be lacking. I encourage you to do a bit of research to find out which of the four healing classes best fits your preferred style of healing.
---
2.) Each of the races offer different advantages than the others, you should look at the different racial abilities and decide which ones you want. Additionally, priests are unique in that depending on your race you will be able to learn some priest spells but not others. Dwarves are generally considered to be the best alliance priests as dwarf priests are the only characters who have access to the excellent Fear Ward spell. The racial choices for horde priests are less cut and dry.
---
3.) I'm not entirely sure that I understand this question.
---
4.) The leveling process consists primarily of completing quests, doing dungeons, and/or grinding mobs. It can take a considerable amount of time to hit max level, and the exact amount of time varies greatly from person to person. I would advise against going into Classic with the thought process of trying to get to 60 as fast as possible as that will suck a lot of the fun out of it.
---
5.) I suspect that it will be very successful. No one outside of Blizzard knows the exact numbers but I personally wouldn't be surprised if Classic eclipses retail provided that it is handled properly.
---
6.) I would strongly encourage anyone to at least give it a shot. The game won't be for everyone and it is certainly less beginner friendly than retail has become, but I consider the lack of hand holding a positive. Regarding the community, there will always be jerks, that's just unavoidable when talking about this many people. As a whole I've found the classic community to be much more welcoming to newcomers than most other gaming communities that come to mind, and as long as you display a willingness to learn the game I don't think you'll have too many problems.
---
Oh I see, okay thanks for the help! I was so confused.
---
Don't think there will be anything authentic with the way layering is going to work. You won't bump into people from the same server because a population of 15K + is going to be crammed into one server and layered like hell.
---
Yeah, rogues were probably the most compact spec in regards to abilities so that one's a fair comparison
---
I’m just going to delete it it because this was funny
---
What’s the best race for a Hunter? I want to play a Marksmanship Hunter but I’m not sure which race would be better for damage, survivability, PvP and raiding
---
exactly why they can stay while others move to gehennas
---
Will I miss a lot if I don't pick tailoring and instead pick herbalism and alchemy, so I won't craft the archemage robe and bloodvein's gear?
---
And to add on to that, c++ is significantly more difficult to master.
---
Yeah I mean... The reason the default loot speed has a delay is that some people have shitty connections, and the devs have to cater to the lowest common denominator. The addons aren't using some fancy advanced method that the devs couldn't figure out. The devs just have to consider all the shitty connections.
---
And then addons speed up the looting, by assuming you to have a good connection. You can't loot faster than you click the mobs. Kinda shows the ignorance of the general player when they think they detect differences between the addons that simply aren't there. And instead of measuring it, they just "feel it". Classic placebo.
---
What's your guys progression? I'm shocked you have a whole raid group quitting for classic. Literally 1 out of 25 of my guys are planning on leaving (it's me lol.) We're a top500 guild though so these people are really dedicated and in love with retail. Maybe that's the difference
---
Mechanical keyboards in general is not the problem. Blue switches, are a scourge with no equal, no doubt. But except from that, it depends on the user. If you mash the keys, they will be noisy. O-rings help alleviate that. If they have low noise gate or a table mic, chances are you'll hear them furiously spamming 22222232222212222.
---
Honestly, just bring it up to those who make the noise. That and chewing. It's basic human decency, as far as I'm concerned, to not make annoying noises. Most of the time it's like "oh shit, my bad. Didn't realize it was picked up by the mic!"
---
"hero"
---
&gt;It was the same with flying and BC
---
I'm not sure I see the problem with flight....
---
You do know what the LFM tab is right? You create a group, put the dungeon, and then people apply to join...
---
Yeah, I mean, you lookup the ones that ask to join or start messaging them yourself, "hey, wanna run UBRS?"
---
You said "The talents are all over the place" and other very vague statements that can mean anything. Explain where the talents SHOULD be and explain why, in its current form, it isn't viable. It's hilarious how obtuse you're intentionally being.
---
Goes into classic sub to cry about classic
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind belfs/draenai, allows a non-ugly horde race, and the draenai starting zone had cool vibes
---
That's true, but I didn't want to be that specific.
---
I believe AtlasQuest is an add-on but it's not currently released for classic so they've given all the quests that it would show you as other sources aren't 100% correct
---
I think it's fine, makes it feel more like IF.
---
As a Portuguese I really don't know which one to pick, specially now with Gehennas being added.  
---
Since the Spanish are a lot and don't have their own servers I would prefer to avoid them.  
---
Don't think on EU we have to worry too much about streamers either.
---
hoes mad
---
1. Yes.
---
2. Some sort of quest helper, ui reorganizer, threat meter, dps meter, atlas.
---
3. I have no idea what addons BFA has.
---
4. Maybe some sort of automation LFR-type of shit. Also guild /w invite -addons are annoying af.
---
5. Not an addon developer.
---
6. Addons were in vanilla.
---
Full means likely long queue times.
---
Locked means no new characters
---
I played both at 60 and found the warlock more enjoyable and the mage being more repetitive.
---
As warlock I enjoyed the different styles of each talent tree as well as those play styles changing with pets.  I also found world pvp 1vX more enjoyable then the mage but it was probably my playstyle .   I will say I did enjoy the mage talents as well, especially fire/ice hybrid.
---
There tends to be more mages as well so if that bothers you, a warlock will have less gear composition.  
---
I personally won’t have time to level two classes so I’ve committed to the warlock based of my past experiences.
---
Ok les boys, on y va en masse taabbberrnnaakkk
---
What you did there, I see
---
Just wow.
---
https://i.imgur.com/cSlc4qC.png
---
Priest is an A+ healer and shadow is disgustingly good in PvP and having a mage make you water and int buff makes it REALLY attractive.
---
&gt; most likely
---
&gt;Blizzard servers are not going to hold 12-13k players online concurrently, no way. I say this knowing 100% that I have no idea what i'm talking about
---
&gt;Where is the problem?
---
This sub tbh, like 99% of the people are idiots like you babbling on about things they're just guessing about and weirdly doubling down when one person dared to ask for a source
---
So it wasn’t stolen at all. Got it.
---
Exactly what I was looking for, thanks a lot
---
Smoke break? chat?
---
I'm going thalnos lol fuck the 5 hour queues everyday
---
Aaaaaaand I'm that much MORE pumped to roll a druid this time around!! Thank you!
---
"Darkfriends" - I see you White Cloak.
---
I've seen about 15 strangers out in the wild wearing Wheel of Time tshirts - I always try to alter my walking route so I can mutter "Walk in the light" while I'm passing them by. I've always gotten a golden, although often delayed, reaction.
---
What’s wrong with having the tab though? How does it hurt your experience? That’s what I’m not getting, I sincerely see no negatives to it’s addition.
---
 [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25006-ClassicAuraDurations.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25006-ClassicAuraDurations.html)  worked for me during the stress test
---
Say someone secured the name "Homelander"- what class should they play?
---
Well use the addon if you want, but don't try to force everyone to have it. Or you know... play retail if you really want it.
---
&gt; queues might be longer for pvp
---
All of the battlegrounds are going to be crossrealm in Classic.
---
Oops, my lack of attention to detail there.. Thanks!
---
You’ll be good, they can still create characters. There will just be a queue sometimes for logging in. :)
---
There's always a way!
---
I had no idea the first option was a thing
---
This isn't an FPS where you have to aim... hitboxes are irrelevant here.
---
Well, Herod and Faerlina are both eastern, so really don't have a choice (Thalnos no thanks). Fairbanks is pacific, so not dealing with that lag.
---
Nobody avoids an rp server because of misconceptions.
---
RP players have on many accounts proven themselves to be prickly bastards that get offended at the smallest of things.
---
* Your name "doesn't fit your race or the lore". That's a report.
---
* You happened stroll into "their quest to defeat a creature". That's a report.
---
I could go on... but the point is kind of made. RP players are very entitled and believe that unless you're part of "their story" you're clearly trying to ruin it and deserve to get kicked. I would honestly say they are the most immature of any player; and yes I am including barrens chat.
---
well I'm on their discord now following the discussion
---
It removes player interaction and the need to congregate in social hubs like IF &amp; Orgrimmar, I think.
---
I hear you, man. I commend you for your efforts and attitude. :-)
---
No?
---
There were no “recent” betas. There was the one beta. You are referring to the stress test, which is not a beta.
---
Its in the discord lol theres like a few br guilds and they all speak normal ass English, it's chill
---
Our GM was like..."NOPE, NOT HAPPENING!. I LOST THE VOTE AND WE WENT SHATT INSTEAD OF GOLEMAGG, AND NOW YOU MUST SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES!!"
---
Dat right click report doe
---
^/s
---
Feelsgoodman
---
I don't think there are any nodes in the "mini" starting areas.  I looked for them in the stress test, and didn't see any.  I could have easily overlooked them though.  I'm talking about the small bowl you start in, not the zone on the other side of the pass.
---
I'm missing a short re-interview with Thex to talk about how he finally got his name
---
I don't think you know what a Millennial is. Most of the people playing this are in that category. Look at any census.
---
No theres YOUR problem. You are blaming people and looking for faults in other people. If the ret paladin was someone else maybe you would have wiped at 99 % . Or maybe not. You dont know what would happen. Let people play whatever they fucking want and enjoy the game, this is not BFA, go min max your ass so Blizz can jerk you off so you buy a mount.
---
Fairbanks:
---
Virus
---
Nerd
---
Dumb
---
Still not sure what to play but probably Nerd
---
No it means you cant create chars there anymore
---
Oh no
---
Why's that
---
I download the latest version assuming it would also work. Weird that the classic version is more hidden on this addon page.
---
Downloaded the correct version now.
---
That's ok though, those things are way more important, but I'm glad you'll still find time for it!
---
Have a ball playing it. :-)
---
A word to the wise - this game is pure heroin.  Welcome the ride :)
---
Put iLvl beside RaiderIO and Gearscore as game destroying.
---
As someone that never raided in vanilla, I always find the taunt argument odd. Is taunting raid bosses that common? 
---
I get some encounters are trivialized with taunt(while some bosses are immune to taunt) but threat being pulled off the tank routinely in raids sounds like an issue with the DPS that will need to be dealt with eventually regardless of tank.
---
Protadins lacking Shield Block and decent tank itemization rules them out as main tanks imo. I don't understand the over emphasis on taunt though(outside of the encounters with mechanics it trivializes).
---
Night elf and orc
---
&gt;Its in the discord lol
---
What's in the discord?
---
Discord is completely different to the realm forums. Discord would be more like allowing you to speak freely between factions, including whispers. Realm forums are public so it's not for private discussions and has completely different "atmosphere".
---
u/redtempest pointed out i put LBRS somewhere instead of Blackrock Spire - fixed!
---
It's not that hard to believe, there were easily over a thousand rank 14's in vanilla and the people who loved the game that much are the ones likely to be on the forums waiting to play that exact same game 15 years later. Just in my immediate real life friend group alone my one buddy hit 14 and my other friend and I were 11s.
---
Im pretty sure this was the plan all along, theyre really careful with adding servers, and i think they always knew 2 PVP EU realms were not enough, but didnt want to go big dick with 5 PVP like NA and also having 3 pvp realms that are language specific
---
Shadow priests are one of the strongest PvP classes in classic but for prolonged battles they go OOM.  That said even with little man an they can still take someone down.  I personally foresee a lot of rogues mages and warriors which shadow priests do well against.
---
Nope, not quite like that. Others in this thread have described it more accurately than I can.
---
You can skin and even pick flowers in your bear- cat- and travel-form.
---
So herbalism is a very suitable profession for druids. Unfortunately, as you say, they cannot drink potions in their forms. Which devalues the herbalism/alchemy-combination quite a bit for them.
---
People in the US speak those languages too... Your post is kinda xenophobic.
---
We'll have fun either way, no concerns there :) What we're really after is outside-the-box ideas to make our time more efficient. We've taken leave from work for releases in the past and raced, and I know the exact feeling of hitting cap and then just doing normal dungeons because there's no way to punch above your weight category - everyone is at the same level. If we ding 60 in early October, we'll likely be able to dive straight into a few BRD + StratUD runs and be MC ready within a few days, if there's already say a guild tank with the Key to the City, etc.
---
This is key. Auctioneer is a must have.
---
WotLK was my favorite.  If we ever get dedicated servers to re-experience that expansion, I will die a happy man, old and gray, still farming champions's seals til my last day.
---
Glad I could deliver!
---
Yes. It will be the majority English speakers. We’re overestimating the amount of non English speakers there will be
---
I want Eliza in Grobbulus but someone got it ahead of me because of the client kicking me out for 30+ min :(
---
Spent so much time farming those on my hunter in vanilla.  Unlike Felwood, I never had to compete for the spot.  In  months of farming out there, I might have seen 2-3 other people the entire time.
---
I'd very much like some sauce to that. I organize for a minor community of Swedes and would like to stay informed of how to dodge the Spanish inquisition, but we don't really expect them. Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition.
---
man those quests, i actually like them, it makes the game more immersive and rewards you with neat shit for your class, nothing as of today anymore.
---
seems that people will roll classic only because of nostalgia, right? ;x
---
HAIL CLASSIC!HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL CLASSIC! HAIL
---
No, just wanted to add that dkp systems are there to protect people from guilds that funnel gear to their friends.
---
I'm hoping for loot council in the guild i will go for just because i intend to warrior dps so i will be highest prio.(Same with the other 15 warriors)
---
Ah a man of culture I see
---
Do you trust every member in your guild, and does every member in your guild trust you?
---
If so, go loot council
---
In all other cases, go DKP or similar.
---
I think the hype train will attract a lot of new players. And I think the lifespan of classic will be longer than some people suspect since new and old players tend to stay for end game content.
---
Me too
---
How does it feel to be dumb
---
Color blind mode doesn't change how people socially interact with each other. A LFM tool does a few things. It lowers the requirement of being in a guild because the guild was always the best place to start a dungeon run. The next best place to get into dungeon runs was friends from other guilds. If you add LFM tab you begin the decay of the exact social structures missing in retail.
---
If people choose to use add-ons thats their choice to willfully ruin things for themselves.
---
If you believe dungeons are the best content in vanilla then you need to get into a good guild and make friends.
---
Ah, I was just remembering how it was back in vanilla. Guess its changed. My mistake.
---
Most guilds are going loot council in Classic so the leadership can reserve legendaries for themselves, plain and simple.
---
There’s a 1/x chance you’ll be part of the fun, because it will most likely not be on your layer.
---
You most likely won’t be on the layer attacking stormwind or defending org
---
You most likely won’t be on the layer where that crazy city brawl is happening
---
And say goodbye to recognizing the enemies as you level throughout the zones. They’re prob on diff layers
---
There is no corruption in the motherland, comrade.
---
Whats the word?
---
My favorite times in my WoW career were had on Venture Co (RP-PVP) after transferring there in Cata from a popular high-pop PvP server. The passion for world PvP is no joke.
---
Hey man, karma is karma.
---
I laughed.
---
Can you get banned for things like client side transmog? And where can I find it?
---
i've had prime since before it had twitch prime and has no bearing on whether i will/would have it or not, so it is effectively a free bonus...in no way am i paying for it.
---
He pretty much repeated the same facts listed above in trade every time I was logged in, with differing amounts based on the current expansion.

I want more people to participate in vanilla, how does this tool do what you are saying it does?
---
https://www.wowhead.com/looking-for-group-premade-group-finder
---
&gt;This is one of the most exciting draws for me personally. You can create a name for yourself that holds a higher value than it would on different servers, along with streamers Faerlina is going to have most of the top WoW pvp players to ever grace Azeroth. I’m not promising anything but we are looking like one of if not the most competitive server out there.

Played on RPPvP realms for a few years now, most notably Emerald Dream. I have been name reported tons of times, which can be appealed easily *MOST* times. If you irritate someone enough you are almost gauranteed to get right-click reported for name, even if it is RP Compliant. It's just how it works, honestly the best way to get rid of a corpse camper. Entire Guilds will even do it if they dislike you enough.
---
Agree
---
Damn you sir. For ruining my expectations:( here's a thumbs up
---
I was very young (10) when actual vanilla was released, so I played but I didn't even reach 60 back then.
---
 but I've played a lot on vanilla private servers recently and , other than BfA and WoD, all the xpacs
---
I prefer a bit of a mix between LC/DKP for the reasons people listed in other comments but more related to pieces of gear that actually make a difference. LC takes much longer than DKP and an easy argument can be made to have certain items LC and other items DKP to speed up looting while minimizing any lose of progression
---
I was planning on going horde. CC doesn’t necessarily worry me, I’m more curious how those mechanics work. ESOyounloterally break them whenever you want but it cost resources to do, and you get CC immunity for a few seconds to avoid being perma locked lol. I’m sure I’ll be fine once I get in there and actually experience things for myself.
---
It’s actually 50/50 on Faerlina when it comes to faction balance
---
Our guild has already switched over. We'll do almost anything to avoid the cancer guilds on Shaz and Golemagg.
---
Do not listen to people who are telling you that any laptop can run this. **Do not** get a laptop with integrated graphics, or this game will not run well, at least not on decent settings.
---
I got a $1000 2018 laptop with integrated graphics, and that wasn't enough.
---
As long as your laptop has an independent graphics card in it, and its GPU and CPU are made within the last 5 years, you'll be good.
---
Example: the gun drops off golemagg. This happens to be bis for any physical class with a ranged weapon slot. But hunters will actually be dealing damage with it, so it is a bigger upgrade for them.
---
In a dkp system, whoever has the most dip out of all the warriors, rogues, and hunters gets it. A rogue has been saving his dkp, letting items get sharded because they would be small upgrades, slowing down the whole guild because he could be slightly stronger. So the rogue gets it, adding 10 or so dps, while the hunters, who could have added 100, are stuck with their blues.
---
Loot councils can be corrupt, but if run correctly tend to be much better for the guild's progression. I haven't ever seen one for a 40 man raid, and it must get intense, but dkp can be badly unbalanced as well.
---
Lol how'd you know
---
Is this an often occurrence though? Especially against taunt immune bosses I feel like having lazy DPS is a liability waiting to happen.
---
You should definitely try to group LVL/dungeon as much as possible I think. I was considering a warrior but after playing around on the test realms on it and a mage it is just SO much slower its actually insane. Let your mage friends carry you through the leveling process :)
---
&gt;Prove me wrong?
---
Don't raid with assholes.

---
nah if u r bad ass and like doing cool stuff like me
---
I missed the part in my comment where I said I did this in classic   
---
:BUT ITS THE CLASSIC WOW SUBREDDIT:  
---
Yeah and I assume you have a brain and can reason that I was talking about TBC but the same thing the op is going through.
---
Soon you'll see my hunter named 'Woodfecker' running around :p
---
Only issue I see with it is that some of the most valuable white items are only worth a ton because they are essential in leveling skillups.  There would have to be value ratings for each white, a tonnnn of work
---
They literally said they had excess realms they would use if needed. Begone troll.
---
Not necessarily, you can release new content without ruining the game again.
---
On top of what u/mckibz said, flying and world quests.
---
You need a max level char to farm effectively, flying makes moving between resources very easy, if you go after latest crafting mats they're a guaranteed sale on AH.
---
In BFA there are daily emissary world quests that gives 2k gold each and can be done in 10-15 minutes max, they are random but they aren't restricted to account so you can do them on all your alts when they spawn.
---
There are also plenty of missions and world quests that give raw gold, but again you need a max level char for those.
---
These are only a few ways you can farm solo without too much effort, if you can play the AH you can make a lot of money fast without even moving from a city, thanks to collectionists (pets and mounts) and the new wardrobe feature and transmog (if you want to know more have a look at /r/woweconomy).
---
My brother is single and has already had conversations with his maid and dog walker (one person) regarding this time period.  They are setup to clean up around the house and take care of his doggos several times on a daily basis while bringing him the meal service that he has prepaid for.
---
Palis are ok dungeon tanks
---
Awesome, thanks for your input!
---
I know about the crowd pummeler. But I think it was kinda clunky design by Blizzard to not at least allow for on-hit effects on weapons, b/c those weapons are pretty often garbage and have weak base damage. But if druids don't care about the weapon damage, then the proc might be kinda cool to have.
---
Additionally, I always thought it was very, very silly that you can't use barkskin in bear form. Like, cmon.
---
half life series from hl1 to hl2e2. also black mesa fan made remake of hl1.
---
Tell it to the judge criminal.
---
Low-effort memes are not allowed. You can still meme. Just be creative
---
Good. More room for us.
---
Exactly I remember killing a stag in Ashenvale with my brother and his friend we thought it was some kind of boss because it had skull instead of level the sense of satisfaction as we found basic game mechanics as aggro healing and stuns.
---
They've already underestimated the traffic they would get from name reservations alone.
---
People who sub early to reserve names aren't even close to the full community who will be joining in on the 26/27th.
---
This still seems like a massive underestimation.
---
I feel Wrath started getting a bit too generous with gear. I for one would love a TBC project as it follows vanilla gameplay very closely but the worst issues are addressed. TBCs only real problem easily quickly turned Azeroth into a ghost town because of Outland.

That is true. Yet with todays Connection across all platforms it is quite easy for any Person on any Server to create a community Event. 
---
Maybe not as straight away as a streamer could (within one hour let's say) they would probably Need announcement a couple of days in advance. Yet quite easy.
---
I myself am not a big stream Viewer. I will watch Videos of streamers on YouTube but that is only the funniest moments compiled in a Video.
---
All I want to avoid by not rolling on a streamer Server is the Drama that Comes along with it (usually) when someone tries to Interrupt These Events they are hated on by literally thousands of People. Which is not right.
---
Why shouldn't they kill someone in a dueling tournament? It is not like they are not allowed to or like the duel couldn't be redone (it's just the first example that Comes to mind) and also the hate that streamers get from other People that "accidentally" rolled on their Server...
---
I just want to avoid all of it while I'm happy for everyone that wants to Play on a streamer Server.
---
We can all choose what Server to Play on and streamers made it quite obvious which Servers they will role so I'm happy the way it is :)
---
Everyone gets what they prefer =)
---
I'm playing horde mage, but I'm torn between undead and troll. I doubt I'll have time to raid at all and I do plan on PvPing so undead would seem the obvious choice, but I hate how they look. I really like the troll aesthetic. How big of a deal is the difference in racials?
---
I suspect a lot less people jumping on it, but we will see
---
Just sent this to my girlfriend for fair warning
---
I played extensively, 3 60’s. And I honestly believe this https://www.wowhead.com/looking-for-group-premade-group-finder

Would help more people enjoy the content Vanilla has. It doesn’t not subtract anything in my opinion.

---
Wait don't the horde and alliance "help" each other when the aq gates open?
---
This should’ve been the approach months ago.
---
Locking player to layer = locking player to server in 2004. That would’ve created the *exact* same experience.
---
Now we’ll actually have pservers that are more true to Classic than Classic.
---
Blizz had one shot and they blew it. If that isn’t the perfect analogy for Blizzard’s track record over the last 5 years then I don’t know what is. 
---
Their games are dying, their founders have left, they’ve been crushed under the corporate weight of activision, yet the sub is filled with fanboys who rush to their defence. We’ve lost our game boys. Get ready to layer hop 24/7 because frankly you’re at a disadvantage if you don’t. 
---
And say goodbye to corpse camping, an iconic part of the WoW experience.
---
I tried that, do you need omnicc as well?
---
We will definitely try to do every dungeon on the road to 60, either me as a tank or dps since we have a druid friend. But they already told me no one has any intention of Duo leveling so I'm kind of stuck going solo
---
I'll see if I can get a fat stack of consumables every time I log in from Resident Mages
---
I'd love to troll a zandalri troll waiting for classic, but the effort at max level required is too much of a deterrent.
---
its just am and pm that confuse me.
---
Does it not go past counting 100 first answers? Just adds the ones after that to "Skipped" and does not update results.
---
Shhh, mod plays horde, he’s gonna get upset and censor this
---
Imbatman
---
Yea it’s gonna Get old asking for it all the time, just Makes it smoother to see it all the time
---
Seconding what they said, but if I can maybe expand, in case OP sees.
---
1) Priests are always good, but other healers are just as good. There’s Paladins and Shaman on the Alliance and Horde which are also excellent, and then druids which have drawbacks but can also heal well. 
---
2) yep. Just Dwarf priests for fear wars
---
3) It’s really as end game focused as you want it to be. You can play for years and never play much at 60, or it can be virtually all you do. There’s fun stuff to do in the whole game.
---
4) Quests is the general way, but I like to run A LOT of dungeons. It’s fun, challenging, you get good gear, and most of all you get to develop your skills while playing with other people. 
---
5) It’s looking good, although I’m a little worried we’re gonna have overpopulation issues for a few months. 
---
6) I’m extremely jealous that you get to experience the world for the first time. I’ve already played through it a handful of times to 60/70, and even more in the current game where you can play blindfolded.
---
Good job on this
---
I was only able to get Tuesday-Wednesday off because so many people requested a few days off before labor day and I was late to ask because release date was so far pushed back.  But I at least have those 2 days and then the 3 day weekend.
---
I've always been interested in ESO, that is a very interesting CC system. In Wow youre generally deciding if its worth it to sit the CC or not and people are trying to get you to pop your trinket so they can follow up with another CC immediately when you do.
---
You’ll be fine. 40 is a big number and people burn out.,just roll your warlock, enjoy the free mount at 40, the easy leveling, summoning, SS, HS and all Tempe fun it has to offer!!
---
the biggest difference is the hair.

Have you seen the diaper post?
---
1) Priests are the best raid healers in the game. Almost everyone agrees on this. Super important.
---
2)  Yes. Depends what you're going for but look into it and decide for yourself which you prefer.
---
3) Depends on what kind of player you are. Personally I think end-game raiding is only a huge deal for hardcore players. If you're fairly casual, the levelling experience is super fun in itself.
---
4) Questing for 80% of the time. Dungeons for the rest (good items, complete quests there, something different and fun).
---
5) Looks awesome. Layering is a huge discussion point which honestly I think is so overblown on reddit. Classic is 100% going to be a success.
---
6) YES YES YES!!! 
---
If you have any other specific questions, feel free to PM me.
---
Spriests and warlocks are very strong 1v1 but they lack mobility for escape/catching people in wpvp. Not a lot of tools to reset a fight. Take a long time to be operational when you respawn (rebuffs, summoning, crafting stones etc) when you inevitably die. 
---
Rogues and mages have burst, cc, mobility, tools to reset or escape. Hunters have that too, they do a bit less damage but also have trackings which is huge in wpvp, a pet to keep people in combat when they try to bandage/reset, so they can be good too if you’re good.

Exactly both of you, it is a good problem to have, + let's be honest, letting thousands of people in queue is not that big of a deal if the expected playtime for one person is up to 15 minutes, unlike in real queue where it is hours
---
I think it was a joke
---
Layers would be ideal if you couldn't hop. It avoids the server merge problems seemlessly. The problem is that the entire thing hinges on you needing to be on the same layer as your friends.
---
They could have treated layers as virtual "servers" which would have been great.
---
I think your points are all correct about corporate. I really don't think that people who work their have a backbone. They just do whatever corporate says with no pushback. And this probably is the cruz of the issue.
---
Same. I'm definitely playing classic, but I'm not going 100% nolife like I would have been for a TBC relaunch.
---
thanks for the reply! hm, I hadnt actually considered druids bc I really dont like night elves... but it might be a good idea!
---
Either way, I think Im abandoning my thoughts about playing warrior.
---
Right? The number of people saying "this is not true vanilla" that didnt actually play real vanilla seems crazy high. 
---
When your solution to layering requires a significant number of people just dont get to play? Ya can go F yourself, I am taking my one vacation for this damn it.
---
Not my addon, but consider this the best bags addon until (if) AdiBags is updated: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ark-inventory-classic
---
Does this work correctly?
---
Medium, low and high reference to players online. All of the realms are low, including Golemagg and Shazzrah since they all have 0 players online. Full, locked and recommended are the statuses that show amount of characters on realms.
---
I like your style :D
---
Weren't the streamers going there?
---
Five second rule link is broken.
---
You're going to be broke, from level 1 to months into 60. You won't really be able to afford buying anything, you're lucky if you make 40 and can buy your mount with all relevant skills bought. 
---
A good weapon is the one thing that makes leveling a warrior bearable. If you have someone find a good BoE and send it to you, it can make a lot of difference. Also, a lot of classes don't use up all the healing pots they find when leveling. Ask them to kindly send the ones they outlevel to you, as you're going to be slower you'll be able to make good use of them. You can ask really good friends (or people who know you're suffering through this to tank stuff for them later) for some cash, but this can be perceived very badly so I wouldn't. 
---
But really, most importantly: Ask for their time. If you can get together a group of lvl 40+ with yourself at level 30 with the quest for the whirlwind axe, levels 30-40 will be a fucking breeze. Every dungeon with a decent group is a boost for you. Anyone questing with you makes your life much, much easier.
---
You can't drink potions in form, but in classic you can use a macro that shifts you out of form, uses a potion and shifts you right back into form. The form change isn't even visible. This is possible because using a potion doesn't trigger the global cool down.
---
Hopefully people will actually use the meeting stones this time around. The only reason they were a failure was because no one ever fucking used them.

It's amazing isn't it?
---
I know that all to well! That’s how I ended up with every 2 of every class max on ESO. I only play 2 out of 12 characters I have lmao. Such a waste of time.
---
Thanks fellow Druid, your skills have not gone to waste.
---
French Canadians are a tiny minority and many of them have native level english.
---
Sounds like the best of both worlds - either thisor maybe roll a druid.
---
Closed
---
This is why I subconsciously rolled a Rogue this time.. I now remember all the times I needed to lockpick something.
---
Yeah I know,  but just about every meme in the past few days that has made it to the top of this subreddit has been "Low-effort". All I am advocating for is few days of "low-effort" memes every now and again.
---
Yep. That's why I'm going for a PVE heavy mix of playtime. So I can get have a high priority for loot in my raid and get gorged on good shit.

I would understand it more on release, but it isn't like everyone rolling one doesn't already know it sucks. People who roll ret pally either have no knowledge of vanilla or just expect to get carried. Some get really indignant about it, too.
---
I’m not advocating for LFG, the premade finder is great for people wanting to crest their own groups, and that’s why I believe it’s so important.
---
Every server is going to have their own community and vibe. Why would you want the vibe of twitch chat to dominate your large wpvp events? I mean, if that's what you like, go for it... but most adults can't stand that. The average age of this playerbase is too old for streamers and their fans.

Good question - I'm not sure. The way we've been exchanging names is to have both players on the character creation screen. The recipient gets their character and name ready and spams the accept button while the other person deletes their original character. As long as both players can log in and create a character it should work.
---
New Reddit, no adblock. You live an extraordinary life.
---
It’s literally a kill on sight listing, and they’ll camp you. This is perfectly acceptable on pvp servers and does not constitute harassment.
---
Harassment is a broad term and in many cases hard to prove. Blizzard will NOT use anything from a 3rd party platform, as info can easily be faked.
---
now thats a low-effort meme of the day
---
You’re actually wrong here. Agility beats str until you’re crit capped which will be never while leveling. Attack power doesn’t raise your dps as significantly as crit does. Especially on the short fights you have while leveling. And you get dodge which helps too and armor in bear.

At least I got Nymeria, though, which if you've read Game of Thrones, is a fucking badass name for a female rogue or warrior.
---
The appeal is getting gear for PvP, or just getting to see some content without spending the money on respecing to Holy.
---
It's very possible that they will today, once NA employees are at work.
---
Well how aboot that.
---
There’s no EU streamer big enough to influence a server
---
just people living in the moment

In on this. Comment to save

Addons I'd like to see: Healbot, bigwigs, prat, postal, recount, move anything. Some of these were in development but were broken on the stress test.
---
&gt; Fairbanks is pacific, so not dealing with that lag.
---
You will not experience any significant lag playing on a west coast server as an east coaster.
---
I'm gonna, I'll never forget this.
---
I remember playing against waaaay too many holy pala/holy pala 2s teams in work.
---
Druids should technically always be hybrid Resto outside of Raids, so a balance spec would look something like 29/11/11, which is quite good.
---
It feels kind of like they don't expect any new people to show up on the 26/7th.
---
Funny that all the realms are named after shit bosses and even the naxx ones are the two easiest loot pinatas.
---
I wanted to play on Gothik or CThun haha
---
Stuck between warlock,mage, and druid. I have never played wow before so I haven't played any of these myself. I'm going to play alliance on a pvp realm. 
---
My main question is which of these feels the smoothest to play? Which of these kits just flows well. I want to play warlock because they are unique and look cool plus on alliance I will be highly desired. I want to play mage because it looks really smooth but it's also like the most popular class. Druid looks really cool and smooth in its base form but I kind of dont like the way the animal forms look, how often will you be in them?
---
I've mostly had good experiences with people of other languages in games. It's always surprising to me how many speak English compared to how many Americans I know that can actually speak another language despite so many of us having to take language courses in school.
---
I think in general it's a unique experience to run into them and so the bad ones really stick out that much more. A bad experience with people of your own language just feels like a normal Tuesday reset lol.
---
Only 4 guilds, though.
---
Wow, you're gonna fit right in here lmao. In retail nearly everyone has maxes of nearly every class just like you lol.
---
No one will stop you. Because of the.... implication.....
---
This would traditionally be removed under rule 7. However I like it.
---
I still remember running rogue/disc twos when i got my DBW. did so much damage.
---
Secondeded
---
Sounds like you will be happier playing retail, which is fine. I’ll be stoked to be in classic, long travel times and all. The game feels big, takes time to do everything, and therefore when you accomplish goals it feels meaningful
---
My first character (druid) as a 12 year old with poor english skills took around 13 days if I recall correctly, I think the general consensus if you're familiar with WoW is roughly 10 days to hit 60 if you play casually
---
Keep saying this even into month 3 with layering and the top guilds running around flasked 24/7
---
so you're just going to ignore what I said and continue trying to prove some stupid point that no one has any factual info on. Sounds about right lol
---
TeamSpeak!!!!
---
Do you like furries?
---
Sorry for the shit post.
---
My PSA: never use chat on Faerlina.
---
It's not the streamers we have a problem with. It's the people who follow them in-game. It's people like you who just don't get it.
---
You are not "making a name for yourself". Nobody wants you there, doing what you're doing. The streamer himself doesn't want you there. You ruin the game for the streamer, and you ruin the game for everybody else playing that server.
---
Stream snipers lack this social awareness that leads them to not see what is wrong with their behavior. Nothing you do provides a benefit to anybody. It's a net negative for everyone but yourself.
---
Hold up, because you might have autism. Let me make this real clear for you.
---
*This* 👏🏼 *Is* 👏🏼 *A* 👏🏼 *Video* 👏🏼 *Game*

what? time zones are not indicative of server location?

You would like it expanded? Or what are you suggesting. As far as losing data, if you did you could simply ask another officer to broadcast it back to you.

- It encourages people to join groups without talking to each other
---
- You'll be playing with people you dont know in any way
---
- After you're done playing with them you will just leave right away and re-enter a queue because its most efficient 
---
- There is no social expectations in these groups because unlike in guild groups and friendly "i know a guy" invites you have no pre-existing social value with the people you are grouping with
---
- The thing that made vanilla dungeons fun was that you did them with friends. The actual content itself is not really that different from retail content.
---
Only for shitty players.
---
i can imagine that some people getting mad over something like this real quickly and we know how things end if things get ugly in 2019.
---
Also lets take the taurens for example.. they are "cows" but they look like humanoid cows.. Pandas as just pandas. Im all for diversity and i respect everyones likings but for me the pandas just do not fit. Also i hate asian aesthetics in games.. so maybe thats a thing for me
---
Very nice stuff!

But as far as I remember, Scholomance door can be lockpicked too.

I like how this sub is simultaneously complaining of there still not being enough servers to sustain the population and that one server might end up dead.
---
It won't. All we have so far is data from those willing to sign up early. Huge amounts will come for launch and after filling Ghennas up as well. All 3 will be heaving. Wouldn't be surprised if more get released at a later date
---
&gt;  The loot system got fucked when they introduced tokens.
---
Tokens were in vanilla, if you mean raid bosses dropping a coupon that you traded in for the specific item you wanted for your class.
---
They won’t even make up the majority of the server lmao.
---
No Boomkin? Meh.
---
Jokes aside, nice sheet.
---
I remember almost winning a 1v1 world pvp match with The Stoppable Force. Not The Unstoppable Force, but the grey 2-handed mace called The Stoppable Force.
---
Those would've been cool names. I didn't even know who Grobbulus was before this.
---
Hey, I have a lot more faith in Classic than Blizzard apparently, they didn't even want German, French or RPPVP servers until the outcry.
---
1 or 2 more EU PVP servers and a Spanish/Italian language realm would have been great. But seeing as not even the entirety of Latin and south America get a server I'm doubtful.
---
There will be another surprise pikachu come release when the fuckton of players who didn't care to pay for a name reservation show up.
---
What fucking streamers? So few on EU why bother?
---
&gt;Streamers organizing community events is a major positive. You'll get no argument from me on that point.
---
Even then. It's 2019. Each realm will have a subreddit or forum for organizing things like this.
---
Are the PVP ranks crossrealm as well?
---
I love the grind, but I’m definitely in need of something new to grind on, so this is perfect for me.
---
I can’t believe they screwed that part and allowed layer hopping.
---
It would’ve been *so* easy from a technical perspective to lock to layer. Let friends choose layer and coordinate, done.
---
Allowing layer hopping is mind boggling. Who is the guy at Blizzard who believed it was necessary to allow layer hopping, at the expense of immersion (the fabric of wow)?
---
Whoever that guy is fucked the experience up for everyone.
---
99% of ppl don't have a problem with the streamer themselves, they have a problem with their followers like you. Yes there will be spam on all realms but nobody wants to hear twitch chat pogger shit. Want to be the scarab Lord? Too bad a streamer has way more resources cuz ppl like you funnel them gold and items. Want to kill a work boss? Too bad ppl like you will surround the streamer and make sure they get the kill. Want to make a name for yourself on a server? Too bad the streamer is going to overshadow you. Want to kill a steamer out in the open world? Guess what now your blacklisted. Want to login? Guess what 2hr ques. Want to quest in a contested zone? Too bad a streamer and his thousand cronnies also happen to be in that zone.  So no it will not be an authentic classic experience. Except maybe the ques.
---
I don't see how ILvl or IO score could work in classic could you explain?
---
Same. My group of 10-ish friends are probably rolling there. Just want to get away from the super tryhard guilds and the people who all roll on one server because they share a nationality. "Scandinavian server", "Spanish server" - i'd rather just play on a normal server for normal people, not some nationalistic server full of people who care way too much about the game.

Thanks, fixed

---
In my opinion, world PvP is a crucial and irreplaceable part of the WoW experience. It provides a type of experience that can't be had elsewhere in the game. Locking yourself out of that is a mistake.

Can we get any more of those NA EST servers?
---
too bad NA is where it's at
---
Ill link via PM
---
Its no more pointless then streaming any other new game.
---
Besides if your primary concern is how many viewers you will have then I can assure you you're not cut out for streaming.
---
I figured as much, however I can't really find any official rules for RP servers either. It's all from deleted websites and archived content, or forum posts made by regular players.
---
In terms of seeing how the realms are looking you can log into the Classic client and it will show populations of each realm per character.  i.e. a lot of folks (including myself) created all three characters on the same server so it will count each one.  Some other pops where they show lower means fewer characters made there.
---
It's fairly obvious what the plan is when they let in many large streamers and a fuck load of their followers/fans.
---
Wow cool others got in, but that wasn't actually the point of it. It's definitely for the mass advertising.
---
Oh look guys it's one of the "I want it easy" gang
---
All the realms are gonna be packed. Finding a group will only be an issue for ret palas.
---
Why will it be closer vanilla experience? Ive played ps*rver for years but just wondering ty
---
If you join Herod you’ll have a pretty good chance at being a streamer. We are fresh out of em! XD
---
Ive also been looking for something like this.  100% with you, OP.  I dont mind exploring different areas to find the quests, etc.  Hell, even if it only showed when i was within 30 yards of someone i'd be fine with it.
---
Im just kind of worried about missing some important quest because the quest giver is hiding in some obscure room of a house, or theres a big nelf standing in front of them or something.
---
"Warlod" for onyxia attunement bit. i'm assuming that should be warlord?
---
This is great!  Can’t wait to see the rest
---
Because it's always easier to start small and add versus start big and delete
---
hi I'm gustav
---
I'm doing a BM hunter too, powerful in PvP or so I heard. Frost mage called Freezus for my Horde character.

Has anyone tried/compared leveling addons? I used Azeroth Auto Pilot during the stress test and enjoyed it but as of right now it only goes up to level 40.
---
The first month before everyone who just jumped on the hype train bails is going to be rough.
---
disc rogue or spriest rogue is what I regretted never playing in tbc.  if we get a tbc recreation I'm definitely playing that.  I played a resto druid in tbc and resto druids were obviously insanely good but anytime I fought a disc/rogue or spriest/rogue it felt like they were having all the fun even if they lost.  also pmr
---
druids playstyle in tbc is fucking lethargic
---
I dont believe so, Mounts in classic are "rare" You can only get your races mounts unless you get your reputation high with the other races then you can buy theirs as well. There are a few specific examples of other mounts you CAN get but are hard to come by. I dont actually know how you would get most of them, but an example would be the Winterspring Tiger. Night Elfs have Tiger mounts, but Winterspring (a specific zone in game) can drop the extremely rare Tiger mount. And the raid Zul'Gurub has "battle tank" mounts you can ride within the instance. But those are the few I know of, I believe the Amani Bear mount may be in classic but I'm not entirely sure if it is or how you would get it. But I know on retail its a rare mount people freak about if you have the original and not the rerelase.
---
I like pvp but I see no joy in getting ganked 1v5 so I'm going mirage raceway pve where I'll do plenty of pvp but only when I want to.
---
Yeah thinking about it. I was gonna roll on a PvP server but looking back at some of the private servers I think after a while, they may become exceedingly ganky.
---
That's just gonna be a pain in the arse for new or casual toons. Especially when phase 2 hits. You're gonna die a heck of a lot if you're still levelling at that point.
---
Hey I don't go make burgers where you work and tell you how to make burgers!
---
Yeah, best to find an enchanter, or just be one. The time required to farm the linen cloth needed to get a lesser magic wand is not very much, and it will accelerate your questing greatly.
---
Who ever got “biggie” on Fairbanks, down to make a trade? 
---
I got “crocodile”
---
I don't understand the risk of switching realms when the game isn't even out yet. What possible ties do you have to Golemagg that you and your guild can't pick Gehennas instead?
---
I understand the name reservation risk but at this point that's pretty low since everyone's already taken the names they want. So you can just delete your character on Golemagg and create the same one on Gehennas, no?
---
offering "Spellcheck"
---
Clickbait is clickbait
---
It will never be the same, discord exists for example. Good luck getting in my group if you don’t have discord(for example not literally)
---
The premade finder still encourages whispering leaders with what you provide to the group, there is more of a reason to communicate than retail considering the abscene of ilvl and achievements etc.
---
I'd rather not start with the "pls link achievement" to get invited
---
I didn't play wow during MoP but I remember thinking "Wow this is fucking stupid." when the expansion was announced. WoW has always been humans vs orcs at its core. BC? Humans vs orcs with some shit from the orc realm thrown in. Wotlk? Humans vs orcs with some drama from the human world thrown in. Cata? Some shit from the battlefield of humans vs orcs. The xtra races introduced in the expansions wer just tehre to either help the humans or orcs.
---
Then MoP comes a long and the humans and orcs have to stop fighting to pay attention to pandas for some stupid reason. The entire expansion was about them and the whole horde vs alliance conflict kinda took a backseat. This shit was so jarring.
---
It's quite silly ;P i have a 144hz screen myself, but it's only 1980x1080. My rig is strong enough to decently run at least 2k, so i feel bottlenecked with my screen also.
---
Instant teleportation everywhere is akin to a lobby game through, not an open world RPG. If that's how people prefer to play that's fine, however for a large portion of the playerbase, having a relevant and challenging world to engage with is important.
---
I would still say you’ve got a great deal worked out my friend I would be super grateful!
---
No.  The drain soul puts up a debuff 
---
If it's up when the mob dies you get a soul shard
---
The possibility of having less layers on the new server is tempting me
---
That's basically it. You also get the bop robes that are bis up until aq/naxx so those are pretty huge. You've got mooncloth crafting too for some extra side gold.
---
On the other hand, alchemy is a good if not the best money maker profession imo. Consumables are always needed. Others might disagree but I'd say that it's up to personal preference on what you want out of your professions. 
---
Personally I'm going with tailoring/enchanting on my mage.
---
Lmao this nerd gave himself silver
---
I have an inbox message that says I was anonymously given a silver 4 mins after my post.  Do I need to validate it to you by sending you the screenshot in a pm?  Will gladly do so.  
---
I have better and more valuable posts than this one, sorry that this culture is too toxic for you to believe a user.  
---
Also, can mods see who gave it?  That may persuade you
---
I've gotta ask, how does the 3 monitor system work, especially in regard to linking them all together, and wouldn't it be too wide? Why not just use a big TV?

You won't be allowed to use curse of doom

I guess you haven't raided vanilla since back in the day?
---
Yeah, herod def won't die. It will be the bulletproof server for sure. I'm just overly concerned it won't  bottom out as much and be overcrowded. Seems like 75% of the community, the type that won't drop off, have chosen herod. If given the choice, I'd rather end up at the end of the day in a nice medium pop, that sweet spot with plenty of ppl but not ridic queue times.
---
Guarantee I will have a way better geared character than you. 
---
It’s not a a matter of ease, it’s a matter of logic and growth.
---
I'm not 100% sure, but I heard that you could ask the Customers service for changing a region. If I'm right - it's impossible to play in different regions in one time.
---
Why when phase 2 hits? What happens?
---
The "durid" thing is probably a reference to Alamo, and old Druid poster from the forums. We was famous for his whacky spelling errors. I have a coworker that refuses to pronounce "druid" correctly because of Alamo...
---
No doubt, its advertising. But it isn't just streamers that got into beta. That's just salt thinking that. I would have loved to beta, I did beta back in the olden times and it was great.
---
A shit load of the people coming in the future will be pve over pvp.
---
But it could always be better
---
Lmao.
---
And casting animation.
---
This is amazing! Aaaah!
---
Please don’t encourage those salty teenagers to roll on our precious RP realms..
---
You've got that one backwards. Blizzard has consistently been making improvements. Their customers have started whining and bitching about everything pre-emptively, and whine and bitch even more if Blizzard ever says something that turns out to be wrong. Therefore Blizzard can't communicate things early in good faith because it will be worse for them than if they stayed silent. So the community keeps whining and bitching.
---
If you think they added a server for any reason other than their metrics said they'd be able to support another server you're a naive fool. Blizzard is not your mom in the grocery store when you were 5. You do not get your way with a large company by yelling and screaming.
---
Could you do one for the EU ones please?
---
I agree, 3 or 4 would be starting small. 2 was NEVER going to be enough.
---
I mean they could've released 1 server to start with to "start small" but that'd be even more stupid.
---
Funny the amount of stink players were giving not having RP PVP realms and now they are deserted, was a pretty vocal minority.
---
You can play pvp as long as you're on a pvp server, but it should be noted that they won't add the "honor" system until phase 2 which will be in 2-5 months? Idk if they have announced that yet. So you'll be only doing it for fun or to be a dick, depending on the area. You won't get honor, ranks or any of that nonsense 'til then. 
---
You can level a warrior if you want but unless you team up with other people you're gonna get bullied while leveling in contested areas. By phase 3 (so BWL) you'll definitely want an arms warrior in your raid for that mortal strike on pesky healing mobs &amp; bosses, so depending on the connections you make you might be able to get yourself a raidspot.
---
Are cast times and casting interrupts a thing in ESO because theyre very relevant in Wow lol.
---
Ork shaman named Wurrzag and Ork Hunter named Gorkamorka. I play way to much TW Warhammer 2.
---
With no sit macro crit thing working 2?
---
"Low" just means low compared to the high pops. We have no hard data on numbers, a "low" pop could still mean 40,000 players right now for all we know.
---
Most bosses are just curse and spam shadowbolt
---
For trash you will be using hellfire/rain of fire for aoe packs and sometimes use rank 1 banish on assigned targets
---

---
Once an hour?

Unless the DK played that shadowfrost spec where you just spam icy touch and it did the same damage as scourge strike. Sadly it got nerfed quite fast :'D
---
Nah bruh, it's all about the rank 1 ES spam to get them procs.
---
What about having big tits? Does that still work in 2019?
---
Trying to cap a node in AB from a Ret pally, hah!
---
Lmao yes you are correct it is now 2019 and I play on a i9 and 1080ti it won't be the same in a lot of ways, but there are some it can remain the same, and one of those is no LFG!
---
&gt;Good luck getting in my group if you don’t have discord
---
Lol I think I'll be alright but thanks for your concern.. 
---
Hopefully LFG or premade whatever never gets added and people like you can just either keep complaining, quit, or stop complaining and just play . A man can hope. :) 
---
No changes woooooo
---
Already talked to my wife. She understands.
---
-Wife aggro nerfed by 90%
---
Roll
---
Secondededed.
---
Playing on a PVP server isn’t the only way to get PvP though. Some people want the PvE and PvP separate so they can do those when they are ready, and not be set upon by gank squads and not being able to do their PvE during their playtime.
---
During Vanilla a lot of PvE servers had healthy PvP in open world and battlegrounds. Not sure how it will be this time around though. Time will tell
---
There will be guilds raiding at all times. Ping difference is negligible. No need to pick one based on est vs pst
---
Starting to dip into addon development, are there any addons that don’t exist yet that you’d like to see? Trying to come up with some small project ideas
---
"Theres a reason retail has become what it is over time."  no one is playing retail, it has like a couple thousand online blizzard hides sub numbers the past few xpacs. no one has expectations from retail because the few that do play it hate the shit out of it.
---
Because? Is it forbidden to name your character after a disease?
---
Oh man I forgot about all of this. I love classic so much!
---
If you've got time constraints I say go Lock. This will allow you a faster/easier leveling experience while still providing you with an excellent caster in both end game PvE and PvP.
---
Mages are still awesome too though. :)
---
is that a thalnos discort? can someone throw me an invite?
---
me and all my friends are NA and playing on Thalnos. So I cant give you any definite numbers but at least 10 Tampons (people from tampa)
---
Weird, I was using domino during the stress test and assigned all my keybinding with it and no issue. Maybe you need to update the addon?
---
I know, you cult members love your propaganda memes. Dumber than rocks too.
---
I'm so excited to do these again!
---
Fucking Youtube copyright system
---
Classic WoW. Classic wow is the perfect end. Part of that end also includes not having people with flying mounts and using actual money to buy rare unicorn mounts or whatever aesthetic atrocities that have been going on for the past decade.
---
So classes like mage and warlock are primarily using abilities with cast times to do their real damage, and interrupting stops them from being able to use spells from that spell type for a few seconds. IE "frost locked" for a frost mage etc. So which abilities you wanna kick(interrupt) are kinda important. Every class has an interrupt so you know its pretty relevant. But being frost locked as a frost mage is tragic at that point all you can do is run and use a fire instant cast basically lmao. Because of this little mini game people are playing casters "stop cast" a lot to bait out your interrupt and make you waste it.
---
ICC had some damn good fights in it and I liked it better than ulduar...although sunwell is still the goat in my book.
---
IMO if they add anything to classic, it should only be content and not mechanics, systems, or levels.  I want to play the classic game system, not relive the expansion and game changes from 2004-2018.
---
You’re awesome! Thanks!

Gamers need to rise up
---
They still want to distribute overall population across available servers and avoid 10k+ concurrent users once layer is slated to be removed.  It’s more of a move to facilitate that and not about the technological limits of layer.
---
Yeah and look at the drop off after Wrath and Cata. I'm not saying all of them were bad but they opened the compromise gate way to much and they couldn't close it again because they got use to giving in. 
---
I hate to draw this into it cause it's a good and bad thing but if they had kept wow at BC or Wrath difficulty we wouldn't need classic but because of all of the difficulty changes and "here you go" addons we have classic.
---
Back in vanilla i was Troll Hunter. I like trolls and my damage output was very high.

The key unlocks the entrance/front door to the Scarlet Bastion in the Living part of Strat.

Yeah I know, married with 2 kids. My brother and I found another duo we clicked with immediately and gamed with them from probably 9-16 til we all started going separate ways, so it's cool to play with one of them again and my brother. I usually play games alone now a days so it'll be a nice change of pace
---
We're going to be on Herod
---
While I don't know about that, what I think a lot of people forget is how much bigger these classic realms will be compared to the old vanilla realms. While I could see the older realms being dominated by specific language groups, I can't see these mega servers with laying being too badly affected.
---
Of course this post could age like milk in a few months.
---
holy sh*t!!!
---
also, can you link the disc server please?
---
Because it's not necessary? They allow the use of addons so people can customize their experience. If this is valuable to you than go for it. The rest of us are fine with good ol' whispering.

I would like to add that you can increase the odds of getting lucky enough to hit a critical mass of followers by having a unique gimmick of some kind.

IE If all the top streamers are Warriors/Rogues/Mages and you are playing an enhancement shaman at a high level you could garner a small enough following to build steam based on playing something uncommon.

I haven't played classic personally, but i'll play with friends who have, excited to check it out!
---
Yes thats what i also read from an interview with blizzard developers. But i mean i hope if they release those legacy servers for expansions they will keep the mechanics from classic i mean take BfA. It has really cool dungeon and raid entrences but no one barely uses it except for guild raids :/
---
That's a good theory. I can imagine them spitballing what to do with WoW2 and they needed to find out if they made a huge mistake in the direction of Retail....and someone says why don't we give them Classic/TBC/WOTLK servers and find out?
---
There are looking for group chat channels you can join!
---
So mean! This is how you treat dumb people?
---
But you will most likely enjoy the addition...
---
Is it true that the new Classic API will not allow spells to be cast from within an addon?  This means addons like PallyPower will not work anymore, at least not in the way we were used to.
---
Well I just had an interesting idea which is quite appealing, but comes with a bundle of issues.
---
Keep WoW Classic the way it is, but still release the expansions in a similar way to the WoW Classic release. Eventually they'd end up with every expansion playable, and an extremely divided player-base. They could scale servers down accordingly to bundle up the community a bit, but that doesn't necessarily solve the problem as far as I can tell.
---
Oh yer that's totally doable. I thought you meant record the whole process.
---
Thank you for admitting to you being apart of the "I want it easier" gang. It's nice to know you can atleast admit this one fault.
---
I'm wondering if something like this already exists. It sounds like something that might. I'll take a look, in any case. Thanks!
---
Loot council is always the best system, if you are on the Loot council, performing sexual favors for the loot council, have photographic evidence of the loot councils sexual preferences, or you are very late in joining the guild and were specifically recruited to fill a role the loot council has deemed important.
---
Other than that, any other system is better.
---
Omg in top left corner there is an alien😱
---
In fact, i should be able to implement a white list editable only by the leader for that. I'll have a new version on Monday and I'll try to include it in that.
---
It's not that bad i have seen a few but they just talk about adding expansions. What i try to say with this post is should they add the legacy expansion servers or update classic but keep the original vanilla mechanics?
---
Exactly. People forget (or don't know?) that vanilla forced people to be social.
---
I was thinking about that to.. I mained as a rogue my first time around.  Classic is going to be so different as a mage, I can't just stealth wherever I want.
---
God I'm excited.

I had to type /bartender and not /bar to get it to come up

If you're looking for some good YouTubers, [MadSeason](https://www.youtube.com/user/madseasonshow) is my favourite. But also check out WillE too.
---
Because you risk not having the more hardcore type crowd that flooded the first 2 servers
---
Atleast there is no fucking brazilians
---
What should I roll if I like to play a supportive class but not a healer? 
---
And in the sense of support I mean that mage can be seen as a support because of all the cc and buff, warlock with summon, curse, healthstone or hunter with tranq shot and misdirect 🤔 
---
No clue if you can help me but every bit of help would be great! :) And I will be rolling horde!
---
Better open up some more german servers, the 2 they provided are already "full".
---
Currently the way I've seen rogues handle it is to use the /stopwatch 25 /stopwatch play in their cheapshot/kidneyshot macros.
---
Just buff everyone everything. On the beta and buffed everyone water-breathing and detect-invisibility all the time.
---
So, at this point I'm pretty sure I'm going Paladin. Trying to decide whether I want to be human or dwarf; right now I'm learning towards Dwarf, because why not. Hmmmm. As someone that will be Holy with a Prot Offspec (what I'm shooting for, at least), I think that it would be a little better.
---
If I stay horde and go Shaman, both Orc and Trolls have their bonuses in the racial.
---
Well maybe don't disrupt RP and corpsecamp and people won't harass you with the report button.
---
Do for a paladin!
---
All the triggered retail players are terrified their shit game is going to die faster than it already is after incessantly claiming Classic is going to die after a week or two. The irony
---
I wouldn't mind switching, I just don't have the power to drag an entire guild with me
---
I said this when I heard about wow classic initially lol.
---
Yes, you are the perfect demographic for Classic WoW
---
Cool name, don't let anybody talk you out of that, it's a real loss. Sorry
---
&gt;A. At the beginning of the raid 7 members will be selected at random to form the "Loot Council"
---
LOL
---
anyway gold dkp is good
---
They don’t like either of those things. Go ahead, ask em.
---
Not enough Horde
---
The the Horde is about being beast and fucking shit up, not being a little nancy fairyboy, that's all I'm saying.
---
Ah, living the dream I see.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX7ehxyYRQc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX7ehxyYRQc)
---
I'm stuck between Warlock and Warrior because I want to be desirable in raids and also have a potential to DPS. I wouldn't mind tanking, but I imagine there will be enough tanks in raids already and it's not my focus. 
---
The other problem is I don't know what faction to play, if it's horde it's Orc for either class, Alliance would be Gnome Warlock or Human Warrior.
---
My former main was Orc Warlock, so I'm torn between doing exact the same thing and trying something different in faction and class (I've had a druid in other expansions and loved it but I don't really want to be forced to heal). I'm planning on being on a PvP server and would occasionally do BG's but not frequently.
---
If it's something that was checked from beta streams it was noted on the graphics. Mostly just chest spawns. It's all data gathered from vanilla + vanilla zones in tbc, wotlk, and cata.
---
Of course lol, you just won't get your first pick at names for your character
---
LFM LBRS Gems Reserved
---
I was able to snag the name "Slippery John".  
---
From Yahtzee Crowshaws book "Mogworld".  Funny book, funnier rogue.
---
door to strat living quarter
---
I see this as a plus ^^
---
I'm having to make the same choice here (i'm also rolling an alliance mage). Here is the way I see it: 
---
If you're rolling to primarily PVE I'd recommend rolling human. The main reason why is that the reputation gain perk will cut down on a lot of your timely reputation grinds for raiding. In addition to this, 5% int is fairly negligible overall. 
---
If you're playing mage for PvP i'd recommend rolling Gnome simply for escape artist. EA is a 1 min CD in vanilla, absolutely busted racial. As far as PVE goes, technically gnomes have a very very slight dmg advantage but it's not much.
---
Both options on ally have their perks, i'm rolling Gnome for escape artist though. Perception is also a neat bonus, but less important for mages due to being able to spam rank 1 arcane explosion against rogues. Just my two cents.
---
Show me your logs, prove you don’t suck at this game.
---
yeah someone already mentioned, its 280! ill fix it but maybe dont want to reupload again lol
---
Well after launch there's going to be people looking for streamers from their own server of choice.  If anything I think the viewers could spread a bit from the big names down to smaller streamers.
---
Death knights were shit in WoTLK. Do you not remember their weird talent system that did NOT make sense for tanking? 
---
Somehow prot. Paladins were freaking incredible and unstoppable.  I remember specifically this one time, 8 people in orgrimmar were trying to kill 1 prot paladin that was invading. For like 30 freaking mins.
---
But paladins wrecked deathknight back then.
---
Beta is up again?
---
I would recommend a PVP server anyway, even if you don't engage in a lot of PVP. 
---
I will be playing resto druid (horde) on Shazzrah so if you're on my server, i will be Moikee. Happy to help you out in-game with dungeons, gear etc.
---
I was very interested in making either a Troll, Orc or Night Elf
---
why don't you just taunt......oh wait
---
Oo this is cool.  I'd love to see a mage leveling build done on here, if anyone has the knowledge and time?
---
Dude something this structured barely works in most guilds that communicate properly. 
---
This will never work in a PUG, ever. You'll get dozens of DCs out of rage, you'll probably not even get 40 people to agree to random loot councils every raid, thats fucked.
---
Some good ideas in there but this will never work with a pug.
---

Also if you ever get really good at the dual box you could Rain of Fire with your blizzard to really increase your AOE potential.
---
Maybe you have it set right, but everyone I've run into who said the same thing had the same problems.
---
CET/CEST is the best cuz that is the time your clock and servertime shows
---
Lol. The Classic experience is similar. But it's not going to be the experience I remeber. To many people taking the game to seriously now. This subreddit is so hyped but at the same time it just feels like a lot of people lost what made wow great back in the day.
---
Logging on, picking the class you want to play, raiding? what's that? I've been level 52 for 5 months enjoying the game yadada 
---
Now it's just up guys race to 60 and raiding herder.
---
That's not the vanilla experience at all.
---
Oh God, is that really him? I remember loving his videos a few years ago.
---
Blizzard's going to drip them in as needed. It's better in the long run to start with 4 full servers instead of 7 medium-low and 1 full

Yeah, my B, had a brain fart
---
I still have all the NR gear on my rogue, don't have the heart to delete it all
---
Twitch app by default tends to install the latest retail version, so you need to select the specific version that is tagged for classic, which often has classic in the name, and/or is tagged with game version 1.3.2

Yeah I want to roll PvP for the classic experience again but I don't have half the time I did back then so...
---
he thinks hes gonna wear plate as a holy pally lol
---
Actually, he's not...
---
I think there is one called 5 second rule.
---
Why does this have silver?
---
Really?!
---
I have a frost mage names Drchillsgood on another server.  He’s as old as vanilla though.
---
\^\^
---
My schedule won't change. I play about 2 hours of games a night, have been with my wife for 9 years since high school. She is a keeper so I am all set lol
---
Every healer can heal dungeons without any talents at all.
---
How much wanding will I do while leveling?
---
If you want to level fast? Virtually the entire time.
---
Lmao what isn't toxic to you buddy
---
Not playing on streamer server either lmfao. Like I said. They’re gonna add more servers. Only hardcore players subbed to reserve a name. Majority have not. The servers have to expand. And if they don’t fuck it. I’ll play in Fairbanks. Seems like a chill server. 
---
Also... dude. Lay-off the roids. You really don’t have to be so angry all the time. Your body is fine how it is. You don’t have to subject yourself to dangerous chemicals to feel good about yourself. Get help.
---
You have the wrong version. Do not use twitch to install addons, it does not yet support classic. https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bartender4/files/2759074 is the latest classic version
---
Often enough you get an upgrade and its not the same weapon type as what you're currently wielding.
---
...if you actually think death knights were shit in WoTLK i dont know what to say. You must have been in some weird alternate reality dude, they were monsters.
---
Annnnd thats why you dont do loot council in raids. Just terrible rule set you have built there.
---
Yeah the biggest gripe I have with lfr and lfg is that its automatic. It would have been a bit better if you couldn't have just steamrolled every damn boss cause that would have forced communication. Buts it a list on compounding factors at this point that made the game meh.
---
 I'm not gonna lie I enjoyed BFA's sectioned off story but I didn't like that I didn't have to understand what was going on like i was lost as fuck cause I only needed to do 2 areas with minor instance grinding to hit cap. Story IS important and right now it's just there I want a mash up honestly of ff14/wow were its mandated to continue to an extent. 
---
Idk my wish falls into that cascade effect also *shrugs*
---
single men
---
All hail the Scarab Lord!
---
Is it too radical to suggest just using the TV as a TV? 
---
Also, you don't need a 2nd screen to Tab out and do other things while you fly around. You only need the willingness to run back from the GY if necessary.
---
Yeah, they settled on a destination first and then never really seemed to justify why we even went there. TBC was peak murder hobo
---
I wish OP would stop golding himself and give gold to me

So it’s pick and choose like CC break. That’s great to know.
---
I would say paladin due to survivability, mobility, and you have that theme of magic and reviving. 
---
A enchanment shaman with hand of rag will give you this too. 
---
For non-faction specific the shadow priest. 
---
Im playing a warrior so one of this is bias, but I have played league since 20011 and wow aince 2006/7.
---
What a man child.
---
In what world is 4 half of 11? Lmao
---
In a couple months WoW will lose 50% of the people who came back. This is a time sink and the majority of people playing have full time jobs
---
That's never gonna happen. No way Blizzard just "remakes" all the old games right? 
---
This classic seems to just be a "quick" way to get a bunch of more subs from people who were never gonna play again
---
I have no idea. His  father probably gave him a reward.
---
Except player characters don't count and aren't considered canon.
---
Sooooo....
---
Tbh, this is a smart approach, start with a very low amount of realms and just add realms until content.
---
I've only got one thing to contribute for all of your questions, but I think it is significant.  Healers determine who wins or loses in battlegrounds.  If you've got one stubborn healer in your group, you will win over the other group and the other team doesn't, that's a win.
---
What about blep?
---
I’m gonna roll rogue but I like up close and personal melee. Mages def seem like an “easier” class. Portals, polymorph, food/water, etc.
---
does that lighting behind the monitor hurt your eyes?
---
K.
---
"If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball"

Yeah we know, you said all this 15 years ago and it was boring then too

Please don’t discourage people from rolling on that server.  If it becomes a joke they’re going to flood out of there into other servers.

I'm actually leaning toward glob. Do you have rp server experience, by chance? My friend and I are hoping the community is less toxic and progression might be a bit slower, so we can smell the roses and not fall behind. Plus, being around all of that rp will make the world feel more engaging.
---
So you're saying retail players don't use reddit as a media at all and only classic players are? Like I've mentioned, this is not based on currently viewing but which community has the most accounts that are active on reddit.

Exactly

ok... good for you...
---
Don’t care virgin
---
with 100 answers so basically ... mean almost nothing
---
Ouu, so you’re saying someone out there is actually stupid enough to spend money on reddit to give out gold and platnium?
---
I mean, level 1 takes like 30 sec to do so if anything you’ll gain 2sec?
---
The pitchforks are real in this thread haha
---
It’s what vanilla is today , which isn’t better or worse than 2005. I was here for both
---
Highjacking this to say that the mods are way way over moderating  I appreciate that they take their time I really do but it's getting a bit silly. 
---
I understand the need to remove some posts that are not inline with rules. But to remove like 95% of posts is not necessary. 
---
There was plenty of interesting discussions going on in some of those posts. It won't clutter the front page anyway because it will stay at low ratings so why the crazy mass murder of posts?
---
It stifles discussion for no good reason.
---
Mage is better in every way except one: Trolling people in WPvP.
---
I realize you're just trying to help, so I want you to take this as genuine critical feedback that's trying to help you improve: this is borderline unreadable. Using blurred images from the zone as the backdrop makes the text extremely difficult to read, especially at a glance or on mobile. There's a reason most good info graphics use flat color backgrounds. They're meant to be a quick reference that doesn't take much effort to decipher or understand. Busy graphics distract you and make things harder to read.
---
After 7 years of playing Horde, I almost rolled on alliance purely for Shadowmeld. NE Priests have crap racials, but Shadowmel + MC in PVP is ungodly OP and I know it would be ungodly fun.
---
thats a good name
---
Got a good laugh. Well done sir, well done.
---
Did a google search and found something similar. This one should work :)
---
rip
---
Tactics, is the quests for the troll area there in hinterlands? With the 10 blood, the key quest, different bones and so on?
---
There will be holiday events, just not this one.
---
why should people join a dead server? Shazzrah number 1 so there is no other option!
---
Seeing a friend run a dungeon in MoP is the moment it "clicked" for me that I'd never be coming back to wow.  Sure, the gameplay seemed OK, but the setting of a dungeon with a bunch of carrot juice barfing rabbit-men?  I'm fucking out.  The whole setting became a joke to me.  Sure vanilla/tbc/wotlk had their "silly" moments, but they were sparse.  An entire dungeon built out of drunk bunnies hopping around like it's an easter brewfest killed the vibe for me.
---
Sample sizes.
---
yeah those are some of the reasons my guild is going Grobb

players tend to me more chill and a bit more mature

So it's individuals with language barriers instead of groups with language barriers?

lol speak for yourself. Is arena any different from queueing for a bg except that it's smaller scale?
---
firemaw was the dragon boss (not unique i know) that had a ridiculous breath that the whole team had to LOS right?
---
Not your education, the person that implied that 4 is half of 11. Horde is dumb.
---
This is awesome! I won’t be able to do this as well as you, but my goal before launch is to create something like this for my class/race! Thanks for the inspo 😁
---
My Ms on East coast is 30ms. West coast is went up to 70ms. I swear I noticed a small difference but I might be a little sensitive or it's the spell batching.
---
Thanks!  
---
I'm a completionist myself, so no way I'd be willing to spend that gold on just playing time, but it's nice to have an idea of how much money level capped players make.  
---
I'm leveling while waiting for classic, and when I saw the astronomical prices of classic-level crafting mats on AH I was kinda shocked. 3k for a stack of Light leather doesn't seem as astronomical anymore, now that I know there's 2k gold daily quest rewards.
---
We need more servers - change my mind.  
---
It's not nostalgia. It's just a good game.  
---
They said no to classic. We got got classic.
---
Absolutely. Solid gaming cave though. /respect
---
Its because its Grobbulus or Fairbanks so no one cares lol.
---
Yes, especially considering "small" isn't quite the same as it was back then.
---
That looks promising, hope it works as well !
---
Yes.  They are that stupid.  But it was fun watching you all freak out.
---
$5 if you do horde druid
---
$10 if you do horde UD warlock
---
It'll be like 1% of the population. Plus reddit is rolling on Fairbanks lol. You're gonna get a zerg regardless.
---
I’m debating between hunter rogue and Druid. I’ve played those three the most over the years. I love their class fantasies. I like world pvp a lot and will be doing premades too! My best friend is going to play either a hpal or lock. It’s been such a struggle picking!
---
There was an update to Dominos on the last day of the test that made the key rebinding work for me.
---
The words weren't hard to read in any way whatsoever, on desktop or mobile. 10/10 readability. Feels like user error
---
Yup! It is an IMMENSE city
---
I think you can still create characters they are not gonna be locked from my understanding, just to let players know that it probably means that there will be queues
---
This post is culturally insensitive to Horde. You're entering this discussion with a imperialist colonial mindset, assuming that any group of people who consciously choose not to use chairs with seat backs must be doing so because they are savage and unrefined, when indeed they are simply choosing what they prefer and what makes them more comfortable.
---
“If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a boss.”
---
oh I see. I was planning on playing on their realm so now I'm a bit worried. How likely do you think that is? Seems like it will be a very high population realm so can a single guild really have such a big impact? Especially when there is also layering?
---
what the fuck are these shitty ass realm names
---
as if that's positive
---
Funnily enough, in Paris CEST is called either GMT+2 or UTC+2. No one knows what the fuck CEST means here.

For the UBRS key (unadorned seal of ascension) it also requires you to loot 3 different gems from 3 different bosses in LBRS which have a relatively low drop chance for each. Then you combine them with the unadorned seal.
---
Can i play retail and use classic models??
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn haha
---
Yes, and roughly 50% or more of all solo content.  Typically you'll mind blast, swp, and then wand the rest of the fight.  You at least want to be wanding 5 seconds before the kill so that spirit tap kicks in after the 5 second rule.
---
You aren’t wasting half a month of a sub. Whether you sub now or later, you will have 1 month of a sub cost for August. It doesn’t make a difference

Yikes. You right. Everyone who doesn’t use steroids is fat and doesn’t have a partner. Good logic. It’s gonna be weird telling my live in girlfriend that she has to leave me because some boy on the internet says I’m fat and out of luck. 
---
Anyway. Enjoy your server buddy. Was just trying to warn you that Brazilian servers do have downsides. As everyone on the original announcement thread with actual experience in mmos could tell you.
---
id bang fury war
---
you really think people wouldnt wanna go on the most populated server as a way to safeguard themselves from the server being obscure
---
RobertRedfordNod.gif
---
Some people are already recruiting for their guilds on discord or on the forums. Might work for them, might not tbh. 
---
I for myself will choose a server a few hours before release, level quickly to 60 (probably around week ~2) and then start looking for a guild on my server with like minded people. 
---
The chance that the guilds i can join right now dont make it somehow is huge so i dont want to commit yet and wait till people actually start to raid/do endgame stuff.
---
I'm not here to attack your post but if you really want to go there then be my guest  
---
your post isn't a professional rebuttal. the part where you claim to own a web hosting company -- I'm guessing what you really meant is cloud or dedicated hosting -- and leave it out in the open as if it makes the rest of your post more creditworthy, Idk about that. you're saying it's a discussion but your post isn't leaving anything up for discussion because we're to assume what you're saying is right because of your supposed background in infrastructure. 
---
call me a troll all you want if it makes you feel better
---
This is definitely needed but goddamnit Blizzard why did you give us only 24 hours before name reservations? This is not enough time for big guilds to change servers!
---
upvote for cool parent
---
What an irony right?
---
I took off a week get fucked lmaooo
---
Allows you to remove yourself from world PvP encounters at will and removes the risk of world PvP when travelling.
---
My parses do make me a good player, snd I’m not advocating for content to be easier, if anything I want them to make raids harder...
---
Thats where the real fun is, farming for raid mats is the real world pvp
---
My version would be this:
---
We start a Night Elf &lt;any class&gt;
---
We level to 8 and next quest sends us into Ban'ethil Barrow Den
---
We log out and start a human &lt;any class&gt;
---
Well i guess thats good to hear since i wont be listening to blizzard then and still going for a full server. Im guessing the queues are going to be horrible though.
---
Sometimes there will be login queues, other times you can still log in to a full server just fine
---
Maybe, but the mob often dies so quick it's probably not worth it.  I would only use sunder when hitting elite mobs and then only early in the fight, MAYBE refreshing again 10-15 sec later before it drops off. 
---
More than sunder/ HS you want to make sure you're using the big ones. Mortal strike, overpower if it procs, whirlwind are the best use of rage -&gt; damage.   
---
Demo shout has a place (dealing with adds, or AOE threat building).  
---
Rend is useful up until about level 40-45, then the damage falls off a relative cliff. 
---
You'll rarely have enough rage to just be spamming everything, so I think if you're duo with another melee you'll be unable to spam your regular rotation let alone spare sunders
---
Only thing I didn't like in BC was the resilience system
---
yes he has eaten so much he can not consume another bite!

I’ve saw a couple yesterday, not sure if it’s based on location or something
---
Hotw spec can do both in the same raid, just change out your gear set. 0/30/21
---
Just don't expect to top meters (not that it matters much for healing)
---
Warrior here and my ultimate goal is to meet as many people and be active in the community.
---
In game goals:
---
- Tank every dungeon
---
- Get to level 60 
---
- Get level 60 mount
---
- Find a guild where I can OT or DPS as warrior
---
- Help guildies as well as myself to get as much BiS gear possible
---
- Complete my first raid (I never did it before in classic, pservers or retail)
---
do you think it's more likely to spend money on your own posts to perhaps hit the front page or hope that some random guy is going to do it on your post and not the 299 similar posts made in the past 90 days?
---
Fun server it is then! :)
---
High pop PvP = World PvP will happen to you whether you like it or not at times. STV will be a literal warzone. BRM will be warzone x2
---
If it's support you prefers priests do that, but so do druids, paladins and shamans:)
---
[Hey you, wanna join my guild?](http://imgur.com/gallery/lKRD1Jv)
---
Retard
---
&gt; but if you understand a tiny bit of druid leveling you will see the obvious.
---
You're STILL not explaining your position.  Not everyone plays the class you want to or knows everything about levelling a vanilla class.  They've changed a LOT over the years and I'd wager that most people who played Vanilla aren't anymore, which means the people who are playing probably don't know why the talent trees should be accessed in the order you think they should.  If you'd explain THAT, then that would be a contribution.
---
Alright, thanks! May just go ahead and jump on it now.
---
Whatever helps ya sleep at night. Simply stating the truth the low pop servers are gunna be empty.

Yeah, I got those mixed up. Droid was the way my friend pronounced it.

---
horde or alliance? lol
---
...what does using reddit on a phone have to do anything? I'm on my phone right now but I'd be at my computer if I was playing wow. This is the weakest attempt to salvage an argument I've seen in a while.
---
Leveling as fury is good for tanking the instances until endgame. Blood Craze will take a lot of pressure off your healer, while Flurry and Enrage are wonderful for threat. All three procs will see significant uptime.
---
Makes more sense to just record milestones, first big dungeons (dungeons you care about), first time dinging 40 and buying your mount, dinging 60, first raid, etc
---
It's a separate client don't worry.
---
in fact creating a mass scale blacklist for people just playing the game in an intended way kinda sounds like "unreasonably undermine or disrupt the game experiences of others". it is the expressed intent of the blacklist to do just that.
---
It’s a separate install. This is easily accessible information on google, the blizzard website, and this sub.
---
Brilliant.
---
Nope, it's got its own separate install and the file is much smaller than the retail client.
---
We were doing Heroic Azshara last night. But then we all realized we didn't want to raid because we wanted to play Clasic instead. So we just sort of disbanded and played other games.
---
None of your alts will make it past level 4.
---
no the problem is that if you carry around a ret for the lulz the other players will also become lazy.
---
you're gonna have people playing with youtube open on the second screen because why should they give 100% (relative to their ability even) when this ret guy is just getting boosted. now if you let that happen the few people carrying the raid will get bored or frustrated due to endless wipes and you will progress even less.
---
you can carry a ret paladin or more for 85% of the content even with people jerking off but if you wanna kill the 2-3 bosses that actually matter or in order to get anywhere past bwl you'll want at least 25+ people paying attention.
---
tl;dr with a ret in the raid you can either be a) already min maxing with people who just wanna do really good on their own and not caring about dead weight or b) not gonna clear the content
---
chances are a) could clear anything with 40 druids because they're that good and b) wouldn't clear it even with min maxing because theyre too bad anyway.
---
They are only half correct ish.  While lvling, the only reason to downrank heals is because a higher rank will overheal.  It lets you conserve mana on a heal that would otherwise be wasted.
---
You typically don't have enough +healing gear to downrank the same way you might in a raid... which is basically replacing higher ranks with lower ranks as the +healing makes up the gap and allows you to cast for longer because of the lesser mana cost.  While lvling you dont have those efficiencies, so it's purely about not overhealing.
---
Same, I think the argument of my friends what that they think trolling is an essential part of the wow experience. *eyeroll* I'll be moonlighting alliance RP-PVP against my Horde PVP character for sure.
---
Then don't farm to sell.
---
ICE TO MEET YOU
---
I've been mainly Horde since 2005 and I think you'll find that there are a lot of little angry kids on both sides. Well at least this is the case on retail. :)
---
 Leave us Banks Bros alone.
---
Naa,  charge is busted for levels 1-20 then you just spam dungeons till 60 since everyone will need you. 
---
No class tanks better than warriors pre BC
---
You're not very good at reading between the lines, are you.
---
You are not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need
---
&gt;and also don't have making every one around us miserable as a life goal.
---
Because people who don't engage in adult play-pretend are automatically toxic?
---
I heard the split was because the Alliance was actually scared of the 40/60 ratio -- so they decided to join Asmongold
---

---
God I’d love to see a warlock version!
---
Good to hear, but im guessing in my case (Shazzrah) there will be queues, from what i’ve understood.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/kKosW8L
---
Apples OP, plox nerf.
---
Yep, new level cap 45, and its only up until Friday.
---
Yeah servers and queues won't be an issue come launch day... and even so if they are ... sorry won't matter for me I can't get started until Saturday lol.
---
1 Server with layering is not equal to 1 server... its more like 10 servers. They will be fine if you have a queue it will be processed in under 10 minutes.
---
I played Vanilla day 1 those first week and month on Full servers was terrible, that will not be the experience this time around.
---
Then who is gonna be left that's soft-spoken and nice?
---
I think we are using two different conception of "casual". I feel like your conception of a casual is someone who does not have time but, still wants the cliff notes of a hardcore game style. My conception of casual is more like my dad. 
---
Not very good at video games. A little derpy. Wants to explore shit I don't even think of as gameplay. One button is almost one button too complicated. You know the casual boomer or gamer who isn't interested in being a world breaker in any sense of the word.
---
My point being is at the time it was released and, I still feel this way today. Is that classic appeals to the non-gamer. Non-mmo player in a way I have never seen a game do. It might not steal the arena masters or arena master aspirants but, it's going to build it's own following of people who want a more accessible experience.
---
I know.lol. but I’m not gonna be playing ally as much, Probably gonna be undead for the racial probably
---
Wow so much I’ve forgotten or didn’t know, what a contrast to today’s wow.
---
 Taz’Dingo brotha! Troll Rogue or bust.
---
Camping in an in character action which has in character solutions. Reporting someone for it is not the answer.
---
That's quite a large project, I don't think I will have the time or resources to do it. But I'm sure the demand for Auctioneer will be high enough that somebody will pick it up :)
---
That's a bold statement. Fairbanks isn't an actual "low pop" realm when compared to retail. If this server was on retail it would probably be Full because it's relative to the other servers. The classic servers probably have 5x more players on it because of sharding.
---
no matter how many times the argument goes through theres no contesting that each expansion could have individual good ideas, but as a whole the game was going on a really bad slide.
---
You're welcome along with anyone else to push for a remake of BC or wotlk, i'll be over at pantheon enjoying that MMO.

Only 1 or 2 items drop off each boss and they have like 10 to 20 item tables... theres a lot of luck getting items.... but i was casual too then and maybe did 1 dungeon a night and it wasn't neccesarily one 1 needed but my friend or guild mate did
---
Class balance and PvP gear.
---
If there's one thing blizzard has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt it's that you can't have rich and varied classes, while also having Arena.
---
That doesn't answer my question though. Why wouldn't the number of buyers increase by the same degree?
---
start your questing in the orcs/trolls area.... at 60, farm a lot of runecloth deliver to trolls. 
---
Note: It's really time consuming.
---
It's definitely hard for the first 20 or so levels. It will pick up, and once you're able to gank people and ruin their days, it's well worth.
---
Not a direct answer, but I've noticed a lot of people prefer Luna unit frames. Those might be worth a shot as they reminded me a lot of how I used to set up Pitbull.
---
Plus a gnome selling engineering patterns that you can camp and resell on the AH to lazy players.
---
I didn't think there was a zepplin to OG in vanilla until 3.something? Not sure though it's been years
---
There is never enough priest and a lot of ppl quit it while leveling - if you know you love it and youll make it to max just go priest man! can go healer or dps anyways!
---
also go dwarf female to maintain your chad reputation.
---
depends what you model edit. If you edit a tree stump into a tower and appear to be walking in thin air to other players or deleting houses so you can walk straight through them or shoot through them, then thats what will get you banned. IF caught by some kinda automation system. But if such a thing even exists, it will catch you changing your character models, but if it does not, youll be fine.

Dota 2 Underlords
---
Thats the point, thank you :)
---
Just take the road out of Mulgore, once you hit The Barrens head north, staying on the road, to Crossroads. Then you head north out of crossroads and bang a right, staying on the road still, and that’ll take you to Durotar. At that point just run all the way to the Zep. Stay on the road the whole time. Would be beneficial to grab flightpaths along the way that way when you do have to go back to Thunderbluff for your shaman quests and trainers you aren’t running all the way back.
---
I mained a Resto Shaman from Vanilla until the end of WotLK. Downranking spells helps a lot (as does Mana Tide Totem). Get lots of MP5 and you'll be fine. It's like an extra mini game :)
---
I hope half of Herod uses it and ties up the whole server with a bunch of AFK mugs so we can get all the firsts on Faerlina.
---
What a load of nonsense 
---
“Like if you agree, subscribe if your angry”
---
This got said more then the “emails” from the “sources”
---
Or have a wife who plays
---
No, a sub doesn’t work that way. It starts from the minute you activate. 
---
My point is, whether you sub today or in a week and a half, you have spent $15 on WoW in August of 2019. You will pay $15 next month. So on and so on.
---
All you are changing is your billing date. I can pay my credit card on the first of the month or last of the month, either way I’m paying for it each month. If you are going to play and are concerned about character slots and money isn’t an issue, you don’t gain anything by waiting.
---
Fuck yes! I was really hoping they release a new one before the launch.
---
I'm quite sure that Classic has more fanbase Europe than in NA. It was criminal to announce just 2 english PvP server.
---
Or maybe they did it to get good PR...
---
Used to use auctioneer back in the day but I imagine there are new auction house addons now.  Can someone give me a rundown of what the options will be for classic and how they're different from eachother/oldschool auctioneer?
---
&gt; VendorPrice to know should I take this mail chest or this leather chest as a quest reward just to drop it off to the next vendor..
---
I forget the name of the add on.  But I found one that adds a new button when accepting quests with selectable rewards.  Basically, if you don't pick a choice it gives "pick the most expensive" option.  If you select one, you "accept and equip" which is nice to not search your bag for that quest upgrade.
---
It depends what you make with it.. You can literally make it so if a spell is on cooldown there's massive text in the middle of your screen telling you that. Look up tutorials on it.
---
Pretty sure “paladins” and frame 1 cover all the expansions, past, present, and future.
---
To give some perspective as an OSRS player. Updates need to pass an ingame poll with 75%. Three new skills have been proposed in the past (with warding quite recently), but they all failed the poll. Some stupid content still gets in the game, and there is some "spite" voting (pvp'ers voting no on good pvm stuff and vice versa). The system isn't perfect and oldschool for sure has changed a lot from the inital 2007-based game. But it still feels like a continuation from that time. 
---
The voting isn't perfect but OSRS still feels like "classic".
---
Become a follower of my church of frostianity.
---
I agree with that. Did some great stuff covering private servers, but he's just really hard to like, or even take serious at times.
---
Yeah I'm rolling priest once again, I love playing it... I also think lots of people will quit the priest life because it's WAY different than retail.  
---
I expect the rogue population however to explode.
---
🤘
---
As a Warrior going for full banana i am prepared to do nothing but AV.
---
Why do you have to be so rude? There's no sense in being like that
---
I’m sure there’s a healthy list of retail add-ons for classic that fill the “void” of recent QoL.
---
This, this and this.  Absolutely worst idea ever.  Lots of times I want to add bits of code here and there to test out ideas but damn, can't even run the script unless it's formatted properly and looks nice first, lol.  Insane!
---
I’m struggling between hunter and rogue. I wish Druid was an option, but I don’t like to heal - and that’s Druid in level 60, healing.
---
Hunter is a lot of fun and definitely the best to level with, only thing that’s kinda annoying in PvP is the minimum range distance.
---
I'm super late so noone will ever see this, but these would be an awesome idea for something like a mousepad.
---
I’m not going to take the time to look up a link. You install the blizzard launcher, you install classic wow by selecting it on the drop down menu of the wow tab, and you’re done
---
Yeah, but then you have to download them before they get deleted by Twitch, which for most users is 14 days from recording.
---
I know I would like to play priest but I am split between shadow priest  and holy priest. I mostly want to start raiding when I hit 60 but my friends aren’t gonna play wow for a while so I will be solo for the most part. Thanks!
---
Wow, this is really awesome!   
---
I'll definitely be using this as I level my druid.
---
oh okay, prove it then and we'll be done with this thing
---
Go make an elf and dance on tables in Booty Bay for silver coins.
---
Meet in Crossroads....  No reason to group up and leach exp off each other until level 10 any way
---
Sounds like you'll get another surgery and 2 weeks more off after the checkup at the hospital:)
---
Am I the only one who remembers "Roger Wilco"
---
I got flashbacks to the kobold place in early EQ in there. Friggin furbolgs spawned on top of my group at every turn. Player skeletons everywhere...
---
.... you didn't use the live version of Cowboys From Hell from 101 Proof.... 
---
shame.gif
---
Alright, thank you man! :D Do not expect to much, but I hope it will be okay.
---
APES are just a bunch of mongoloids that think they are 200 IQ. Like most idiots who also happen to be dicks they lack any self-awareness. Back on private servers they were some big fish in a small pond, but people soon realized they were way overhyped and overrated.
---
Feels so good!
---
The hell? This is like GDKP with extra bad steps.  Just run a straight GDKP raid and can it a day, its what I plan on doing.
---
&gt;then IMO they don't deserve the mount
---
not like they deserve the mount anyways fpr like no reason
---
Should be telling yourself that, you're the guy going on a dickhead brigade that brings nothing to the table. It's not enough for you to play on the *super cool populated server*, you have to go out of your way to be an ass too.
---
woah did somebody say
---
F R E S H?
---
There absolutely will be a player drop off. It’s crazy to think there won’t be
---
I am horde only but I just don't play with RP dweebs problem solved.
---
I never said that. I said retweet if you are angry and also subscribe if you are angry. And if you doubt the emails, I have one thing to say - look how good the spelling is. Case closed.
---
I'll keep that in mind and give Luna a shot if Pitbull doesn't work! Thanks.
---
if 10k player can only farm in 1 or 2 spots for an item, that item becomes rare.
---
If 10k players can hop layers to get that farm spot - that item becomes not so rare :)
---
They're both great for groups actually. Priests bring so many tools for healing, but Shaman has tons of utility like mana tide, and the beloved Windfury totem. If your friends are playing melee classes, I'd strongly consider Shaman for windfury.
---
But it always will becouse 200k retail gold =1 month of sub
---
lol. “I don’t have Rebirth in my spellbook.” 
---
Hold on to your loins, boys! It’s gonna be a crazy.
---
Exactly, forums are shitshows. Honestly, I spend so much time on forums that after long breaks from MMORPG's once I start playing one again I am almost shocked at how nice most people are. Sure you meet a douche once in a while, but forums don't reflect the actual community at all, just like how a few hardcore guilds from a country don't represent the whole country, despite how much they think they do.
---
Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to detect the difference between a program pressing the space bar every few minutes, and a person doing the same.
---
What does Bash 2/2 allow you to do that Bash 0/2 does not allow you to do?
---
False.
---
I feel like they had to make everything super balanced to make Arena relevant. It’s a much better system than Vanilla’s rankings, but Arena wouldn’t work competitively for Vanilla. BGs are 10-40 on each side, but with 3v3, any weak class or spec is detrimental. 
---
Even though BC was much more balanced on the PVE side of things, Arenas were *still* unbalanced. There was the Priest/Mage/Rogue combo that was just too good, as well as a few others. Add in Resilience and it’s got some bad vibes to it.
---
And that probably led to everything being ultra balanced to the point where every class is similar in WotLK. I like Arenas and can’t wait to do them in TBC, but they just don’t work for Classic, outside of maybe just for fun.
---
You are mainly brought for the Marks buff. Unless you have to many hunters, you shouldnt be survival regardless.
---
Trueshot aura for a full melee group beats survival.
---
[http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=low+effort+post](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=low+effort+post)

It just takes 20agi to = 1% crit.  So 20agi gives 1% crit, 1%dodge, 40armor (dosn't benifit from bear form multiplier), and 20ap(still gives 1ap per point in vanilla correct?).  Vs 20str giving 40ap(56...or imaybe 48 depending how the multiplier works...while in cat).  For tanking agi would surely be higher priority...cat it's closer.  With crits giving an extra combo point + the extra damage I'm not sure where that would land dps wise.
---
You used to be able to
---
You are right.. my mistake. It was intoduced in 3.2.0. Been playing too long
---
Why don't you just create both and then you can settle into the character you like more as you level.
---
Level shadow, if you are in love fight your way for a harder to find raid spot.
---
If you're not in love, take an easy to find holy raid spot from nearly anyone.
---
Yeah, I really don't want TBC or WotLK servers. We've been down there^(,) *^(Neo)*. We already know that road. 
---
I want something new that avoids going down the root of 'casualising' the game (i.e. avoid flying, LFG, etc), but selects bits from live to include (Arena, pet battles ^(so it's easier to convince my girlfriend to play), Blood Elves, and new raid technology&amp;design merged with old methodologies)
---
No Manatide is pretty lame, so probably not,
---
Do you want to gank people while they're questing?
---
Do you want to avoid getting ganked by people while questing?
---
Do you want to go out at level 60 and hunt other level 60s in the world, solo or as a group?
---
I don't care to gank people. Don't care to have to worry about getting ganked while i'm killing my tigers in STV. And at 60 you can still go and cause havoc at some opposing faction's town and other people will show up and fight you if you flag. People say 'you can't have the classic experience without it', yes, yes you absolutely can. Not everyone gets off on ganking.
---
You're aggressively stupid
---
that makes no sense. how do you think the servers work?
---
Technically you’re right, but that doesn’t really make a difference. All you’re changing is your billing date. Either way he’s paying for a wow sub this month.
---
A sub doesn’t cost less or more based on how you use it, it’s a sunk cost each month.
---
That might be another reason, I'm not too aware. All I know is that it's confirmed for both sides which servers they are picking, unless new Eastern servers suddenly appear before launch.
---
To be honest though, Streamers and their sheep won't last too long in my opinion, they will always find other new games to play or go back to retail. Faerlina and Thalnos will be similar in population when that happens.
---
I think this is what we're going to have to do. Hopefully they'll actually come meet me!
---
so amazing!
---
Except the "meta" was constantly changing during retail vanilla. Every patch came with its class balance changes. You're confusing retail vanilla (a living game that was constantly evolving) and pserver vanilla, which is a 1.12 snapshot of vanilla, and what we're getting in Classic. 
---
I would welcome class changes in Classic. Maybe after naxx. Maybe before. Or just leave it be and wait for TBC to fix vanilla's issues. Either way is fine.
---
I totally agree with you, but Blizzard has acknowledged, and fixed, some costly issues.  The largest of those is giving a community and entirely rewritten game with a large team and company time.  
---
I don’t disagree, they got their subs and now they can perch themselves and watch us all funnel into a traffic jam, BUT!
---
I have one customer who runs a comic book auction site.  He has a specific day each month with a $1mil+ comic and it demands every bit of machine power and bandwidth I have.  I even sub it out to AWS (Amazon Web Services) to help carry the load.  
---
Blizzard doesn’t need to sub.  They can run virtual machines on existing hardware to ease the burden for launch week.  Hell, most of our realms are virtual servers on the same physical server with a ton of redundancy. 
---
Expansion of very large distribution groups costs resources yes, but they have those resources already.
---
As previously posted, I just hope it is a smooth launch and not laboring under a false impression that they will get it wrong
---
That's......a really good way to put it.....
---
Having a tough choice with picking a main myself. 
---
Faction Alliance.
---
My only requirement is that I must have at least 1 viable DPS or Tank option for dungeons.
---
What I've been thinking: 
---
• Warrior
---
• Paladin (I'd have to play ret or prot in dungeons and those specs aren't amazing)
---
• Mage (2 friends are already going mage)
---
• Priest (Already have a priest healer in our group, but old shadow is one of my favorite things to play, and I'm not sure how viable SP is in 5mans).
---
Its hard for me to pick a spec because the order of what class I want to main changes dramatically between PvP, Dungeons, and raiding. 
---
-----
---
I'm open to other classes, but I'd like to avoid Warlock and Rogue since I already have a good amount of people playing those specs in our group.
---
It just rid of crit chance, didn't really stop the whole gib fest thing. You had mace rogues stunlocking and warriors with stormherald to circumvent the lack of crit damage. If chunks can't happen, just stunlock the shit out of them so it's practically the same effect.
---
You are right u have to run through the barrons to get to durator rofl
---
Jokes on you, there was a ret pally on world first azshara.
---
There are free action potions, other player’s spells, plate boots, your PvP trinket, and a cloth belt that can disable another player’s kiting potential against you. Gnome makes PvP easier, but it’s far from necessary. Play what you enjoy and you’ll succeed at whatever you push for, so long as you have the time and dedication.
---
&gt;a name that I personally have never seen taken.
---
So, timmybr. *What name might that be?*
---
Have them come to you
---
Friend always said See'thun. Pissed me off.
---
I wasn't sure which server to roll, either Pvp or RP-PvP. I have no one to play with anyway so maybe I'll give RP a try.
---
Pog in de chatto!
---
Shazzrah kids are downvoting you, stay strong my brother. You hit me up any time and we'll ditch the wives, get in the hot tub, soap each other down, just grown up shit.
---
That discord is like the US, fun to observe from afar but I would never live there.
---
Oh, I see. Thanks a ton, mate
---
you might do that, but that doesn't make it good or anything. 
---
obviously downtime is the worst, but you don't fucking use regrowth, it has the worst hpm. this just further proves my point and shows that you too have no idea how to level druid efficiently.
---
Awesome job. Thank you so much for this
---
Every single interaction with a member of the opposite faction in a PVP server is content. Will they attack me? Do I want to attack them? Will they wait until I'm engaged with a mob? I think that it's very exciting in a way. 
---
Phase 2 will be wild, as the honour system is in place, but there are no BGs. While PVE players can tag themselves, in a PVP server you will either be hunter or prey and the choice will not always be yours.
---
You're totally right that there's no incentive to have 0 queues, and it's better for them to have queues if there are still servers that aren't full. But part of the equation involves revenue from player retention. But you're kind of making it sound like this is like a crappy early access release on steam where the developers are going to take your early access money then vanish into the wind. Blizzard is a large company and at some point if they actually behaved the way you seem to think they do their reputation will cause the company to fail. It's never beneficial for a large company to do actually do a cash-grab game.
---
This is seriously beautiful. Well done!
---
To clarify, on his stream he said that due to real-life commitments, he anticipated a lot of players would take between 1 to 6 months to hit 60 depending on their commitments.
---
This was right after he reviewed a gnome mage on a retail-like private server that AOE'd his way 1-60 in 3d 23h, or close to that.  He was anticipating solo questing his way to 60 in about 4.5 to 5 days played.
---
Calling anything low effort and no content is an attack.
---
And no, I own a webhosting company with shared, dedicated, and virtual hosting
---
I dont assume people on reddit are correct and neither should you.  I do however see posts I can validate and back up when I have some background on the subject.  Why should you assume I am wrong but the other reddit posts that boast the opposite view are correct?  I dont want to argue, I just want to login and play like you do.
---
I'd name it that even if I was horde lol, I'm rolling both factions tho as always!
---
Omg I think all my friends are obsessed with The Office so I'm liking that Thunder Bluffin one....
---
Creeper
---
You actually have no idea what you’re tlking about. Prot pally are top tier dungeon tanks cuz of easy aoe threat, and mobs die fast enough ao you won’t go oom and lose aggro. Ele shamans are insane with AQ gear and quickly become a top pvp spec. Survival is THE spec once you hit a certain agility lvl with better gear due to talent scaling. BM was the best lvling spec and farming spec for hunters doing mara runs until they get good enough gear.
---
Eh, they get a community of people to back them up.  Regardless if YOU don't think they deserve it or not, there's enough people that do... then they deserve it.
---
as already stated i have no interest in writing another druid leveling guide, because im fucking lazy and it would also be not that good because im not an expert concerning druids. however i know the basics and can identify a bad guide.
---
Or just put a weight on the w key. Not a macro just as effective.
---
Losing all your gear because you died doesn't mean PvP is "harder" on those other games, it just means it is more punishing.
---
You spew some garbage mongoloid logic while trying to gatekeep "real PvP"
---
Super punishing mechanics for dying just make people want to avoid PvP. The more people who try to avoid PvP the less competitive it becomes.
---
There is a reason all those games had little to no competitive PvP.
---
from now on lets not ask any questions anymore!
---
Everything is 'good enough', but it will depend on your guild.  I think 30/21 is slightly better though.  Some guilds will force you to go for the 31pt mana totem.
---
I BEGGED my wife to roll on Bloodsail with me but the RP stigma is strong with her, so we ended up on Myzrael. :'(
---
I don’t even care, my first ever char was a Ret Pally back in vanilla and by god I’m doing it again 
---
I do care, help pls
---
Every guild needs tanks, even off tanks. So be prepared to slap on a sword and board every once in a while, and you'll be able to find a slot no problem.
---
Sure that happens, but I’m talking about now in retail where ilvl matters much more. I’m sorry but I will outdps anyone 10 ilvls lower than me it’s just pure numbers.
---
"No! You don't get it... me and 5 of my friends are ditching Retail for Classic... I've only got 5 friends so that IS Everyone"
---
Severe Queues. Do not like the sound of that lol. I wonder if Faerlina will have a queue or enough people are dodging streamers that maybe it will be chill
---
NO
---
where did you find these hunter stats at?
---
Guilds will run multiple dps warriors, but there will also be a huge population of dps warriors. You’ll just need to find a casual raiding guild and secure a spot
---
I leveled a hunter in the stress test and all the shit people complained about seemed to be fixed. No issues with it.
---
Do you by chance have a list of these macros? I'm going to need all the help I can get, rolling druid this time around.
---
Am very thankful to OSRS for helping pave the way (let's not forget EQ has been doing legacy servers for years).
---
But with that said, I tried runescape a couple different times before I got into WoW. I couldn't stand the graphics. Even in the few days wait between deciding to get WoW and my mom taking me to gamestop to actually buy it, when I was so hyped I was itching for anything close to the experience, I could hardly stomach looking at RS. Lucky vanilla WoW is still beautiful and always will be.
---
If they are leveling Undead... they will only do at most maybe partially level in Silverpine before they hit a snag and end up meeting you in Crossroads. That's how it has always been for me when I leveled my numerous Undead characters in vanilla.
---
real time is a bit too low tho. i mean when i didnt have a job on p-ser vers it would take me about a month to level and i was mostly slowed down by my own frustration and being bored of it all because i hate levelling. i feel like a month is a fair estimate if you really play a lot but you won't be anywhere near the first 60s. it usually takes me around 12 days played to get to 60 and that's because i dick around and do dungeons as i please even if it's not efficient.
---
Lmao I couldn't sneak up on ragnaros cause the clap of my ass cheeks
---
Thanks for the link, I was thinking I heard it from shedo or skarm.  Found some of the numbers in my other post just above (havn't tested them, but they come from taladril's druid paper).  Still not sure which is "better", but certainly enough that I'll be checking things out and counting on my fingers come launch.  :)
---
Depends on how cute you are
---
10 Shadow Resist is almost nothing. Don't let that be something that decides a significant decision for you.
---
Oml this is ancient
---
IDK what guide you're looking at but DPS warriors are the best DPS in the game and are often needed.
---
Dps warriors not in high demand... 
---
Well, answering your question, I don't think you will be able to, since all guilds will be going hardcore mode since day 1.
---
Sorry.
---
Even better to run into your favorite City as an invader
---
You’ll need a chemo after looking at them.
---
there will be casual guils, actually casual guilds are the most numerous and this casual guilds will need casual warriors
---
and since a loot of casuals will level dps classes that are good for leveling your warrior will be on high demand there
---
Any script worth using will a) not fire so quickly, b) fire at random intervals, and c) use different inputs.
---
It would take me about 15 minutes to make a script that would press a random movement key (and then it's opposing movement key, to keep my position centered) every 3 minutes + (random number between 1 and 120 seconds).
---
If someone were watching streams on my second monitor and wanted to stay logged in to wow to read trade chat, that's something they might do manually to avoid getting kicked out. So it's difficult for Bliz to identify scripts that do it.
---
Check all his trailers, the Naxx one is superb
---
You don't know how many players will be on each layer. If there's 5k players on each layer, that's still more players per resource node than was ever in Vanilla. 
---
So go figure why you think the prices will plummet.
---
NICE
---
But they aren't getting rid of layering anyways during phase 1, so this doesn't explain the need for queues on release
---
Cool
---
You guy swill be dropping retail for classic and then 3/4 of you will be dropping back and acting like nothing happened.
---
super cool idea.  Hope I remember to get this one!
---
super fishy and obvious, but each to their own
---
Shaman will mostly stack +healing and downrank chain heal.  Your group will also have to play around static totem placements otherwise you drain a lot of mana dropping new totems.  I wouldnt say they are terrible mana-wise though, but they are less flexible than priests.
---
I say do both where you save a local copy and use twitch as a backup save, but also use it to create clips from.  Again, it's more if you have the resources to be uploading while you're recording, you might as well do it for redundancy.
---
100% of classic population is reading classic right? Everyone cares about this hype, everyone cares about who rolls where. Oh wait, they dont.
---
As if solo players dont exist, as if there is not a single guild that will reroll, as if people who will make their character on day 1 dont exists. I understand your argument, but lot of factors are not accounted in it.
---
Someone answered the question and you still had to respond like a douche. Nice job
---
Simple yet satisfying
---
In the first year of vanilla I think I got around 30 free days to compensate for gamebreaking server issues.
---
I play plenty of games where you lose progress when you die but I'm not sure what you're getting at. There is not a full-loot or hardcore server option in WoW, so the choice is a) realms where you can PK unwilling players and b) realms where you cannot. In the context of WoW realms, PvP realms are harder to level on due to large amounts of fighting in certain regions like STV. The fact that it is easier than it was in UO or Everquest only matters if you are trying to decide whether to play WoW or UO or Everquest.
---
Whats crazy, is these are just the players who decided to resubscribe for early name registration as well as retail players. I know alot of people who didnt care enough about names to subscribe early. Might get a little hectic come launch day.
---
Great post, I forgot about a lot of these, but I can’t wait to relive them!
---
I think you're the one having a hard time m8. Vanilla had different classes than you know today. Blood elves were NOT in look it up. You're misremembering.
---
I don't think so at all. It only got released a few days after, a shitload of people who missed out on a name will try to get into it and then another bunch of people will sign up when Classic releases. A lot of those probably would rather sign up to a realm that isn't marked as "full" too. There are significant cons on a full classic realm (competing for resources non-stop which is a waste of time).
---
I'm also a Zilean main and a Druid main. I think Druid is exactly what you're looking for if you have the patience to learn the class. 
---
Frost Mage is also a good alternative if you want heavy damage and more control at the cost of survivability.
---
"seems kinda fishy" should hardly be grounds for a ban
---
I have the perfect solution: Don't play Herod.
---
You guys can stay on Shazzrah. :P
---
It would be cool if one of the servers had more of a mixed population instead of being *claimed by* 4 different communities.
---
Big Crits is even a good one
---
&gt; Even if they come out with another server -- all my friends, our guilds, friends of friends, we're all there it would be a coordination nightmare to try to get all of us onto another server so we'll be staying on Herod no matter what.
---
this is why layering is absolutely never going away
---
#Hahahahahahahah
---
We said no changes!!!!
---
I'm just glad if my main makes it past level 4 the first days.
---
You know I will have to "steal" this for my druid this time around, I've never played druid before - but I guess it's time and this will definitively help me out a ton!  
---
Cheers :D
---
I got you by slow I thought you were referring to the speed it takes to get to raid. Which is what a lot of people consider the "actual game" I do however agree it is slow in other ways as well. Such as mana being an actual concern and the specs not being as complicated to play.
---
That being said. That is part of the reason I think it will be more popular. It's simply more accessible to people not native to the genre. I think people under estimate how obtuse and overly complicated retail can be for the uninitiated. Only time will tell who is right though.
---
*PoM Pyro has entered the chat*
---
They'll be fine. There will be a massive drop off of concurrent players. A dead server = dead game in Classic (it's not like retail where a dead server = playable game due to LFD and Cross-realm BG's).
---
&gt;I liked it better than ulduar
---
Ummm, nah bruh. That being said I LOVED all of TBC and WotLK.  People always hate on the Naxx re-release here but at the time there were 12 million ppl playing WoW and about 10,000 of them had seen the raid anywhere besides youtube.
---
This is how it is in the home improvement reddit community.  The professionals get flamed by professionals with differing techniques and also HGTV diy’ers.  It is tough to use the poop knife and cut the “proverbial shit” to get what you wanted out of the post
---
Where's your salvation?
---
On pvp you will experience wait time until you get the chance to play, enemies kill you for no reason. they will kill all npc's, imagine completing all of your quests just to find all of them dead by a undead rogue killing everyone on sight (no offence horde players, but you're jerks when it comes to that) Normal servers however is on my opinion better, no wait time on queue, no enemies killing you, if you want to kill go to pvp matchmaking. Dont be a jerk
---
Honestly, don't feel "stuck", mate.
---
Back in vanilla. The REAL vanilla. If your guild collapsed, you'd simply apply for a new one on your server. That's the way to go in classic. Server hopping won't be a thing. Your server is your home, not the guild.
---
Sure there are bound to be casual guilds who take anyone as not everyone cares to min/max.
---
The real "issue" with war dps is it's fairly gear dependent and there are just other classes who dps better, bring more utility, and need less gear to do well.
---
I'll never tell anyone not to play a spec or class they want because I believe if you play well enough and take the time to find a quality guild you will raid. Just don't expect it to happen overnight.
---
I met my husband doing "Jailbreak." Ah, sweet Vanilla memories.

---
rip goblins though
---
You lose some momentum changing stance then charge or changing stance then intercept.
---
The automated aspect of the macro would be a time saver, and potentially a life saver.
---
You wouldn't even need to manually change stance if you want to charge/intercept
---
An STD sounds exactly like something Blizzard would flag.
---
I showed this to my gf and she really wanted a rogue one lol
---
definitely not during phase 1
---
I like all of these, except (probably unpopular opinion around this sub) arena. 
---
Arena was really fun and I had a blast doing it in TBC and Wrath.
---
Hes starting point is probably around 3.5hrs of travel time away from where he needs to go to.
---
Yw.
---
That's definitely not true. Runescape has been using anti-botting software that could detect something this simple for years. They're able to detect randomly timed clicks (for "high alching" in that game).
---
How bad? ;)
---
Yea well good luck trying to prove it. Ill do more than just that. Ill automate my character to run, sit, afk. Run, sit, afk. Subtle, but effective.
---
It has virtually zero impact on your PC either because it's recording directly off the GPU.  
---
You need very fast upload bandwidth if you're streaming otherwise there is a noticeable difference, even if very slight.
---
I wanted to roll on Bloodsail Buccaneers (NA RP), but I was overruled by the family group, so we’re on Pagle (NA PvE).  Their reasoning: people will be busy with RP stuff and less interested in quests/dungeons/raids, so it’ll be harder to find groups.  Any truth to that?
---
I mean I would prefer that model were it at the same price point (e.g. $14.99 for 30 days divided by the minute or something).
---
Guessing it was a bit more than that ;)
---
Here in Russia it was 599 rubles a month, last I looked. Which I think is a out $8 but that's just a guesstimate (I don't look at currency conversions).
---
No Pudge, ez report
---
I really hope that feature will never come. It is one of the reasons why most servers are horribly faction-imbalanced nowadays. Nearly every server on retail is either heavily horde, or heavily alliance.
---
tauren look cooler with antlers tho
---
I can't stand streamers, so here's my plan. I'm going to roll on their server. Not to be some scrub that plays with them, obviously, but to gank them. Then I'll tune into their stream all day to watch and stream snipe them. I might even post clips to share it all over. Man, those streamers are such IDIOTS. hahaha
---
Is this really worthy of a post?
---
Yes the countless mace rogues and Stunherald using warriors was a blast. 3 seasons of stuns, gotta love it.
---
What you’re saying is you dislike Blood elves because you don’t like any representation of males that isn’t a hulking muscle power trip. That’s your problem, don’t try and force it on a fantasy game buddy.
---
Yes you would be at a disadvantage
---
This guy plays diablo 3
---
As fearless in death as he was in life.
---
Did you draw that? That's amazing.
---
I don't believe they will honestly, in the recent post they even said that they will open another EU realm because they expect SEVERE que times. I have expected que times to be heavy though and so should everyone else, it's classic after all.
---
The eastern servers are effectively based in the Midwest (Chicago), despite the misleading name.
---
I live in MO and will be rolling on an eastern server.
---
eastern, servers in chicago
---
agreed, im going Grobb myself
---
Eastern is only an hour ahead, that has always been easier for me
---
Dominating BGs is enticing. I wonder, though.. is that only possible if we are both “super geared” or can we realistically be performing in “okay” gear? Like is this after I get my PvE DPS gear, then I try for good PvP drops from dungeons/raids?
---
Also, I worry that the BGs won’t be any fun if I don’t have a pocket healer. I get that I can’t have my cake and eat it too, but it is something I think about.. maybe it’s a silly concern.
---
Nah just do classic+ rescale tbc and wotlk to 60.
---
Oh your right, I dont play warlock and just had to go check. I thought immolate was an instant dot. I accept defeat
---
Streaming doesn’t take Hd space til you download vods so I plan on plugging in an external hdd just for those vods
---
Well you already want 3 or 4 or so, for the different curses.  If your raid has a lot of warlocks you can also bring a shadow priest and get 15% bonus damage on all those shadowbolts.
---
Fairbanks? More like Fairstanks.
---
Whitemane for life bitches.
---
How do you know that?
---
I see a lot of people talking about push to talk etc... voice activation in the thread. There is a software out there that filters everything that is not your voice (keyboard noise, dog barking etc...). You can use it to either filter your voice input or what you hear in your headphone. So if you're using the software on your mic it will filter for you the output, if you use it on your headphone it will filter the incoming noise.
---
I personnaly use it for discord because I like to use voice activation. You can test it and download it [here](https://ref.krisp.ai/u/u3444bd5fb) (shameless plug its my "affiliate" link it gives me an extension to my free trial). The software goes for 10$ a month after the trial to filter microphone, but the free version allows you to use it on the headphone input.
---
Perfect! Thank you!
---
For fullest immersion Blizzard should limit connections to the server so everyone gets dial up level ping.
---
Yes, there are lots of rings, they made a special bag for them.
---
Layering HAS to go by the time World bosses appear. They have said that before. You cannot have 2 Lord Kazzaks or two Aszuregos.
---
Likeliest outcome imo is new servers and free migration.
---
Except that’s not what I or the person you were replying to were saying at all? I can explain analogies if you’d like :)
---
They will remain at Shazzrah, it has been confirmed in our Blizzard Spanish forums.
---
Get vods and back them up on hd after downloading on twitch. Initial stream takes no hard drive space.
---
Yes, it was removed some time ago in retail WoW because it wasn't used as often later on in WoW's lifespan (I believe in Cataclysm)
---
It's just a 6th bag that holds all your keys that expands based on how many keys you have, up to about 32 keys.
---
It's the key button in the bag slots as seen [here](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/b/bd/Bag_slots.png?version=990631c01256d72497dc061e1b3e757b).

This remains true on a Normal realm if you stay flagged all the time, you just lose the ability to grief lower players haha.

You either pick Herod or you just don't play. Or if your a twitch fanboy throwing your money at others playing classic make a level 1 on any server and then just watch twitch.
---
New chance to get my name and I'll actually be home when the server goes live!!
---
Crazy because holy doesn't provide much additional healing until late and you won't have the crit to utilize illumination.  Also if you deal more damage less healing is required.

yessir.

Awesome - thank you for this!

Downvoting me for failing to understand basic human psychology. I'm impressed.

So cynical, much upvote, wow.

I remember when ret pallies first got divine storm it was way overtuned. I watched a ret paladin solo 4 warriors at the same time and walk away at full health.

And who can forget the paladin that soloed a raid boss with reckoning bomb.

Also latin americans speaking spanish there
---
That's exactly the guide I'm currently reading! Thanks very much for the help I'll forward this along to the boys.

Eastern for me, better connection and with my work schedule I would rather start earlier than later.
---
It comes out on the 26th in NA, which is Monday.

I went pacific just because I work until 7, most guilds raid schedule would work best for me in pacific time zone.
---
Hey look! Here's one of those grown men who need to get a grip. You're fucking pathetic.

Even in the current day, voice activated is very very common in my experience. 
---
On the other hand, programs are generally a lot better with thresholds, I can usually get it so background noise and keyboard sounds do not trigger it.  I generally find holding a keybind in certain kind of games for PTT to be very annoying, MMO's notwithstanding because of all the keybinds I already need to dedicate to stuff.

---
Raided as Troll Priest back in the day and made Rank 11, very good in PvP.

Rolling UD Priest this time because WotF. I barely found myself using Beserk as a Troll Priest. WotF is game changing for both PvP &amp; PvE.

shieet, i'll prob need a new gaming chair to get there.

I don't want to split gear with 2 other warriors.

I have yet to get OmniCC to work in classic and that makes me sad. Also, Necrosis is the only mod with a DoT timer I've found that works. Is there a simpler mod for DoTs in classic?
---
My wife and I used ElvUI throughout the stress test.  Party and raid frames worked just fine for us.   Including smart switching between them based on party/raid size.
---
Bruh, you're killing me. He's not technically right - he's right. The billing date doesn't matter, "sunk cost" doesn't matter. If he buys a subscription now *he is getting 18 days of playtime out of a one month subscription*. That is the point that EVERYONE is making here. If you buy a pizza and throw out 3 out of the 8 slices, you've still spent the same amount of money, *but you've wasted three godamn slices.*
---
## bruh 😂💀💀😝🤤
---
credit where credit is due.
---
I’d rather have people who are there to RP to be honest. 
---
Yes, if you don’t RP and your friends are going to an RP server, you wont be forced to RP all the time. 
---
But, if you are not into/interested in RP Grobb would be a bad choice for a server. The whole reason we fought for RPPVP was so we had a server that was for RPers that want to PVP. Why would you want to encourage non RPers to go there?
---
i have no idea, these days.
---
but back on official release, it was 2500 total. and at TBC it was upped to 3000.
---
i assume it can handle more. a lot more, these days.
---
love your name, that's a cake reference right?
---
and thanks for the advice, will prolly roll Horde on that server. my friends are going ally on herod, and I'll definitely want to have a horde server too
---
You can bind a custom macro in Clique.  Just have the /cast command in your macro:
---
/cast Healing Wave(Rank 2)
---
Yeah classic release date was announced after I submitted my vacation plan...I am off the exact week before and start to work on 26th!
---
Fuck me I guess?
---
Which bit? Everything there seems to be pretty common knowledge at this point.
---
Meh kind of a moot point if you’re running SM Arm 12+ times.
---
Hey dude, sorry about your cancer. That's coming from a genuine place. But I don't think you get what StrayLilCat is saying. Trans people, and many LGBTQ folks, do get harassed a lot in game. Just look at the comments in this thread. White people (myself included) just don't get that level of harassment. I can't imagine anyone with cancer ever getting harassed in the game. People generally have the empathy to care more about people who are sick. LGBTQ, not so much. In the real world, like where I live in Canada, it's not a big deal; I cannot think of anyone that I know in the lower mainland that thinks twice about it. Our prime minister even marches in gay pride. 
---
In the states and in some other countries, there's a huge backlash and an ongoing issue with it, which includes hate crimes. 
---
I'm sorry, but the average white straight male does not deal with these issues.
---
Still no keyring slot btw
---
I wouldn't be concerned, I think it's unrealistic to think you'll have a perfect 50/50 split. Also you have to take into account how many people will either
---
A. quit before max level
---
B. not pursue any type of pvp
---
C. play the game infrequently
---
That’s a great drawing - do some more!
---
he is joking
---
Totally forgot that existed
---
It still has its uses just not nearly as reliable as the version that exists on private servers.
---
Lol no. Especially not in casual guilds.
---
It's a little slow, but some of the talents like divine strength and imp seal of righteousness help you out. I've seen it done more than once with moderate success. Honestly I don't think you'll be setting speed records regardless of your leveling spec, but feel free to try things out for yourself.
---
I’ve heard people talking about wanting to cram that zone full of shit for Classic+... and I’m just like... please no :/
---
I levelled a warrior to 60 in a pirated server. They are very very difficult to level. You will struggle against mobs the same level as you. You will likely need to seek out mobs 2 or 3 levels lower than you for levelling, which really reduces your XP. Conversely, a hunter or a mage can take on 2 or 3 even 3 mobs the same level as them.
---
However, I am willing to bet at 60 you are going to see everyone in /1 begging for warriors to come tank for them. It will be very hard to get prot warriors for your groups. So if you do make it to 60 its worth it.
---
My advice for someone wondering about being a warrior is this: If you aren't really sure whether or not you will even make it to 60 through the 200 hours of gameplay, then pick a class thats funnest and easiest to level. If you know for a matter of fact that you will get to 60 and do the end game content, play your warrior. 
---
Just get a good 2000's metal playlist and grind your butt off.
---
You really don’t support the idea of a hunter?
---
Selling/Trading: Ex, Oom
---
Buying: Smith, Ss, and other unique 2-4 letter names
---
DM me on here if interested.
---
Depends what you’re meaning as an “advantage”. Mage, warlock, and spriest were the only things that had kill pressure on a ret pally in a 1v1. But pallies also didn’t have kill pressure on anyone that was smart enough to run away without some lucky crits or a stacked reckoning bomb.
---
Assuming your feature functions just like the LFG tab in retail it will 100% hinder social interaction. My proof is in retail. People create groups, wait for the list to populate, then hit the invite button on the classes/ilvl players they want. You're right there is the option to right click a player and begin a conversation, however in practice no one does. It removes the NEED for interaction. In retail you can create a group, click invite 4 times and never say a word. That is unequivocally bad and should not be in classic.

---
A balance druid would never be in the same group as the healers for mana tide, you'd be in a group with 4 mages/warlocks.
---
You're delusional if you think some people won't drop off in phase 1. There's nothing wrong with liking classic and disliking retail (that's literally this sub) but don't be callous to the fact that not everyone shares your opinion and may not want to solely play classic from the moment it comes out. 
---
I agree with your statement about it having a casual demographic appeal however, Activision-Blizzard has created an environment where people want to be rewarded with shiny thinks for little to no effort. If you've played retail in the last 4 years you have no doubt seen the people in LFR/dungeons after every kill "LOL wow still no loot/omg 3 bosses and nothing F\*\*\* this game!" 
---
Your gross over generalizations of "  Classic at every point of the game demands you slow down and take it seriously." or " Classic is engaging from the minute you start playing unlike retail "  are what starts bitter childish back and forths on this sub about who's dad can beat the other one up.
---
Lesbian dwarf priest hiding her urges from the light.  Dabbling in shadows and discipline.

Well I hope that is true.
---
If it lasts 4 (like Vanilla) - 6 months in P1 it would be atrocious and kill the momentum entirely.
---
I have 40 fruit cakes.  On my character.  They are the best food in the game.  Just incase I need one.   I am a rogue.

Go warrior because you will be happy at 60.
---
Good luck getting there though.
---
They dungeon groups are usually called cleave groups. They cleave everything down, it is quite quick
---
Much of the allure of Classic WoW is about permanence, your decisions actually matter. You can't suddenly change your race in a D&amp;D tabletop game because it just wouldn't make any sense and takes away from any meaning your previous decision on race had.
---
Classic WoW is a true RPG
---
I'm assuming any word that is commonly used to describe skin color is banned. People mentioned that Yellow and Black are banned as well.  
---
I'm going to get downvoted for saying this, but it's a good call on their part. Those names aren't creative or interesting anyway.
---
Hey man ! I already saw your excellent post on warrior macros, you're a legend. You make an excellent point for the pvp weaknesses of a non spammable macro.
---
Thank you for your insight and making a non modifier keys macro that seems so damn epic, I'm looking forward to testing it ! :)
---
While slaughtering each other like there is no tomorrow in Silithus, because the entire lvl 60 Server population suddenly has something to do in the SAME AREA; which is a flat, desert wasteland with no way to hide.
---
Sure, the NPCs don't wage war.
---
But other than retail, Classic is about what WE do, not what the NPCs tell us is happening ^^
---
Happy cake day!
---
Engineering ends up being more of an endgame profession - with tailoring you could make your own bags, make yourself some Truefaith Vestments, and a few other things, then drop it for engineering late game if you want.
---
Tailoring and enchanting level well together as well, since you can DE pieces that you make with tailoring.
---
Not really.  I've been playing WoW on and off again since launch in 2004.  I originally rolled on Frostwolf, a PvP server.  There were only few times, at most, when open world PvP made my leveling harder.  
---
It was always fun running into Alliance at a dungeon portal and fighting them but most times we just ran into the portal.  If you don't want to be corpse camped you don't have to be.  I never understood people complaining about it when all you had to do is rez at the GY, wait a minute and go do something else in the zone.
---
Open world PvP is more of a minor annoyance on a PvP server than anything else.
---
Teacher: You only have one homework problem tonight.
---
Me: Oh shit this has subsections a through j, wtf!
---
are they going to swap again next time a server opens if they don't get their names here?
---
Let's be real though. Ain't nobody gonna watch WWE jousting without infinite Pepsi. It's part of the core experience.
---
im sure that guy is dead by now
---
It's really, really bad here. Every few weeks the sub finds something new to complain about, claims it will ruin classic, then when it turns out to be a non-issue or resolved they move on to the next thing. Sometimes it's literally just an idea of something Blizzard *could* do that popped into their heads, and their only evidence is "dude, it's *Blizzard*, of course they'll do it". Then they'll argue to the death that it's going to happen and anyone who says otherwise is a shill.
---
https://classicdb.ch/ is closer, though
---
troll cant.
---
Tailoring is a very good choice for gear (early and late game) and bags.      
---
Enchanting is actually not a great early choice because it's a pretty big gold sink. Like the wands are good, but every other person trying to level enchanting will have an abundance of wands so you'll be able to get one cheap. You'll make more gold early on by vendoring/AHing greens rather than DEing them.     
---
       
---
Engineering is certainly a good profession choice, but not early on. It's something you pickup at 60 and powerlevel. 
---
      
---
Personally, I'm going skinning tailoring. Apparently skinning and simply vendoring the leather is a solid choice on a fresh server start.
---
I doubt the streamer server will only have 3. Maybe 15.
---
The races have virtually no difference for PVE.
---
Main for solo, alt for grp play, alt for playing with the bf
---
It doesn't really matter what the ratings are i'm gonna be a druid
---
Join the Grobmob
---
In theory they are supposed to get rid of layering once they reach a certain treshhold of activity. 
---
In the worst case scenario, should they not limit somehow the accces to a popular server despite having layering then they could end up with crazy things like 25+ layers and at this point even if 90% of the playerbase leave a few weeks later you'd still have much more players on that server than what vanilla was designed around.
---
That's pure speculation but i think Blizzard has an estimation of how many players will stay active a few weeks in and will cap the layered servers with that % in mind.
---
Layering may increase the server capacity by maybe 10 for launch but it would be hard to remove should they launch without any restrictions
---
As a new player this makes no sense to me
---
2 toons yo
---
My husband and I plan on playing together. :-)
---
If you want to play shaman, don’t play paladin.
---
WARLOCK my friend.
---
Everyone needs your summons and lock rocks.
---
It's going to be hilarious when everyone realizes there's no summoning in classic, because it is suuuuch a crutch in retail.
---
Warlock summons are a BIG DEAL.
---
From what I was reading balance finally got the the gear they needed in aq40 and above.  I was thinking of going druid with a mind to go balance at high level.  (feral while leveling, I am not an idiot).
---
which ones of these do you only need one per group, and which ones does everyone need to enter the instance?
---
OSRS are welcome here any time, hard to deny they've played at least some small part in making this happen
---
I have two terrariums, one is a Chilean Rose Tarantula and the other is my Witblit Bearded Dragon
---
Oh? Are we sure of that, thought i saw a bunch of talk that it was a private server only thing.
---
Cope
---
tyty!
---
add servers...and then what?
---
blizzard says 'if you haven't logged on in the last X days/weeks, you're getting moved to one of these new servers we're opening'?
---
You actually get every item from that dungeon, you wont split anything :D
---
Shadowguard is way better for PvP. Procs Blackout and low cost. Plus you have a MS.
---
Yeah I feel like that would be really hard. I don't know how different our playtimes will end up being, it will probably end up being a bit random sometimes.
---
Can't imagine what that sounds like! 😐
---
Well this didnt age well.
---
I appreciate it
---
Really boils down to if you want to get chain feared or if you want to potentially stun melee for a few seconds while you run/heal. Matter of play style and if you're more group PvP or 1v1 PvP oriented.
---
good they don't exist on horde then 🤟
---
Well same thing happens if you make tbc and wotlk servers you split the community 3 ways

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqc9eo/the_nordic_community_has_revised_its_previously/). 
---
I find you can tank dungeons even when you're pure fury. I don't think it matters until late game, and it would only slow down your levelling.
---
Awesome. Let's do this.
---
I am gonna make a character on Gehennas aswell tonight. Then I'll have 1 on all PVP servers. I'll wait until release to see which server seems the least shitty. 
---
So far Shazzrah is looking like a shithole, the discord anyway. I know it isnt a good indication of what all people on there will actually be like. But at least I can avoid the people on that discord, a great advantage to start off with. 
---
With the Nordic people moving over to Gehennas I probably will aswell. I always enjoyed playing with them. Their English is great and overall I have very positive experiences with them. And Gehennas will probably have no, or at least a shorter, queue on launch day.
---
Depends, if you play mostly the same try and wait. If not try to make time to run dungeons together.  That's best way to learn your rolls anyway and how to communicate.  Gonna have plenty to do together at 60
---
The first launch of wow I had a group of friends that set level restrictions.  Like basically I'm going to stop at level 22 and wait for you guys.  Realistically what works is yeah I'm 32 but I'll come tank wailing caverns for you.
---
Priest and warrior are another story they always could use some help.
---
I am still mad they took away my Keymaster achievement.
---
I too have a beardie! love her to death. She is Witblit. Also have a Chilean Rose tarantula
---
SM ruin is going to be way more popular so you dont have to respecc for pvp.  Even if you dont get the corruption slot for nightfall, you lose 5% damage over DS ruin.  Which is not the end of the world, especially if you play horde where you will be threatcapped more than you will dps early on because of the lack of salvation.
---
Warlock and Spriest are both good at PVP.  With good gear and team you can probably heal non lvl 60 dungeons as a spriest to level.
---
End game may be hard to find a raid spot as a spriest, easy as a healer.  Why not both and see which one sticks? No need to rush to 60.
---
This is me. Im mainly concerned with ganking so ill be speccing that way.
---
Haven't played pala on private, was ret in vanilla and I played PvP (dresshealing for raiding ofc :)
---
Pick whether you like the faction or class more. Main one, alt the other. 
---
If you like Enhance, Ret is good. If you like Resto, any healer works. If you like Ele, Mage is probably the best alternative. 
---
If you like all 3, consider Druid. Balance certainly isn't great in PvE, but can have occasional big crits and is good at hit and run in PvP. Feral and Resto are good in both
---
Had nothing to do with names lol.
---
They even said once the 2 first servers were offical that it was subject to change if a new one comes due to spreading out from the first overpopulated ones.
---
chill the fuck out boys
---
all 3 servers are gonna be FULL
---
BUT WHATS THE NAME REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Why do you have to ask that? It would show role and level. There is no reason it would function differently in classic than in retail.
---
Yes you will be at a 25% disadvantage, dwarf is the better rogue vs rogue duelist by a long shot
---
You’re a grobblin at heart 💕
---
Doesn't leveling multiple characters feel a bit overwhelming though?
---
I'm going to level my main mostly by myself and play an alt with my girlfriend if she decides she wants to play. If some of my friends decide they want to play then I'll start another character for that.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you. I don't consider pvp to be a huge burden when levelling; if anything it's a refreshing change of pace.
---
But even if you only define it as a minor annoyance, it's a minor annoyance that only exists on pvp servers. Even if only by a small amount, this means that levelling on a pvp server is more difficult than on a pve server.
---
If you want to make the point that levelling on a pvp server isn't that much harder than a pve server, there's an argument to be hard there. But if you're trying to say that levelling on a pvp server and pve server are the same, well, you've already contradicted yourself.
---
Also to say you don't have the lockpick skill for the chests, then snag it alone after everyone left.
---
Delusional
---
/bumpfist appreciate it!
---
Gnome dude. Easy pick. The intellect is kinda nice, and so is their escape. You are gonna need it to get away from all the horde shamans.
---
The only leveling advantages engineering will give you is an increased toolkit to deal more damage to mobs or protect yourself in WPvP. One thing to consider is that leveling engineering is very time consuming especially if you have to buy all your mats off the AH since you won’t have mining. 
---
In my opinion engineering is not worth having while you level. I’d suggest tailoring/enchanting if you set of being an enchanter. However, Enchanting only really gives you a decent want before level 20, quest wands are better going forward. I’d go with two gathering professions to make money and stock up for consumables while you level then switch your profession to the ones you really want at 60 such as tailoring or engineering.
---
As a mage when I would fight gnomes I would grenade right after a frost nova because the cast time for escape artist and grenade are the same, so 9/10 times they would just waste the one advantage they had.
---
Honestly, the only thing I disliked from your list is the class homogenization. Everything else I'm either nuetral on or actively enjoyed.
---
Do Pixels next
---
No respecs
---
When youre so insecure about your realm choice u gotta rag on the others
---
Thats not quite how it works.  You are queued in the gateway.  The realm has dynamic expansion, so yes it has a cap, but it will continually split the influx of people into layers.  
---
Yes, it did USED to make you wait for people to get out of the server
---
Yeah. IIRC Divine Storm did holy damage, which wasn't mitigated by armor. And there was no holy resistance either, so it was essentially true damage. It got nerfed pretty quickly, and thus was born the meme about nerfing ret paladins "TO THE GROUND BABY".
---
Yea three low level warriors cleaving, that’s going to work great!
---
I'm going between hunter, priest, and shaman.
---
I'd heal primarily as priest or shaman. I have a couple buddies that I'll be leveling with rolling warrior and priest... But for the end game having two priests in our guild won't be bad at all lol. I kind of want to heal, but pure dps sounds fun too.  Also I enjoy the kiting and control aspect of hunter pvp
---
That's not how you make a twitch clip
---
It's a Seinfeld joke, he loved using those in trade to get a ride out of someone.
---
I keep making small changes to my reserved toons based on my beta characters. First was her hairstyle, now I gotta go back in and change her piercings. I’m glad I rolled mage bc when I was planning to main nelf I had a daily crisis on hairstyle AND color.
---
^^^^^^
---
=0 got me
---
Hell no, someone else will do that shit.
---
An add-on wouldn't be able to do anything the standard keybind UI can't do. So no. If anything you'd need a 3rd party program that maps controller keys to the keyboard.
---
Neat plates is similar. I haven't tested it though.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/neat-plates/files/2761666
---
You were the top hunter on your server and you don't know that survival is a top tier PvP spec?
---
By the way, going prot is legit for PvP healers.
---
I like the male dwarf dance better, but overall animations and uniqueness I prefer female.
---
I got the name Beardless too which I think suits a dwarf female perfectly.
---
The windfury proc does seem very interesting, atleast when your not on the wrong side of the axe
---
It never seemed worth the cost &amp; effort to me especially when you're questing, but if others disagree fair enough.
---
&gt;My point was that retail isn't immediately appealing from the second you make a character. Which again is just factual.
---
This is an opinion OP, not a fact. A fact would be that today is August 14th. You gave yourself away
---
Someone mind explaining me why they are so fucking angry? I honestly don't understand anything why they are mad
---
Fury dps is one of the top contenders. You'll probably get people asking you to tank but if you just explain that you don't like it the majority will understand. I know I'd rather have an enthusiastic tank than one that isn't having fun, especially since you can't just queue for another one. But people will absolutely bring a fury warrior as serious dps in groups
---
I'm on the fence about maining a DPS warrior spec, I'm not a good tank (and vanilla tanking is apparently even more involved so fuck that) I'm not looking to be top tier raider or anything but will I actually  be able to get slots as DPS war?   
---
Also, my friend who I will probably be leveling with is a prot main, am I fucking him over in terms of gear progression by playing warrior too?
---
&gt;looking to tank dungeons for my group of friends
---
Then do it. If you like the playstyle of calling the shots and controlling the fight, be the tank.
---
&gt;viable druid (or even) paladin tanking is
---
Druid tanking is possible, lots of guilds use them as offtanks, but it isn't great, and Paladin is pretty horrible because if you run out of mana, you can't hold threat.
---
If you want to do end game content or raiding as a tank, you really HAVE to be a warrior.
---
I will be leveling a warrior. You don't have to level in tank spec, most casual dungeons would require a decent shield and some other gear that can let you tank. Leveling in arms is usually faster for solo play. But here is the thing, you can be quite effective with a healer buddy or small group.
---
Plus instead of solo playing, you could just run lots of dungeons. If your group is fast, a lot of people would probably want to do a second run.
---
Melee cleave groups are going to be insanely fast.  There's a lot of videos/guides talking about it.
---
2 weeks off work, fuck my fans fuck my work fuck my friends
---
Do you by chance have a link to a talent calculator for this spec?
---
The Ony chain was so memorable on ally side. The final turn in...walking through the city in rp walk mode to go confront onyxia in the castle...NPCs yelling shit and then getting into the castle and all hell breaks loose...level 60 dragonkin attacking everything and everyone from level 10s to 60s...then ony transforming and this big ass dragon is just in the castle...aaah memories.
---
Leave the Vent or I'll have you bent.
---
How do I look at potentially joining one of these? None of my friends went Horde - Fairbanks and I am looking for some chill people to play/level with.
---
This isn’t for me really, I have my groups set for the most part, but I’m trying to get the best system to keep classic popular
---
Yeah I’m trying to imagine going back and watching hundreds of hours of boring and tedious leveling. Not to mention, I’m pretty ugly to look at
---
Laughs in EBITA.
---
&gt;Be correct\*
---
There's quit a gap between having consistent moderation and being presidential lol
---
A good warlock plays in the back line and dots every fucking thing they see. When nightfall procs you can 2 shot other players. Run Succy to charm/CC players. Keep Deathcoil handy for when shit gets hairy. Learn to fear kite players.
---
Locks are high priority in PvP because they can cause a lot of havoc from far away. As long as you don't let melee get too close to you you'll be kinda invincible. Will need very good situation awareness.
---
I loved making people rage during PvPing with my Lock :)
---
Yeah the Pallies figured it out a [couple months ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op9kWkI4F-I), it's been confirmed to still work on the beta and wasn't placed on the "not a bug list" so everyone is planning for it to function the same way on live Classic.
---
Unfortunately, there's been a ton of people saying "sit to crit doesn't work, that was a private server thing" but then when corrected they say "yeah but that's sit/stand crit, it's totally different from sit to crit".
---
I know in vanilla it used to not work, but it sounds like its different now.  I remember in vanilla having to constantly realm hop when a server when down.
---
This is the only change I support
---
Yeah true that. But if I made lunch every time I took a flight path I’d get awfully fat :D
---
KANGZ
---
As someone who didn't play the beta, what's the best way to install / find add-ons and ensure they work in classic?
---
https://youtu.be/uh02zvHHPzw
---
Warriors are expected to be able to tank five mans. You'll get a lot of flak if you are looking for a tank as a warrior and refuse to. Raiding will be fine as just dps, but you might be expected to off tank. If you really hate it with a passion then yes, rogue will be better.
---
I thought it was vanilla, but in hindsight I think your right. Just looked it up and it looks like it was path 2.2.
---
That will limit you some, but druids are really good dungeon tanks, and you can always tank yourself later on down the line.
---
this, also enemy cast bars not showing
---
Layering was never intended to fix queues.  Sure, less queues are a sideffect of laying, but not the main focus.  Layering is there to ensure that zones don't have a bajillion people in them all fighting for the same resources.
---
Queues will probably still happen as even with modern technology, having tens or hundreds of thousands of people all trying to log in at the same time will stress any system.
---
Right? I played ret, and adjusted my spec so my heal crits refunded my mana so I could throw spot heals all day long and it would drain my mana from dps, or buffs.

---
Right?  The number of people who think any solution that involves people not playing the game or think that server merges are the way to go is delusional and safe to ignore.
---
APES are also going Gehennas EU
---
Not much choice really.. 2 of the 3 EST PvP servers are full and the 3rd one is going to be full of all the non English speaking people that are in the same time zone. (Portuguese, Spanish, French Canadian etc.)
---
Yup but external HD’s are cheap and youbjust plug that in and select it as the destination
---
Does the enrire group need to be attuned to something, or is 1 person enough?
---
I may try to do some more of the iconic characters the servers are named after.
---
I know this was posted yesterday but its still killing me
---
I made a undead priest named Maynard. He will be giving speeches about holy holes and holy poles.
---
I told my friends I'm leveling another character whenever they aren't around
---
But I get the feeling that eventually we're probably just all going to diverge and level separately anyway. One friend has a baby coming 2 weeks after launch so the likelihood of him being on often enough for the rest of us is kind of slim, and another friend likes to disappear for whole weeks sometimes to do IRL shit so same story there.
---
I imagine we'll all level together until like 20 or something at least though.
---
It’s hard choice because i cant stand orgrimmar, and i live everything about the alliance leveling zones, cities and the races
---
Well damn. My guild was happy to be on a Scandi server as we have a few of them, as well as other nationalities. I thought Shazz was going to be the real international server but I guess people want to be in their own servers.
---
Go watch highlights of groups doing this on the beta.  Melee cleave groups are insanely fast at leveling.
---
Just a small question, since I don't have an active subscription, my friend reserved "my" name for me, let's say the name is Thex. If he deletes his Thex, will I be able to create my Thex right after? Or there is a timer that I have to wait?
---
Making a guild just for this. We got our discord set up. I will be playing a warrior. Mages are welcome &lt;3
---
While leveling it can be. Small bags don't afford space to organize unless you go with a one bag mod. When you're questing somewhere like westfall, your bags are easily filling with lots of junk. 
---
I use flight times or auto runs to sort bags.
---
It's much easier to sort bags higher levels since you're grinding different mob types less often as well.
---
a discord would be great. guild not so great since i have 20+ irl friends playing with me
---
Someone who wasn't them got Reddit coins.
---
Not everyone lurks Reddit hour after hour every single day.
---
It's not a hard rule. It "should be kept" to english but they won't ever ban someone for it.
---
Just to make it clear the Danish community is staying on Shazzrah as well. As you can see the "Nordic" coalition is 90% Swedish anyways.
---
I really got turned off to pvp because of gear stats like expertise and resiliencestuff. Suddenly it was not okay to pvp if you spent most of your time in pve. Both felt interchangeable in vanilla.
---

---
lol k. It'll just mean more money for Blizzard by way of realm transfer away from Thalnos once they all get tired of having to use a Brazilian dictionnary in order to form up a group in the trade chat a couple of weeks down the line.
---
Ultima is also running the Herod discord. What a weirdo
---
I'm stuck. Want to play a dps caster thats easy to level in a pvp realm and good for end game raiding. I'm between Warlock (UD/Orc), SPriest (UD/Troll), and Shaman (Troll/Orc). I like the versatility of these three all being able to self sustain or outright heal if i want to (which I've never mained). Open to suggestions!
---
For Warlock which spec levels best? I roll demonology but i've heard pet mgmt is crucial in vanilla. Also, is soul shard grinding as taxing as people say? 
---
For Priest would my gear be the same for Shadow/Holy or would i have to farm separate sets? and how difficult is healing? I've never mained heals before
---
For Shaman is totem/spell management as big of a pain as people are saying? 
---
Bonus Q: Can anyone tell me what to expect in RPPVP realm?
---
Lots of failures and practice. I usually start with a rough outline in pencil, sketching out major forms like the big body, little head and legs. Then will add some more details in pencil. Eventually going back over in pen and erasing the pencil. Makes it look a lot more finished.
---
Not sure if I should still roll on Shazz or switch over to Gehennas.
---
It depends. The raids require everyone be attuned.
---
Yeah, if I recall, the elites had weaknesses to certain rogue abilities that actually made them pretty easy if you knew what to do.
---
I think since I won't have the time to raid getting every race class combo you want to 60 would be a good long goal you can do at your own pace!
---
Don't play a race that you hate. Loving your character is more important than that extra button. 
---
A small part of you will cringe every time you see the other troll mages and you wish you were a troll.
---
Then when you spend hours farming for 100 gold and finally get on that shitty dead horse, you are gonna hate it, because it moves like an old plastic action figure.
---
Then when you see the awesome colourful raptors bouncing around fluidly you are gonna be jealous.
---
When you log in an your undead talks like an 80 year old smoker you are gonna hate him.
---
When you click on a troll NPC and he is says some troll bullshit like 'ZAAZZU!" you are gonna wish you were a troll.
---
Don't do it for the racial my friend.
---
Luckily I have USB extenders and can see my screen from the en-suite.
---
Get off your alternate account OP
---
My friend took two weeks off for ti and classic, I’m so jealous
---
If world pvp interests you even slightly go pvp server and never look back.
---
Same with EU Servers, EU PVP FUll, German Servers both FULL, both Russian LOW, both French LOW ;D ahha
---
Are these on castbox?
---
I'm SivHD, this is my juke school
---
That sounds incredibly expensive. As a priest there is a very limited farming potential. As you level if you take enchanting expect to be broke. If you on top of that leveled engineering (twice if you want to minmax it) you will be buying your ore and stone, which also will be super expensive due to the demand. Unless you have a guild backing your profession this is going to lead to a bad time.
---
Better to just buy wands
---
Thanks! That's another recommendation for SM/ruin, I'll look into it
---
yea its a meme spec
---
Iol and Kek are mine!
---
I've made an addon called Personal Shopper that you can use to automate the purchase of items! It's super lightweight and just uses slash commands. Essentially you can create a shopping list and each time you visit the vendor, the addon will check whether you have all of the items from your shopping list (including a configurable quantity) in your inventory. If you don't have enough of the item, the addon will automatically buy that item up to the specified quantity. I foresee it being very useful for things like reagents, ammunition, and pet food. I have only tested it in retail as I do not have beta. But if you're interested, here's a link to my github page! I will have a classic version working asap.  
---
 [https://github.com/Cormeer/PersonalShopper](https://github.com/Cormeer/PersonalShopper)
---
**This is freaking gold.** Favorite GuildName/RP so far. (Although a fishing guild on Grobbulus comes pretty close)
---
Sounds like my dream situation, but I'm stuck playing as horde and on a non-RP server.
---
And half my friends are on Herod half on Faerlina.  Goddammit, lol
---
Neither do I. That’s not an excuse to not use a search bar
---
Shaman would complement the warrior/priest pair nicely, though you're right another priest wouldn't hurt. Hunter would work and is quite fun. Don't underestimate the kiting ability of shaman though, between earthbind and frost shock you can keep an enemy slowed pretty much constantly.
---
What's your target for /played?
---
Warlocks are great for dungeons, because you're not restricted by debuff slots (As far as I know it will be 16) and provide good dmg and CC(Fear + banish), but due to the limited debuff slots you will mostly spam shadow bolt in raids, and maybe refresh a debuff if you're the dedicated warlock for that debuff. 
---
You also have to farm some soul shards before the raid to provide health stones, soulstones and ports.
---
Blizzard had Legion launch flawlessly on servers like Stormrage and BfA (Mostly fine) across the board.
---
I have faith in them for Classic. There will be queues but I don't expect server death.
---
Official.
---
Can’t tell either. God I hope this guy isn’t serious
---
Awesome!!
---
It's not getting corrupted from being on storage, it's corruption creating/saving the file. Default save settings on programs like OBS corrupt the file if it doesnt close the recording properly. Your system locks/crashes you lose your whole recording session.
---
Chocolate milk sucks anyway.
---
Thank you for putting in the work
---
My girlfriend has been traveling for work for around 8 months now so it’s been long distance that whole time. She finally come back September 1st so I’m fucked when it come to WoW time.
---
I think I'll stick to peeing in a bottle and performing an enema 2 hours before launch so I don't have to poop for 2 days.
---
I've never been a fan of world PvP. A lot of a-hole tendencies tend come out because of it, and I wouldn't be surprised if this was the core of the toxity evident in WoW.
---
Recount worked for me in StressTest, but tbh Details! looks like it may be better functionally.
---
APES are going on Gehennas now
---
The Brits are still on Shazzah
---
nah
---
Both Warrior and Rogue are the two best melee dps, and as far as raiding goes you would have no trouble getting a spot as a dps warrior. But during leveling people may expect you to tank dungeons, although you don’t necessarily need to be tank spec and throw on a sword and board, or get another warrior to do it.
---
I think UBRS was originally a 10 man. The reduced the difficulty on it before the end of vanilla to a 5 man.
---
Why bring layering into it? People using anti afl stuff will have the same effect whether there is layering or not.
---
I started working as a Sys Admin last August and learning about virtualization of servers was the coolest thing of the job so far. Being able to just boot up a new server with a click of a button and doing modifications on the fly is awesome. Kinda wish I learned more about visualization in school instead of the basic knowledge of one server per box.
---
Count Up From Classic perhaps?
---
As a Finn Shazzrah.
---
same with ret, you could basically one shot people, with shadowmourne you could solo bgs as well
---
Damn you got me.
---
I'm pretty  partial to the tauren shaman myself
---
Beast mastery hunter is the literal proven best leveling character in the game, what do you mean “lol”
---
ITT: Computer scientists(🤘) and people suffering from the Dunning-Krueger effect(😢)
---
I hate to make recs based on leveling speed. If you are focused and care about speed, you're talking about a ~10-20% speed difference between lock and war? Play the class you want to press the buttons for. End of story
---
Esc, dey, kraig
---
Fairbanks!  I have a character on whitemane too though just in case! 
---
What about you ?
---
Multiple servers are full, because blizzard is retarded and made 4 pvp servers in Na and Sa
---
I mean, you could still roll on Faerlina. It's not like the whole server is streamers, there's still going to be normal people too (myself and 20+ others decided to roll there anyways). We're playing horde (and all the cool streamers are horde anyways. If esfand was Horde, it'd be even better).

---
If you think swedes will be the majority on any realm then you are dreaming, every realm will have people from all over Europe.
---
Yes there will be a large amount at the beginning. However the herd will thin out due to the difficult and long leveling time. They will most likely be a top 3 most popular class but don’t worry, play what you like. Warriors are usually in high demand for any group.
---
Barrens chat will also always be toxic. But yeah, low probability of actually playing with those dorks.
---
Working in the IT industry I know what you're saying is true. Every technical issue people are having I'm confident won't be an issue at launch. I have faith in Blizzard. (I am expecting some login queues)
---
I do wish they were more open about what they are testing and the results of those tests but that is the developer in me wanting those details. 
---
Have faith people and enjoy it. Blizzard want this to be a success as much as we do.
---
Most people have Mechanical keyboards nowadays, just run a macro to type some bs and hit enter and back out on a delayed loop.
---
It appears that quite a few of the norweigans and danes are staying yea. The Fins and Swedes are still moving and the Swedes more or less make up 80% of this "coalition" so its still a big part moving.
---
But its good youre comment is the highest since its relevant for those players!
---
I'm sure we do
---
We're indeed a group of 5. Me, my SO, a friend that I really enjoy playing WoW with and he's bringing two friends as well. Me and my friend already know what to expect of vanilla, considering he played it and I played wrath - pre rdf wrath as well. My SO plays retail (started in BFA, poor thing) and the other two dudes never really played WoW seriously aside from a casual Private Server here and there, never reaching max level nor doing content.
---
So it's an interesting group but we'll see how well the new blood enjoys classic. Hell even for me it will be mostly novelty.
---
So long as you have 1 friend that is leveling a healer, you should be set. My wife, and I, are playing together. She's going to main a Shaman, with a little bit of healing to keep me rolling forward, and DPS for the giggles. We're just gonna have to make sure we have lots of food, and water.
---
Ret was stupid strong in pvp with some bwl gear. Hand of justice trinket had chance on hit extra attack, seal of command did the same thing. They  could proc off of eachother. That happened a lot id be one shotting the crap out of people.
---
clearly they mean do not spend your gold at the auction house.
---
&gt; Rotface &amp; Putricide? Saurfang?
---
Do you mean Rotface and Festergut? They were too simple and easy. Barely had mechanics and required close to no raid synergy. 
---
Putricide was hard but the fight and mechanics were fucking aids. 
---
&gt; Both blood quarter bosses?
---
The council was just annoying and not particularly hard. Vampire boss, again, not much going on. Somewhat fun if you get bitten early though. 
---
I wasn't a big fan of the LK fight either, way too long with stretches that weren't particularly hard. You ended up wiping after 15 minutes to a fucking defile. 
---
Nah, in my opinion it doesn't come close to Firefighter, Knock x 3 or alone in the darkness. Those were legit fucking hard and really cool.
---
Troll priest is pretty great. Chad Tauren Shaman might win overall
---
Queue
---
Only going to talk about the ones I know about:
---
Mage was and is my main and I love the class so much, so I'm biased, but it sounds like if you love magic and efficiency then it might be a good choice for you. AOE is definitely an option, and portals to the major cities will also help you guys out. You can sheep and slow mobs if things get dire, and have water+food for the both of you when you need it.
---
I haven't played Shadow Priest but I've been exploring it as a main for Classic, and people say that it can hold its own on the damage department while offering plenty of healing. But the answers I've gotten also say you'll be wanding a lot as Shadow Priest for the sake of mana, so if you're concerned about boring rotations then you will hit that point as a priest during leveling.
---
Orc or Troll Shaman?
---
Orc or Troll Hunter?
---
Orc or UD Lock?
---
Was hunter that disadvantaged in vanilla? Should I perhaps make a Mage instead? But I’d like to have some melee instead of all casters/ranged... I leaned toward warrior for awhile but might hold off for later because of the slow leveling process... then I wanted to play a rogue but I’m honestly terrible at rogue when it comes to any pvp situation, they’re just fun for my own pve time... but I also want to pvp eventually...
---
I know this is all opinion in the end but I’d like to hear the bullshit. At this point I just need to pointlessly hear/ramble about WoW on the daily or I’ll explode.
---
I would look up some of the individual guides mentioned within Guidelime, as it is just guidehub basically where people can upload their own guides, or guides' of others. For example you can look up Hakurai's or Sage's guides and see if you like them, then use Guidelime to have them in game
---
THese are all cute and fun. love it!
---
My buddy's last name is Black. Imagine being told your name is mature content
---
You people saying this are stupid af. The US vg polls show like 20 to 40 people total, and not all of them are going to whitemane in the first place.
---
The best English speakers are Scandinavians in Europe so it'll be good.
---
I might do it. I was debating on it. I have a webcam set up to record my cats, and OBS is set up with everything and I think it looks pretty nice? My only issue was that I originally was going to level completely alone, but now I'll probably level with my brother, and he may not be okay with being streamed. Guess I'll ask! It'd be pretty awesome to have the files just to edit fun stuff later if anything hilarious or fun happens. :D We've all had that sick win/save that we wished we could see again...
---
&gt; I can do all of that within the game already.
---
You can, because other people do. If half the playerbase decides that discord is a better option for finding groups, you're not going to have a good time ignoring it
---
it rly doesnt matter one bit.
---
This is highly accurate.
---
As long as swedes r gone im good with Shazzrah.
---
No matter if they add a queue or not it's not going to change the # of people on each server, and therefore will not impact the ability to remove layering down the road.
---
They already shot themselves in the foot on that by making literally 2 servers lmao
---
So the fact that right now the servers are up and you can sit at the character select screen is a good start. Just wait for the timer to drop to 0 and you should just get to play.
---
I’m going to be pretty far ahead of the crowd at that point I think, I’ll be playing 24hrs straight. So there’s a fair chance I’ll either have to solo or wait for another rogue.
---
Came here to say just this.  Load balancing stateless HTTP requests is a cake-walk compared to managing TCP sockets, especially at this volume. OP is full of it, probably gilded himself.
---
Imagine being told your name is mature content
---
Yeah I was really enjoying having the old totems back.  Earthbind saved my ass more than once when gets hit with a mass respawn and I've gotta get the F away from the adds.
---
&gt; And that wouldn’t have happened if half the player base (streamers) didn't claim one server and the other half (Anti-streamers) claim the other, leaving the last one to be claimed by the BR/LATAM community which nobody wants to play with.
---
FTFY
---
You consider druid as one of the more fun classes?
---
DBM is made by some random player. Big wigs is made by hardcore raiders and usually has more advanced/useful warnings. Recount because I've always preferred the UI. I've tried vuhdo but the options are unfamiliar to me and I have a much easier time navigating and setting up healbot for tracking debuffs/setting macros hotkeys. Moveanything didn't work for me maybe I had a bad link.
---
Dwarf. Fear ward OP.
---
You’ll have to point them out to me then because all I’m seeing is multiple videos from the same person that basically says “doing this is faster than leveling solo as a warrior”. Or are you talking about when everyone was stuck at level 30 with literal BiS gear? Are you going to stop at 30 to get three whirlwind axes?
---
How dare you not wanting to spend a little Mana to help out your fellow Players? You must be Horde, they are all like that! :p
---
OMG you should NOT have told me that, the old 29 community had a long tradition of TTS shenanigans but none of us used discord until we started coordinating for classic so we did not even know it was a thing!
---
I crashed it once and then restarted and tried right again.
---
I did this on vanilla, albeit unwittingly. I was in college so I played until 5 am EST anyway..
---
There's no real upside to joining a server 3 hours behind unless you're playing the auction house before people get home from work and school. There's the raid implications you mentioned, too. I think the east servers will calm down after a few weeks - but they'll still be relatively full. I played Area 52 for years and rarely had queues even though it was full 24/7. What is the shitshow you're trying to avoid? Launch layering is supposed to alleviate questing crowds, and if the stress test was any indication it worked only too well, if anything.
---
ABSOLUTELY!
---
why not word it that way, saying avoid it when it's the best way to make gold is confusing
---
Yes. This is exactly why my class choice has been so difficult. I have qualms with everything. See that one other reply regarding shamans.
---
Are you seriously trying to claim. A majority of wow players think leveling is good in retail? If I made the claim. A majority of Americans slavery is wrong. Do I need to take an actual survey? No of course not because so many people believe it it's obvious. Leveling in modern wow is broken. No matter what else you think about retail. Most people agree with that.
---
Not really but yours isn't really a source either. I guess Brits/English speakers are going on every server.
---
Who will shame me, though?
---
Not sure about Bagnon, but i think OneBag3 works!
---
It's good and bad. When theres too many and they're for important things then they gatekeep people without enough time. Because to an extent mmo content is a race even for the casual. If you want to attune to the current content so you can more likely find groups now then all these attunements are a wall. Not things to take your time on. Wait too long and you're just playing catch up and the game is that much harder. This was a very real problem. They're also exhausting resource wise sometimes. This isnt skyrim where we have all the time in the world. Obsolescence is a thing.
---
That said, not having them at all also sucks. Big epic quests scattered about were nice ways to landmark your power. The earth princess quest chain for example was epic. And ones like the class mount quests are unforgettable. I still have my Linken picture and boomerang in my bank. Early on when the world was still unexplored they were great ways to learn azeroth. Couldn't mount up and fly there so you had to hoof it and look for clues or ask for help.  Only reason I went to winter spring was for linken quest. And hillsbrad was a deter for my nelf rogue I was leveling over in ashenvale. I hadn't even touched EK at that point.
---
Balance in all things.
---
Ah. Too bad. The results or the outcome will be a bit skewed then if unattentive people start sharing "75% will play Shazzrah" as facts instead of actual live numbers. Im guessing a lot of people wont check back in or will and see the same without noticing its just based of 100 first.
---
Is there actually a Coalition? I mean it looks like you're all split...
---
I didn’t notice that when I responded I was at work lol, deleted it cause the info was dumb af my bad 😂 best option is Alta for leveling together then
---
Warlocks, they have summons. Everyone wants a warlock
---
Nope, that's what I used back then
---
Dont forget about dancing/stripping for gold. Even telling jokes for gold. 😂
---
Orcs are the coolest imo. But tauren are huge and that's always fun as a tank, and warstomp doesn't get enough love and is actually relevant in 5 mans.
---
Racials for general tanking: Tauren &gt; orc // troll &gt; ud
---
Coolness in my opinion: Orc &gt; troll &gt; ud &gt; tauren
---
That mix and mash reminds me of TBC leveling gear! Had to be horrible to have your character look like that.
---
Yea I need this.
---
Really could use some advice for healing as priest vs. dpsing as Warlock. My concerns are that priest healing in end game is extremely boring but I have heard there is some skill to it and room to outperform others, is this true? For warlocks, does the debuff slots actually push them into shadowbolt spam for the entirety of classic? They seem very good for pvp but the shadowbolt spam seems meh. I was also curious how they are in dungeons and if people really do look for other dps classes over them for both dungeons and raids. I have been seeing people say that warlock scales very well into the 2nd half of the expansion. Can anyone shed some light on this situation? Really stuck on which of the two I want to play as far as wanting to be competitive within my class and role.
---
The Native American community has switched from Herod-PvP to Faerlina-PvP due to our community's deep ties within the streamer community.
---
 nordicclassic.jinnis.se/
---
I think the biggest problem wow expansions created was scaling. The fact that your stats and damage go up so immensely over every expansion is absurd.
---
They should rescale everything so you never are able to one-shot or solo molten core bosses/mobs. Would make the world much more interesting
---
Old Penny Arcade was best Penny Arcade
---
Undead have a shorter run to UC but they're likely to pull mobs on the road so it can be dicey.
---
Orc or Troll I believe can make it all the way to Org easily enough without pulling but have a slightly longer of a run.
---
Don't mean to sound rude but it was literally planned for like 24 hours. Tons of blue-posts too.

"The trolls spam messaging me are gonna get worse"

Super helpful, thanks!

^^^ IT Professionals unite!
---
I'll just set my alarm clock for a couple hours after launch. Get a few hours in before going to work, should be fine.
---
If the stress test is anything to go by, everything will be fine 15 minutes after launch, but you never know.
---
Your memory must be short! i was in queue for 30 mins and that was just for name reservation, never mind server launch week. No matter what happens rolling on the new server is not a bad thing as im sure it will always have a full layer (3k people as far as im aware) rather than have 50k or so on Shazzrah
---
If you're somewhat close in playtime, convince your friends with the least time to give up on professions.  Work on professions as much as you can while solo.
---
If you play vastly different amounts, keep an alt at their level.
---
I'm in AZ, I get about 20-40 ms difference between Eastern and Western servers. It literally doesn't matter. In vanilla 300ms was the cutoff for a green latency bar. Playing on EU hosted private servers, it was 200ms. Spellbatching is on 400ms bundles. The difference between 30ms and 80ms literally doesn't matter.
---
Me and my buddy are interested. Both experienced gamers and off work during week of. He will be on a warrior and I will be on a feral. Let me know if interested.
---
Where did those estimates come from?
---
Literally gave me chills!
---
I am looking for an addon similar to Learn2Spell, where it would automatically replace your old spell/ability ranks with the new rank upon learning them. Anyone know if that's available yet?
---
Delete and repost to weekly thread before mods do it for u
---
Don't play a warrior casually. You will never make it to 60. It's like beating all 3 Dark Souls games, while your friends (other classes) are playing through Assassins Creed.
---
Not to mention, you can't just "jump in" and tank. It's friggen hard in classic. Holding aggro is a real bitch. In the old days DPS had to throttle back their spells and take it easy so they didn't pull aggro. Today you are going to be playing with all the retail DPSers who max/min their DPS and do everything in their power to top meters. They aren't going to go easy for you.
---
Every time I hear the word casual, I think - DONT GO WARRIOR.
---
Hunter disadvantaged in vanilla?  It’s the fastest leveler and excellent in world PvP and the first few phases in general.  Definitely not disadvantaged in most content people are actually going to experience.  And do you think your guild of friends is gonna gkick you if you get all the way to Naxx with them because your dps lags a little?  Seriously doubt it’s
---
most classes offers some level of support, but in general
---
Tank -&gt; control the fight
---
Heal -&gt; keep people alive (support)
---
DPS -&gt; Do damage without pulling off the tank or dying
---
The only real support role is healing
---
Druids remove magic and poisons, sleep beasts, root
---
Mages remove curses and summon food/water, sheep
---
Priests mana burn and mind control
---
Warlocks fear
---
Rogue Sap, blind
---
Hunters frost trap/slow/kite
---
Etc.
---
In real life, I am a human. Why would I want to play either; a human, a short, stocky human or a very tiny human. I just find the alliance very plain and boring, especially their cities.
---
I am quite biased as I grew up playing horde but I just love the idea of a misfit band of races banding together out of shared ideas/'unite against a common enemy'. 
---
Also the barrens as a 10-25 non contested zone is amazing!
---
I’m 16 but I’m NA. Ive been raiding naxx on private servers since I was like 12 lol
---
Depends on the player. Too many people are dedicated to "make it work" that they will tunnel vision. However if they are smart, they will spec into holy enough so they refund mana on a crit heal, and play with a "support" mentality. Rather than a damage mentality.
---
More than i'd like to admit.
---
Also because im still not *absolutely* set on the hair color i chose for my Dwarf.
---
Can't decide if to switch or not.
---
Less queues at launch compared to shazzrah and a smoother transition to remove layering but eventually could end up a dead server.
---
https://i.redd.it/52mr3euo1gg31.jpg
---
What about similar playtime but sometimes paired schedules and sometimes totally different?
---
Actually he does.  That's how modern datacenters work, everything is virtualized and you can spin up additional capacity on demand with a click of a button.
---
This sounds great for hunters so they don't mistakenly come to dungeons without full ammo.
---
Pretty sure getting the mallet is not required part of the questline that summons Avatar of Hakkar in Sunken Temple.
---
I am not a network expertnby any means, but one idea I had was that the limited number of servers was to estimate loads on live.  Sort of a population prediction based on early access.
---
The demand is fine... the supply is just rather high this time around.  My guild has twice as many warriors as the next class already.
---
Re: titles; they are against the ToS. Most of them were added to the mature language filter just as a way of keeping people from getting them (even though they're not actually mature). Titles include Dr but also I believe Sir, Lord, King, Queen, Prince, et cetera.
---
These days most of the things filtered aren't mature language; they're just against the ToS.
---
RP-PVP! Strong World PVP, healthy RP, and a more generally mature/dedicated player base.
---
Fuck yea, jump in! Bathe in the addiction and neglect your responsibilities! One of us!
---
Will playing on a PST server ever matter if I'm EST?
---
they announce it on forums, no one is going to Gehennas anyway, so don't worry
---
Does this mean I wont be able to play on it at all? I cant enter it to reserve a name on them.
---
Let me put it this way: what happens to the prices on the AH if there's 25,000 players and only a single layer?
---
I hope your right buddy.
---
I'll boot up my private server and count the chairs in the vanilla client.
---
I played in an RPPvE server during retail Vanilla and *we tried hard*, both in PvE and PvP content.
---
The only difference is people can mess around, dress up funny, tell in-character jokes, do events, etc.
---
Golemagg pvp
---
They hated him because he told them the truth.
---
I am in the exact situation but I think I'll end up rolling an Alliance. I played horde during Wotlk, it just didn't feel right as I was Alliance all the time.
---
what colors ya got?  let me give some input
---
I'll have you know I've been biking this summer.  So I'm one of those things.
---
Haha... clearly not :)
---
So by the same logic britain shouldnt have joined the EU before solving its own problems?
---
[Horde] [Herod] [EST] [Hunter] LF raiding guild. I work in the medical field, so days I work can be long. 99% of the time I'll be at my PC and online by 8 PM, but I also have to wake up early, so about 11:30PM is my cut off for playing. Played on/off since release, but I didn't start raiding until WOTLK. I have always mained healers, but I'm switching things up to play Hunter. It will be a learning experience, so I'm looking for a group that will be supportive of the growing pains with a switch. I'd love a group of people who understand life outside the game is priority, but give it 100% on raid night.
---
I joined in WotLK too! :D Hopefully someone more familiar with Classic can chime in and offer better advice, but I agree with you: I don't think Classic is as conducive to alting.
---
That's actually one of the reasons I'm excited for it. I like the idea of having to pick one character, where everything gets bound to them (and not my entire account). If I were you, I wouldn't want to level more than one character either, but I'm planning to level solo, so I haven't really thought about how to handle leveling with other people.
---
Sorry I can't be of more help! :(
---
Keep your fingers crossed, I plan to attempt to Apple Store next week.
---
Xxik'illuxx is simply my Orc Warlock's demonic name.
---
I’m in the same boat as the guy above but I’m torn between priest and Druid. Can priests hold their own in wpvp if they’re not shadow? For example, running a PI spec? I love priests but I also love wpvp and one of the appealing parts of Druid is being able to heal and wpvp effectively in one spec (hotw)

---
stealth detection is OK, I think the game treats you as +2 levels higher when checking detection. If you really want to own the rogues, go human - but they know humans have decent detection so in a group they will attack the non-humans first. Otherwise the int bonus and escape artist is pretty awesome.
---
The real reason you want to be human is that reputation bonus for PVE
---
It's official, brazilians and french candians. Avoiding this server like the plague.
---
I've always been curious about these.  Question: If I was playing on an RP server without knowing it, what are some of the main differences I would notice as I go about my day to day.  What really stands out about the RP experience beyond what I might imagine- i.e.- people typing in olde english
---
There's a missing middle image here for the pre wotlk patch.
---
You want to go to Quel'Danas? Nah this'Paladin turf
---
Why did you recreate it anyway?
---
&gt;space paladin blood elves
---
Only the humanoid squid-goats were from space. The BE were there in vanilla (they just used recolored night elves... ) Even the lore has them from azeroth.
---
I would think it would work, no idea as well. If I wasn't maining a Mage instead of a Rogue that was actually my intention to level as a Hemo rogue.
---
That was actually my original inspiration for an addon, lol. I was a noob hunter way back in the day and I wanted to alleviate the suffering.
---
why no naxx names
---
Naise
---
I don't know if this is true, because I played in an RPPvE server during retail Vanilla and our guild was a hardcore progression guild.
---
In fact there were two guilds on our server (on our faction) that were on the cutting edge of raid progression.
---
That was exactly my point. Paladins can focus on int&gt;+heal&gt;Crit&gt;mp5 and basically never run oom because of the Crit talents. Meaning it’s not solely from the “short cast time and +healing!” As our misguided friend would like to have us believe
---
I've never played battle pets. I've never been a collector. That said, I don't think this was really a bad addition to the game. Pretty harmless. (Except when the weekly quest was a pet battle one. Fuck that).
---
Free Also, Horde and Alliance will be working together. Just in a more unofficial and economically damaging way. Yay server discords, amirite?
---
They are all in Paris
---
Purely this.
---
From the Addon description in my provided link:
---
"Spell timers addon for all classes.
---
- Multi-target
---
- Good default whitelist
---
- Totem timers since 1.13.8
---
- Timers are customizable for each spell
---
- Optional nameplate timers
---
- Supports groups, priorities, dot/gcd ticks and a lot more"
---
yes, you just put /tts test
---
Keep in mind everyone will hear it, in voice or not if text channel is open on there computer then they will hear the TTS. You can turn it off/on in your discord settins&gt;Text&amp;Images. Also, you can give roles on your server the ability to do this.
---
you seem to care pretty much considering your previous post lol
---
Imagine thinking moderation only applies to a cartoony make believe game from 2004.
---
The Druid is capable of doing everything you listed. Not the best, but brings tools that others don’t. Lots going on with mobility and tactics.
---
You’ll enjoy stealth in the beginning too, as there will be many ganking.
---
Just depends if you can make raid times. If the guild is hosting a raid at 7PM PST, can you make it at 10PM EST for 3-4 hours?
---
So you're saying blizzard willfully screwed people out of names despite being logged in 30 mins early? They intentionally kicked me to log in screen right as I tried to make a char, then after 30 minutes signed me into an Oceanic server I had never come close to clicking as I'm in NA? Just to fight namebots, all the while requiring a paid sub to take part? Damn lets praise blizz!
---
My fav streamer gonna make a guild in which I’ll join. There’s no special requirements for this, but I’m a beginner in WoW, especially in classic, so I can’t decide for which race/class should I play, but we all gonna play for a Horde. The guild is not for “clear/complete all kind of end-game stuff”, it’s mostly, u know, for the soul, just for streamer’s subs and followers for chatting and play for pleasure
---
they would probably do it anyway at least two more times before the launch
---
The Gnome mage is awesomely hilarious - that’s exactly how ridiculous Gnomes are!
---
Man and people have the spriest video I linked crap for not using many spells. This is significantly less
---
we ARE talking about macros
---
There almost certainly will be queues on launch... RIP hope I can get in too
---
and got paid for it. TO THE GOFUNDME MOBILE
---
As I said, they're harder to find, not non-existent.
---
&gt; if I am wrong come Aug 26, sorry for keeping the dream alive
---
You'll have to offer something better, like eating your shoe, or drinking a full bottle of tabasco sauce.
---
These kinds of explanations don't sit well with me because it's like they ignore the fact that it was a good game.  It hasn't become less of a good game just because the popular games coming out now are substantially different.
---
The game holds up really well, as is pretty strongly evidenced by all the private servers over the years.
---
It's easy to write people that enjoy it off as dire Hards or not representative, but the game was really popular in its day for a good reason, and that reason hasn't changed.
---
A lot of people are looking for reasons to shit on classic, but a lot of those people will be converted when they play too.
---
I agree guilds will struggle with the 40 man roster stuff, though I don't think that will cause people to quit.
---
JUNGLE SORAKA OP
---
There's no way they can detect a package that mimics keyboard or mouse inputs.  Sorry bud.
---
Great quality content, thank you for this =)
---
The top guilds used group loot.
---
In retail, yes you always gear up DPS first. As a resto shaman, I was always last in the guild to get gear, even though I was an Officer. We geared our healers last, always. Whether using group loot or LC.
---
In Classic, you have to gear the MT asap. All gear will go to them. After that, it's pretty easy to distinguish DPS loot from Healer loot; there's some crossover, but not nearly as much as in BFA/retail.
---
Tiananmen Square
---
The number squishes are largely responsible for that though. In TBC it was still quite hard to do naxx, level 70 groups wiped in there. Meanwhile nowadays you get a 10000% damage boost and 10000% reduced dmg taken buff in not current raids, its quite silly.
---
They already did this. It was a huge thing.
---
The only answer is GROB.
---
If you guys don't have a macro that singles out someone who makes a mistake with "You're about as useless as a poopy flavored lollipop" then this whole endeavor is a waste of time.
---
Okay?
---
Originally it expanded as you leveled up, not sure if it's gonna be bottomless or not
---
As a swede whichs community doesnt like changed mid in we are going Shazzrah
---
Yep this is what I did. Installed them all through curse forge. There are also some that work from the retail versions though. Handy notes classic dungeons requires handy notes base which is only one version.
---
chances are you weren't sending real click-like input to the client, were using some common software they scan for, or played 24/7 for days
---
all of those are much more likely easy methods to detect botters than investing in complicated solutions to maybe possibly detect the few people who go out of their way to not get caught
---
Me and a firend tend to relive our childhood and replay classic together. When we cant play together just going to lvl an alt
---
Yes, but this is a big problem. Alot of people roll on RP server, because people are more grown up there, but without the intend to even try to behave a bit in character. This spirals out of controll pretty fast, ruining the server for people who actually want to do rp.
---
yes and im it doing to the point that it feels like i have a problem
---
I had that same happen but it was on a Wednesday.
---
Sounds like an absolute cancer mindset. You're not entitled to "not be disrupted" in your little games, particularly on a PvP server.
---
Just like original WoW dev Kevin Jordan said, if there is a PvP solution to a problem, it should never be moderated.
---
If you're getting corpse camped or your event is being invaded, *that's an in-world event* and you need to call on your friends and faction to retaliate. (and by retaliate that doesn't mean right click report for Activison Blizzard to ban people, it means actually get your axes and spells and kill them by playing the game)
---
The prices will increase.
---
Love this. "Retail is out of the question sadly" 100% relatable. 😂
---
These are amazing!
---
In the same boat, a lot of irl pals and I were going to play together, but our schedules just don't fit. It's a shame really.
---
But I want to get pre-mad
---
Our Swedish group are very skeptical of this move as well.
---
I think I'll only be able to put in about the same time as you once I get to max level. My plan is to roll a warrior tank so I can get groups quickly and probably just farm Strath living for Righteous Orbs to cover my repair costs.
---
With my friends I think I'll be able to do some raiding and be taken places I might not be geared for. But the main plan is get all my attunements and farm dungeons. It's what I enjoy :)
---
You'll see a decent amount of people walking around the cities slowly, people out in the world having in-character conversations, etc. And the least toxic barrens chat you've ever seen.
---
Okay. I understand you like blood elves but they just wont be in in classic. You might like night elves. Sorry you like elves? Fuck me I guess lol.
---
The coalition pretty much means the guilds and the guild masters who are co-operating, there are a lot of guilds and players who are Scandinavian and not bothered by where the coalition ends up.
---
Honestly too early to say. As you said.. LARGE % of scandinavians arent in these coalitions or havent playtime to pre-reg name etc so their (and a majority of the general playerbase) serverchoice will be at launch day.
---
So who will be where is still gonna be hard to say. All 3 servers will be great choices really.
---
If you don't plan on playing at all after the LAN party, I think shaman sounds perfect.
---
It's an intuitive class (whack things, cast shocks, throw heals, drop a totem here or there), has a ton of utility that is synergistic with warrior, is strong through the early portion of the game, it's not the same 3 buttons over and over, and has a ton of flavor for you as a new player. Negatives are that it's a melee (hybrid) class basically until 60 and you lean ranged.
---
If you were playing longer term I might lean toward priest, since it is stronger and has more options at 60, while still fitting your general requirements. Shadow is a ton of fun while leveling, but can be a bit tedious. Dot mobs, Renew your brother, wand. 
---
Mage/lock/hunter are all awesome classes, but if you're leveling as a dedicated duo, playing a class that can heal will have such a huge impact on your speed, downtime, death count, pvp encounters. I can't understate it. Warriors are really rough from 1-59 because they can't sustain, but with a healer they fulfill their full potential.
---
Well this is like the 20th comment/post I've seen trying to label whitemane as "the racist server" and its pissing me off
---
I like that her Orc is basically a Teletubby.
---
&gt; now that I can just fuck around on my phone
---
Don't you have phones??
---
They play the 30sec seal timers, because that is all they have. A bunch of different seals that all serve a purpose, but only 1 can be active at time. So yeah you will use judgement and 2-3 different seals, hoj, and hammer of wrath is only usable for execute. So if you are just trying to attack other players, 80% of the time you will not be hitting any buttons. Thats why i say go holy, because most of paladin abilities are used for group support, and holy can still smash people for over 1k crits.
---
Warrior is the only class in vanilla that is similar to how melee classes are played on retail for the last 10 years. They are pretty much the only melee class. Obviously rogue is, but vanilla rogue is its completely own play style.
---
They are not regular Taurens, it's a "new" race (allied races)
---
I actually wouldn’t be against them making it really tough. The most dedicated should get in first. I don’t want anything on a plate for classic.
---

I'm gonna give 100g to the first person to call me yank
---
still considering taking one enh shammy for the tank group cus im not sure I want to force one of my trusty resto shammies to totem twist and to be help with nightfall/annihilator axe.
---
Holy cow. It's been known that private servers tuned the dungeons, but that's more than double the damage of classic... That's huge.
---
Like I said, this doesn’t happen if you use Nvidia’s  built-in recording features.
---
I seriously dont get why you at this early stage, already wanna split up the community. Let others make the move, and stay put to maximize the Nordic community experience. Big mistake made by the Swedes imo!
---
I have played on RP servers since 2007 this has never happened to me and I have never heard of this happening. I don't know what servers you've played on, but this is completely out of line with 12 years of experience for me. I once had a bank alts name reported for being noncompliant with rp server rules (Which it was and I knew that going in) but that's been it.
---
You know, she said she didnt want to go to the beach for the weekend and we're just going to do a phillies game. K, babe. Whatever you want......
---
Shazzrah will forever have layering
---
I managed to get Zandalari, but no way in hell I'm doing pathfinder part 2
---
Yeah well if you let 30k people play in a quest hub it‘s just going to be too crowded. Sharding is only in place to support flexible server sizes.
---
Priest as the main healer.  Pally is great at helping a bad healer get the job done but a good priest can carry a 5 man more easily.
---
\[Alliance-Herod\] &lt;Southern Gentlemen&gt; Casually hardcore guild!
---
What we want to do:
---
\- Raiding in a semi-hardcore, casual type of way.
---
\- 5 mans! We thoroughly enjoy spending time with a variety of people running 5 mans and hope you do too!

\- Many of us go back to Vanilla, where we first met and fell in love with WoW.  We've been playing games together for 10+ years and are looking to add new friends 25+.
---
\- Most of us play daily/nightly and enjoy the social aspect of hanging in Discord as much as the in-game aspect of raiding/world PVP/memeing on the Ironforge bridge.
---
\- Real life comes first.  Many of us are married, engaged, or just have other things to do!  We never expect you to put the game over your family or real life!
---
\- Experienced leaders with Vanilla experience through AQ40 and private server experience equal.  In addition, many of us have completed lots of mythic, gladiator pvp, etc. content on Retail.
---
LFM:
---
\- 25+ mature gamers that are looking for a relax place to accomplish raiding &amp; PVP goals.
---
\- Friendly people that can laugh at themselves (a must!) but also understand a time to focus &amp; be serious!
---
\- Members willing to put in work to make their character the best he/she can be!  We aren't hardcore min/maxxers but a little effort goes a long way!
---
\- Members who desire to clear as much content as possible on a schedule that is as minimal as possible.  
---
\- Members who are on time, prepared, and motivated to knock things out as quickly as possible within our small alloted raid times.
---
\- Looking for another officer or two to join our small officer group thus far.
---
\- Looking for class leads for Druid, Hunter, Warlock.
---
In game Goals:
---
\- Have fun

---
\- 5 mans NIGHTLY!
---
\- Voice: Discord

What's the best way to keep up to date on which communities go where?
---
Please stay Norwegians!
---
and almost all of them make some of the 3 mistakes i mentioned
---
you think thousands of people wrote their own bot programs from scratch to bot runescape?  lol no, most use AHK scripts or runebuddy or whatever the popular rs bot is called idk.
---
Unfortunately rested xp caps at 1.5 levels. So you would have to play the warrior every 10 days (assuming the warrior is parked in a inn), grind or quest until you are out of rested xp then put him back in the inn.
---
So far faerlina seems fairly split( compared to herod which is gonna be 60-40). It sucks but it's very understandable that no one wants to pplay alliance
---
streaming is instant cloud backup
---
Whoosh.
---
ooo this is cool. hadn't heard of it. thanks!
---
One million Thunderfuries.
---
Can I get that as well p l e a s e
---
No need to. We still have 2 medium pvp servers on EST
---
Ooooh thank you! &lt;3

---
The good thing about Shadow Priests is that not many people will try and gank with you while your leveling. 1v1 a SP will own all classes if you know what you are doing. Unless you get stun locked and bursted by a Rogue, which, if they don't kill you immediately they are in for a bad time.
---
planning to do lots of PVP but can't decide between warlock and hunter
---
was leaning doing an orc hunter because of the huge amount of rogues im expecting, but warlock also looks super fun. from what I've read they're both pretty gear dependent? cant seem to decide which one might be better overall in BGs though
---
I knew exactly what I wanted to play. Now all my moron friends want to go Horde because they are morons.
---
Me too! I always loved the attunement quests during WoW Classic and early BC. I never liked how they got removed later.
---
Found the guy that only played Warcraft 3 and isn't familiar with the lore behind the orcs and eredar
---
VW isn't viable? I've not heard that; what's the reason?
---
VW tank and fear juggling 2 other mobs while dots and wand melt mobs seems, to me, a decent leveling/grinding strategy.
---
Just more content at 60 post naxx and they should let you xfer your character off the realms to new ones for that. That’s it. No tbc no wotlk even though I think they were great expansions, the prime of WoW. I just don’t want to end up with lfg and all that bs again.
---
I remember leveling as prot in WotLK and I could do 20-man pulls solo no problem. Fastest leveling I've ever experienced.
---
you do you man!
---
Oh I know, like I said two different things. But it still took me 20-30 minutes to make my characters. Once I found out some of my names were already taken, I spent much more time crafting my toons to make sure I liked the way they looked.
---
I’m just trying to illustrate the point that queues are not the same as they were in 2005 because the tech used to host our servers is not the same.
---
Thinking about going NE Bear on Grobbulus, and combining that with my Orc Warr on a EU PvP. Thanks for clearing this up, do you have a ink for the RP rules for Classic?
---
No its not 😃 Try again next time 😉
---
Upvoted for Demonstration of Value.
---
I played WoW about 2 months after release, she only played from late BC onwards. Played a private server about a year ago but again joined later so haven't done a Vanilla release yet.   
---
If we're AOE pulling, the only thing I'll be contributing will be Fire Nova Totem and possibly also a Chain Lightning. If I'm body pulling in ghost wolf and dropping stoneclaw + fire nova, I should never need to drink, she'll be doing 80% of the damage, my job is almost purely logistics.
---
This is not 2 - 3 guilds.

---
It's a joke bruv. But seriously I've seen some guys push the limit with amphetamines.
---
Will they use the classic game data once it goes live? It was my understanding they use the data collected from pservers.
---
where did you view that?
---
thanks Blizzard for not announcing 3-4 servers immediately so almost everyone (including me) are too afraid to switch to Gehennas because of "don't want to end up on dead realm"
---
gonna play with Spanish spam in chat now, wonderful
---
Not to be that guy, but the word you mean is alluding.

damn that was cool!

Druids can do all of it, tank/heal/dps(usually melee in cat form not boomkin). The issue with them is they are usually not very good at any of it. There are examples though of feral druid tanking in raids, and their heals are very efficient when the other healers respect their healing over time and don't heal over it. I've seen claims that feral dps can reach 2/3 of the dps of other traditional specs, but this is with a lot of effort(consumable farming). It is the least played class, some of it is deserved. They have a very diverse kit in pvp, seriously they have all kinds of little things they can, and I imagine it has a high skill ceiling. The first battleground released is warsong gulch, and druids in bear form are a lot of fun to play as the flag carrier. I would watch some videos if that wounds interesting. They also can heal or go into cat form and stealth to assassinate the enemy flag carrier.  They will level very easy, they can solo quest fast, heal in dungeons, tank in dungeons, etc. You will probably easily find a raid spot, especially as a healer. 
---
Warriors get shutdown easy in pvp if you have no backup, aka having a pocket healer. However, nothing is probably scarier than a geared pvp warrior with a healer. They just scale so well with gear and can kill multiple people with someone supporting them. I played a shaman in classic and I  had a handful of alliance warriors I could name that always had a pocket healer. When I saw them I usually knew I was dead soon, it was just a matter of what I could do before that. 
---
Warriors will level slow, unless you have a steady group and do fast dungeons.  They are the defacto tank in raids(some druids do tank but its sorta rare). They are decent dps early in the expansion, and they scale very well. becoming one of the best later in the expansion. The warrior class usually attracts tryhards or serious players, so you will be competing in raids with other serious raiders. Even if you are a dps warrior there will be times when you will offtank.
---
I think low level health regen is a lot quicker compared to PS, so you might have that going for you.
---
Playing in a Trio doing a lot of 5 man dungeon runs. 2 friends have already chosen warrior and priest (horde). As I'm not biased with any class what would be your ideal 3rd man on the 3man team?
---
I will if you promise to stop spouting stupid memes.
---
Deal?
---
are you gonna cry about it too dude
---
YES .
---
im for real dawg gonna check in 20 times a day untill launch
---
I guess shit is a bit negative, but it's pretty much accepted as the expansion that implemented a lot of the systems that, "killed" the game.
---
I LOVE the Lore behind wrath, but man I think besides ICC (and naxx) was boring. I know, I'm in the lone when I think ulduar is boring.
---
Like, if in retail now they re-released two old raids as modern content like they did in wrath people would lose their shit. The dungeons were pretty boring too IMO, well the culling one was pretty cool but beyond that I dread doing the timewalking events in Wrath.
---
I also think the zones are boring outside of Storm peaks (ironically where ulduar is) and Icecrown was dope too but felt a bit underwhelming.
---
but he can't do that till the 27th. What do till then
---
There are pets in Classic, just not very many.
---
I'm east coast and I'll be playing on Grobbulus, the Pacific RP-PVP server. Seems like a lot of EST players are rolling there since it's the only option for RP-PVP.
---
Pallypower is an absolute must-have. I dont want to fathom the effort and time consuming process of setting buffs up "manually" in raids. People constantly crying for rebuffing, people forgetting what to buff to whom, having to keep a googledoc of which pally has which specc for optimal buff distribution. No, thats just plain bad, and pallypower provided the needed interface for it.
---
TIL Bear Grylls is a mage.
---
Yet companies still fuck it up
---
If they do not change this, it will not be the "Vanilla experience" .  
---
Small changes like this are a MUST to preserve the games 'feel'
---
Told the wife to deal with it since I am forced to watch all her shit tv shows since my office is in the other half of our master bedroom.
---
Seems accurate.
---
I'm pretty sure I opted out of getting set bonuses as it was hard to fully max out healing when using some of the set pieces. Who knows though, 16 year old me wasnt the smartest.
---
Whats to say Bliz wont release spanish servers for Classic? they can see the location of the users reserving names afterall
---
Classic isnt as much about output as retail is, it's about utility, long fight ressource management, and participation, coordination, as well as consumable farming.
---
Like you said some specs can become a 1 button rotation, but that's because it's not about individual performance, it's about how you were participating. If you switched right, did the right kick, dispel, cc, if you were able to manage ressources long enough to finish the fight without becoming a burden 2mn in etc ...
---
It's about playing with people mostly, and farming consumables, like, A LOT.
---
You can largely substitute Orgrimmar for Thunderbluff, a more aesthetically pleasing and peaceful choice. Personally I think UC is the worst of the Horde cities.
---
&gt; then you just spam dungeons till 60 
---
"Just" run dungeons for at least 192 hours so you can hit 60 and run more dungeons.
---
&gt;no pandas
---
The only reason I need.. Fuck pandas, and fuck MoP, the worst expansion by far.
---
Success in classic wow has more to do with time available to play than individual ability.  You don’t have to be very good to do everything before the 2nd half of AQ40 and beyond.  If you are the worst dps or healer but never miss a raid you will gear up faster than the number 1’s who can’t make it every night.  Rep stuff is almost always time played over ability.  
---
Im not saying the only way to play or have fun is constant grinding, but in terms of gear acquisition, profession progressing and basically anything pre battlegrounds you have two variables: Time spent playing and RNG.
---
B-but I saw my favorite streamer whose never played vanilla before do it and he said it was good!
---
As if there’s anything wrong with that? You’re an idiot.
---
Yep, have your pet taunt then stop attack, then spam wingclip until dead or oom. It’s actually quite fast to level from scratch with this method.
---
Don't rob me of my 15% stronger shadow bolts! I don't care if people are dying!
---
Remote desktop to login
---
who cares lol
---
bet the next realm name will be Garr
---
Tunnel Snakes rule!
---
What should I do as a retail horde paladin? Just go alliance and switch in tbc? Was there a faction change in tbc? Should I just settle for another class on horde in the hopes for a future tbc? Not sure what I’m gonna miss out on by ditching a character and switching.
---
Yeah I had to suppress a lol when I read "long quest chain"
---
C'mon mages, where's ours at?
---
TLDR; 
---
OP says launch will run smoothly and there won't be a login queue.
---
I'm glad I left before it went away. Well I suppose if it went away in Cata I was still there, but I bailed on retail after starting on the 1st raid. I just wasn't into it anymore.
---
I did read about the difference between these 2, and I feel like classic might be more "grindy" ?
---
Switch a couple of things instead for a more cat focus, it is a bit more bear optimized there.   If you go improved MotW you might have an easier time getting into a pug raid since you can advertise that,   If you don’t care as much about bear you can steal from enrage and imp rejuv and that one spare point, but I would not remove from Insect swarm or reflection.  I would not steal from furor especially if going cat since that’s how you can power shift.
---
It is a jack of all trades kind of build, but it still has a little bit of focus on specifics within itself.  You can bear tank cat dps and heal all with the same spec, but you’ll have to pick if you want to be a bit better at cat or bear.
---
&gt; Scandinavians announced moving to Gehennas
---
&gt; http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/
---
and if they moved i would recommend not going there, they're buncha griefers
---
Should remove the “use” and center “restores”.
---
APES.
---
The ONE thing I wish that classic had (not that I want to add it) is explosive trap for hunters.
---
Shit is so much fun to use in Eye of the Storm. I can’t imagine how much fun it would be to use in Blackrock Mountain. I’d be launching people into the lava constantly.
---
There aren't that many downranked spells/abilities used in the 1-60 grind. Better to accidentally use current rank Hamstring for a few levels than accidentally use old rank Mortal Strike.
---
Yeah I should have specified my beef with the blood elves a bit there.
---
Kael'Thas is THE main protagonist for the entire expansion of The Frozen Throne. He shows up in each of the three main campaigns (founding of Durotar was separate) and him leading his people away from their desecrated homeworld is how we get to know the Blood Elves. 
---
Blood elves are NOT paladins, and Draenai do NOT have space ships. That's what I'm saying there. 
---
I know, I know, everyone else just accepts all this bullshit and I'm the crazy one for being set in my ways... 
---
But the thing is, the Blood Elves and Draenai that we got to know in TFT were fascinating, they were amazing! Then we are reintroduced to these races they're almost nothing like how we knew them before, especially the Draenai, but the Blood Elves too in terms of nobody really caring about Kael'Thas even more, even though he's their prince.  It just seemed like they basically said "hey, we want to design new races with new characters, but still want the name recognition" and went from there.
---
By contrast, Arthas and the Scourge in WoTLK perfectly continue from where they left off in TFT, and that's what I love about WoTLK and hate about TBC.
---
Sweet, got the names Qq and Aqua!
---
I got the name Gnomelander and then my friends all voted to roll horde :(
---
I should have prefaced with “we were fucking baaaad”
---
That's awesome! Hopefully, she doesn't use Reddit and see the post... XD
---
WTT Lonely and Mononoke on Gehennas for the same or equally good ones on Shazzrah. :)
---
Dammit. I had finally made up my mind on playing a shaman. Maybe warrior is back on the table now haha.
---
What name!
---
Shrek Rogue is my favorite class/ race combo
---
Isnt Whitemane a low pop?
---
I go for RPvP for the names and the wPvP
---
By far the best server. In my experience the RP isn't as overboard as it would be on the normal RP server. So Grobb won't be like MoonGuard lol
---
If Shazz is anything like their Discord, I'm not sure Faerlina can contend.
---
Yeah so number 1 priority is any dps with a key, and 2 would probably be a hunter for Drak and flaring the later trash pulls.
---
Wait, is this That SivHD? The juke city, 6 rod of ages LeBlanc master?
---
Whatever kid. Go ree somewhere else
---
Many people skip fishing, but I feel it is very valuable to have. You can level fishing and cooking almost perfectly in sync too
---
Seeing something on reddit 6 months ago doesn't mean im on reddit all the time. I'm actually new on reddit. I guess checking out classic wow reddit section on my phone once a day mean's i dont go outside. Oh well.
---
Are you being sincere?
---
Good ol' mailbox dancers.
---
\&gt;:D
---
Doubt.
---
I have a group of about 50 who just reserved our names, we were initially going to Shazz.
---
Most wanted to avoid queues but personally I'm kinda glad we skipped on Shazz, if their discord was any indication of the community.
---
Anecdotal info &gt; A professionals explanation of how modern large scale server systems work.
---
That’s right there is the Dunning-Krueger effect.
---
JUKES!
---
Lmao he made to look like a fool and now you’re pretending you are too good for this.
---
IIRC some of the blade server weren't even realms, they were just parts of realms? So they would need like 6 of these for a full realm with high pop?
---
Idk but as a /r/homeserver enthusiast I've always wanted one of the commemorative ones.
---
Naturally the locations aren't going to make sense given I only played the test, but what's an attunement? and what are the keys for?
---
This is awesome. I’m so excited.
---
ohh so you dont have to reopen realmlist or relog to make it appear?
---
I don’t think it’ll be so vastly different as to change the experience as a whole.
---
I wouldn't get caught up on that. Every class with the exception of a few will always be brought to raids.
---
Damn, Tauren Warrior I presume?
---
PvP was already full within 30 minutes of name reservation
---
Any quest addon?
---
You don’t have to RP. You won’t actually be seeing people do it constantly if you’re not actively seeking it out (at least that has been my experience). Certainly be respectful of those who are RPing if you choose not to participate.
---
Can't wait to mind control horde into the lava in BRM on my NE Priest. Shadowmeld+ mind control = lulz.
---
I played during the stress test last weekend. No nostalgia for me but it was glorious. No nostalgia except for the pre-Cata world. It looked so much better than the post-Cata world. Longer-lasting and more immersive weather effects. IMO more realistic aggro radius. NPCs hit harder. Having to meet people and party up even for quests. Green and higher items take more time to acquire. Making them more meaningful.
---
Alright, but that's nice. Then I can serve gear and armour to the little war. Someone said warriors will be in high supply at start anyway, and if that's true I might as well main something else at start. Level a lil' war on the side
---
Is there any way that someone can make "Dr damage" work? I used to love this addon! It is also called theorycraft or caster stats. All it did was shows the damage or healing the ability is going to do on your action bar on the ability
---
Damn, well I hope for those people in a queue that it's not as awful as it was for me on Monday where at the end of every queue all I got was disonnected :/
---
People who trained on pservers for Classic gonna be like Vegeta stepping out of the Gravity Machine.
---
&gt; yours isn't really a source either
---
You're right, that's why I ask for one :D
---
Yes, PM me, we can agree on some time when I delete it and you can take it
---
It's like all of them lmao
---
To my knowledge, the shadow forge key is used to open a few doors: The series of doors to the left that Leeds to the general and golem lord (also makes arena runs easier)  and the doors to the lyceum (after the 7 dwarves/ lava run)
---
Make your friend just take the name for you? not that hard
---
WTS ON GEHENNAS : Eureka, Gladius, Mudkip, Absolution

Orc has 30% Stun Resist, which is pretty damn good.

Also a dwarf priest and I've gone for the fullest blackest beard there is.  I was visualising Father Grigori from Ravenholm in Half Life 2.
---
Herod will have layering during the second phase.
---
Waited for 2-3 minutes in the "logging in to game server" and got in. So be patient boys and girls :) good luck getting your names. I got all except 1 that I wanted, oh well.
---
Nope it goes straight from offline to online
---
Bam, that's great!
---
Zerg won't matter due to layering really. Pick what you want, leveling will be most likely and hopefully be very crowded first 5months.
---
Got Scythe on gehenna. Probably not rolling there if someones interested after launch.
---
Deleted Sibir on Shazz
---
The concept of changing my realm decision based on the names available is hilarious.
---
Like not liking the color of your paint so you move cross country to a new house
---
Not sure how always running flags in WSG is a con considering you are the sole reason your team wins. It's a pretty sweet feeling actually.

Hunter. There is a slight curve, but once you figure it out you will have a blast.

I was able to get. Tt on Herod. Really wanted Il or Ill tho.
---
Thex?
---
I’ve seen plenty of Dutch guilds on Shazz... and many English speakers are on Shazz ... The Spanish is a minority and probably not gonna be a headache at some make them to be.

Really good stuff. Aprreciate the time you put into this.

Got the chance to reserve my name, Tupac

You'll all be 60 eventually.

But usually play an alt, work on professions, or help them catch up even if I get nothing from it...

Yeah I got pog name too so think imma ditch Shazrah

WTS on Gehennas: 'Gank'
---
So much has happened since your server chat!  EST PVP servers have been under assault!  
---
Faerlina - home of the streamers
---
Thalnos - home to the Brazilian, Latin American, and now French Canadian communities
---
Herod - home of all the REST of the east coast making it a super high pop server
---
Can we get a new EST PVP server before launch pls?  I dont envy the idea of rolling on any of the above servers or trying to find an EST community among the west coast servers.  
---
Am I alone in feeling this way?  It would be nice to bring some attention to this issue.  I think we and Blizz both KNOW that more servers are needed.  It's just a matter of if they launch them before or after release day.  Post release server additions won't serve their purpose as well bc people will have roots in their original high pop realms and if they do switch they will potentially be throwing away hours of time invested in a server they never wanted to play.
---
My rant is over now.  I just wish we had 1 more EST PVP server before launch :(
---
No just sitting and waiting when it goes from Offline-Low works, that how i got in under 1min.
---
xD
---
Do you think the RP-PVP realm will be taken as seriously as other PvP realms? Real question
---
I deleted the name 'Posty' on Shazz.... enjoy.
---
Didn't you ask for Danathar on Shazzrah the other day?
---
I want an addon that alerts me when valuable loot drops. I don't know if it should change item tooltip or display a chat message.  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7191/fused-wiring](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7191/fused-wiring)  for exemple might worth some gold, but I, as total noob won't notice and vendor these. It should parse the data from a customizable list. It would be cool if could also alert if a vendor we talk to has some valuable item available.
---
I would call it JackpotClassic.
---
You’re totally right but the difference is that the balance spec, if you don’t take Moonkin Form, literally gives you 3 talents that actually change the balance spells and they don’t do anything to change your gameplay, you will just do slightly more damage spamming your moonfires, while a ele shaman actually does a lot more damage than a pure resto. But you’re right that a lot of builds nowadays are hybrids and that’s one of the cool things with vanilla
---
so is nazjatar under azshara?
---
Man I like both of those shades of red, and love the iron skin color but i feel like black is kind of the way to go with that skin tone
---
My SO works and I don't so I have all day to play and he has the evenings. We like to play together so I have two characters. One I play alone (alt) and the other I play with him (main). When I reach max level, I usually turn all my attention to my main because then I'm not technically leveling without him. And I usually level the alt up to be a support (professions and such) to my main.
---
Easy solution to that. Just say it's your first time running this dungeon so you'd feel better if someone else took charge. People are usually just glad to have a tank they usually don't mind
---
There is just no way that Herod, with the whole "this is the real-deal, masterrace realm", isn't going to be the most toxic one.
---
Faerlina will probably have the most "non-authentic" vanilla experience, but should be fun for those who don't mind that.
---
Anyway, Mankrik awaits me.
---
I know.
---
But it made sense to move and make an all nordic server rather than staying on Shazzrah.
---
In the times of 100% darkmode everywhere I really can't use a theme like that.
---
326 hours later...
---
Lol
---
Honestly, from my private server experience compared to my classic experience, Warrior leveling is night and day.  Like I said, I struggled hard on pservers while I hardly struggled with classic.  I may not have exact values but that was my personal experience.
---
As if the majority of name reservations weren't made by retail players
---
Since firsts don't mean much, it's just whoever shows up first. You'll have 25 guilds clear every raid day 1, it's just whoever had the earlier raid time. Speedrun times are valued more now adays. Also on private servers there was just the one server, so maybe that did contribute to delaying gates for scarab lords. I think there was like 32 on the last server.   
---
But I think alot more people care about scarab lord since it is literally a one time/limited thing, then doing AQ40 which they'll do every week.
---
Who mourns for Morn! Woooot nice
---
well checking the website tells you the story of whats called the nordic coalition (which seems to be mostly swedes)
---
Overall alot of misinformation is being spread atm.
---
You guys do you
---
I had no idea it could actually fit like this. But when I think about it, it makes sense that it would and I feel stupid.
---
What's an arbitrary number on a website got to do with me socializing? I'll give you the answer. It doesn't. 
---
And mentioning it doesn't change the fact that you suck at socializing and need help to make it easier for you in a game made to be social. 
---
I know it hurts to be so bad but please first step to getting better is admittance.
---

Maybe a shuffle in the same boss teir? Even then I'd prefer not. It doesnt really add anything interesting tbh

Also willing to pay some £££ if anyone has them or knows who has them.
---
Thanks.
---
On a private server I would have said Orc 100%. After having seen the classic beta, Tauren seem to be huge. I'd just pick for aesthetics at this point.
---
Ew
---
I think you’ve swayed me to warlock wow cool ! Thanks so much !
---
If you're playing casually then one benefit of the mage might be the time you save by teleporting to different cities. That'll probably be what I miss the most this time around.

---
Bra beslut att byta till nya servern (Gehennas)!
---
Tråkigt att horde:alliance ration blir skev. Några hordeguilds borde överväga att spela alliance.
---
Thats a good point actually. Most people will come after experiencing heavy queues at launch
---
What class goes that good?
---
Eh, maybe... but DPS Warrior is the worst class you could roll as a casual player. To play the class effectively you'll want to complete a set of DPS gear and a set of Tank gear, and also a set of PvP gear if you want to do that as well. Developing a Warrior is just very time consuming.
---
It's possible that you find a lax guild that's okay with you just doing mediocre DPS as a fury warrior with no ability to help out by tanking adds and such. But the competition will be fierce (a lot of people consider it the most fun role in classic WoW), and I guess I just don't understand why you would want to play a Warrior over something like a Rogue or Hunter or Mage if you don't want to actually take advantage of what the class is good at.
---

---
For anyone wanting to simplify, ElvUI or TukUI handles... I think 5 of these (dominoes, Luna, Lea, Nug, and VendorPrice).
---
people truly underrating the amount of people that will play and also forgetting that game hasnt even launched yet so you server cultures etc arent established yet. 
---
Even seen some people think GEhennas will be a dead realm lol
---
That's tricky. The definition of valuable can change after some time, and depending on the server you're playing on. I think the best way to check that is getting Auctioneer (assuming somebody will make that fit for Classic, but I assume so) and checking what price the item typically goes for. Kind of out of my league due to complexity, sorry :)
---
What is this propaganda haha. ''it's a living, offline, server''
---
Swe?
---
As long as they keep atleast 1 or 2 true 1.12 preservation realms, I'm down for classic+
---
I think warlock! Thanks for the help
---
They did not.
---
Let’s just make it a first person shooter too while we are at it
---
&gt;Do you think PvE servers will be low pop after release and what makes PvP so superior?
---
Lol no, plenty of people in their 30s that don't want to spend time in queues and grouping 2 hours before raid just to zone in.

To me, what you are suggesting is just weird. I mean no offense, I just don't get it. And I say this as someone that makes lets play videos and has a youtube channel with 15K subs. I've never had the desire to record myself in a "just for me" sense. I mean no disrespect, it's just strange to me. Then again, I don't keep mementos, I don't have any old photographs, I don't decorate my house (at all - literally nothing on my walls). I wouldn't mind getting some cool paintings or even some of the cooler prints I've seen, but I don't feel a strong desire to get them, and I'm cheap, so my walls stay bare. My landlord probably thinks I'm a serial killer or something, but I've just never felt the urge to decorate. If a thing doesn't have a use, I typically don't own it. I guess I'm just a minimalist. Nothing wrong with what you're doing, it's just so alien to me.
---
Bad troll

Dude... Pandaren weren’t in classic *facepalm*..... roll Tauren Demon Hunter instead.

Not 'sa bad.

It became sort of WoW meme when Thex made a post on reddit when name reservation was announced.. he was asking what people would name their characters and he said he would make a troll shaman called Thex. Then everyone said they will make a troll shaman called Hex. Then yesterday when name reservation was available someone took it and gave it to the real Thex
---
They are.
---
Right -- I think people coming to play Classic as a game will find a lot to love in returning to Vanilla. But I think there will be several others looking to chase the feeling of wonder that WoW provided them initially (hoping to get the proverbial cherry popping experience again, for lack of a better phrase) and they're going to be the ones that are let down.
---
So you are saying you are better than me because you get more tinder matches have more money and because you think you are a better player. Okay. Thanks for showing me that are are bad at socializing are depressed because you are single and that you think money equals happiness.

Nordic coalition? This is a Swedish coalition with a couple of Norwegian guilds in it. Bullshit. Norway is staying on Shazzrah and so is Denmark afaik.
---
My younger brother is a system admin and man does he get a laugh reading this sub.  People who have little to no idea about web based infrastructure have a ton to say
---
The private server stench is strong with this one
---
Because the amount of DPS a guild/raid can perform is completely dependent on the tank's threat/aggro in Vanilla. Far, far more than any other expansion since. In a perfect scenario, with the perfect raid comp, with every raider in perfect BIS and performing perfect rotations, completely maxing out their DPS.... you'd wipe in seconds because someone will pull off the tank. So in Classic, DPS will literally have to stop casting just to lower aggro a little.
---
That's why you gear tanks first. The more damage they do, the more threat they hold, the more your actual DPS can go balls to the wall.
---
So in Classic max TPS (threat per second) tank builds will probably be meta; by the end of Naxx on the pservers guilds were rocking Fury 2h main tanks in full dps gear just to push threat as far as possible. That's an extreme case ofc, but in general max tps is proven to be 3x as effective as max defense builds, so long as your healers don't suck.
---
Sure, but you won't MT regularly because ppl prefer warriors. Do you rly want to farm bags worth of pummelers every raid night? Seems rough but can be made to work. Yeah they are really simple to play in pve.
---
Nah not really. Commutes here (Houston) are known for being pretty bad but 3 1/2 hours is way outside the norm
---
Blizzard is in complete control of their servers. There are two layers of queues, one for the login "server" when it's getting hammered, this could be eliminated just as OP said. Blizzard can allocate more "hardware" with the click of a button and allow more simultaneous connections. The second more important queue is to actually get onto a particular server. This doesn't actually have anything to do with performance, but rather population size. Blizzard has some numbers for how much population they expect to lose over time and has set some maximum concurrent users per server to some number that when they lose their expected number of people they'll still have a full or maybe slightly over-full single layer. They'll keep those queues in place because it's an incentive to go play on a non-full server. If all servers are expected to be over-full by a large enough margin, Blizzard would open a new server, this is what happened in the EU. 
---
tl;dr everything OP said is true and possible but caps on population and queues will exist as a way to influence the community to hopefully prevent dead servers down the road.

Commenting for later use
---
Is there a good diagram or link that can help me understand the specifics?
---
No, you misunderstood. You spec holy but take the +15% shadow damage as well. Of course you will heal significantly less, but it's better than running out of mana in 20 seconds. (I'll be maining a priest btw)

---
100% agree on any gear score addons being excluded. 
---
I think having strong guilds will keep them away. But I wonder if inevitably people will use them for PuG raids. It’s a lazy way to gatekeep people for raid experience.
---
Yeah they were low pop at the start just like everything else. Took hours for it to reach full

Excellent. Undead warlock is tight.

---
But seriously, I've played on plenty of RP servers (including Balmung in FFXIV, which is notorious for its ERP crowd) and the ERP "menace" isn't as affronting or even obvious as people fear. And even if you do become aware of it, you can easily ignore it in most cases. Silly fear.

I played the stress test they way I played vanilla. 12 hours per day. Once my leatherworking skill was high enough I started giving away leather armor to whoever would accept it. Next best thing to randomly buffing people. It felt nice to help some other players have a better chance in fights.
---
Thanks! I’ll need it. If Herod is anything like the server I played on in classic/TBC (Auchindoun), Alliance will be outnumbered heavily. 
---
So I’ll be outnumbered, as the worst wPvP and solo leveling class. Should be interesting, but I know it’ll be worth it at 60, as you say.

Really torn between Shaman or Warlock....
---
* Leveling
---
   * I don't feel like playing warlock over shaman will be a huge benefit besides the speed at which I level. I have leveled a lot in vanilla (unnamed servers) and feel pretty confident on leveling.
---
* PvP
---
   * This kind of makes me believe I might like Warlock more because I really like to play elemental in PvP at 60! I like being able to off heal and provide useful totems, but ele seems only useful when I have my big burst up lol. I'm curious if anyone has anymore experience on warlock pvp and why they enjoy it?
---
* Raid
---
   * Super unsure about raiding. I don't particularly like to heal, but I also don't mind it. I think warlock would be more fun, but I also know that it's really not a great spec until later down the line. How is gear competition? I feel like it would be harder to gear a shaman because there's like 8 in a raid. Do warlocks gear much faster?
---
I guess I didn't add too many questions so I'll list a few here:
---
(Copy) What has less gear competition?  
---
What is more rewarding to play in your opinion and why?  
---
For competitive PvP (let's assume same skill on both classes), what is better for group comp?  
---
Raiding thoughts in general?
---
Thanks in advance,  
---
Akos
---

---

and these ones?
---
Aside from the perhaps not helpful answer that any build would be OK, I guess the missing piece of the puzzle is what the druid wants to bring to the group. If they like healing you could build a little holy trinity right there in your group.
---
If only modern phone devs would learn this lesson and realize how violently bright they make their things...
---
Vanilla had a rework of the damage, either at the patch were going to or just before. This made mobs much easier to kill.

Spanish as individuals, sure, but as a group/large number, you're extremely rude and selfish, like the Greeks, only Greeks also hate Greeks.

You're going through threads trying to defend it, and I understand that you're Spanish so seeing what people say can suck, but it just shows how many people have bad experiences with Spanish people/players.

People will move, others are waiting for launch to start their subs, I'm sure it well be just as big a layered clusterfuck as all the other servers by launch day.
---
There is a Geheenas discord?
---
I appreciate the positivity, and do think blizzard has high competence at this.
---
But man it's not *that* simple to just 'spin up more computing power'.  
---
* Not everything scales horizontally indefinitely. 
---
* Bottlenecks can happen. 
---
* True stress testing is difficult. 
---
* Generally when crashing under heavy load, there is little to no recovery until load subsides or you take actions to protect overloaded areas. 
---
I'm sure Blizzard is quite skilled in all these areas and without a doubt do a better job than *most* companies out there. But virtualization does not magically solve anything. Better code, architecture and failing predictably will tho.

If the servers aren't in a AWS/GCP/Azure, I wouldn't be surprised that production is still bare metal today.

&gt;A bit worried about the PvE aspect tho as I know Mage has to be Frost for 2 whole raids and it's nothing but Frostbolt spam, and I believe the optimal Raidspec for Locks is also (ruin spec?) only shadowbolt spam, right?
---
Pretty much. Warlock is more fun to duo with, if you'll be playing a bunch with your friend, and has more variety in leveling -- although it's probably criminal not to mention aoe farming as mage, if that appeals to you. Otherwise, single target mage leveling is basically the same frostbolt spam as raiding.
---
That's what this part is for:
---
    #showtooltip [combat] Intercept; Charge
---
Should be:  "Can I sneak Teamviewer through my company firewall?"

TPS is still important for 5 mans. Tauren stam is a % base, so it gives more effect in raiding than in 5 mans too.

I'm excited to not have things account-bound. I've been an altoholic ever since I started playing WoW in WotLK, but for Classic, I'm really going to try picking and sticking to one character!
---
I feel that by making things less character-focused and more account-focused, you lose the sense of commitment to just one character -- and it limits your emotional attachment. If you stick with one character, through thick and thin, even when they aren't top deeps or FOTM, I think you really form an identity as/with that character. They become a part of who you are. That's what I'm most looking forward to.
---
Sure, it makes it harder at times. It's not always easy staying with them when your class is bottom of the pack or if it's hard to find groups who will bring you along. But it's like marriage: Although staying committed to one person means you don't have as many options or variety anymore, you gain the emotional depth that is only found through commitment to a single person.
---
Could the difference in feeling leeway and all just come from the fact that our internet is much faster, we render a lot more frames now and the server performances are probably many vanilla combined !?
---
I bet you guys want a BR server.
---
Only because holy priest was broken in tbc. Circle of healing - instant cast, cheap efficient heal, no cd, spammable. Not to mention chain heal spam.
---
WTT/WTS Yogg and Noth on Shazzrah for good names on Gehennas. Also have Ring on Gahennas.
---
Should have known.
---
That’s a very fair mindset, and I find myself debating going PvP often. But I’m a b*tch and get extremely stressed out when going out in the world while I’m flagged and after a while it can become nauseating.
---
That's not a bad idea actually.
---
They could also tell us one thing then increase the numbers dramatically. Everyone ready for standard AQ requirements then the patch hits and we need 3x the original amount... though that would really penalize the "regular" servers without all the streamers and hardcore players.
---
What kind of a gross ad filled site is this?
---
At max level I played cold blood + prep spec. It’s very very good, you can basically 1v1 anyone with all your cool downs if you play correctly / don’t get interrupted by enemy reinforcements
---
I hope you are right!
---
Because a ton of people are already set on a certain realm. Its like you think the population will naturally divide itself evenly between the realms. It will not. Theres a big chance right now that shazzrah could end up with 3 times the population of Gehennas, that would not have happened if the realms were announced at the same time.
---
It was only OP in WotLK, and some classes with decent players were fine against you, but if they didn't know then they were screwed
---
That’s what I’m thinking. If that’s the case I hope there’s an addon for it!! One of my favorite things about WoW oddly enough haha
---
I dont look at classic wow being a week and a half away as a bad thing.

---
Addons are built with a language called Lua.
---
Wow Classic uses a very modern version of Lua.  The same as BFA actually (just not quite as new but still BFA).
---
Wow Vanilla used a very old version of Lua (obviously).
---
The point is, addons designed for Wow Classic need to be written using the modern Lua language, not the old one, and adhere to its far more stricter environment.  
---
In Wow Vanilla, addons could get away with almost anything.  I remember an addon which automatically made your character drink a health potion of the relevant strength when your health got low.  And, as others have said, Decursive was just press one button and it would automatically find the player with an affliction and cure that player.  No need for any thought whatsoever.  And there were heal addons that would just be press one button and it will automatically heal someone with the correct healing spell.
---
That sort of automated gameplay isn't possible anymore so it's not possible in Wow Classic either.
---
When is this going to stop?
---

Same, my irl first name. Same story on shazz. I'm thinking it's just on some banned list, belongs to staff or whatever, because there's no way to be that quick twice.
---
Erebos, based on the book?
---
Since gehennas could be like a wild west realm - meaning less coalitions in general, more small groups of friends - the general population is forced to speak a language everyone understands (english). 
---
Its actually quite funny that these coalitions and nation herding just promotes to speak in their mother tongue which then leads to other nationalities to criticize these people.
---
IDK, you might be the only person there.

Both can be good healers, paladins are very mana efficient basically spamming flash of light, also you will constantly be buffing your raid as the duration on those are very low. Lay on hands is a really good for worst case scenarios, they are also great pvp healers. Shaman brings wind fury totem which is really good in vanilla, also has the option of going a viable dps spec if you ever wish to change later. With good gear and knowing when to use lower ranked healing spells you can manage your mana fine, albeit more of a challenge than paladin.

Myself and a few friends are rolling Horde on Pagle. Seems like we're going to need all the help we can get.

2-3hours of gaming everyday is a lot lol.  Yes you'll be fine.

Alliance or horde scum?

Ofc it is. Don't worry about time, enjoy every bit of it.

By the time you reach level 60, maybe you have more time in your hands and are be able to raid in a casual guild. Classic is an experience that you shouldn't miss.

Warriors are tiresomely difficult to level, so a lot of people role one with high hopes but then give up and make a char that seems easier or more fun to level/play
---
weird because the server is full, and on opening reserve day (12th) was the only server with High population.
---
I'm looking for the name Furry on Gehennas - i can trade it / buy it - whatever! hit me up in the PM! :)   
---
I got the names Druid, Owlcapone and Moogician.
---
You are only accounting for people that organize themselves and reserve names way before the game even starts. The majority of players didnt even choose a realm yet...
---
2-3 hours a day is more than enough to enjoy 95% of the game, and if you can mlve some hours around in the week or throw a few more over the weekend, you can bump it to 99.9%.
---
Get in. Water's fine. And if you don't like it, take it month by month and it'll only be 15 or 30 bucks. People buy full price video games all the time they hardly touch. That's 4 months of game time sitting in the steam library.

AEW AEW

I have 40 hour workweek and a newborn and wife and i was wondering the same. Times changes and i cant play as much as i wish when i was on highschool where i played 10+ hours every day. But ill take it and play in a casual way (try to have my personal wow time every evening for like 2-3 hours).
---
Amazes me some have the time and energy to spend hours each day on PvE servers trying trying to find people for groups or waste time on unreliable guilds due to a lack of replacements for slackers.
---
The prices will skyrocket, since there's too many players relative to respawn nodes. Every hour, 4 black lotes will spawn. Around 40 plaguebloom per 15 min in EPL. How on earth do you want such a system? It's gonna be 250g for a flask, or 10g for an Elixir of the Mongoose.
---
Priest is better at keeping the group alive. Pally's better at keeping the tank alive. In a full cluster situation, dps can die, but the tank cannot. :waffling: Full cluster scenarios usually have more to do with shitty tanks than shitty dps, so ideally the solution is find a better tank, not pick a better healer. You're talking about the two best healing classes in the game, so there's really no wrong answer: do you want to play the squishy spell caster with a full kit of spells or the unkillable healer with a hammer?
---
Why in denial? I can speedrun Teldrassil blind.
---
Obviously, this place is challenging, but you just have to take it carefully with pulls. That is all there is to it.
---
Anyone can snipe it - that being said I remade all 3 of my characters 7 hours after name res opened - you just have to be quick.
---
I'm more interested in seeing how many dig in their heels and refuse to play even when half their core raid team stops showing up, it's a very real thing too. I hopped on my old toon since I signed up to reserve my name and dug through the guilds chat log and there is some drama! Several people claiming it's a fad and how it will fail and everyone will be crawling back in 2 weeks tops and a bunch of people talking about playing the open Beta and how they genuinely were having fun.

yea thats exactly what i said boy. now sit down and let the adults talk.
---
That is a huge print. What size is it?
---
Paste the fonts folder into the classic folder I'm pretty sure. Also frostadamus has a recent video up where he changes the font and it looks pretty good. Also really don't think it's bannable it's not like nodding the actual game files like model swapping, and also people overhaul their entire ui's to an insane extent so if that isn't bannable then fonts definitely aren't either. Never had a problem with altered fonts in years of playing.
---
Assuming it will be the best pvp though, might be getting ahead of yourself.
---
Or people could give it a shot. Who knows, they might enjoy pumping more value out of thier $15
---
Yup
---
I want something a little more accurate other than “here’s a book, read the whole thing if you want your source”
---
This went from “common sense” to “just read this entire book”. Big jump don’t you think?
---
Mana drain is a common spell?
---
Druids are fine on healing. They just bring less than other healers do (Blessings, Totems, etc). You can look at recent pserver raids and see how druids are doing here https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/  
---
Druids are really good in world PvP, look up vids like Stormx or Cucker C@
---
There are locked gates leading into some dungeons, some dungeons have a room or two locked off that you need a key. 
---
A couple of the raids have a "magical" way to access them instead of running to the portal (a shortcut essentially to get in). Your toon has to be attuned to the magic's to use these shortcuts. Thus why wr call it getting attuned.
---
I didnt start until Wrath, and i really didnt start playing Dwarves primarily until i came back at the end of WoD.  I think that one had black hair, but it was a warlock and it just fit better, i think.
---
Now i play a Dark Iron, so black (with the fire) is just natural.  
---
For me Classic is a new beginning, so i actually kind of like having something a bid different.
---
Gladius, Samwise, Absolution, Mudkip
---
I forgot to mention I wanted to use my phone with team viewer. I'm not sure how movement would work that's why I was worried.
---
Yeah, that's really good, but there's also tri-spec, in which you basically just stun and slow everybody in pvp.

Still haven't heard of anyone rerolling. It's going to be problematic.
---
I remember in vanilla that you could do the Redridge elite quests or Wetlands Dark Iron quests with a random group of 4 to 5 people no tanks or healers needed. On a pserver we could only do it with a full instance type group. If your tried it without a tank or healer it was impossible unless you where really high level.
---
Dual spec is literally the only thing I would bring over.  Almost every single class has an optimal PVE and PVP spec and they are mutually exclusive =/
---
Classic noob from retail here. What exactly are these for?
---
Our guild loves this. Massive props for excellent work!
---
I didn’t play for the first time until Mists of Pandaria. I have no clue what to expect...
---
If you're just holding W as a flag carrier you are doing it wrong. But, hey, fun is subjective I guess.
---
Yah, I love it there.  Best site on the internet.  They'll be adding a streaming service soon, and then we will be able to broadcast our local klan rallies.
---
I forgot to mention earlier that Hunters are regarded by many as the best 1v1 and Open world pvp class, and a lot of their abilities hard counter the broken rogues lol.
---
don't subscribe to the grind. classic is about savoring it and taking it at your own pace.
---
The half that had no content and a raid that was cleared day2 of the expac?
---
The half that had DK's with 2nd life ghoul form in arenas?
---
All of WOTLK was bad. The only thing good about WOTLK was most of it's class design was good, unlike TBC, which had awful class design(PvP perspective)
---
Shazzrah will have 5k more people and im one the guys who LOVES queue cuz it tells me im on the RIGHT server
---
That might be too hash. Feral is obviously good, but if you know how to play, Balance rotation is pretty effective. Between the nukes, dots, thorns and self-sustain, you can clear areas with ease.
---
You're the one that needs a brain, this wouldn't be an issue if all servers came up at the same time but because this one is a late arrival most people have already decided on one of the previous two servers. This one is relying on people changing their mind and late comers to populate so it's not even remotely the same.
---
Let the streamer server get the turn ins ASAP and hope one ass doesn’t ring the gong early and fuck most of them out of it.
---
Although non-streamers servers would get the gates open slower, it’d allow for more people to get scarab lord.
---
Wave bye to this post  enough with this name trash.

Found the Undead Rogue
---
months  
---
a few days wont save you. it'll just ensure that you will run into the slow back end of the masses when you do start moving.  
---
do yourself a favor and start with your main. you're overthinking kill speed. efficientcy and not sucking are far more important in getting past the zerg than kill speed.
---
You don't need a ret paladin for any of this. The BoM talent point are in the first tier, it's no problem at all.
---
The problem with ret isn't their abysmal DPS, but how angry warriors get when you funnel them gear.
---
It definitely does look nice.  Its not a look im 'used to' or whatever, but it definitely looks appealing.
---
That lighter orange is nice as well, but i think it works better with either a lighter, or more brown skin tone.

yes, it also is rumored to be the default "Brazilian" server, and the Brazilians have a pretty awful reputation for online games (rightfully so), and for that reason, people are avoiding it. I think that if you are playing with friends, you wont even notice it at all. If you are Alliance, even less so.

People are sleeping in Thalnos becasue a FB group for Ragnaros (notoriously awful br server) said they were going thalnos... if I see more than 5 br players speaking portugese between 1-40 I would be shocked.

That's what it says...I don't remember that. I THINK you had to be at a specific place near the dungeon and then it would teleport you essentially half way through the dungeon to the 2nd half.
---
yea i would say stick to arms until 30ish and you can switch to fury if you want or ride out arms to 60. Basically Arms/Fury to 60, tank as dps spec, just use sword and shield and def stance while in dungeons, and wont have to worry about being prot spec until the 60 content imo.
---
What a shitshow, lol.

How many characters are allowed for guild names?

Probably because of the 5-10 day /played requirement.  Assuming 4-5 hour per weekday and 12-15 per weekend, it should take 2.2-5.5 weeks to hit 60. A more realistic number would be 2 hours per weekday and 8 hours on the weekend resulting in 4.6-9.2 weeks for 5-10 days /played per toon 1-60.
---
I'll probably go back to DotA. Only way to beat an addiction is with a stronger one.

---
Considering the deep hate for streamers I am willing to bet this whole sub will be rolling herod
---
Have to bring the AQ going within....12 hours? Maybe 24 hours of the gates being opened.
---
Of course, I was mainly thinking that you never have to stop as a feral, neither to drink nor to heal (or barely)
---
You are a hero

I let my wife know I'm taking leave starting the 27th and to let me know now if she wants to do anything because if not I'm taking that as her giving me the go ahead to play all day.

Thank you!!! I'm so happy you made this and not a 45 minute video on YouTube
---
I want to play Feral, mainly for PvE, is this a viable option? With the debuff cap, is it worth it?
---
In the end I’m playing feral because I want to and have fun but just curious to the viability of it.
---
Hunter vs Warlock.
---
Ranged pet class is a near must for me, I'll be casual and not averse to farming soul shards when I need to.
---
Which will serve me better in pug bgs? I will likely be playing with a mage/priest most of the time, but not always.
---
Both will be engineering, but idk which is better in wsg/ab/av
---
All scandinavians should move to gehennas.
---
We're enough to fill an entire server. Screw the spanish/italians/portugees/ect.
---
why would you want to be on a server with a 1+ hour queue?
---
Well ya, but I'd rather you read the whole book instead of asking for ever increasing details on a source that disproves your argument hoping for a small chance you can throw the whole discussion away and come out looking superior.
---
You got me there. I'd suggest laptop via hotspot. If you are that locked down.
---
You've been watching too many AWS commercials.   If it were that easy, don't you think Blizzard would just do it?
---
Yes, actually. 
---
wait... no.
---
Yes, TBC didn't have the LFG features and it's still the best expansion Blizzard ever made. Flight worked in Outlands imo. It should have never been introduced to Azeroth, but it ended up in the game in Wrath. LFG was also introduced in the ICC patch. You're dreaming if you think they'll introduce Wrath servers without LFG.
---
Some I think drop for everyone others are one per party.
---
Where does the back door to Statholme lead? Just wondering if it allows you to skip to the last boss to make farming Deathcharger easier.
---
Opposite
---
Mines tied to faction.
---
Priests have an easier life with the Horde for sure, not getting heals sniped by Paladins with infinite mana. Dont have to deal with Purge, Windfury procs, earthshocks, tremor totems and WotF against one of their go to defenses. (At least fear ward can be removed.)
---
Paladins just have alot going for them. (Since I want to heal anyway) Free mount, the utility/buffs. Plate/Shield/Cleanse/Freedom/BoP/Bubble AND Stoneform? What rogue could mess with me? Lol. (Who gives a shit about 5 wep skill when you dont dps anyway, get Stoneform!)
---
People are stupid sometimes... Doesn't really reflect the "value" of comments, lol.
---
My guys too. We are two groups of 3 and 5 people
---
Waiting in a queue will teach us patience for waiting to tag quest mobs.
---
When I first started I got creamed in there as a druid. I vowed to go back and kill everyone in there and help people out in it when I hit level 20 every single day. I never disappointed them. &gt;:)
---
I don't rp but I played on a rp pvp server for awhile. Can't say I really recommend it for non RPers. It's true that you're never forced to RP and generally as long as youre respectful of others that are RPing, you'll be fine. 
---
However, the reason I dont recommend it for non RPers is because most guilds do RP and they have events based around RP. None of the guilds I joined forced me to go to these events, but as a result of not going I always ended up feeling like an outsider in the guild. RP is how a lot of guilds socialize and by not joining in, it's harder to form connections with people. There were very few guilds that didn't RP at all so I felt like my choices were extremely limited in guilds.
---
That was my experience as a non-RPer on a rppvp server at least. YMMV.
---
It is up to date.
---
Fair point - I agree there should be more herbs, there has always needed to be. But my arguement friend - is layering compromises much more than just herbs. 
---
Community takes a hit due to not seeing the same people. 
---
Ganking is almost taken out due to layer swapping.
---
Rare mobs are no longer as rare. 
---
The positive of not many nodes per player is when you actually get one yourself, the reward is higher!
---
I don’t think the negatives outweigh the positives. 
---
Make more servers.
---
well we cant look at the demographics survey to get a rough idea.
---
already over 1800 respondents for Fairbanks alone, and thats just people who already made their characters and are nerdy enough to do a WoW survey weeks before launch lol
---
Or you just wanna make an excuse because you got called out. It's ok dude like I said first step is admittance.
---
Swe herr My guild is staying shazz
---
It really do be like that sometimes.
---
Ah Eastern Plague Lands, never has there been such a hibe of scum and villainy and ganking where it is extremely easy to get away from the guards.
---
wow, didn't know that, on name day i wasn't able to get home and log on until about 10PM(EST) so i didn't even see that que for just name reserves, might have to be \*sick\* that day...
---
I disagree there friend. It's just a case of people whining because they don't win every single one on one.
---
In the end it just matters that the two factions are equal.
---
miss, miss, miss, miss
---
WotLK prot pala was just silly "lets have a CD that only activates if they actually needed it" sure the downside was if the healers fucked up you wouldn't have the CD for when it was needed which isn't really a downside as you would just wipe it if it happend.
---
i remember ToGC the beasts fight on the first guy just impaling one tank you could heal threw it without a CD so you would get a situation where the prot paladin had this CD ready if he fucked up while every other tank was out of CDs for the rest of the fight it was totally unfair and unbalanced.
---
No plz
---
Yeah there's at least 3 Dad Guilds I've seen on Herod.

I'm starting one /r/DadBodHerod

I had a pet attack macro set up during the stress test and my pet was responsive and felt fine to me. Not sure what you mean by sluggish.
---
There's probably thousands if not millions of people still coming when Classic releases. it will catch on, it will gain Twitch popularity and people will want to get in on the action. I'm quite certain that Gehennas won't be the last server they will add and it will be just as crowded as Golemagg
---
I know, I mean does everyone actually do it though. Like is Ony a mandatory raid that everyone does, or is it often skipped
---
I was browsing wowhead’s thottbot skinned classic site last night and it has old comments from both thottbot and alakazam. I thought it was pretty cool.
---
using a farming alt to speed up warrior leveling is only a thing in your mind, do the math, how much time will you need to spend farming to make your warrior so powerful it cuts down on his leveling time?
---
How do I find this?
---
no server community due to sharding

There's a clear sentiment that grobbulus is going to be low pop, so I'm asking you what made you make the joke. No need to be the prototypical chan dunning kruger boi
---
Oh good.
---
That's cool your dad is an astronaut, mine's just a drunk.
---
pretty sure it reserves it
---
Go to Stormwind and take the train to Ironforge?
---
Dwarf to Elwynn is not hard, you just run from Dun Morough to Ironforge, take the tram to Stormwind, and then run to Northshire Abbey which is where your homie will be spawning.
---
That's great if you have Nvidia. What do you do with and GPUs?
---
&gt;had trouble catching up/learning on the go compared to experienced players 
---
Don't worry about that part. Forget the people that are ahead of you and focus on having fun at your level. The game is fairly easy to learn as you go.
---
oh my... now that is a name I have not heard in a while
---
think you need 10 to sign it,  can reserve via making guild charter I think
---
That's him! So he exists again, that's pretty awesome I can get a Murky again.
---
That's why.

---
It's just a lot of people trying to find fault with every decision.
---
1. They didn't make enough servers, everything is going to be overcrowded.
---
2. They made more servers, they will be underpopulated and dead.
---
Server was made due to demand, it'll be fine.
---
I'm not particularly knowledgeable in this subject, but is this going to be any different than Legion or BFA launches, where millions were logging into the game at once? I know there will be queues for the individual high-pop servers, but why would the log-in servers be any worse off for Classic than on retail expansions which most had quite a bit more people logging in at once?
---
Yea I remember "layering is broken". And complaints of batching that relate to things that spell batching wouldnt ever touch.
---
knowing your goals helps
---
CE pets came with the CE code, Murky was not part of the CE pets and was a separate code that needed to be claimed later by a vendor next to the fishing hole.
---
sounds right. I remember you had to send the warlock and two other people outside the instance to summon someone.
---
Nice, looking forward to seeing 500 naked gnomes when I load into Dun Morogh in 2 weeks.
---
Blizz just need to download some more RAM
---
Using the book wasn’t even my source, I’ve already claimed to not have read it yet. I’m done with this kid. I won’t be seeing anymore of your messages. Best of luck on your next GED exam, I’m sure you won’t fail it this time. That assistant manager position at the McDonald’s down the street from your mother’s apartment has your name written all over it. Good luck!
---
If it helps you feel better. those few hours prolly won't matter, your name most likely is already taken.
---
Yeah that's surprising because it's PVP. You think it'd be right up there regardless if it's RP.
---
They all have shit animations unfortunately.
---
They do use spanish in other games a lot. League of Legends and Overwatch being two titles that come to mind.
---
It’s a true adventure
---
As used by mobs, or bosses.
---
No, not really. People still dont evenly distribute themselves, even if they chose the perfect amount of servers, some would still be chock full with queues and everything while others would be closer to medium pop. This is simply how humans work.
---
According to another user the NPC to claim the code is there and that's what I needed to know.  
---
The CE pets are claimed with the CE code, Murky is not and needed the NPC at the fishing hole, same with Big Blizzard Bear.
---
I think I want to be a shaman but I can't stop thinking about hunter.
---
Please sell me on playing an ele/resto shaman before my dumbass mind changes its decision.
---
No, my retail guild I've been in for 8 years decided to make a horde guild there
---
LFR started the trend of things being handed to players, and that started the downfall of feeling accomplished in the game. Accomplishment is that feeling when you really want something for a while and then, by your work and effort, you get it.
---
People didn't go into molten core only to get sweet gear. That was a big deal, especially since epics didnt grow on trees, so they had their own mystique beyond the stats, but people went into molten core and got blown up by idiots who couldn't see massive swirly fire around them so that they could see Ragnaros rise out of the lava. Because the only way to experience That was to earn it, the same way everyone else did. That entire experience is cheapened when you can hit a button and join a queue to fight what may as well be trash mobs.
---
No LFR. No story mode. If you want to see it, earn it. Otherwise, you don't deserve it. There's a reason WoW is dropping subscribers like an anchor, and seeing the love for classic makes me think it's not because people aren't interested in MMOs anymore.
---
Gotcha, that's not DR though.
---
Server first race, not world first. 
---
* The first Worldwide Ragnaros kill was by Ascent on [Medivh](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Medivh_US) on April 25, 2005.
---
That's the world first.
---
I agree with the others suggesting to level and group at the Crossroads. It won't take a long time to get there and you'll all have access to trainers, etc.
---
It was one blade per continent, but idk where I got that info from.
---
Oh god this is going to be me... things haven't worked out so well.
---
hotw Druid
---
Undead warlock is my jam, yassssssssssssssssssssss.
---
I can give my opinion here though, and no one cares about what name you saved, etc. Let alone trading names, like what? Go look at other posts like this, no one comments, cause no one cares.
---
It’s some of the best gear for little effort; there’s really no reason not to do it and any raiding guild would expect you to be attuned.
---
Graphic design is my passion.
---
Hogwash.  You can use saved variables to store information and then access it through some data connection voodoo.  That’s how addons remember things session to session. 
---
Hypothetically this addon could store a character’s inventory as a saved variable, it would get written to a file on exit, and then you could access it in excel to display in a meaningful format.  
---
It’s not the addon interfacing with another application so much as it’s one way to export information where your end product is viewing it in excel.
---
Reroll what? A lvl 1 character.
---
I've never been capable of controlling my /played.
---
I started playing with a friend and maybe after level 10 I was never the same level as them until they got 60 a month or so after me. 
---
Since that resulted in some bitter feelings on both sides. I abandoned them from their perspective. And I felt like just because I play more doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to do what I want in game. I decided to no longer make strict leveling agreements with people or even expect them to be similar in level.
---
when bosses drop 3 items each, you need all the loot sources you can get with 40 man raids.
---
Be filled with regret you couldn’t afford something better?
---
Or just use AMD ReLive which is nearly identical to Nvidia Shadowplay’s GPU-assisted recording software.
---
&gt;  first world race on classic
---
So im struggling between Druid and Mage. Here is my question, how easy is it to get into 5 man dungeon groups and raids as a mage? I figure for 5 mans people want the aoe dmg and a portal out once its over, but will overpopulation be too much? I know if i were to go Druid id be able to heal / tank (0/30/31 Heart NS) and would never have to worry about gear competition or not being able to get into a group. Although Druids have their own drawbacks which I am aware of. Thank you :)
---
One forearm is MUCH larger then the other
---
A huge number of people will be playing similar amounts. You'll be in good company

I'd you let too many people in you'll negatively impact performance.
---
class quests, dungeon quests, ony and bwl atunement, and just regular old quests that have like 4 quests within them.
---
&gt; I forgot to mention I wanted to use my phone. I'm not sure how movement would work that's why I was worried.
---
Very poorly, but as long as you set up some custom keybindings and log your character out *at the AH NPC*, it's doable. 
---
Just... extremely inconvenient, so really not worth risking your job over.
---
I'm not gonna give two f\*\*ks, I'll level to my heart's content.

Absolutely a hunter weapon
---
Method racing for world 19485628th Ragnaros kill! Make sure you tune in!
---
Will it be realy world first? It would only count if boss mechanics were changed and they needed to develope new tactics. It will most probably be a who can gear up the most raid members race.
---
Thank you bro, bless you !
---
That was the first kill in Vanilla. This is Classic.
---
I wasn't saying you specifically needed ret. You are setting it up as if it's always a choice between holy and ret but not everyone wants to be a healer. If you have the choice between fielding a ret pally or not having enough pallies for all the buffs I'd personally bring the ret every time.
---
I'm not some ret fanboy I just don't think it's worth actively avoiding them all the time.
---
Misleading topic. Swedish guilds roll on Gehennas, danes and norwegians on Shazz.
---
This sounds amazing.
---
WTT Highlord, Roflcopter &amp; Harambe on Gehennas
---
give me twink orcs and trolls, blizzard. also, the undead females and the female orcs both have fine animations imo
---
will i have all the quests of the human starting zone or will i be missing out on something?
---
  Literally no one says Herod will be the "authentic classic experience", except on Reddit.  Herod will be the Reddit server.

I hope that we're right about this hahah if you play retail, give it a shot! :)
---
Well it seems that all realms are at least medium now.
---
your newborn is extremely weird if you can work 8 hours a day and still play wow for 2-3 hours after.
---
Yes, but on the other hand I've also found that RP is another way for people to form cliques and being elitist about it. I've been through big drama over RP.
---
So a tip is to never emotionally invest yourself too deeply into it. Only leads to trouble if you step on someone else's feelings, or someone steps on yours. Maturity is hard to come by.
---
Just keep lieveling and of you are 60 you van help the homies abit in power dungeons
---
Because it's not that easy, in reality. We spun up some additional nodes for our database. Know where the problems were? The AWS network between the computer containers and the disk. That's Amazon's fault, not anyone at our company's.
---
Oh wait I mean "reee Blizzard stupid". I'll take my upvote now.
---
It was pretty satisfying to log out of my alt and into my (higher level) main rogue back in the day and gank the fuck out of corpse campers especially when they tried to run away on a 60% mount, ha!

That was World of Warcraft.

This is for World of Warcraft Classic.

Anyone see anything about or find a working version of WIM?  Need me a good whisper management Addon!

The idea is to have the list made by user input, the addon would just alert you not actually defines what is or not valuable.

So you’re saying it’s 100% Blizz’ fault I got yeeted out of the login queue and thus didn’t get any of my old names?
---
You can downvote me all that you want.
---
Scandinavians stay in Shazz, Spaniards stay in Shazz, British stay in Shazz... 
---
It's going to be problematic because no one wants to change, since Shazz still looks like it's going to be the "main" server.
---
I'm going to do this and put in my will for it to be played at my funeral and whoever stays until the end can have my account.
---
Let me just leave my guild and roll on a different server because Blizz decided to release another one.
---
Yeah, these guys are going to try and use world buffs and any means by farming to get some edge that hilariously won’t exist. I’m thrilled to see them frustratingly fail for 6 weeks or so.
---
The Finns are not moving btw
---
Just checking out server pop.  Nothing in US is low pop anymore, they def going to need to add more US servers.
---
I think that's a broad statement. I don't think that everyone playing off specs assumed they will be able to do whatever they want whenever they want. I imagine many of them understand they will have to do what is necessary in whatever moment.
---
I think that as long as you're willing to be flexible and do what's necessary that you can be a team player and still have access to DPS gear if you choose to. 
---
Either the content is as hard as we remember it being, then these guys will likely adapt their specs and play style as needed. 
---
Or it's as trivial as some think and it's entirely possible that a guy spec's shadow will be able to heal just fine on raid nights and melt faces the rest of the week.
---
That's great advice thanks.
---
One down
---
It’s not arbitrary. The measures are relative. Low does not mean low. It means “lower than Shazzrah”.
---
Hardly.  All the talent in on EU
---
Rag will die week one, it has already been theoricrafted that it is possible to do it in 5 days, but that is probably the best case scenario.
---
First of all, Rag is NOT a BR server.. Secondly, sure, most of us are going there, but so are many people from the Spanish Latin America,  the French Canadians and even so, NA players will still be the majority there. If anything, Thalnos will be the most culturally diverse server. 
---
Regarding our bad rep, we are aiming to change that, for example people are discussing many ways to deal with anyone who tries to be toxic.
---
What a time to be alive! "Is the game worth it if I only play 2 hours a day". Wow

Pretty easy to spot who never played on PvE in classic lol

Method going to give some pserver-pros a run for their money?  The claim is within a week from launch he'll be down.

Paladin tanks, even geared ones have less threat. As a warlock im used holding back on dps. with pally tanks i had to be much more carefu. def doable tho.

That's even worse.

Download new Tool album

Feral is complicated and rewards good play. Sword rogues, you have to watch a swing timer for procs (especially as horde)
---
Plenty of big name P-server guilds have said they're aiming for a week 1 or 2 rag, so I guess we'll see ;)

Hnnnnng colonel, i'm trying to fly around
---
Generally speaking giving something to the person who uses it best in group content is more satisfying than the alternative.
---
If one TF gets dolled out in 15 months, and a given player doesn't get it, it going to the MT is way more satisfying than it going to some memespec.
---
The difference between:
---
&gt; Yay, this helps the raid team a lot!
---
&gt; This guy got it? 
---
Is huge.
---
As you say, it's a team effort. So people get more out of what helps the team.
---
If you want to get bindings as a memespec, reserve them in a pug you organize once it's farm content. That's how I'm planning on getting my HunterFury meme, rather than expecting main raid guildies to value my meme over common sense.
---
Tl;dr:
---
Team &gt; Meme
---
thats a little stupid xD
---
Why shouldnt i use aimed shot in my rotation pre 50 ??
---
No need. France will surrender all their Realms to us.
---
Never forget season 5 Holy Paladin, Ret Paladin, Unholy DK. Still traumatized from getting one shot off a couple crits
---
Do we care? I meanfrench wow streamer are not big enought to disrupt a server like asmon, soda and co
---
Personally, i am rolling on Thalnos and I expect it to be fine, just trying to fill in the asker on a bit of drama. 
---
Also, what am I looking at here exactly?
---
Looking for Tim on Shazzrah, I have Dew and hs on Shazzrah or whatever you're looking for, message me if you got it.
---
But with the new Layering Tech that seems like an odd choice?!
---
So keys will just go in the bags instead?
---
balance in all things

What got me into wow was a friend in work. He was complaining he couldn't find a copy of wow anywhere. I was home for the weekend and spotted a copy in the shop, the last copy, so I bought it. For him!

Back at work next week, he said he would gladly pay me Tuesday for a wow box today. I told him to piss off and installed it myself and here I am now. :)

&gt;more complicated stats

Bit of a tossup because of crit.
---
I would say low level/leveling str &gt; agi, but later on agi gives you armor as well as crit which is huge.
---
Flew from org to teldrassil, it went to xr, ratchet, back past org, then ashenvale and beyond
---
pretty big waste of 15 minutes
---
Technically Keyring wasn't pure vanilla, more like vanilla with sprinkles, patch 1.11, but still I agree it should be in with the client they are going with. Bag space is at enough of a premium without having half a dozen assorted keys taking up slots.
---
People assumed the streamers would bring a toxic community and if  reddit is telling of things to come I wouldn't touch Herod with a 10 foot pole. Sucks I wasted a good name reserve the other night.
---
ohhhhh that's interesting.  Yeah I'm sure the improved barrens chat is very nice.  The spam in all of that chats can be annoying and im sure the general higher degree of kindness is a breathe of fresh air

---
no?
---
They cannot level to 60 in one week..
---
No chance.
---
Yes, and it will last you a long time. If you want to raid or pvp you will probably hit max level around when BWL and BGs open. 
---
There is so much content that you can play at your own pace. You can just do Dungeons and make the Tier 0 your goal. Hell, just hitting 60 is a big accomplishment. I expect a huge amount of attrition when most players have had to level for 10 hours each expansion will now need to level for 100 hours.
---
Haha. See you on the battlefield my friend.
---
Mage is usually a top pick for filling dungeon dps, always good damage, polymorph is the best hard cc for humanoids or beasts (almost all dungeons), aoe control and solid aoe damage.
---
How much does it benefit it? More than the DPS increase it might give a fury warrior or rogue?
---
Again, plenty of guilds didn't even have TF. It's not a necessary item for progression although it is nice.
---
TBH though, I was just using TF as an example. I could just as easily said giving a staff of shadow flame to a shadow priest.
---
I think it's unfair to the originators that anything done in Classic be considered "world first". I played Vanilla and I was nowhere near end game raiding level. I didn't become an actual raider until Burning Crusade and even then it was nowhere near the top US or world guilds.
---
Those top guilds in Vanilla were the real champions. So much of the stuff in the game was broken and you didn't have raid bosses "player tested" for months like you do now. I've posted before that once I started raiding in BC I ended up in the top guild on my server and we got many "Server firsts", but while those were really exciting for us we were copying the strategies and tactics of the 'top guilds' in the world who downed the bosses usually weeks or months before us.
---
Those guilds in vanilla got the true 'world firsts' under much more difficult conditions than any of the top guilds in Classic will face.
---
It will be a little inconvenience till then but no big deal most players will only just start getting keys by then.
---
&gt; Technically Keyring wasn't pure vanilla
---
Of course it was.  You don't get to decide that only the first X patches really count as Vanilla.
---
Yeah, I'm rolling Thalnos myself. I am just stating the drama that is going around to someone who asked about it. 
---
I'm sure it'll be fine and I look forward to playing with you there.
---
I'd like the current visuals and animations. That's it.
---
Actually forgot this existed :|
---
Hope to see competition, not in term of skill but more in term of organisation, preparation and execution
---
It would be like going to a convention or a fair for something you arent really into just because you like the venue or atmosphere. Can you? Yes. Are there a few others like you? Probably. Will you get looked at sideways sometimes by people who are there because they're interested in the subject matter? Definitely.
---
Think about it for a few. Imagine at a renaissance fair just walking through with no interest in even acting the part at all. Would probably feel a little awkward?
---
This is why I go RP tbh. Can't stand retarded names in mmos
---
I have been doubting my decision to play a holy paladin. My priority in terms of where I see myself spending time is BGs &gt; world PvP &gt; raiding &gt; dungeons &gt; soloing.
---
I see a lot of references to how paladins are strong PvP healers but without any specifics. Can anybody give me a more concrete description of the experience?
---
Also for soloing at 60 (quests, farming, etc) just how painful is life going to be in healing spec?
---
I am thinking about recording my playtime with nvidia. Just unsure of what to do with it once it’s saved. My SSD isn’t that big. Google drive?
---
Unless these guys have played pservers or practiced on one for months, they won't get it
---
It seems like you made up your mind already. Go hybrid the hell out of your pally. The light be with you or whatever pallys say.
---
I'm almost exactly like you, but I'm going druid.
---
+1 second on stun/pounce can be a real game changer at times.
---
That extra stun second allows you to get off a max rank healing touch and get back in form before the stun wears off.
---
As for pounce, it allows you to shred twice (from memory). Really amazing to have it.
---
Same. Love the graphic updates over the years
---
Cant handle the shazzchad
---
Appreciate the info!
---
Depends what you want. 
---
You could be a flag carrier. Basically a battlegrounds tank. 
---
Ranged DPS are really good at just dishing out consistent damage.
---
Fire mages do explosive burst damage, frost mages control melee classes really well.
---
Spriest is pretty amazing in PvP because you can spam vamp touch on every target in sight and heal a good portion all the time.
---
Affliction Warlock is crazy too. Just DOT every thing  up and watch em die, someone gets close just coop and fear em and run while dots do the work.
---
Hunters are great too I hear, never played one but they've always been a power house. Aimed shot Crits are bursty af.
---
DPS warriors get kited to easy.
---
Rogues are awesome. Can peel and kite for all your ranged well. Catch someone off guard can lead to an easy kill. Probably the best world PvP kings too. See someone pull a mob and then mess em up.
---
Never really played DPS warr or pally. So not too sure about them. I know with a good pocket healer they can be a wrecking machine😅.
---
Ya I can't see people juggling that many keys right away. The odd stuff like the Mara staff don't even go into it anyway.
---
Woops you are correct. While it's not a lot that 5% does add up over the course of a taid boss fight or a dungeon. I'm not really one to pick a race based on racials. I care more about the models and animations personally
---
Can you tank BRD, LBRs, etc as Arms?
---
We're gonna need more servers probably
---
Yes you can probably just sit on your character for the two hours before it goes live.

How I feel on Bloodsail
---
Make your own guild and stop wasting space on this subreddit with this garbage
---
There is a time and a place for ferals, unfortunately it's a lot more work, and the skill floor to even be worthwhile, is far too high for the average player to dedicate to achieving.
---
Ragnaros is a Mexican server.
---
Stick to the roads and watch to the roamers. Me and a buddy ran from Darn through darkshore and ashenvale all the way to crossroads and only got killed a few times from the roamers. 
---
Run to org, take zep to UC
---
Very cool! I'll give it a try on my pcs at home.
---
Just tag those mobs quick for the first few levels after that I'm not worried about it at all tbh.

Lol don’t wry majority of the wow community is still better than these artards. Don’t let them discourage you from subbing in 2 weeks again lol

TF was such a monster at threat generation that warrior tanks were using it well into T6 in BC. TF was a such a monster in threat generation that rogues and fury warriors who were lucky enough to have it had to STOP DPSing in the middle of encounters in order to drop threat.

Recount worked for me in the stress test. Granted I got to level 6 so I didn’t have much DPS.

We need tin foil hat wow edition

ok, that answers it.

Swede here, not moving.

You also said it'd be useful for newbies, though. But if the addon needs user input, it's not gonna be very helpful for newbies ;) But sure, a simple list based loot alert would be rather straight forward I'm guessing.
---
Games where death had real consequences are much more exhilarating. Unfortunately that's not what wow is. Wow is a steady stream of enjoyment injected straight into my veins.
---
You're right from a probabilities perspective. The question is simply at what point in time does it become more effective/efficient to use other abilities instead.

1 warrior who uses full plate + 2hander, 3 warriors who use whatever gear + resto shaman will be fastet to grind gold in dungeons like stratlive and scholo. Mark my words!
---
Knew a guy named Oi back in vanilla.
---
Personally I think the overall population will skew in favour of Horde. Per server, expect pvp realms to be Horde dominated and pve realms to be Alliance dominated.
---
WTS EFC on Gehennas. Also willing to trade for a Shazzrah name.
---
That seems dumb. We get shitty AV, but actually qol stuff suddenly doesn't need to be on 1.12 level at launch.
---
That would be nice!
---
&gt; why cant they "just get better servers" is what im asking.
---
I'll have a go at answering that. It's not just a question of having faster or bigger computers on their end, though that is part of it. And remember that a 'server' in WoW (and most MMO's) is not just one computer. Each 'server' will have multiple actual CPU's that handle various parts of the game world. How many actual CPUs will handle a single 'server' I don't know.
---
The real issue, and what  is that as you add players into an area the potential interactions between them increase exponentially not linearly. An interaction here is anything that any character needs to know about another character on the screen. Even if players are just standing still, the game needs to check which way everyone is facing, what items are equipped, did they /say anything etc ..
---
Say you have 10 people in an area.Each player needs to know about 9 other players. Times 10 players that's 90 possible interactions that the server has to check for and possibly handle. Now double the number of players. It's not 180 possible interactions. Because each player now has 19 possible interactions. Times 20 that's 380 possible interactions. One hundred players? That's 9,900 possible interactions. You very quickly reach a point where even if nothing is happening and your server is super fast it simply can't communicate the interactions quickly enough to keep up - server lag.
---
I'd imagine it's only a minority of us that would sub just to reserve names, I'd be happy to be wrong though. The more the better, and it helps to have more accurate ideas on server pop.
---
I partage your opinion and will create a character on every server, but will be probably be rolling on Golemagg!
---
By any class?
---
As someone else said, need to narrow it down.
---
So let's go through the roles:
---
DEFENSIVE SUPPORT (also known as defensive healer, such as priest/paladin): keep your group alive, sometimes keep the flag carrier alive, basically you are their shadow. You do what they say, and if you are fighting midfield you are trying to keep others alive.
---
OFFENSIVE SUPPORT (primarily, shaman): you are purging all friendly buffs, slowing, tossing totems and doing everything you can to screw with the enemy and focusing on key targets (healers, flag carrier).
---
UTILITY/DAMAGE (hunter, mage, warlock): take out key targets, use CC effectively to control the pace of the fight. Warlocks - curse of tongues on all healers, seriously I cannot stress this enough CURSE OF FREAKING TONGUES. Agony will do JACK in comparison to tongues. Mages - use frost nova, sheep and whatever you can, protect your supports, back up your flag carry, remember their lives is quite often in YOUR hands. Screw meters, people will feel the impact of a single sheep more than any pyroblast will EVER do. Hunters - track humanoids/beasts, find those flag carriers, call it out, use traps, conc shot, and send your pet on casters (especially healers) to pushback their casts.
---
MELEE DAMAGE: key targets, see a healer, get on them. Interrupt heals, make their life a living hell. Not in range of any key targets (healers, fc's), support your healers and casters. All melee dps have some kind of CC, so USE IT. A healer's healing goes to 0 if they are dead.
---
And finally:
---
DRUIDS: (yep they get their own mention here) you're the flag carrier primarily in WSG, the entire game revolves around you, and the enemy flag carrier. You need to play evasive, and very smart. You will be fed a TON of information by your team constantly, so focus up and try to filter through everything. Calling your position and calling for help BEFORE you're in a bad situation is CRITICAL to your survival. If you're not on FC duty (as there's other druids on the map or playing another map) you're a defensive support. HoTs are quite strong in pvp, especially rejuventation as there's no cast time, so you don't need to stand still! This is very VERY important as people are going to be hunting you. If a melee goes towards you, drop into bearform. You can last longer in bear, and you have frenzied regen for a small heal over time.
---
If you need more details about a specific class let me now. But that's the general overview of what kind of roles people fall into.
---
This is what I had planned on doing. I just recently started playing WoW. I find the gnome to be the only race I enjoy. So I only have the choice of the four classes to pick from. I was going priest but that isn’t an option 😏

Hi, /u/Popaye512
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqf1jf/think_im_going_to_be_a_good_contact_to_add_to/). 
---
Many people, including the person who set that record, expect it to be shattered during classic.
---
They should take away login servers because watching people riot on reddit is funny.
---
Don't get me wrong. This might be a good setup to get players out of the starter zones at launch
---
considering that the Realms are already burdened with 50 k players just for the name creation.
---
Blizzard might be forced to do super layering for the starter zone. Aka. Layers withing a layer.
---
However. I don't think its fair to blatantly keep this total nerf of the starter zone unaddressed.
---
Mad, bud? 
---
Look... This post was to get people to consider that maybe this shit isn't as serious as it's being made out to be.
---
If I really want to make it a life goal to raid prot I'm not going to roll up in someone else's guild and tell them how things are going to be if that's what you're worried about.
---
If that's my life's goal I'll either find a guild that says ok yeah let's try it out or I'll make my own.
---
But I was using myself as an example not the point. 
---
The main point of all this was that you're going to expect people to shut up and heal and take what you give them and never once think that maybe this guy who is 80+% of the time doing what's best for the raid wants a piece of loot for soloing or PvP or whatever and maybe they deserve a shot at it.
---
Maybe that guy isn't a team player in your eyes but maybe the rest of the guild shouldn't be so fucking selfish either.
---
I do! But I’m no expert in PVP nor PVP when it comes to warlocks - at all! Actually I’m just an Novice trying to figure out some of the details that would help me through parts of the leveling. A good start so to say! 
---
The model is actually just a personal tool for me to remember some of the stuff, that I know I’ll forget in the process. I just thought i’d share it with you guys. Hope you find it handy!
---
Right! [This](https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/february/WoWChronicleSample-12.jpg) is a map of Azeroth prior to the Sundering for reference. 
---
At some point, Sargeras, the evil demon lord, corrupted Queen Azshara and lead her to summon the Burning Legion into Azeroth. The Well of Eternity was the source of all Arcane energy in Azeroth, and thus the most talented of Azshara's magi summoned the demonic legion to Azeroth using the well. The demons, of course, attempted to destroy Azeroth and corrupt all of its living forms, but a group of Druids, leaded by Cenarion and Malfurion, succeeded in destroying the corrupted well. The legion was repelled, but at a great cost: many demigods and holy creatures perished in battle, the world was shattered into several continents, and Arcane magic, which drawed the attention of Sargeras to Azeroth in the first place, became strictly forbidden. The Night Elven society prevailed mind you, but the Highborne who still practiced sorcery were exiled: some went underwater following Azshara, thusly becoming the Naga, and others, unwilling to give away their Arcane way of living, traveled to eastern lands, founding Quel'Thalas and later becoming the High Elves. The Sunwell, the High Elven source of energy, was made from a flask that contained a sample of water taken from the Well of Eternity before it was destroyed.
---
It's a great story, and although there's so much lore, the game makes way more sense if you know the stories behind the places and characters in Azeroth!
---
😉
---
I read of a tank/holy build (can't remember the split) that actually made Paladin quite versatile, which I liked the sound of. It allowed perfectly capable tanking for dungeons during levelling, easy farming and good survivability for BG's and so forth. Should suit level 60 questing quite well.
---
I need to find the post again, or simply Google it, but that's probably what I'll be running until I find a solid raid guild who will, of course, swing me over to end game Holy-ness.
---
A stream belonging to one of them. Maybe it was a ruse, but I doubt it.
---
The realms are showing a *'up'* to me.  As in up so you make make a character and not much else.
---
As far as names go: https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/world-of-warcraft.php
---
I think there is a limit to the realm still. I believe it was said that each layer will be near the size of an original classic retail server (~3500?). But the cap for the realm will be between 30k-50k. 
---
Just what I have picked up from browsing here so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Ty man
---
Yes, it will be world first Classic Rag kill.
---
Just a reminder that using $ to trade names is against the user agreement. Thus, a violation of this subreddits rules. AND Blizzard monitors these forums, or maybe Soupa tells them shit. Either way. You are walking on thin ice
---
Shazzrah discord feels like bunch of 12 year old meme makers. I left the channel after couple of hours.
---
Some trash chat is fun, but it sucks when it takes of a chat channel.
---
Well the Blizzard Devs literally told us in interviews that they would watch closely and make decisions based on the number of people creating characters during name reservation. I'm happy that everyone is so happy, but it can't really be a surprise :D
---
You can't really prepare enough to transform 120 hours into the amount required to accomplish that.
---
Not trying to be a jerk, but I was definitely being sarcastic. You’re going off memory here friend, from a long time ago. I’m pretty sure their numbers are more accurate than your memories.
---
Imagine saying that without any humor. It doesn't add up
---
I off-tanked MC and BWL mobs with Arms/Fury and probably 5 in Prot (10 max iirc). 
---
I was smart with +Defense gear and healers had no issues keeping me up on Vael.
---
discord is not the game
---
I'm simply pointing out that your "consensus" isn't automatically fact. People on non-RP realms aren't automatically toxic just because you say they are. In fact, from the exchange I've had with RP players so far, you seem more toxic than any player I've met in a PvP realm.
---
So my druid buddy does want to focus on healing. But I do not know how he is going to about talents and what not. We also have a warlock that is joining us bringing the group total to 4 folks now.
---
Might work in a guild situation but pugs aren't going to have the patience to understand your rules and will be full of loot drama.
---
Undead Warlock and Troll Priest are spot on
---
There are bots running especially up until release. It's gonna be for super common words or 2 letter stuff that they can sell
---
Got zappy!
---
Ahh okay. Yeah I was just going from memory, I knew I was probably wrong lol. Thanks for the input. Do you know if they'll be using live Classic data after the 26th?
---
Before ZG and AQ20 are released, then yes, both Onyxia's Lair and Molten Core are very mandatory.  And even after they are released, it's still very recommended to get gear from those places if you want to progress to say AQ40 (or even BWL if your guild is lacking lots of T2 themselves).
---
There were two main reasons, dodging the huge queues predicted on Shazzrah during launch and dodging the unofficial Spanish realm.
---
There will be queues on all PvP-realms for sure, but hopefully Gehennas will be more reasonable atleast.
---
U shouldn't be talking in the middle of a game anyways xDDD
---
And the words needed are: Mid, gank, bush, and look at Widowmaker ass, so...
---
Cross-Realm BGs though
---
Too bad week one is only 5 days long before it ends then and Classic isn't a private server you nub.
---
If you don't enjoy your roll in a video game, reroll.
---
Don't expect to be rewarded for doing something you dislike of your own volition. Especially at the expense of the group.
---
I had an addon during TBC and Wrath that replaced the undead character models with the Chinese versions (no exposed bone, no rips in armor).
---
I haven't been able to find anything like it for Vanilla/Classic though. Can anyone help me out?
---
Completely FAKE. Did you even read the link?
---
I remember it was nearly unusable on my old computer due to being infested with Flash-based ads. ALL THE POPUPS!
---
Human Rogue or Dwarf Rogue ? Human gives access to a 25 talent tree as a racial ability and 10% rep is huge for people no longer playing this again in their early 20s. Stoneform gives the win versus hunters though. It's so huge for PVP, even versus other rogues.
---
I know this is beside the point of the thread, but man that talent build is awfully... awful. Rather than putting as many points into the best talent available, it just jumps around. For all your sakes, I just deleted what I wrote because I ended up ranting about every talent choice in that sequence.
---
Decided between gnome mage, human warrior, and dwarf rogue.
---
Already eliminated mage for now and will be an alt in the future.
---
Really like the aesthetic of the Human warrior and how they look in any armor really. Also like the idea of difficulty. Really into bloodborne/dark souls so I feel the leveling process is up my alley.
---
For rogue I've had little experience playing this class. Probably up to level 28 like 4 years ago. I really like the idea of sneaking around. Pvp will be my focus with raiding being pretty close second, depending on my schedule. Dwarf would be great for pvp, so I have that base.
---
Gold is somewhat of a concern, but my focus will be more leaning towards accumulating wealth than speeding through leveling. Also gives me a chance to really enjoy everything this time around since I was 12. Played a wanna be ret pally in vanilla :)
---
Of all the things to retain from earlier patches, it’s the “no keyring” nonsense.
---
There are a lot more private server guilds that are in the running for first rag. They aren't as famous as APES, but definitely in the running.
---
That was retail vanilla. This is classic.
---
Sure it'll work, but as with playing anything off an external flash drive, it's gonna not be optimal. You'll encounter pretty slow load times, among other things (naturally).
---
https://i.redd.it/c2sn4lju8fg31.gif
---
&gt; For a start this is on PS
---
Oh you mean this post has nothing to do with Classic then?
---
Well has you said, just have to share account and by day 5 you have a good chunk of your 40 raiders ready. The first ones can get quintessence and farm a few dungeons and by day 7 you have your 40 players with basic/semi decent stuff and you have probably a shot at Ragnaros. 
---
Now of course it requires playing unhealthy amount of time, breaking TOS and being super prepared with more than 40 people but... you can bet that some people will just do that
---
What name was sniped?
---
It been a fe years now how do you summon raggers without the rep further water?

Best Addon for rogue regarding Stun / Blind Timers?
---
Guild names are limited to 32 characters but must still follow Blizzards restrictions as to appropriate content. Unlike character names, guild names may include spaces and are case-sensitive.
---
Cata i had most fun with, wrath was best in terms of content.
---
Priest or Druid
---
Im having the hardest time deciding on a class for classic! Originally I wanted to play horde and go undead priest and it was such an easy decision to make. I think undeads look super cool and are so aesthetically pleasing in cloth. Being a healer I would always find groups and if I ever decided to do PVP I could melt faces. I was happy.
---
Then all my friends decided that they wanted to play alliance, and we all know what good is it playing if you cant WoW with your rl buddies (am I right). And this decision fucked up everything! Becoming a priest then became questionable as I now would have to play human/NE or dwarf. Which to me all look terrible in cloth, my favourite alliance class is gnome but being a priest isn't possible. I figured well if I cant get any of those to look aesthetically pleasing guess I'll go dwarf female and say fuck it I'm ugly and proud plus it would be kind of cool being a unique snowflake and grow to love me weird character.
---
Then entered my thoughts of the druid! After going back and forth wondering could I really love a female dwarf maybe I could be a druid healer! This way I can still play the roll I want as healer making and asset in end game content. Easy to gear up as there arnt many around and it could be fun being able to play any roll. I just worry with all the constant druid hate about never being the best healer and not being the best tank would that effect my competitive nature of wanting to be great! Also their complicated builds and if I would miss out on groups for someone wanting to take a priest or healer instead. I was a gnome rogue the first time I played classic and I hated the feeling of being so disposable its a feeling I want to protect myself from this time around. And no I am not a fan of paladins at all! lol just don't like em.
---
But yeah I would love to hear what you guys say think, all advice is welcome. Thanks for letting me rant everyone
---
Not everything is in that folder. There will also be stuff in AppData as well as registry entries. Also I think battle.net is required so you would need it and all of the dependencies it has too.
---
Some programs will run off USB and create this stuff on the fly whilst others won't run without it so portable versions of them have to be made to encapsulate everything required.
---
Yeah even the bigger polls only have like 40k participants. It's good, but it's the group that actually googles and uses Reddit.
---

The new mug'thol bc/wotlk era. Ahhh la nostalgie

Because you won’t have it yet. The best path for talents while leveling is to put your first 31 points into BM, until you get bestial wrath. After that you then go marks and get aimshot at level 51.

The problem here is that you’re saying it’s “wrong” that this guy was able to kill 5 familiar or whatever without having to stop, even though it’s using data blizzard took directly from the original client. They didn’t make it up. If he can do it now, he could do it then. People are better now on average. He could’ve known what he was doing. Too many assumptions for this post to make sense, memory aside.
---
And that was just the first verse...
---
There is no difference
---
very true
---
 + the utility spells that the horde have to constantly be purging/dispelling 
---
really hard to say priests are better than pallys in pvp healing
---
Do only Male taurens have bigger boxes, or female too?
---
Thanks m8, any feedback is greatly appreciated!
---
Azuregos
---
Could you share your preists name so I can /hug you in game?
---
Warlocks are always strong 1v1 but less useful in group PvP. In later phases, you can make up for your shortcomings in groups by having excellent gear because you just delete people before they can react. That's what people mean when they say Warlocks scale with gear.
---
Most people who choose Warlock for PvP just want to melt faces 1v1. You don't need to wait until the later phases to do that.
---
You know the beta is closed and invite only right
---
I can't help but feel like you're projecting some grief you have about people feeling entitled. Life in 2019 is hard isn't it?
---
Do you think I'm that fucking delirious that I think the whole classic population is going to read this and say holy shit I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner! This is the ONLY way to play! How could we have been so blind!
---
No. I'm just putting some shit out there for people to consider. That is possible that maybe there's such a thing as taking this whole min/max shit too seriously.
---
To be honest though I don't give a shit what people do. I'm just bored at work and needed something to do.
---
Time to go home now though so thanks for helping pass the time. You're the real MVP now.
---
Ok so Mages are a good pick to fill a 5 man spot. I am a little worried about overpopulation but that is reassuring at least. My favorite thing about my pally in retail is that I can auto get into any group bc i can heal / tank and both are always in such high demand.
---
I keep checking because somehow I was allowed to reserve 4 names lol
---
The way you say that makes it sound like they will be updating the game to. BC/WOTLK....is that a possibility?
---
That was beautiful
---
Nice. The usual twists and irony that was never funny to being with.
---
At least there is some difficulty in this forum because you can forget about that come the launch of Classic.
---
But at this point of the evolution of a company, after many years of experiance with launches, they should know the bottleneck(s). I don't think they have all their servers in premisse. At this point, it's not a technical limitation. They can rent more IaaS for the auth services, but this is a management decision.
---
I think it will be fine after all. 10 to 45 minutes queueueue is ok for a game I'll play for years! 240 hours played per year, 1 hour queued on lunch.
---
Alles gut
---
Do you know if this addon will be updated for Classic (if it hasn't yet)?
---
Guild Banks for me
---
Personally I think you will have more fun on a pve realm, I will get brigaded by all of the PVP players but as a new player you will struggle to defend yourself in pvp and I think it will take away a lot of the charm that WoW has to offer. If you want to PVP on a pve server there is always battlegrounds.
---
Finland here, we're holding horses (staying on shazzrah for now) and looking where nords are settling on the following days. Seems like most nords are holding breath and waiting mostly for spanish players to make their minds first.
---
I don't know what it means, I haven't heard anything from Blizzard that *defines* this. At launch, my guess is that it will mean that it's full until someone logs out, and thus the queues will be huge. That's what I gather from experience and from the Blue post from this morning:  [https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/new-wow-classic-realm-coming/69910](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/new-wow-classic-realm-coming/69910) 
---
&gt;We suggest that players choosing a realm consider this one \[Gehennas\], as **we expect that other English PvP realms may experience severe queues at release**.
---
They don't say it means no other characters/accounts can be created in the server, just they warn of **severe** queues.
---
But it's speculation... would just seem kind of silly if no other accounts could try to log onto "full realms", cuz what if people who'd created characters didn't all log in the second the realm launches (relatively unlikely, but still), it would mean they're leaving realms with some room in them, which seems counter-productive at launch.
---
Yes, Shazz is so much better that Swe Nordic coalition (90%) decided to leave it 😂

Seriously though check the discord...

They opened a 3rd one and it's already high aswell.

Aren't you embarrassed writing this?
---
They don't need to. They can just scale it down. It's like when F1 teams build a scale model of their car to run wind tunnel tests with. Why don't they run a full sized car? Because they don't need to. They can get the data they need from a small scale model and them simply scale it up to size when they're ready to go.

Hahahah, alright. I'll fix that when I get home! Annoying that they snuck that into the software I used

What's a good site for searching add-ons by category for  classic wow?
---
Lol except not everyone playing classic takes a census on reddit.
---
Let me guess, you started playing after Cataclysm?
---
no particular reason but,
---
from what I see in server populations and reddit posts:
---
pvp &gt;&gt;&gt; pve
---
streamers server &gt;&gt; none
---
eastern &gt; pacific
---
so of course a server with only the last one would have medium(?) population
---
Starting your sub 2 weeks early to reserve you name will cost you $6.77. A far cry from $15.
---
(14/31*15)
---
Not that I disagree with the sentiment. It’s still definitely a lame cash grab by Blizzard.
---
It's not. Strange Behaviour is staying on Shazzrah, but the doc is saying Gehennas

Some of us have family, friends, work, athletics, and still have good amounts of time for wow. In this situation I have all the above. Problem is on a week to week basis my game time changes. Being able to plug into raids, because lets face it not all guilds will fill 40 slots every raid time, is my goal. Healer role tends to fit the lf x for pug slot in guild run more than anything else, but the popularity of those classes pollutes the chance of getting such spots.

---
In the closed beta I don't think you could summon people from outside an instance to the inside. Wanted to summone someone to a WC run in progress and couldn't.
---
Did they change that?
---
That until you look at more recent gear sets.
---
Sorry I made an edit if you care to read, since I felt like my original comment was not a story enough.

It's not your name until your character is created. Until then, it's simply a name you and probably others want.

Which server will they play on?
---
Me and my friend, both took 4 days off from work, and we are going balls deep for 6 days in a row. Trying to get around 55lvl, then the rest of the levels we can solo, if we don't find time to play together.

Nobody does a notepad.  Nobody did a spreadsheet.  We were all 16 to 20. If they messed up badly enough,  you remembered.  If they ninjad something of yours,  you still remember their name to this day.

Ulduar raiding in Wrath.

Not 5. 15 mobs. Close to entire Cave without exiting combat, because he was doing a "speed level" mini test. Skill ? at level 6 ? There was nothing more to do than backpedal and cast heroic strike. I could do that as a kid after a couple of hours play time.

A silver, 4 golds, and a platinum for saying, "There were too few login gateways on name day.  I think they will open more on launch day.  This is very hard."
---
Not really, they might be more, but wrong to call it Nordic coalition when it's only one country.  
---
That said, several swedes said in the Norwegian discord, that it's not all the Swedish guilds, just some of them.  
---
Don't know the numbers, i am not going to play on the Nordic server, even if i'm Norwegian, but i follow the discord.

You can't just transfer away from your problems like you can in retail.  Rerolling in vanilla takes months and months of time.

If you make a macro for an ability that does not specify a rank, it will try to cast the highest rank you have available.
---
For example:
---
`#showtooltip`
---
`/cast Mark of the Wild`
---
You can throw this macro on your bars at lvl 1 before you even have the spells and do not have to change all the way to 60.

It looks like KoS addon was updated for Classic - do you know if Opium will be too?
---
Why exactly? 
---
If you dont mind explaining your reasoning, i'd like to know
---
I don’t know what you’re so upset about, vanilla was not hard. It was new and people didn’t have nearly as much experience with mmos. It’s going to get steam rolled by people who know what they are doing
---
Hope this is allowed here; I want to ask WHERE should I play more than what. 
---
I am torn between choosing a PvP or PvE realm first of all. I'd immediately go PvP but since I'm going to be Alliance, I am a bit afraid that the Horde will be super dominating. Is this an actual concern or will it be more fair? I want to do both PvE and PvP so it's pretty important to me.
---
And on that note, I'm west coast but from what I hear, none of west coast servers are a good choice. Apparently Whitemane is where all the trolls are oging? And Fairbanks is a low population. Would I be able to get away with east coast without suffering too much?
---
Thanks to any who answer
---
They should've had a LATAM EST. Or just a 4th. It seems like the demand is there.

When Overwatch was launched I had zero problems getting in, no queues. With the amount of experience Blizzard have now, I'm sure they can handle it.

---
I don't think you're delirious, just stupid
---
It has everything but race / class haha dang.
---
I most certainly won't do it, because I have not lost complete faith that Blizzard might implement unarmoured 100% mounts.
---
If they do, I will want a 100% wolf as tauren. If I dungeon grind, I will still be friendly and have to spent thousands of gold buying runecloth.
---
I rather level 1-2 more days /played and be 3/4 revered with Orgrimmar, maybe even exalted if spillover works in vanilla.
---
I would like everything the same, just delete lfg and flying mounts, but this last will need to ve reworked as there are places you only can access by flying
---
On Light's Hope a guild did it in a week if memory serves. Basically just geared in high end greens.

RP? Nah dude I had enough STDS back in Moonguard
---
I played MoP on release and could barely accept quests, has Blizzard changed how they handle launch dates since then?
---
he didn't explicitly say I did, you're right.
---
Alright, well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news here. But I've actually gone ahead and changed the addon. It will not automatically purchase limited-quantity items. That was not at all the intention of this addon, and I don't much like the idea of it being used that way. If you can find some other way to cheese limited-quantity items, go for it. But I'd rather you not do it with Personal Shopper.
---
Just remember, people are stupid. Makes reading comments alot easier.
---
From most to least important:
---
**Blackmage** for my Mage. Literally my username everywhere and it makes too much sense not to do it.
---
**Avery** for my Priest. I just like the name to be honest.
---
**Byleth** for my Warlock. The main character's name in the new Fire Emblem, which I'm currently playing. Heard this name for the first time there and thought it sounded cool. Looked it up and it's the name of a mythical king of hell, which is pretty fitting for a Warlock.
---
My fiancé scheduled a cookout with her mom on the first Saturday of classic and didn’t ask me first. 
---
My job doesn’t let me call off mid week. I’m playing wow only in evenings after work until that weekend. 
---
I am trying to get out of it without sounding like a dick 😂
---
You should encourage other servers to reduce the queue times on your server. Just my two cents.
---
Not sure why it would take someone longer than 20-30 seconds to make the character you want...
---
Create a character and go through the options before you remake...
---
If I was that guy I'd wait until the game goes live and get faulty to say he wants to use real money to buy the name and get his arse banned

It seems like the majority of the swedish guilds moved to the new EU server, but there will probably still be a good balance of scandinavians on Shazzrah
---
And to compound on this. HC guilds are more amped and organized than ever before. They have new leveling techniques (i.e. dungeons) that previously weren't as effective. 
---
One of the major flaws with this subreddit is that its impossible to tell who actually knows what they are talking about. It's getting more and more clear that people re-entering the game join the sub and just spread complete misinformation based on "what they remember" from 14 years ago, or worse, are just talking off the top of their heads.

Having a hard time picking between mage and druid. I fear I will eventually want to do damage as vanilla is known for one shots from warriors, enhance, and mages. But the gearing is so much quicker for druid because no competition really.

Struggling to understand how long in comparison it would be to get tier I guess.

Either way play male. Both female races animations arnt as good imo.

I know what options I want the problem is someone/bot getting my name as soon as I delete it

Should note though that the keyring won't actually be available immediately, and will have to wait for the first patch before it becomes available (no word on when that will be -- I also looked through all comments on here to see if anyone had mentioned this being absent from the beta/stress tests and couldn't find anything about it, so decided to post it here as a PSA).

Better than voidwalker as a pet since you push more dmg mobs die more quickly and you get enough sustain so it speeds up lvling a lot

Basically if you wanna be able to heal yourself in combat more than 1 time per fight you wanna play a pally Druid priest or shaman.

I really like the idea of a hybrid or caster and like the idea of being able to lvl quickly am leaning towards a druid / shaman

I think it’s impossible to have an “authentic Vanilla experience.” We know so much more about the game. I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed, because we have turned retail into a big spreadsheet where all the wonder and exploration are replaced by min/maxing to the extreme. 
---
I mean damn, that is what made Vanilla special. All the new things we learned and how hard it seemed at the time. 
---
If you want a better analogy. It will be like starting a new ladder on Diablo 2. It’s the same game you love, but you will only capture a fraction of the wonder you found the first time. Still, 10% of what I felt in Vanilla is still 1000x the experience of retail.

and even if everybody in the raid min/maxes so that the content becomes trivial, the next step is just... take less people to raids so that there's more min/max raids and more loot, like 20 man MC x 2 instead of 20 tryhards carrying 20 boomkins

Flying really didn’t do as much as people are saying in tbc. And there’s many areas of the outlands only accessible by flying mount which would require world adjustments. Quite honestly this magical world where max level characters are just roaming on their epic mount and dueling each other in thrilling battles it’s largely mythological. Tbc started a few trends that started a snowball effect to the game we have today but flying wasn’t one of them. 
---
If it’s that big of a deal just change flying so if someone hits you in flight then you’re both dismounted and given a slowfall buff until you hit the ground.

That works very well for the medical field, especially since people are putting their lives in your hands. But with technology lives are really at stake.

Unfortunately technology isn't always consistent, a crash could happen. I believe OP is correct though, but blizzard wont say that; It would give people too high of expectations. If something goes wrong then the people would be more up in arms about it. 
---
However if it goes smoothly then people will be satisfied. People expect the worst and are pleasantly surprised when it doesn't happen. But if they are believing the best will happen and even something small goes wrong and is quickly fixed, people go crazy.

This sub seems to have a collective amnesia when it comes to flying, at least in TBC.
---
Farming for epic flying took most people as long as (and possibly even longer than) 100% mounts in vanilla. Basic flying was more of a utility than a mode of transport, a lot of people only used to reach places like TK instances or Ogrilla, or move around BEM (the zone was designed around flying). For a good portion of the expansion FP+ground mounts was the most used mode of travel. And having two or more characters with epic flying? Almost unheard of.
---
Case in point: how many druids capable of summoning Anzu do you remember?
---
Epic flying only became more common when the Quel'Danas patch hit and all players got access to steady income from daily quests.
---
It really became an issue in Wrath with how much easier it was to obtain thanks to inflation (and even more trivial on alts).

Both are solid options. Although Hunter is often seen as a rookie class, it's quite the opposite. They are tough to master, comparatively. They have a lot of clunky mechanics to get used to and it's very easy to make mistakes (hence their old bad reputation -- though don't worry about that these days). 
---
Shamans are easier to get into, but still have a ton of buttons to use optimally. Granted, most totems won't see much use if any at all. 
---
Personally, ever since it became known that the 1.8 diminishing return sharing between Freezing Trap and Scatter Shot will be in Classic, I've been turned off from Hunter. They already got a deadzone, shot weaving etc to deal with and with their best CC option being in a poor state I'm not convinced. I think Shaman will be a better bet in general, between the two, if we're talking end-game dueling and BGs. Shamans are also always in high demand. Plus, you could quite easily raid as 30/0/21 and have a solid healing spec and optimal PvP spec. 
---
Hunter undoubtedly levels a ton faster though. No two ways about it. Either are by no means a poor choice.
---
If they want my memes, they can pry them from my cold, dead hands.

The weapon skill doesnt work in pvp and doesn't just give 3% hit.  Mosts guilds give the token shaman sulfuros so axe skill isn't as necessary.  If anything it will make them want you to be nightfall bitch even more.
---
I have to switch somewhere and I'd rather take Gehennas over Golemagg. So Gehennas it is.
---
Hopefully this time you can level and see the cloak :D

It’s a little subjective but for me it is primarily because I enjoy keeping others alive and I have found the Priest has the most diverse tools set to do that. A Druid is also fun with friends, you can fill dungeon roles easily and stealth while they take the attention. But being the “field medic” and being able to drop some range damage/mana burns when the situation calls for it is a good time in a group.
---
It will be popular but definitely not as popular as a warrior
---
Will twitch mod will properly support Addons for Classic just like it does with retail?
---
I'm with ya fellows!  
---
Among other things, it is decent info and I can partly confirm the info as a ICT-Teacher (not my main field tho).
---
Oh, my bad. I put the new .exe in a folder by itself because I thought it was supposed to be an installer. It opens after replacing the file, I'll get to the actual testing part now!
---
Hopefully lots of pop-up pictures too
---
What about #nochanges?

RAISE THE PITCH FORKS! /s

I've remade a 2 letter name a few times, and it's been fine.

Chill out and just play what you want

Liar, not Scourge. Only orcs of the Mordor !
---
"Change Realm" was disconnecting me, so don't worry, you might have been fucked either way
---
It feels like 2 examples were given of things opening, and more could have been given. Such as dire maul and the darkmoon fair.
---
And more, meaning Zul'Gurub, battlegrounds, etc.
---
But I know what you mean, and I wish it were so.
---
I am aware. But I have so many on my retail account... I just want to bring them all D:
---
Maybe, but they are also one of the best dps classes in the game and come with a decent cc and the best interrupt, so they're worth playing.
---
You’re fine, I’ve deleted and remade my characters at least 4 times. There is 0 chance you’ll lose your name in the 30 seconds it takes to do this.

People like paladin healers because they have really good physical damage mitigation just for wearing plate. But their blessing of freedom and flash of light spamming + spiritual focus allows you to output a lot more heals faster than any other class when getting hit. Also, because crits refund mana cost, you can spam heals longer than any other class as well.
---
You can also go pretty deep into the prot tree to further enhance your tankiness. 
---
But yeah, that's mainly why healing paladins were a terror in pvp, because all dps aim for healers first then to cloth dps. And in a race between both sides, any other healing class is dying way faster than the paladin. And once the healer is dead, the enemy push essentially gets routed after that point most of the time. 
---
However, because people know that paladin buffs can be cleansed off, once shamans or priests start to dispelling buffs on your DPS and begin to cc them, that's when the fights become more interesting. But in the end, you still have an advantage overall due to being almost a tank yourself.
---
Why does it seem like so many petulent man-children are here?  Is that really the crowd that classic is drawing?
---
The high warrior population will decrease the rogue population, if anything.
---
can i smell ur seat?
---
Classic stuff going back to Retail, one Thex at a time? :D
---
If I lose the name Anthony i'll be so sad :( haha but youre right, I'm sure it will be fine.
---
Yea that’s true as well, I figured most locks will run am/ruin once they gear up a bit.
---
Not pointless, removing slows and roots is valuable against most classes. Mages will probably be a nightmare regardless.
---
Worth noting you will probably have freedom from pallys or free action potions tho
---
&gt;I'm going to insult my friends because I'm a moron
---
Warrior and rogue will be most played.
---
Then mages 
---
and then everyone else.
---
It's No attack If the login attempts are real players, it's still ddos, tho..
---
Who the fuck are you to judge another man's meme

Definitely Druid. The warriors lack of hesling will make you feel incomplete.

---
Ah thanks, then thats a load off my mind.
---
Man I feel bad for laughing at that.
---
That may be true, but it feels a bit awkward that they mention Naxx, and more overtime (since Naxx is pretty much at the end of Vanilla's timeline)
---
Just remember that you'll most likely be playing your class, not your spec. Healers heal.
---
Not at all. Even if prepared, Gnome is definitely the strongest dueling race for a Warrior. Night Elf gets a lot of mileage out of shadowmeld in WPvP though. But Escape Artist is very useful. Obviously you'll struggle with Mages, either way, but it can make the difference far more than other Alliance racials.
---
So to clarify open world pvp is a thing on Pve worlds ?
---
Got Windfurious (Shaman) and Axcellent (Warrior) so im pretty happy
---
&gt; No need to be the archetypical chan dunning kruger boi or result to pedantry, though I do understand that you always have to feel like you're the smartest in the room
---
Yikes dude. Somehow you didn't realize that post was meant for another thread since it had absolutely nothing to do with what were talking about here. Obviously I can't be the smartest person in the room if you're here lol. Anyway, yes I think grob will be low pop and consist of mostly redditors, since they literally created the server just for a few outspoken crybabies here, and had no intentions of rolling one out to begin with. Now what you've done is split the already small population of RP players across what will be two extreme low pop servers.
---
Indeed, it was my top result, wish there was a way to downvote it.
---
Back in the days of early private server we played often in realm with max 100 online player...
---
how do shamans and paladins fare in healing 5 man content? I'm pretty much set on healing with one of these classes.
---
Yeah i was going for it on Herod as well but not right at the start. I got runecrafting on faerlina yesterday, but will be maining runecrafting with an alt-code i, on Herod.
---
You will be proven wrong. onslought members already explained on Podcast how it is possible to pull this off... and it’s not even Hard. There have been enough private server starts to test and even the last Stresstest was a good check to get ahead of the pack. There are enough levelling strategies to get 60 people to 60 by Monday.
---
widepeepoHappy
---
Meh cata was just a whole downhill thing.
---
i cant believe it LOL this is amazing
---
EST guy rolling on Fairbanks here. Tbh, between Whitemane being the 4chan server, Faerlina being the streamer server, Thalnos being the Brazilian server, and Herod being massively overcrowded, Fairbanks seems like the only choice that won’t be completely insane.
---
Tell me more about the condom catheter and colostomy bag.
---
With Prot/Ret you rely purely on Reckoning and Retribution Aura.  So I would really recommend that 5th point in Reckoning. This method is slow but costs almost no mana so you can do it Warrior Gear.  You will be killing one mob at a time, but chain pulling so you always have multiple mobs hitting you. Your only sustain in this build is Seal of Light and Judgement of Light which you should keep up all the time, so spending 2 points to lower Blessing of Protection's cooldown may be more useful here.
---
Prot/Holy is the superior build, but you will have to exchange Seal of Light for Seal of Wisdom occasionally so you can keep your Consecrate up.  This build is a bit harder to do with pure Warrior Gear so you will have to find some Int, but you are much safer because of Spiritual Focus and you will be burning packs down at the same speed so aren't constantly in combat.  This spec is definitely higher damage, but requires much more input.  You will be continuously rotating your Consecrate/Seal of Light/Seal of Wisdom and looking for Redoubt procs so you know when to Holy Shield. You have to swap to Concentration Aura in order to get a heal off and swapping Auras is two more GCD's on top of everything. It's not rocket science, but the other build is much simpler if that is your thing.
---
Druid, right after getting Bear.
---
I'm rolling a holy paladin for a similar reason: you're *always* in demand. 
---
Paladin blessings give you a ton of tools that you can use for your own defense, or to save your friends. Nothing feels quite as nice as getting a blessing of freedom from you pally friend while running down a mage.
---
Our heals are *insane*. Holy Light? Sure. It's big and slow and gets the job done. Flash of Light? Buckle up - it's *fast* and can very easily turn the tide of a battle. Now Lay on Hands? There's something just *special* - bring somebody from the edge of death up to full HP and put them back into the fight. 
---
Buddy got hit by a rogue? He's almost dead? BOP him. The best the rogue can do is blind him and hope for the best - full immunity to physical damage for X seconds and you've got the time to heal him up.
---
On top of all that? A hard single target stun that you can just slap people with to lock them down.
---
Go pally. You won't regret it.
---
I've tried using a remote desktop but there's something with MMO's and using your mouse to look around that makes it not work properly. The mouse sensitivity between the pc you're using and the desktop your connected to doesn't register properly so it feels like your mouse sensitivity is maxed.
---
Add-ons for classic private servers aren't compatible fully for official classic, at least from what I've noticed. I dumped my Vanilla private server 1.12 add-ons into the beta and basically all were broken. Sites need to separate the categories.
---
Baffling isn't, I hope the webiste is a joke.
---
Got me.  I'm EST and going to be rolling alliance on Grobb.  We can be the anti-server.  But miss me with that RP shit, unless that RP is killing raid bosses.
---
Got Kitsune, Tayto, and Craic, sorry Irish friends
---
Just because I agree, fuck that place, doesn't make you a boy, as a man can recognize the shit he's about to wade through and still wade through it (looking at you poison cave in Dark Souls 2)
---
I’m going alliance on this server :) hopefully it’s balanced
---
I mean personally I’d prefer it was level from 1 again
---
Who shat in your pants?
---
I cant tell you exactly, but Id imagine if you contacted them, and told them about how you want to keep your name, but just change the appearance they might be able to let you take your time, and make sure it gets back to you IF anything went wrong in the process. I cant say for sure if it works, but If I had a name like "Thex", and wanted to make sure I keep it then its what I would try first. If you can be sure the name wouldnt get taken at all then I wouldnt worry about it. With a name like Anthony though you can never tell who might be awake thinking "Oh lets try that one!" Gl op on keeping it
---
Anybody else getting Back to the Future vibes on this?  A man named Thex goes back in time to classic to alter the current retail game.  Like whoa!
---
I dont want no gayass Anthony name lmao
---
I was curious if it was like Ez or something good, then it might be worth to script

You sure trashing the dagger at lvl1 is worth it for immolate? You'll be out of mana really quickly, nd the stabbing helps kill them faster, while regenerating mana, no?
---
No. The only games that have a noticeable effect from that small of an ms increase are FPS games and the like. Also with the way spell batching is in classic, there will be even less worry about ping.
---
Nope, there is no spillover reputation. There are a few exceptions (like  some quests reward ironforge/gnomeregan reputation in Dun Morogh/Loch Modan).
---
Omg stop
---
What a unique idea
---
Okay cool, glad to know it works. Yeah I got my authenticator on my phone so good to go.
---
My Alliance will be on Fairbanks, and my Horde on /r/Grobbulus
---
Yea, I always thought they were pretty cool. Tedious but adds more emphasis and importance to certain dungeons and raiding
---
Having a hard time picking between warrior, hunter, lock, shammy :/
---
While I've settled on shaman, I can't decide which race to go with. 
---
I primarily intend to heal/pve after leveling and am not overly concerned with min/maxing. As lame is it sounds, my primary concern is a healing animation I won't get tired of.  I've ruled out male tauren and male orc as I'm not a fan of their cast animations. 
---
Any suggestions for race/gender combinations that you really enjoyed as a shaman back in classic? Thanks!
---
Yeaaaah lets go with that lol
---
?? It didn't on retail for me, and I downloaded all my classic addons through it too.
---
I see. So you are stating a fabricated number in the hopes that it gives credence to your point.
---
Common sense doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
I've always spent a ton of time trying to optimize my keybinds across my characters.  I try and keep the spells that I use the most closest to my fingers and easiest to click while also grouping types of spells together.
---
What's not shown in the image is some of the targeting keybinds I use, which I bind to the scroll wheel of my mouse.  Scroll up = Last Target, Scroll Down = Next Target, Middle Click = Target Self, and zoom in/out is changed to ctrl+scroll.
---
I'd be interested in seeing what other people use for their keybinds.
---
They're pretty easy, but... The drop rate for the Voodoo Charm is absurd. The other day on the stress test I nearly ground out an entire level on that one quest.
---
I have canadian satellite internet on an acreage, I consistently got 90-150 ping during the stress test
---
She's a level 28
---
I hope you really enjoy your vacation in Azeroth! :)
---
No Dark Mode? Are you mad?
---
Private servers. People played on pirated servers, for years. And infact are the reason we are getting classic.
---
No time off. Going to have to play it like any other game.
---
Hmm you sure? I did it without buying game time. Unless my subscription is still active....
---
Its the name of the RP-PVP server i'm playing on for classic.
---
They are releasing Vanilla again. As it was in patch 1.12, you can download it from battle net app, goes live 27.8 .
---
same, he can hear anything coming and the ride donkey ability is untouchable
---
Only eating one day for the week? Must be a big meal
---
Ok cool you go and stack agil and see how shit your dps is when levelling at like 35-50.  Look at any guide on classic Druid’s online and they all tell you str &gt; agil for levelling.
---
Finally some good fucking food.
---
https://discord.gg/fA7eHz
---
Yeah I'm so glad Titan was scrapped for Overwatch...
---
\*Resists your Hammer of Justice\*
---
Both do spectacular, shaman has chain heal, healing strem and utility buffs. Paladin has flash heal, possibly the most mana efficient heal in the game, holy light hits hard when you need it, plus they can wear plate and have a lot of utility spells as well
---
No rogue :(
---
I doubt you'll be disappointed if you roll mage mate. Apart from having to drink a lot. At least you can conjure your own water :D. Wands are also super useful in classic. Enjoy the vanilla experience buddy.
---
6-7 hours of sleep a day? Casual.
---
I even found Classic Beta ready addons that were broken. Specifically, an addon that stopped me from attacking mobs; I would press my action button and an error message would appear blocking my attack action. The addon of course had nothing to do with combat.
---
&gt; If you'd like to be able to do ranged DPS in pvp, shaman might be the better choice.
---
To chime in as a druid: BALANCE IS **GARBAGE**. (Sorry) It requires a ton of gear to do any kind of damage, the mana costs are huge.... could go on, but Ele shamans are insane, especially in pvp. Used to run a premade on a pvp server, had an ele shaman who would routinely, instagib people with chain lightning. (From full life) Was fun playing a druid running past him with the flag and watch him charge the doom lazer and watch the person chasing me fall over instantly.
---
So to continue the discussion:
---
Druid: hybrid melee/healing (as caster dps is not there), with tank thrown in as a possibility.
---
Shaman: hybrid caster/healing (enhance really isn't that great in classic, outside of nightfall bot), with ele being a possibility in pvp bursting out a key target.
---
As for leveling speed, shaman is decently fast, but is better with a warrior partner. (Windfury warriors will carry you to victory) And druids can level solo from 1-60 very fast and effectively, and is best paired with a rogue if anyone. (Due to using stealth quite often)
---
What class do you plan on rolling?
---
You don't eat after launch?
---
You Alliance don't know how bad you can have it in Classic. Horde in Vanilla was more often outnumbered, and vastly outnumbered as well. Even so badly that on my server, Dragonblight-EU, the ratio was 1 Horde for every 2 Alliance. Being to 2:3 isn't that bad tbh. Personally I was actually fearing a Vanilla ratio again of 1 Horde to 2 Alliance, and Alliance dominating the top 10 KT kills. Same I wouldn't have liked a ratio of 2 Horde per 1 Alliance either. Though 1:1 would've been ideal, with 2:3 the ratios in Classic are much closer to equal than in Vanilla.
---
Whoa now... You're telling me I can enjoy a piece of content without having to trash something else?
---
I got oldmeaty for my undead warrior and needarrows for my troll hunter
---
Very nice! I'll see you out in the battlefield for some world PvP! What class are you going to main?
---
Not sure of anything, but sure love to experiment! Your bare hands punching them mobs, should provide you with nearly the same dmg according to some youtubers!
---
Yeah it’s not inaccurate.  You’ll be feeling like you do no damage 30-50 if you stack agil.  But do as you like.

To add to sephferguson' summary: the reference patch is 1.12.1, the last patch of 2006 before the Burning Crusade pre-patch. So all classes, items, mobs, etc. will exist in their final vanilla state. The state of the world is as it was in 1.12 as well, so there are quests in Silithus, etc.
---
Progression content has been held back and will be released in phases, so raids and dungeons will release in the same order that they did in vanilla, timetable to be determined. This also applies to battlegrounds, which will be released in phase 3.

Gas is over $3.75 a gallon in California.  You are going more than 25 mph for an entire hour.  30 mpg combined city/highway is fairly high for a car that's affordable for someone at lower salary.  I only used the 3 hour and not the 4, which increases the number by over 40%.

That’s awesome

I must be lucky as hell. It usually drops within 5 kills.

---
Wut? You do know that the nordics generally don't speak each others languages, and instead we use english to communicate? A nordic coalition more or less has to speak in english or we literally will not understand each other

No one. Someone who had a shaman named thex. That's literally it. Nothing more.
---
Same boat as you OP, I'm rolling a lock(never played one before) and sort of worry about dungeons.  I have always either been a tank of healer, but I am sick of healing and have no interest in ever playing a warrior
---
Thank you so much!

I wanna know too
---
Thex is a shaman. That's it. Someone had a shaman and its name was thex. There is nothing more to it than that.
---
Warlocks are the greatest! If it helps, yes you will have to level them with a pet, but at max level you can get a talent to sacrifice your demon. Soo you become a shadow mage
---
Pretty easy
---
Alright well if the private server crowd is the crowd that's downvoting OP and giving him so much shit for his post, if they're gonna be like this in the game, elitist and entitled, then I don't want to play with them and probably won't play classic at all because of it.
---
&gt;3% hit
---
*Only* with axes though. Sure, the *goal* is to find a nice axe while you're leveling or at end game, but you'll spend a lot of time using staves and maces as well.

It is very extensive but you can gather the important points from it and do your leveling as you like, but don't plan on getting your tiger around lvl 40 since it is not possible judging from rep gains. However, the cloth quest and morrowgrain can help you with the last rep.
---
I think I will roll a Druid :)
---
Very helpful post! Thank you so much.
---
I loooove the look of Troll shamans especially when they have a shield
---
Just get a group, geez.
---
There's some rough parts if you do it as a hunter before you get your pet. Most of it is fine as long as you're careful about your pulls. 
---
There are a couple rooms with 2-3 mobs in them that are almost impossible to solo as a pet less hunter. Especially that one room with a relic that has the named furbolg that can shock you for quite a bit of damage and casts regen on himself as well. Normally I can solo that by kiting him until his adds leash back, but I couldn't do that on the stress test because things were spawning faster than normal. Furbolgs I killed were spawning on top of me lol. I had to wait for a couple other people to show up and help out.
---
Racist against undead?? Kk
---
Going into a sort of sub option, Troll Priests are great at defensive pvp. Shadowguard procs Blackout when all those enemies try sticking to you, Hex of weakness annoys the shit out of paladins and they cant remove it! lol
---
Old bliz is back
---
Not confirmed... They've "confirmed" all servers multiple times.
---
I thought It was because of freedom of choice, a rich world, places to explore, bonding with your guild, the accomplishment of defeating a hard boss, seeing your character progress...
---
Thank you for the enlightement. Now I'm gonna boot Superman on my N64 and have the time of my life sluggishly trying to fly through some rings for no apparent reason.
---
Found the ret pala
---
Ah fair enough. I haven't played since the first raid was released so I haven't experienced Nazjatar or Mechagon gear.
---
You mean you prefer Fasterlooting or SpeedyAutoLoot?
---
Yeah because blizzard doesn't buy into the memes in WoW EVER...
---

---
I can't tell what kinda food Grobbulus is on.
---
Possibly higher queue times
---
I don’t know, I hate being killed 17 times in a row off a corpse camp. Like, I get it dude, your dick is huge, let me continue questing now.
---
I leveled as a Melee Hunter (very likely with zero talents used) until I gave up at about 45. Dealing with pets was too hard and it broke my heart when they left me..
---
I was probably 9 at the time.
---
"Remember the 5 D's of **dodgeball**: Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge."
---
Tbh as a Scandinavian it was pretty easy to get the names we all wanted.
---
So far everyone in my group of 8 have gotten all 24 names they wanted.
---
But sure it will be appealing to someone I guess.
---
If doesn't persist through log outs it generally means the server trusts the client; never trust the client. (odds are it persists)
---
Mouse binds are your friend

Love it. They should just end with WotLK and do WoW2 and pick up from preventing Deathwing's awakening/destruction!
---
TIL I'm a man. 
---
Did it on a private server several times, it's really not so bad as long as you check every room and don't get overwhelmed fighting 2-3 furbolgs at once.
---
If none of these doomsayer topics are against the rules, how are the mods to blame?
---
Lol, I leveled an undead warlock on a recent pserver and I don't think I ever lost a 1v1 (this isn't exerageration). Honestly I'd rather undead for leveling because Cannibalize is anmmaaaazing syngery with life tap. WoTF is just icing in the cake.
---
I would like to see a retribution paladin with the name: Ballsofsteel
---
If you have a Lock friend you can cut out a lot of time by being ready at the entrance and summoning when the third arrives..
---
You not getting into the closed beta is not a valid criticism of the beta in of itself. 
---
The intent of the beta wasnt to get you, specifically, to play. If it was, I'd agree they did a terrible job of meeting their goals as they didnt invite you.
---
That said, I did get an invite, so I'll be playing and thinking of you.
---
Will be low next month when all the retail players go back
---
Starting  1 month after launch? Hire a bodyguard in game hehe
---
That said, as someone who played the shit out of this game through WOTLK, 
---
We, the people, DEMANDED attunements be removed from the game. First, we wanted them to be removed from our alts, so we only had to do them once. Then we just wanted to be able to waltz into raids with no questions asked whenever we freaking felt like it. 
---
This, like most of what ruined WoW, was actually a player-demanded change. We just thought we did, but we didn't.
---
People will say things like healthstones, soulstones, imp stam buff... but really, everyone wants you for the free port.
---
&gt;thus far blown away our expectations.
---
not being to log in for name reserve is definitely not blowing away my expectations
---
Are Swedes like Russians?
---
Oh you’re gonna be so much fun to play with buddy, can’t wait to explore Azeroth with such a fun guy like you!
---
If the daily roasting of the layer mechanic doesn't scare them away I don't think anything will.
---
Britts, Dutch and Swedes &lt;3
---
Grob census is like 40% EST people, you’re overthinking it. Join the grob mob buddy
---
Oh, I'm sorry, where did I say that?
---
Pfft no...... yes.
---
I’ve heard it’s pretty polarizing that paladins don’t really raid tank though, how true is that?
---
High pop is a good thing in my opinion, I Played Bleeding Hollow, a High pop server in Vanilla, and with High pop economy establishes well, always lots of people to group/raid with. Things are abundant and no one person can corner a certain market, has a lot of competition which i find all those to be good. I also am worried cause i have a few irl friends waiting until launch to play but they wont be able to make a toon on Herod right away and im not moving to Thalnos or Faerlina lol
---
Hellyeah, me and my mates
---
People not respecting English? Yikes.
---
Lmao, we need you over at [Classic Raids](https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds) !  There are so many people that would apply, haha.  Btw, would this count as an RP guild? xD
---
We had french canadians in our guild from classic - WOTLK and they were cool.
---
I'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'll start with the rogue and rotate around I think.
---
The nelf's arms should be flopping all over the place, otherwise it's not a nelf.
---
Depends how ya pronounce it I guess. Is it Go-le-magg or is it Gole-magg?
---
Depends on how fast the mob will die. Serpent is only as as good as the number of ticks you get from it. The earlier you use it, the more damage it does.
---
How does one get a world first at a zone? Or are you talking about some retail garbage?
---
As a rock, I can bear scissors - however paper can ruin my day
---
Male troll has Kamehameha though
---
nuh-uh
---
Can’t recommend having your rotation on your mouse. It’s bad for awareness. But I guess outside of pvp it doesn’t matter.
---
That's why all the loot is Hunter loot. It's not the Warriors, but OUR Ashkandi.
---
It will come down to login servers regardless.
---
(Atleast the first few days) 
---
It probably won't be that much better on a third realm, considering quite a big chunk would just change server initially to play.
---
I should be rolling orc shaman for the stun resist but the tauren the trailer is just too cool.
---
Hopefully this was just to get your feet wet on editing. No one wants to watch 50 2v1's where you're even popping FAPs and health pots. It's pretty cringe.
---
&gt; it will be quite a bit more fun and less stressful
---
I'd argue that's quite subjective. Doing a few dungeons runs is fun for a while, but on that 10th RFK clear in a row it can easily start getting quite rote. And as far as being less stressful, the efficiency of dungeon grinding is very tightly knit to performance. You have to be on point all the time or things will quickly slow down badly. While when questing it's a lot of just running or fairly basic combat encounters.
---
That said, I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy it and have success with it, but I also think many others will find that it's not quite what they signed up for.
---
I thought you were just saying I was as dumb as a vegan and you had something against vegans. My bad.
---
But yea, you're making a large claim with very little substantiation. Loads of selection bias at play when looking at who reserves names on what server. It's too early to tell lol.
---
IDK why you're characterizing people asking for something as "crying" either. Would you characterize players asking for classic wow in the same vein? 
---
What's wrong with petitioning the devs for something? It clearly worked, lol.
---
Of course they have to use the chats. But you can't blame people who doesn't understand Spanish for wanting to avoid servers where they fear they won't understand what is being said in global channels. That's why people avoid the Spanish population, not because they hate Spain in general.
---
Sorry, there is quite big french community and it seems that people are splitted, want to know which server most of them will go :)
---
What was about hunter that you disliked? If it was the pet management aspect I doubt you'd like warlock any better lol. 
---
You seem to appreciate mage a lot, I'm guessing the mobility and firepower are what draws you. Warlock has pretty much no mobility, especially compared to mage, and their firepower is respectable but in a much different fashion. Dots and filler shadowbolts versus just blasting away with your main spell. Don't discount the utility mages offer either. They're more convenience oriented than warlock but everyone appreciates food and water as well as being able to get ported all over the world. I will say it's extremely nice being able to summon people though, especially before summoning stones, when someone quits or even just since you'll be hoofing it to dungeon entrances anyways
---
The server count
---
"Ok I found rebirth but why does it say I need a seed?"
---
Anyway i thank you for talking this way. Is nice :)
---
Maybe the people who complained about there only being 2 servers aren’t the same people who are complaining now.
---
Well played and thank you!
---
Oh this reminds me of my Tauren Death Knight named Deathmilk. Tried tons of different variations of death and dairy words. Surprisingly Deathmilk was not taken
---
The level 1-5 zone is a tutorial. Anyone with WoW experience can face roll it solo with no downtime. You found it hard back in vanilla because you were new.
---
The vanilla experience was not know what's gonna come next.
---
The private server experience is knowing what's gonna come but loving it and not wanting to change it .
---
Both are absolutely fine, I'm just pointing out the difference.
---
Horde players are more faction proud in my experience. It's easier to find Alliance characters with Horde alts than the other way around. I think the story telling makes Horde players more passionate. Just a personal observation.
---
Can you make this for rogue?
---
I reserved timmybr on 3 most popular realms
---
Boo, repost
---
Yeah it'll separate them and they'll never be able to find each other again.
---
Already told the boyfriend to stock up on microwave meals so he won't starve when Classic hits, lol.
---
The number i would love to know is the number of returning and new subs. All these servers will be full before launch.
---
Dude there’s like no brits that play this game.  Source: am Brit.
---
The Paladin advantage is actually insane, looking back I'm amazed I never noticed it. Blessing of Kings is just.... I don't even know how that flew through testing.
---
Womp
---
Dwarf priest gnome mage obv
---
Congrats bud!
---
Thats not true. I would say most people will login for the first time at launch. I know 8/10 people in my group don't care about reserving a name.
---
comment vous savez ca?
---
I have to delete this post now. Karma is going to reach 0. See you later.
---
This is stirring my inner Nurgle. I was going to roll on Mankrik but now I'm torn
---
I did a full clear of Deadmines on the stress test at lvl 15 with 3 hunters, 1 priest, and 1 druid.
---
Is he only a level 60? He should forever be a level 60.
---
&gt; What's the catch?
---
No paladins to duo with and aesthetics, I think.
---
If a beholder eyes you, you're fucked.
---
The real question is... who is **not** Thex ?!
---
Honestly, just google [male or female] [race] priest classic wow (maybe add pvp to it) and you'll find your answer. I did this to decide on the sex of my warrior.
---
I am playing shaman main. 
---
What is a nice alt to level with the wife, currently off the priest hype train.
---
Currently thinking rogue or warrior?
---
Ah good old Wendsday
---
everything you just said is subjective
---
I was fine until your last sentence :( hehe
---
Who knows, maybe this 1 in 100 deserves tha pain ;)
---
Cheers
---
What I mean is that they wont interact with people english not because they can’t (they don’t know any english) but because you don’t want to. Why else would you join a swedish guild if not to interact with swedish people for the majority of your activities  - you level with swedes, you farm dungeons with swedes and you raid with swedes. I’m not saying that it’s somehow bad to play like this, but in the eyes of the international community your almost as useless as russians or turks.
---
You said something I really REALLY want to highlight...
---
&gt; **hibernate on adds**
---
This is a CC that quite often nobody else can do (Dragonkin). Something like BWL where each trash pull is a NIGHTMARE (following second boss we had 3 druids, each one was hibernate spamming their target as if they got loose GAME OVER), druids really are important.
---
I was drawn to druid because of the skill ceiling was so high, then I came to realize the skill floor was just as high, but was a blast to achieve it.
---
This is of course subjective and you can look at different styles through videos.
---
But if you want what would be generally agreed upon for Alliance races..
---
Priest: Probably Night Elf, maybe Human if you would prefer that race fantasy more.
---
Mage: Probably Human, unless you would prefer the Gnome race fantasy.
---
So basically Night Elf Priest and Human Mage.
---
If they have shadowburn in the classic release, they are good, if not, they are bad.  Simple as that.,  they needed that extra nuke to become viable.  In total, they were a great class to play in classic vanilla.
---
Except the food won't be cooked till another 12 days.
---
I have a feeling this thread wont age well
---
When I played an enhancement shaman many years ago  geared warriors and balance druids were the only things I felt like I could never beat 1v1
---
Absolutely nothing.  Could achieve a similar list by picking what specs rank where using a random number generator.
---
Probably biased because it was the peak of my raiding career, but Firefighter was just out of this world epic and well tuned.
---
Can’t decide between a large number of classes. Mainly just want the be able to take on just about anyone 1v1 in open world pvp, also don’t want to play the most popular class. Any ideas?
---
Skarm is in fact awesome. But I have my doubts.
---
You could have your alt be opposite faction
---
Id join bc I hear rp servers are supposedly more chill &amp; mature, but i dont really have an interest in rp beyond my internal character vision and I dont want to annoy those who do.
---
she does.
---
A mighty Troll born long ago.
---
If you aren't concerned about raiding then any Druid spec is honestly really good.  Not sure who told you otherwise.  Druids just simply outlast other classes if you know what you are doing.
---
Dont worry
---
Blizzard knows better than us after all
---
yeah a random redditor told me what i wanted to hear and so that is now what i choose to believe.
---
Which areas are FFA? Didn't know that there are others beside Gurubashi
---
Maybe the people who were complaining then aren’t the same people who are complaining now.
---
If that's vanilla with sprinkles, BfA is Burger King.
---
The first time I did it, I got lost and couldn't find my way out so I just stuck around helping people kill stuff. Eventually I found my way out by following a group who seemed to know where they were going.
---
Damm useful when you need to replace someone or when you have a hunter who showed up with 50 arrows. The utility warlocks bring is a great addition to any group.
---
The argent tournament bullshit was the clear beginning of the end.  Following up the majesty of Ulduar with that garbage was unforgivable.
---
No but ching/panda is
---
Human. They look both funny at times, serious at others and kinda dignified. Night Elves are good for Priests, but can't be Mages and Dwarves can be badass priests if female, as male they look weird wearing skirts.
---
But at least the alliance boys don't have scoliosis.
---
Yeah but one player per server will be filling out his backstory :)
---
they know this game inside and out. you will see apes in classic and they will have a MAJOR effect on your server.
---
&gt; The vanilla experience was not knowing what's gonna come next.
---
Hence why they should change it and surprise us.
---
Rogues always have their place.  They are good at everything.  Their critical role in endgame and dungeons is kick interruption.  So you do need fairly good reflexes.  That’s the only caveat I’d give to them.  Also, obviously they do damage.  You need to not end up odd-man-out in a team.
---
Wanna bet?
---
Bruh fearn't we still got the blackrock bar
---
I still miss SWG, I often wonder what that came could have been if they had more funding/better development to polish the game up a bit instead NGE turning it into a grotesque WoW ripoff.
---
would you mind linking the name of it to me pls if you find it
---
Not related, but curious we're you're based. I'm in the hosting industry as well.
---
Force a meme long enough and it will find its way into retail.
---
this is my approach when lost in wow as well
---
Good answer. The fact that is the same as mine is coincidental. :D
---
I cant tell if serious.
---
All my Swedish communities besides the ones mentioned in the Nordic website thingy seems to be staying Shazzrah, the word didn't spread fast enough for people to discuss it within their groups before name reservation was already out.
---
So Shazzrah it is!
---
If you or your friend get too high of a level, just help the other guy out. Help them with the quests or run them through some dungeons and get them up to your level.
---
If they're just a little lower than you, let them tag along for quests anyway. It wouldn't hurt.
---
il y avait un post ici plus tôt aujourd'hui.
---
The Retail crowd isn't the audience for Classic. Hence the different names.
---
Rogue or Druid. Rogues will be really popular, so druid?
---
You can 1v1 anyone in the open world, anyone who is too tough you can reset the fight by running away. You can quite often deal with even 2v1's effectively.
---
The learning curve... is a bit harsh.
---
Google got me a career outside of walmart where I can afford a pc good enough to play wow. QQ loser.
---
Step one: Get bear.. oh wait, the moonkins are a nightmare at lvl 10

The Internet was invented for war. And all we use it for is to complain.
---
Fine with me.
---
Ofr eth Herod!
---
&gt; Lots of them refuse to speak ~~english~~ Spanish and assume everyone speaks ~~spanish~~ English
---
Funny how it works in all directions.
---
The « reaction » to non-English speakers ever since the EU servers announcement has been nothing but a vile slew of self-righteous xenophobia.
---
Night Elf Female Priest
---
Human Female Mage
---
I mean, people pick Dwarf and Gnome ironically which boggles the mind.
---
Or just roll Horde and be Undead for both.
---
Priest/warrior is really strong, great to level through instances or group play!
---
Something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/A1V9fJe)? Just a quick mockup I made.
---
It literally took someone from retail that follow classic like 2 minutws to do for fun, and it's desperation?
---
Warlock is going to be less popular because they don't get good raiding gear until BWL in phase 3.
---
I got “moo” .  There is no better name in the entire universe.
---
Orc is slightly better stats wise. But considering you're going to be staring at your character all the time, appearance matters.  
---
And large Bull charging at your enemy is very intimidating.
---
Thanks I appreciate it. I'll take a look and hopefully you don't mind me bugging you one more time if I have no luck:P
---
i'm 6'0 with 18-19" shoulder span
---
Haha yeah the GG Taunt was great. But also the crying Baby, golden Fist.. sooo many good ones. What I liked most was the Ms Pudding Announcer
---
The Maul and the Gadgetzan arena.
---
Yeah of course that's a concern, I'm only touching on ping.
---
They are probably reluctant to communicate because if something goes wrong, they will get crucified.
---
Yes nerf viper sting hell with no changes/s
---
I think that was added in BC.
---
This is the dumbest post I’ve ever seen on this sub and that’s saying A LOT.
---
Others have said it but going to drill into it more, both are really effective in different ways.
---
Paladins are infinite mana healers. So very effective.
---
Shamans have chain heal but are really mana efficient as well.
---
As for buffs you're looking at utility vs pure strength of the buff. So kings/might/wisdom vs totems, which are weaker individually than the single buff, but together add more utility. (Windfury, tremor, cleansing totems etc etc).
---
Don't worry, healers are always going to be invited to groups, no matter what class they are.
---
Thex is the Leeroy Jenkins of this generation.
---
At least according to straw polls on what faction everyone plans on rolling Grobbulus was 50/50 last time i looked but it is a RPPVP server.
---
Alliance s'en va sur Faerlina. Horde sur Thalnos.
---
Forcing us to log in first is annoying.
---
I'm sorry man.
---
Really just sucks when you are in some abandoned zone. I was really happy when they put in maps to various caves and such. I'm hoping that memory will help me find my way cause I have horrible navigation skills in games. I can be looking at the map and still turn and run the wrong way 😂
---
Fuuuck
---
Hunters are antithetical to the imperialism of the Alliance.
---
Yes I agree with you. :)
---
They were mostly. The original post had the like to give credit, but it’s been a while and I didn’t figure these would come up again.
---
So I've heard. I was just in a different place in my life by that time and didn't have the time or energy to devote to the game. Though I'm glad I'm at a place to be able to play again for classic.
---
Yep, Peter Cullen narrated a lot of old Blizzard trailers. I think there's even an old Warcraft 3 trailer he narrated.
---
I definitely I not miss leveling a warrior in vanilla. I’m basically gonna be in bgs and with light raiding. Probably achievement gathering some too
---
Sorry about that. I truly do apologize. It’s just that you’re not my crowd.
---
I played vanilla as a 60 warrior. First boss in BWL, my guild leader was explaining the fight. He split the raid into 4 groups and assigned each group to a corner of the map to pick up the adds that spawn and prevent them from wacking the boss. (severely hurts there orb channeling) Anyways after explaining the fight and people making it to their corners, the guild lead did a ready check. I checked not ready and told him I didnt have a corner assigned to me. He paused, thought, and said, well just stand in the middle of the room and if any adds run loose, taunt them and pull then to a corner. After 2 or 3 attempts and wipes. I told him no adds were ever getting loose, and asked him if he just wanted me in a corner. He said no. I asked what should I be doing then? (Was feeling useless / underutilized) he told me to just dance or something and that he didn't care. So every attempt from then on out, I just stood in the middle of the room and /dance. When we finally killed the boss, someone made a recording and it was on the front of our guild web page, and in it, you can see me, standing in the middle dancing away. Always brings a smile to make face when I think about it, and two of my friends who were in the raid remember that and we still laugh about it to this day. Wish I could find the video lol :)
---
Yeah a lot of people group TBC and WoTLK flying mounts with all of the later expansions flying mounts. The huge difference was when Cata brought flying to Azeroth.
---
Flying in Outlands and Northrend where the landscape was designed for it and while those were the expansions zones of focus, there was still plenty of things to do in Azeroth and the capital cities were still very relevant.
---
The issue really is more about flying being brough to Azeroth. I dont mind flying in TBC/WoTLK
---
But you're literally... oh, that's the joke!
---
There's many posts on the subreddit about how it's fine if people don't RP, so long as they're okay with many other people RPing. I mean, I'll almost surely will be rolling Grob and I won't really be RPing.
---
Thanks i hate it
---
Thex should be in every group.  Spread out those totem buffs.
---
I believe it’s possible.  MC was ridiculously easy once people started to learn the fights.  The hardest part in vanilla was training 40 people to work together and do their jobs.  If these people can level up fast enough and grab basic gear; I totally see it happening.
---
i searched and think its this one:
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg
---
I didnt test it though so try it out i guess at release yourself first
---
Perfect!  Another realm I didn't get my name on lol
---
That's why I'm not worried about claiming names already, I prefer a more fantasy approach to naming. These 'funny' names will just end up being cringy and tacky after a while.
---
I leveled several Night Elves into at least the 20’s during vanilla-wrath.
---
I’m prepared.
---
Placeholder icon. Forget who this guy is
---
Cool thanks
---
Agree ToC was such a garbage raid.
---
Thanks a ton
---
There's another thread for this already - by the way!
---
Hey guys, this is part 1 of probably 3 that will cover all \*dungeon\* rare spawns/locations, as well as the loot that they drop. Includes item appearances as well as any overly noteworthy information about comparable items etc. Hope some of ya'll find this to be of use!
---
Go back in time and make unique names.
---
Stop making me want to play druid lol I've already settled on warrior!
---
My math is all wrong cause I used 3 hours each way rather than the 90 minutes cited in the article.  
---
Something to point out, is that the number of "super commuters" that take public transport to work is much, much higher than regular commuters.  When I drive to work it takes 25-30 minutes.  If I were to take public transport it'd take over an hour and a half because of a bus and two trains.
---
I can definitely see how it affects people that can't afford the $5k rent in SF.
---
Sure, that looks good!
---
BLADES OF LIGHT!
---
Most people I see are cool with you not RPing, so long as you don't hate on the people who RP.
---
looks pretty but the advice is pretty dumb
---
That was kind of just classic design though. You really couldn't get to 60 with quests the whole way. At some point between 55-60, everyone just has to buckle down and GRIND FACE.
---
Jävla svikare. Stanna på Shazzrah som en man istället för att lyssna på en vekling till ledare.
---
I'd be nice if you would give some specifics to what you are looking for tbh.
---
You really don't read.  
---
I never said I wanted arenas in classic. First of all, not enough specs are viable in PvP for enough classes. Then it's just not their place.  
---
I'm just saying that I disagree with the OP shitting on the concept of arenas as if they're something horrible like micro transactions for Pokemons or LFR raiding.  
---
Arenas were absolutely wonderful during BC &amp; Wotlk specifically. After that, they were meh / shit depending on the expansion. Doesn't mean you can classify them as "shit".
---
&gt; Classic was good because of that reward / retail is a silver plater handing all the loots wth minimal effort.
---
You don't get mythic gear with minimal effort, just like you don't get raid gear in classic with minimal effort. 
---
&gt; Make More servers, don’t water down the experience.
---
Why are you telling me this? I'm just explaining to you what will happen with 20k players on one layer. 
---
I know Classic inside out, there's nothing new about these problems.
---
It's only at medium at the moment, but all of the servers that were at low went up to medium. I wouldn't be surprised if all European servers become full by launch day.
---
who cares. Terrible MMO names.
---
I was hoping so much for the WC3 Remaster to Release before Classic. I bought it instantly after they announced it.
---
It's like eating at a restaurant and the waiter brings you a menu, and replace that menu with plenty of time to pick food with a new updated menu.
---
OP could you please post a screenshot? Would love to share with friends afraid of not rolling Herod
---
Everyone just talks out of their ass here.
---
Banish, curse of elements, curse of recklessness, curse of shadows, soul stones, health stones, stamina buff, debuff (felhunter), seduce, and fear.
---
Also, hellfire does more DPS than unimproved blizzard, but you have to position your character for it.
---
Then why do we post here because everything that's being said now has been said before?
---
I just did Normal. If I want to do PvP then I'll make a character there once I get more familiar with the game (never played vanilla).
---
I like human for both.
---
Desperate prayer/spirit racial/diplomacy is an all around good pick for a priest. Significant human priest lore as well. Perception is situational but very strong when used correctly. Weapon skills irrelevant.
---
Human mage because it’s quintessential to Warcraft. Lore is so well developed you have so many fantastic quests, buildings and NPCs to support.
---
So I'm definitely going to Blizzcon, now.
---
This isnt google. Do some research before making a post lol
---
Communities form around games. It isn't incessantly bad just because you don't feel inclined to join them.
---
You're on Reddit
---
oh no someone reposted a meme.
---
How much do racials actually matter? I intend to play alliance rogue and I hear that dwarf is the best (or maybe human) but I love me some night elf &amp; their animations. I'll be playing a lot, probably to much, but won't be a sweater at all. Am I fucking myself by going with the weakest alliance racials in night elf?
---
Just click the link and introduce yourself. There'll be plenty of people to greet you.
---
We'd be happy to have you
---
Yeah.. every dungeon is basically a raid experience which is a huge pro and a huge con. 
---
Playing a pserver earlier this year, I'd basically log on thinking "ok i have 3 hours, i am doing wailing caverns today" and would focus solely on getting the group together. I actually found it wasn't too terrible, all things considered.
---
Same, it's already on Medium!
---
Anyone wanna test out TipTac? It's a quickfix but it was a great addon in Vanilla.

We’ve been through way more shit. Imagine transferring servers with a few of your friends all at the behest of your psychopath friend and then everyone hates you. Then Thrall comes along and gives your life purpose
---
I love how classic devs are actually looking at the community and putting Easter eggs (this and thex)
---
I really believe that this game can follow the success of Jagex classic servers. 
---
This is basically their second(and probably final) chance to save WoW. Because Activision does not see this as a big release Blizzard basically can shape the game how they want.
---
Or... you could stop being butthurt because someone told you to search, and instead look at the many many posts that have gone very detailed on macros.

The work is already done, you're just too lazy to type two words.

Normally, I'd be with you, but... this is what opportunity looks like staring you in the face.  A man can change his stars!  Cash in bredda.

How do I avoid Reddit in Classic?
---
Beautiful!

---
Lets be real you will have too many people for sharding for first month except for first 20 people who pull ahead of the pack.
---
You get your ass kicked by level 1 mobs? You must be really bad.
---
As a Scouser, I agree.
---
Holy shit, that’s amazing info thank you
---
They don't fall off, if anything they get stronger with access to better gear.
---
Once the green dragons and AQ roll around it starts feral weapons being put in the game. 1 handers with FAP (feral attack power) on them which is a real power boost.
---
AQ tier set also has hybrid stats for druid, when the first two tiers (or 2.5 tiers if you count ZG as a tier), have healing stats primarily.
---
I was a naxx tank, and would routinely duel our best fury warrior, it was quite often a coinflip or 60-40 my favor, based on who was playing best. (But he was top of the server in gear and skill, Grand Marshal/Naxx weapons and gear) I would duel others and it was no contest to me obliterating them.
---
Druids if anything, start slower than other classes. But you can't chase down a good druid, just too many tools in the toolbox to reset the fight.
---
Relax? That close to launch? Admit it your gonna stair at the login screen and watch Netflix until gametime
---
This is why Alliance always bored me, Tall Humans, Humans, Small Humans, smaller humans.
---
I am sure its better overall, but I dislike how Wowhead fills up the entire page with just random stuff.
---
The older sites were neater.
---
Dwarf &amp; Gnome.
---
Oh yeah totally arenas are great but why are we bringing up tbc when classic is about to launch. We get it there's a demand for tbc servers too, but right now classic is on the table. Let's see how it goes before Blizzard gets going on developing tbc again.
---
I don’t know.  They may see how glorious Classic is and abandon Welfare WoW.  As long as they’re non-toxic then they’re more than welcome to join the Classic community.
---
You don’t seem to get that people have different points of view.    
---
Some people just want a nostalgia time warp to 2004, others want the best game possible, and recognize that there are some things about vanilla that are better than live (like no dungeon finder / cross reals creating a sense of community, no flying mounts, etc...), and others that could use improvement (while understanding which “improvements” classic fans disagree with the most and why).  Many other people are mixed, they are happy with some changes, but err further on the side of caution.    
---
I mean look st the thread about trying to hit PvP rank 14 (the one with the CLASSIC system).  Almost everybody thought that system was shit, and some went as far as to question whether it’s existence was even healthy for players in a literal sense.  It’s pretty fair for people to question if that should be changed.      
---
And you don’t have to agree with me, but look how negative you got just over a suggestion that feral druids (who already don’t get a race choice within their faction) should have the ability to not all look completely identical for each other while also looking exactly the same the entire game.    
---
The only way that’s hurting anybody’s gameplay experience is if they are so fucking hardcore on their nostalgia experience that they specifically went back and reinstalled vent instead of discord and stuff like that, and the very sight of slightly different looking Druid options would trigger them.  I mean this is something druids asked for even IN vanilla.
---
They had 2,5 years to learn Classic though.
---
1-2% more
---
My heart is leaning towards horde but i feel like alliance has way better cities and zones asthetically. Im very casual and wont likely make it to 60 any time soon. Im mostly in it for leveling, dungeons and a little wpvp.
---
I played a vanilla server a while ago and was a NE druid, and im torn between a druid again or a warlock. Ive been at this for weeks and bounce back and fourth depending on the day :(
---
Im also worried about not being good enough at druid to do any world pvp. 
---
Alliance or horde and druid or warlock? Which one is more fun and which has better zones?(fun wise)?
---
Drop a mana-bomb, saves us cash and solves the problem.
---
La de gå. De fleste svenske, alle norske og danske så og si stannar på shazz:)

We are all Thex on this blessed day :)
---
I won't do it. I'm not a sell out. I have my dreams and it doesn't involve streaming. I would be letting myself down, opportunity or not.
---
Holy shit I would join if I was on a pvp server. I love Dodgeball and Ben Stiller made that movie
---
Blackburrow!  1999.  Home on leave from the military, spent my ENTIRE leave playing EQ. Remember it fondly.
---
Well thats why we need more servers, 15k people per servers with sharding 2 first zones would be close to perfect imo, maybe even a bit less than 15k, but doable for sure.  
---
You know, we already have the problem of too many people past the first month with layering.. so its not like layering removes that issue entirely.
---
They can, 20% not 30%, and it uses an air totem, so they can't do that all the time, its only optimal sometimes.
---

yea servers are down for me too.
---
to check the bank/bags of your alts so you don’t have to logout to check if you need to buy the mat or you already have them.
---
Increasing the amount of players also increases the number of buyers.
---
regardless
---
If you want to run around the world doing stuff, probably lock or hunter is easier to do. Having a pet is a real benefit to going into scarier places, especially I would lean more towards hunter in that respect (feign death).
---
If you wanted to lean more towards BG's, shaman. A really good shaman knows how to play offensive support and can make enemies' lives hell.
---
We don't even know how low "low" is.
---
Thanks so much, really appreciate the help! Leaning female troll now.
---
Go to Classicwow.live
---
I disagree
---
So there is a thing called the "Classic Tetris World Championship" where people play a game they already know backwards and forwards...
---
If there was one thing I could add to classic it would be the barbershop and inclusion of some allied race features. If Tauren could get the high-mountain horns that would be sick and it would not effect the game at all, it'd just be another NPC gold sink which really would do no harm to the game. 
---
Do not want transmogs, but character (not gear) cosmetic changes I'd be very open to.
---
It made enough sense. Illidan is in outland raising a demon/naga army to fight Sargeras. An agent of Sargeras is in outland to build a demon army to resurrect Sargeras on Azeroth. Everything is getting so demony, demons are popping up everywhere in Azeroth, but especially around Karazhan. Someone has to stop it, and the last known person to be able to enter Karazhan was Khadgar, who was last seen entering the Dark Portal.
---
Why go to outland? Because that's where the demon are coming from, and that's where Khadgar was last seen. Why stay in outland? Because there are two armies of demons there, rallying forces to invade Azeroth.
---
WHY IS THEX
---
From top to bottom your tradeskill window has a bunch of lines. "Mail", "Copper Bracer", etc. In this case, "Mail" is a category while "Copper Bracer" is an actual craft. The function `GetTradeSkillItemLink` crashed the game for me if the number given was the line number of a category.
---
Yeah I lost my name Laz-Arugal within the 30 second window it took to remake with the appearance I wanted.
---
It really sucks.
---
Screw Alakazam, who remembers Stratics?
---
I can't wait to get Elvui, i have been handicapped without it. It just fixes so many things for me.
---
I will be headed in there as gnome mage at launch i want that Darnassus rep.
---
I'm saying you need to subtract the cost of the alternative method to say what the cost/value is.
---
&gt; Is that really the crowd that classic is drawing?
---
Judging by the attitudes of people I met on private servers, yes.
---
Interactions with people.
---
Phew. That might've just convinced me to say fuck Herod. Even as a horde player lol. I want decently balanced WPvP
---
I still enjoyed it in seasons 10-20, but the quality certainly went down.
---
Experiencing the same thing
---
I’ll do you one better.
---
It’ll be totally fine
---
Really trying to make my mind between healer druid or paladin, I'm planning on doing lot more pvp than pve, and played druid for all bc/wotlk. In classic I experienced only rogue, which I'm planning to level at a later date
---
Classic wow reddit should take some notes from 2007 reddit, I dont even enjoy playing osrs anymore but the memes are great.
---
its also the language of people who are cripplingly bad with jokes
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqgwi5/just_rerolled_from_shazz_to_gehennas_5_minutes/
---
Yeah, I also noticed it. Odd.
---
I did this exact thing back in the day; I never had any issues running dungeons as arms. I had a good set of defense gear, though. I even off-tanked trash in MC when needed. Optimal? No. It worked fine, though.
---
Okay, thanks. :)
---
Simply don't throw out numbers you don't have.
---
42%~ of Grobbulus players are EST according to a recent poll:
---
Both german realms were full within hours while both French realms had low pop
---
How dare you!

A lot of us had cable back in 2004.
---
First of all you know my guess is as good as yours, for all we know we could have 15 full servers 3 months from now. But sure, lets assume what you said. Easy, offer free transfers from full realms and have a community poll for merging (only for the low and dead servers), if majority votes for merging, do it. Resolve naming issues by either random chance or the first one to make character keeps the name, level 60 characters prioritized. Same for guild names.
---
The Horde was in it’s prime Vanilla until MoP, it picked up again in Legion and then Sylvanas had to be written terribly.
---
Same thing on NA
---
Im in this boat but wanted to play warrior bc the only plate dps spec other than pally.
---
But warriors in wpvp seem like an always uphill battle. 
---
Rogue is the other melee dps but they most likely will be overpopulated.  
---
That's where I'm stuck at along with your faction decision making.
---
Uf caster hpala was so fucking fun.
---
Based on the info you provided Druid sounds like a better fit. Don't let anyone fool you Druids only shit spec is moonkin. Feral (cat) is middle of pack on DPS (and you provide leader of the pack buff) if you're good and bear tanking is the second best tank in the game. Bears get a bad rap in my opinion. Bears have a couple strengths in vanilla compared to warriors 1. They have higher HP pools than warriors 2. They have higher threat per second. A dps pulling aggro from a Bear is actually quite difficult. 3. AoE tanking is easier on bear with swipe spam. 4. Battle Rez if you aren't preoccupied. Now for the bad 1. They don't mitigate damage well so they require more healing 2. You don't have OH SHIT cooldowns like Shield Wall or Last Stand. 3. You can't break Fear. Have fun tanking Nef when he fears! Dwarf Priest can help with this. 4. Tanking is less fun to play. Lets be honest though tanking on Warrior isn't exactly fun either, but at least they have more buttons to press.
---
I kNoW moRe thAn BliZzarD!
---
I'm new to wow, but in other games I tend to play a healer/support role.  Would it be dumb for me to roll a priest or shaman if I am largely going to be playing solo?  Should I stick with a hunter or warlock that would be better for solo play?  Thanks.

Good job, you broke them. Way to ruin it for everyone.
---
They're nowhere near as bad as a Warrior to level.  Tons of CC on every pull (Sap, cheap shot, kidney shot, Gouge), bleed kiting, a get out of jail free card in vanish, run away with Sprint, and can just stealth past groups of mobs if you want.
---
Warriors that pull more than two mobs don't have those options, they just die.

The players had a right to be mad, paying subscriptions and all, when no one could enter the damn raids, let alone get anywhere on the 1st boss.  This wasn't catering to casuals, but to the 99% of players.   It all came at a steep price.

Very interesting, I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for the advice!

Oh yeah, Tranquil Air. I remember.
---
I still don't know wtf Thex is.

You need more then 40 people though. You need people that do things outside of raids, like support the guild with making warlock alts to summon them around, people doing professions, gathering things etc.
---
Killing Ragnaros world first will probably be done by about 60-70 people working together and probably not sleeping much in the first week.

Lmao, streamer server the alternative.

---

---
Same here - any pages online showing if servers are down?
---
Not a very good analogy.    
---
I would agree with you if it were a simple case of “PvP was so fun I played all day every day and quit my job.”  Just like how other than “the food tastes good,” McDonald’s doesn’t specifically encourage you to eat 5,000 calories a day.    
---
But it’s more or less literally impossible to achieve top ranks without making some incredibly unhealthy decisions, and blizzard specifically encourages you to do that by hating significant rewards behind those ranks.    
---
Pretty much the only other option is to cheat and share your account.   
---
Also, people talked about “welfare epics,” in TBC, but at least you didn’t almost need to literally be on welfare (and have no job) to get them.  I mean morality or whatever aside, who the fuck would even want blizzard to reimplement the same system?
---
Lol. How white caucasoids can be racists against other white caucasoids ?
---
DAMN YOU, CHAIIIIIRRRRRR
---
I didn’t get it
---
Grobb will be ballanced! 
---
But as an alliance guy, i know a lot of us, are "noping" out of pvp servers, just like war mode in BFA. seems to be a general 65/35 rate H to A on any server other then Grob.
---
Thanks for your input! If you want to have a post where the OP doesn't respond, make your own post!
---
HAVE FUN PLAYING CLASSIC. :-)
---
No one told me anything really i came to the conclusion after looking deeper into the class its just not really for me. It seems like a ton of work to play one and while I will dedicate a good amount of time to classic it may be a little much for me.
---
Saved thanks for this post
---
They don't keep moving if you take away their water!
---
Not against someone who has engineering as well though.
---
blizz knows better than us, of course
---
First time seeing the ghost in blackrock was really fun and interesting.
---
why suddenly the change?  
---
thought they all go to shazz?
---
Haha, no good. I hope you find some time to play!
---
Choosing a new realm after name reservation was very stupid and bound to split the community. My friends and I got our original names so nothing really can budge us now.
---
HEROD IS THE ONLY GOOD SERVER!
---
LAYERING IS BAD MAKE MORE SERVERS!
---
...pick one
---
Thanks for the info. That's what I was thinking but I only tanked from BC onwards on a druid tank and no real experience on a warrior.
---
Hell, I know a ton of arms warrior that off-tanked raids back in the day just because they PvP'd in their off-time. It's perfectly viable for 5s and 10s.
---
look again
---
You do? Maybe you can tell them to add more servers then. They can't fathom why they'd need more than like 2 servers for the entire world.
---
Thanks a ton mate! I played male tauren resto druid into nax and hated the size and how lunky he felt that I didn't raid without savory deviate delight lol
---
That said, I was thinking about giving female tauren a shot as it's a much slimmer model and I've always enjoyed war stomp/the gear aesthetics.
---
This is a common phenomenon that's been used in disinformation campaigns all over the world. If you repeat a lie enough times, even without proof, and have others who follow you repeat that lie as well, eventually people who had no reason to believe it will start to believe it.
---
What aboute all the private server talk.
---
They didn’t. For most servers it was a non issue. This hypothetical scenario people keep regurgitating about how a small imbalance leads to a snowball effect of people rerolling/ leaving is utter bs. Most servers had slightly faction imbalances. Characters took long as fuck to level, it was an incredibly tedious process, and gearing was even worse. Most players stuck to their decision and slight faction imbalances barely effected world PvP or world balance. 
---
I think I vaguely recall them offering free transfers off extremely populated realms to low pop realms but faction wasn’t a consideration.
---
He didn't, it was a joke.  It's a level 55 item and the closed beta only goes up to 45.
---
This is awesome
---
Yeah I figured this was the point too. Smite is better than I expected for tagging mobs because you don't need to wait for it to land like with most spells.
---
Are you fucking kidding me? Would be nice if there wasn't 1 viable server for people who wanna play PVP EST
---
Nah, I'll be hopping on classic though
---
Thex is going to be the very first server celebrity on Herod. Have fun!
---
Unless it’s something like “Asmongold” you should be safe.  But I wouldn’t be surprised if people had scripts running to snipe streamer names just to extort them.  I know one streamer that is offering $1,000 for his name.
---
I mean BC had the whole stealing light from a Naaru thing. I am OK with that being a cool origin story for BE Paladins though. 
---
Wrath had... Wrathgate. You know, the alliance still mad about getting bombed by plague and stuff.
---
Cata is where things went sideways with Garrosh and Theramore...
---
[2.Trade] [mageguy]: Free portals. Tips welcome :)
---
What an absolute legend. You're the man
---
If you play with a coordinated PvP group or a couple friends go Pally or Shaman. They are the best PvP healers.
---
Yes, because despite knowing what's "best", there is still plenty of room for theory crafting, people who dont read countless guides on everything, and people who play it for the experience and nostalgia. Classic provides an environment where group dynamic is very important in a dungeon or raid, it requires actual thought and preparation. You're still not going to be face rolling through the dungeons or raids just cause you know what to expect.
---
This didn't age well

None that I can find unfortunately

Anthem's launch was a pretty big mess up, but it wasn't on the scale of Vanilla.
---
There’s a good argument for them and there was a post floating around from some of the private servers suggesting to go owl. I’ve used owl/cat/wolf and prefer the 1.2 speed wolf from sfk just because in raids you end up using a wolf and I prefer the 1.2 speed for pvp. I had no problem using owl lvling up but end up switching for windserpents for tags.  Serps are great for instant tagging mobs if your competing for tags. I’m all honesty with bm, it really doesn’t matter what you choose.
---
I would love if he told Blizzard to take it out of retail because it's trash and Thex only played vanilla (and soon, classic).
---
Finally figured it out and now the realms are offline. Go figure.

obligatory: why do people even follow this guy ?

Im not support asmon and im not a Fan. But the items are for lvl 50+ (beta goes up to 45) and he clearly made it for entertainment „I’m an asshole“ joke. Ppl are just too mad rn

I find both shaman and priest super fun in solo content. Both can level as dps specs (I’d recommend Enhancement for shaman though) and heal with the right gear in dungeons. People will always be looking for a healer so you can play your support role when needed/end game.
---
Modern games now have the same fidelity as this trailer...
---
That's not bad at all. It still wouldn't get old after that.
---
Man my thoughts exactly...I was also going for gnome mage but after reading over more and more and watching some videos...Shaman is looking great. I would for sure go Shaman but all my friends are going alliance. Hell I am even considering going Horde solo just to play Shaman.
---
Cant wait to RP in defence of the light and the living

This is accurate.
---
Mi Pei Rong sounds more pandaren than goblin.
---
Honestly in Classic Wow you are going to be doing a lot of group content whether it be dungeons, quests, or pvp. So if you think you will enjoy healing I would just go for it. There will also be plenty of guilds to help a new player such as yourself along the way :).
---
OP what have you done?

Brazilian tears incoming.
---
The story of Thex has gotten off to a good start.
---
All good man, thanks anyways!!
---
The most valuable Prot skills are within the first 18-20 points you spend in the tree.
---
Conc Blow (Stun) is nice but not essential – particularly as lots of high level mobs and bosses are stun ummune.
---
Shield Slam is only worth taking if you’re already at 30 points in Prot and, eh hur dur, I guess I’ll spend one more.
---
Maybe in Tokyo but most certainly not in the rest of the world
---
RpPvP is really bad for competitive PvP players, bad for finding any raiding guild, and just isn't good for anyone not into RP.
---
Layering is antithetical to vanilla in every sense of the word, so no. Sure hope Blizzard haven't fell that far that they would actually keep layering past P1.

So 8-10 times in a 2-3 hour session.
---
That sucks
---
good stuff man, your video's are a great resource to the community.

LF Jace on Faerlina/Shazzrah
---
Cool! That is where ill have my PVP alliance character. Ill see you in STV then =D
---
&gt;How will the first char to make keeps name if two servers merge into one? You dont make a char for transfering , it jist gets transfered.
---
By date. The first character of the two keeps the name, simple.  
---
as for the rest of your comment.. ???? I hate sharding, I would prefer 0 layering, sharding non of that shit. Layering is literally the same shit, and you are for it.   
---
You realise that layering is sharding but not cross realm? Never seeing the people on your server while levelling, thats exactly whats gonna happen with layering!! People zoning in and out, mobs coming out of thin air, mining nodes disappearing in front of you.. all that shit is coming with layering. I dont want non any of that, but you want it for some obscure reason. I would MUCH RATHER compete with 15k people for mobs.
---
Well it looks like I found my people!!! Let's make a guild! 
---
Jk. I have one. But come join me you excited fools!
---
Ooga gang?
---
lol playing WoW and having a GF good one
---
I mean ya you might resist some stuff as Orc, but War Stomp isn't a bad ability in PvP either.
---
It's funny you say "This is surreal." That's my name on most platforms, I go buy Surrealistic, and tried to go for the O.G. 'Surreal', but it was taken on the server I wanted it :(
---
Yes, I fall I to that category as I just started streaming a few weeks ago.  There are quite a few small streamers that are hanging out in the discord servers.  And while I do plan on min/maxing pretty hard, it's more of a social thing.  Like your buddy is playing next to you.
---
If you’re mostly going solo honestly anything works. The king of soloing difficult encounters is lock and hunter but really anything works for questing in general. Shaman and priest are great in their own way at soloing.
---
In another reply you said 80%?!
---
If these people are going for a week 1 MC clear then most likely they will be so optimized and so far ahead in levels that pvp isn’t an issue. 
---
Hard to kill a guy who is 10 levels ahead of everyone a few hours after launch.
---
I'll help if I can. pm me when the game launches and if my Shaman or Druid is on the same server we can group
---
Yeah of the reddit demographic, not the server's
---
For real though. My guildies have been razzing me for such behavior! They are our little babies ready to go out into the world and spread their wings in a few weeks!
---
That makes no sense, they can create layers on demand and remove queues nearby instantly. They are fearing not be able to remove layering in the future and lying regarding the reason.
---
Where does one see the total amount of users on a Discord server? Asking for a friend.
---
Not Finland?
---
I can see the complaints in a few months when Blizz is telling Herod they can not remove layering because there is too many people.
---
TukUI is out for classic. Close enough.

---
I was thinking Dr. Zoidberg
---
:) I hope we do too. You're right btw, they very likely will do the server spin on launch day, but anyone who has been with Blizzard for long as a player knows they do that every expac so it shouldn't be a surprise :)
---
Oh man, I remember back in the day when I had to get MC attunement that I soloed it because I was a mage and could jump and blink through the lava in BRD with fire shield to skip all the mobs.
---
As a kid it felt like mission impossible.
---
They should add him on classic too.
---
Yes Wotlk was peak power fantasy for many classes in my opinion.
---
The balance came from acknowledging that and still giving us some of the most difficult raid encounters with it like LK 25.
---
You might have felt like an "unstoppable life force", but that's what you had to be to even have a chance at fighting the Lich king itself and his most loyal servants!
---
Am I your friend?  I also pronounce gnome as gee-nome
---
Thanks! Just don't wanna be sitting around waiting in a city for ages looking for a tank.
---
Whatever, I'm sticking with Whitemane unless something significant comes up
---
We start a human priest
---
We level to 15 and go to deadmines
---
The warrior says dwarf priests are better
---
We log out and start a dwarf priest

Why would anyone seek out to make a coalition with people who they are forced to speak english with, if they don't want to speak english?
---
Gotta be Arcanite Reaper..!
---
Read the rest of the thread for why you’re wrong!
---
Quick overview, there’s already hardcore guilds assembled/assembling, world PvP will be poppin with all the RP guilds doing events and RP rivalries, and the balance is almost exactly 50/50 according to polls!
---
if it was me i would sleep during peak hours so theres less people on when your grinding
---
A lot of people had a perfectly good experience reserving names, but I did not. 45 minutes of disconnects before any of my friends and I could get in. It's genuinely comedic. Decades of experience and they can't get it right. It's guaranteed launch day will be fucked as always.
---
"80% of players having a smooth experience is good enough! The positive people will tell the negative people to shut up! Fuck em!"
---
It's ok, hes just a filthy straight back.
---
More excited and fun ALLIANCE folks should come join us on Fairbanks! FTFY. 😝
---
Per Kaivax:
---
&gt;Due to very high demand, we will open a new WoW Classic realm for name reservations at 5:00 p.m PDT (8:00 p.m. EDT) today, Wednesday, August 14:
---
&gt;Stalagg – PvP – Eastern Time
---
&gt;We suggest that players, especially those on the Herod realm, consider creating characters on Stalagg. We expect that other PvP realms in this region will otherwise experience significant login queues when Classic launches.
---
&gt;Thank you!
---
Level a pally to 60, lvl engineering to max and spend my life trying to tank 5 mans as prot while ignore people tell me to roll holy to raid just so I can live out my goal of being a valiant defender of the light
---
Yea let's not train viper Sting 😉
---
Bro don't be stupid you could be rich lol
---
I've deleted and re-made reserved characters over 100 times at least. After several hours I think "what am i doing" and start playing some other game, then the sickness gets me and i open it back up.
---
this is the shameful life that awaits on the 27th
---
&gt; Im also worried about not being good enough at druid to do any world pvp.
---
You can always run away, don't worry about killing your opponent, not always the best idea to engage every single person because their name is red, or continuing a losing battle when you can run away.
---
Warlock if you are in a pvp situation you are losing, you're all in. You can't escape like you can with druid. (Even fearing someone and running away isn't always possible)
---
Zones are a bit of a tossup, while alliance are really pretty, and horde are more rugged, it's faction fantasy.
---
You single handedly crashed all servers, now everyone has to do it all over again!
---
Thanks for the update.

They're opening up another EST PvP server
---
Now watch my friends actually be smart and move away from Herod to the new server and making me have to double think joining EST again
---
Getting ready for the successive incoming phases and eventually for TBC.
---
Blizzard Fanboi club, this guy right here. He belongs with you.
---
and how exactly will anyone know you're italian? exactly, they wont so stop worrying.
---
The only italians people get pissed at are the guys who move around in massive coalitions and only speak italian in /general /trade /party.
---
I plan on getting good gear and then shitting on noobs in pvp (either world pvp or battlegrounds)
---
Practically speaking you can just max Gnomish and move on with your life because the most commonly used goblin items/ most useful are engineering wide anyway and the others aren’t worth the cost.
---
Yeah I mean if warriors are the hardest to level, rogues are easily the second hardest. The only advantage to leveling they have is they get to pick and choose which mobs to fight with stealth, where as warriors have to fight through everything.
---
Sta(lag)g
---
You think for yourself and do what you want.
---
Hunters can't use maces, druids can use it though.
---
If you're trying really hard and using an insane amount of consumables every single raid, then you can find a niche as a Paladin tank in raids. Most people will not go that route. While I don't agree with everything in this guide, this is a good start and will give you an idea of the dedication required to tank as a Paladin: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/tankadin-guide-playing-as-a-protection-paladin-in-wow-classic/#plink-abilities
---
Paladins are legitimate tanks in 5 mans though. They're relatively squishy and they hold threat on multiple mobs like champs.
---
Now, wheres my promised venison milkshake from Americas hat.

That's really interesting. Would have been cool to have them as a reputation faction with a vendor reward for hitting exalted.

A Raventusk Raptor mount or something! Thanks again for the info mate.

Is there a hidden joke like u wanna kill urself when you play retail or ......?

I've no problems with defending myself but as I tend to avoid Italians myself (I deal with them in RL already, I want to meet other people when I play) so I'm worried about being "isolated" because reasons... If a community decides to avoid some players they can grown even 3 pair but they can't do much

The swedish community split and switched to Gehennas. Norway and Denmark are staying at Shazzrah

VanasKOS for enemy faction, some notes addon for allied faction. Haven't found a notes addon yet that doesn't require you to either friend or ignore someone, but that's trivial to program anyway.

Swede here. Not moving. Zög zög

This meme is only 15 days old? So much has happened since then...
---
Tryhard strategy is to level up Gnomish first to make the Bind on Pickup items (Battle Chicken, Death Ray, Lil' Smoky) plus any of the BoEs you want to have, then level up Goblin Engineering second so you can make the awesome consumables (sapper charges, the big one) forever after that.

Aren't Italy, Spain, Greece (and a couple other) looked down upon within the EU because of their perceived laziness/entitlement?  I think it's probably a bigger problem not limited to the WoW community.

Switching is hard with everyone stubbornly rooted and attached to the names they have got, I'm most concerned for my friends who haven't subbed that will create on launch, I hope they can create on the same server without issues.

Yeah I was worried too and now I am not worried. They are just playing it safe.

Within the context, "relative realm population" literally just means "we have low/medium/high/full server pop indicators", it means nothing within the interaction itself. So as it turns out, you did pull it out of your ass.  
---
You're free to feel offended by that as well, I have no malicious intent but I can't control your feelings.  
---
 [https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/716697196847095809](https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/716697196847095809)   
---
In 2016, a representative posted a tweet response, explaining that population indicators were showing lower-than-usual populations across the board due to the capacity being increased. If these were relative to eachother, no change would have been detected.  
---
Server population indicators mean nothing if they're relative to eachother (which they aren't), they become arbitrary since we cannot actually tell what the server can hold and how stressed it or the experience playing on it will be.  
---
Exactly the same can be said for the situation we're currently in where either the # requirements per stage were changed or the server capacities were suddenly increased. If they were increased, who would know by how much, and whether they can be increased further?  
---
They especially give us no useful information due to how layering works, 'low' pop servers could quite easily be the best experience down the road if the player retention is higher than expected, giving us a healthy population while the 'high' and 'full' servers could turn out to be unnatural megaservers.  
---
It was fine in the early versions, but just doesn't work in a post-CRZ/layering world tbh D:
---
Both of you are completely misrepresenting what I said... I’m not comparing swedish people to russians in general. I’m comparing swedish people in swedish guilds who only want to play with swedish players. At the end of the day, for an international player that doesn’t yet have guild, the only thing that matters is if the pool of potential players that he’s going to interact with (raid, level, farm dungeons) gotten smaller by the nordic community leaving? And the answer is: not really.
---
I hate the idea that they're banking on such a large number of players quitting by phase 2.
---
I’d assume most players are too lazy to switch
---
I'm going to freeze myself in the snow. Please come get me an hour before launch.
---
What lets you think theyll be back in an hour?
---
Is it possible for a server to get full where no one new can join and its completely locked?
---
There's a few more in night elf type zones like Stonetalon Peak and Ashenvale
---
Yikes. I'm saying don't generalise anyone for any reason. I'm not crying about anything, nor am I feeling hard done by or marginalised. The "WoW Community" isn't exactly an oppressed group.

I hope you get through whatever it is you've got going on right now.

&gt;And if what you love is making videos or streaming... 🤔

It's not about who it hurts, it's about an authentic experience. And I'm annoyed because questions like this plague the sub daily. The topic has been beaten to death and it's a Classic+ suggestion which has no place here. 
---
If you want friendly systems go play retail or a fun server. Classic isn't for you
---
Yeah, that is about what I expect. I will probably be more on the hardcore side of things closer to launch, and will start returning to the real world at some point. Hopefully classic will just be left alone and I can take forever to gear up, without new content coming out to invalidate my work.

There’s a Venn diagram where one circle is people who make Brazil memes, and the other circle is people who have actually played with Brazilians.

You also DI the healer before you die so you save everyone a corpse run. You also get to Rez and buff up everyone while the dps goes afk.

I'll pray as hard as I can every night for that. Nothing would make me more happy than layering going away asap.

As a citrix end user I'd like to take you out back and have a quiet word

I haven't played on PVE realms so I can't tell you how often people flag themselves for PVP. You have to google that.

I know that if you get close to enemy guards you get flagged too for example.

Confirmed my name and everything! If you see Thex, that's me!

Indeed they do, Starting with less is better than starting with more, for this very reason: They can always add more, they can't take away.

Doesn't take a genius to figure it out, sorry that you're having issues using your head.
---
create a different race/class/faction and replay from a different perspective, if different faction its different quests that you probably haven't already done.

Good times.

Why would it matter if you don’t need to make any more changes lol
---
No you wont because shazzrah is the brit server so all teabag deliveries are going there
---
They said name reservation for Stalagg opens at 8 EST.

Money means you can pursue what you love though. Streaming a little bit on the side in between wouldn't be too much trouble. But hey, you do you
---
I picked Atiesh but it seems now like Paul's was the place to be
---
What scenario? 1o1? Small skirmish? Huge battles? Everything depends on the situation.
---
someone mentioned rag - what other ones are you referring to bro?
---
It’s simple. You speak English, no problem. People don’t have an issue with Spaniards or Italians, they have an issue with large groups of people they can’t communicate with. It’s not rocket science.
---
I'm going to link this to every paladin saying his end goal is to get this. There's quite a few of them.
---
You can also just get an addon like Memoria to screenshot milestones. Much more diskspace friendly and easier to tab through later.
---
Made troll and left it ready for launch. Funny how no one said I should pick orc. 
---
Grats guys, you helped me make my decision :)
---
Not without me fixing  the mistakes first pls
---
Speaking as one of those with 0 to 10 during the beta it is fun getting to know viewers. Kinda like meeting new friends etc. Give it a try and dont look at viewer count.
---
P.S. If you want a more detailed example please msg me and I'd love to share more on my experience during the classic beta(streaming).
---
As long as you're only using English in /1 /2 party's, and generally anywhere that can be seen by everyone, you won't have a problem.
---
you've been looking at some shite bis lists then mate
---
Do horde characters even have beards!?!?!
---
The new realm goes up in an hour... they need the realms up now so that people can actually delete their Herod chars if they’re going to move ahead of time.  
---
I personally won’t be moving if I can’t free up my 3 slots before the server goes up.  Gives me a massive disadvantage to actually getting names I want.
---
I agree, EST needs another pvp server that is not full of streamers or the non-us communities.
---
There’s a few cute faces. You can easily make a little thicc cutie.
---
Cloak made with a scale from Onyxia so you can survive the final boss of BWL? Didn't we get only one scale per kill?  So we needed 40...
---
I'm just worried there won't be enough interest in the new server now over Herod / Whitemane and I'll be moving from a guaranteed lively community to a toss-up.
---
The actual hardest dungeon in the game
---
Yeah same that was like the first website and I was like what the fuck no
---
Same I think it will have the best balance.
---
Nope, still smarter too few. Adding more servers 3 months after launch if needed is still very easy. They can set up a new server in 15 mins, open free transfers and problem is solved.  
---
Merging or closing servers is massively more difficult. Too few is always better than too many.
---
Yeah thats usually what i hope for from the average person, a live and let live. But to answer the orginal question it just nice and less annoying when you know theres other people who have been through the same thing as you and deal with the same issues is all, less pretense. Overall Im just nitpicking at servers so I know where I want to roll for sure with various angles looked at, a possible lgbt community on a server being 1 factor (pvp, population, friends and faction balance being some other considerations).
---
And i found out about why thalnos today, apparently the brazilian community somewhere extented an open invitation to whoever and one of the groups mentioned was lgbt so thats pretty cool.
---
There was a tread about witch hunt, report and tank Italians and Spaniards in the official forums just a couple of days ago, now it's 404 because it was probably against the rules.
---
Well I don't want to hide my nationality because some idiots thinks I should and I never speak in my language in public chats if I can avoid it but to be fair back in the day I remember big coalitions of Danes and Norwegians speaking in their language in /trade and nobody give two shits about them now
---
Please fix Hunter F/D &amp; Trap DR! We are already gimped enough!! PLEASE!!! I BEG OF YOU!!!!
---
It's the same as RuneScape. Get good gear to do harder content until there's no content left. Then PvP for fun whenever you want (using said gear makes you stronger in PvP as well somewhat similar to RuneScape).
---
You make "getting the best gear" sound so trivial. Farming Naxx is not an easy thing to do for most people.
---
Eventually there will be either more content or a transition to BC.
---
Yall have fun with your queue times...
---
Everyone, all 100k said that?

No problem. Full credit to /u/DiveHasFun from the warlock discord [https://discord.gg/9xEwk9](https://discord.gg/9xEwk9)

You have a guide for that?
---
And Sulfuras would be about as good for a feral at 60 as a normal lvl 30 blue. Vanilla upside down world.
---
well danes and norwegians aren't bad players, maybe that's why?
---
Hunter lock is a breeze. Both have let’s that can mediate the aggro while both can range pull/tag mobs. Also, it’d be a pain in the ass to yank the both of you when together.
---
Or the good ones play more than you do, to the point where you're like "hey, should we go socialize today instead?" and the gf is like "nah, wtf we wanna do that for, got 35 more levels to get, you damn slacker". ;)
---
After getting full Naxx gear(good luck) you can amass wealth and do whatever side stuff you want it's exactly the same.

The only warning I have for Grobbulus is that you will be in the cult of Grobb before you know it, he’s an addicting icon!

Woooa slow down there. We all didn't take 40+ classes in astrophysics ok. Jeez. /s
---
I quit BfA after the first raid.  TBH I was specifically thinking of alot of the non leveling gear when I said that.  Kul Tirans and Zandalari armor in particular is really well done.
---
Masterful mistake by BIG ACTIBLIZZ
---
Revamped???
---
or they could have just started with more realms instead of layers.  a new dead realm?  good job, they've made the problem worse.
---
Stalagg sounds awesome what are you talking about?
---
there are different tiers of Raids.
---
Onyxia's Lair -&gt; Molten Core -&gt; Blackwing Lair -&gt; Zul'Gurub -&gt; Temple of Ahn'Qiraj | Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj -&gt; Naxxramas
---
My chosen server stayed up for all of 47 minutes before it went down for days.
---
As per the people before name reservations, Blizzard knows more than you.  Except this time they actually do because they know how many people made characters and they are saying the Herod is maxed out.
---
Can fury warriors be played for fun for a solo player who rarely groups? I don’t enjoy any other classes more then warrior, but I’m not sure about what kind of grinding I would need to achieve somewhat decent gear. I can dedicate 5 hours per day to play for 2-3 months. And I’m also willing to play prot but I’m more inclined to play fury. I’ll really appreciate some help.
---
If it’s 1.12 forever then it’s an attainable long term goal if you have an organised guild and you’re the only paladin. Something to crawl towards, slowly.
---
Blizzard are more than likely using their Openstack Autoscaling private cloud implementation currently used in Overwatch for Classic WoW. A network traffic capture shows the EU realms are located their own slice of a data center in Amsterdam, NL (EU realms) and are reporting VMware network adapters. However, they have mentioned leveraging AWS for possible migration/testing and additional resources if required, since their custom built autoscaling service (sidecar, written in Go) is portable to both Openstack and public cloud.
---
This is effectively a VM cluster using Senlin to launch new VM's through Zaqar (message broker). Nova then launches new VM's based on the current aggregated load of the overall cluster. Lifecycle hooks control the draining (down scaling of the VM's within the cluster). This is nothing new in terms of the foundations of autoscaling itself. However, they have also massively improved their database issues when handing scaling requests by "1000%". I believe they are a using a Cassandra DB cluster for this. I highly recommend the presentation from Duc Truong and Jude Cross (Blizzard) at the Open Infrastructure Summit in April this year here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9Mj7k-BoGU&amp;t=829s
---
You shut your whore mouth.
---
48 minutes for anyone else wondering
---
hahaha
---
Tauren also have a longer reach in melee. So it's not a bad pick at all for warrior pvp.
---
The simple solution is to freeze yourself..
---
I don't know about that high of a level but for sure you'll the fine for a long time. You'll mostly be wearing cloth, though.

I think it’s too late. Most communities are gonna stay on Herod.

This would for sure be my wife lmao. I built a new computer and have just been using my old one as a 'streaming pc'... so basically she can just have that one lol

---
*bubble-hearths in fear*
---
I stream with roughly 6-10 viewer average. Do it to show friends games (Warhammer Age of Reckoning/Mordhau) since most are into FPS but I do it more for a social aspect. I’ll be attempting a 36 hour straight stream come launch day probably with some sort of giveaways to up interactions. I feel like as long as I have someone to interact with when I get tired I’ll be able to make the push for the full 36.

Not a single server will be dead and they are going to have to add even more at launch.
---
Phases are for planned content. Patches are for 'oh shit the bug lets them do what?'
---
I'd imagine everything will be in except maybe the lvl 50 class quests. Hinterlands/searing gorge quests should be. Silithus is entirely tied to the whole AQ content patch so no surprise there it won't be in, like how the Naxx related world events won't be.
---
What the heck - so just the sulfuron ingot alone would take around 100 runs of MC ?!?!?  That's like 2 years of raids every week.  Because I can't see people selling them very often.
---
Both are servers I reserved names on. Sigh.
---
Oh hell yeah
---
Blizzard is seriously so stupid.... it never fails. They really didnt thought that 3 pvp servers would be enough and then obviously its not so they rush to release a new realm. Just makes everything a mess. Retards
---
Is Orly the Owl still in the game? I remember it being one of the first meme adds.
---
Majority of swedes are moving and most of those guilds a re swedish. Both servers will have a decent sized nordic subculture :)
---
No one cares as long as you are using english in public channels. As a scandinavian I hate seeing nor/swe/dan in public channels, so that is no different. The general difference is that all scandinavians can speak and write (good enough) english, the same can’t be said about all Italians and spanish.
---
As a very poor DKP druid due to lack of us in the raid and plenty of Cenarian drops, getting an actual epic weapon was such a big thing for me. Even though i had no idea back then, I loved my Finkles Lava Dredger
---
Was kinda hoping they'd introduce a third Pacific time PVP server.
---
What's this all about?
---
show me on the doll where the bad man touched you
---
That can be detected aswell. Again my hopes are not high, but policing their TOS should be something they are concerned about to keep the integrity of the game.
---
Right? Those bastards were outhealing my poor noobcakes gimpass Druid this past weekend. They'd heal almost to full and i'm standing there like "wtf bitch, this is Classic, where is your ass getting all that mana from?!"
---
Lucky single people
---
That's the github for their development branch.  I didn't check the commits, but I imagine it's being updated constantly at the moment.  Just because we're getting it from the same place does *not* mean it is the same version.
---
Debuffs/buffs on self worked, debuffs on target didn't display duration.  This *was* possible in Vanilla 100% for sure, but the weird API may not allow it for some reason.  Focus frame is in a similar situation: You absolutely could create a working focus frame addon in Vanilla (I use one on a pserv and it works fine), but the addon API for Classic won't allow it (so far).
---
Well this server opens up for names in 45 minutes
---
So you can have another chance to get it!
---
Oh wow.. WHo woulda thought?!@
---
Hey Thex, Is NPC Thex an accurate representation of your Thex? I need to know, for my Thex.

You're a smart man, keep the woman happy lol.

Goes to show how terrifyingly hard it will be to make thunderfury too. That requires TWO 3% droprate items and even more arcanite bars than sulfuras takes D:
---
but fairbanks is still medium
---
This. Very, very few people will get all BIS.
---
It's not gonna be dead on launch
---
I’ve been thinking about how this content will stay relevant basically forever. This is the first time in WoW history you can legit beat the game. People will get to the point of being so geared that there is no more upgrades to obtain, and I think that’s awesome
---
It was because the default color in HTML is white, and web development wasn't nearly as focused on UI/UX as it is today. We have better frameworks now, too.

Well there's your misconception, northern europeans don't usually speak their own language in game.
---
And if they do, they will switch to english when asked and not just flat out refuse to speak it.

Perhaps your blowing this the tiniest bit out of proportion? The way this sub talks its as if every single one of them is a ninja looting griefing player.

PvP ranks being dependant on your actual gameplay skills and not amount of time spent in BG's. Basically there is no good competitive PvP scene in vanilla.

There was a bug with charge that if you were jumping while moving and a warrior charged you, their charge would end up at the point the person started their jump from, and so they couldn't land a hamstring because you were too far away.

Back in 2005 my older brother made a human warrior, and the random name generator gave him Arathor. Every so often a GM will come along and try to change it, but once he's able to explain how he got the name they let him keep it.
---
Still plays him to this day. Though when he went to make him on Classic the game told him the name was restricted, so there's that.
---
Have 3 characters reserved, 1 for me and 2 for my friends. I'm not moving and I bet you at least 90% of the people are not switching.
---
Please stop.  EVERY SINGLE SERVER will be overcrowded.  
---
No one should come to Grobbulus though.  It is guaranteed to be dead.  Yeah, definitely the worst server choice you could make.
---
Wait but layering was supposed to fix the life or death issue where people are unable to tolerate 10-50 minutes of queue time for 2 weeks of their life - glad we now get the bad solution and the thing it was supposed to fix.

Idk if you've seen yet, but a new est pvp server is opening up if you're interested.
---
Fair warning, that is an alternate build to the more popular voidwalker tanking build, this one forgoes it and uses sucubus for dps and life drain tanking
---
Great, I played Vanilla in 2004, and played classic in the stress tests, and level 1 mobs can be killed by anyone of any class with no risk at all. You'd have to aggro them and not auto attack to die. Itching for an internet argument? Not really, just wanted to insult a pserver elitist that thinks they're better than everyone else when the truth is you wish you could play retail but $15 a month is too much for you.
---
Dude how is this a problem? You’re ostracizing people for speaking their native language on a European server. Refusing isn’t as simple as noncompliance, refusal can mean ESL speakers don’t feel comfortable with English because:
---
1) they’ve been made fun of for errors
---
2) they don’t know English fluently
---
3) they’re ashamed or embarrassed by their accent on discord.
---
4) they feel stupid when they can’t describe what they mean in English.
---
Your mentality doesn’t take into account these factors. There are many reasons people don’t speak English and it’s not based on arrogance like you suggest.
---
Thex Therapy
---
Don't make a new char on any new server, Herold is going to be THE pvp server &amp; it's something everyone should be apart of
---
mages do pvp in frost.. that bubble is kinda a big deal
---
Whats the deal with Thex?
---
Or a server with queues even after layering ends
---
He has a microwave and mini fridge at his desk for the In between meals.
---
Aight, Gnome it is. I like being ready for pvp at any moment or situation. If I wanted to pick fights, I would just go rogue. Thank you.
---
If you're not a mod, you can generate an invite link and link it, should show total members
---
Login servers are not new tech that needs testing.
---
Best case scenario is you are right and blizzard just casually fucked their paying customers for no real benefit.
---
But that's ok you will get pleanty of ignorant morons who need to feel "smarter than the filthy masses" who will support you because they can't get that feeling with actual understanding of anything.
---
When your fun relies on what strangers outside of your control do, you're in for a bad time
---
Good luck man. Enjoy it!
---
Big if true.
---
Aight, Gnome it is.
---
Yeah. My sleep is going to suffer so I have time to play...
---
If I am going to be leveling a Priest with a Warlock duo partner, is there any advantage to going for Holy Nova by level 30? (Wand Spec + Spirit Tap first)
---
I do understand that a regular shadow leveling build is capable of healing dungeons and would be much faster solo, but in a duo where we are trying to AoE grind at some stages of the leveling path, will Holy Nova provide much assistance?
---
I tested it out on an insta 60 server and the RNG is once per minute.. Out of like 30 attacks, i had no luck for the chance. It is literally 1%. Needs like 100 hits for it to proc.
---
Doing god's work.
---
WoW has never sounded so good. (though, I wish alliance had high elves and horde had ogres)
---
The hate is unwarranted. You’re asking a person to mitigate hate by sidestepping their native language, when you should be ostracizing those who flamboyantly refuse to play with ESL players. That’s so backwards.
---
Yeah, do that, and save a set of healing gear (cloth/leather/mail all fine). Your spec won't matter too much for healing early dungeons if you have at least some gear for it. Super early mana pools are a lot smaller than once you get a big stack of Intellect.
---
Yes, I understand hyperbole, I just hate private server elitists that don't realize retail is a game with a much higher skill cap. I bet /u/TianlanSha couldn't even complete a raidfinder raid.
---
Modern WOW player can’t handle it and would be screaming in outrage.  Players today get angered at any roadblock labeling anything that gets in the way of what they want now as “timegating.”  
---
Tell a story over time to portray a living, developing world - Timegating
---
Requires gathering a resource to buy gear - Timegating 
---
Anything that is not an account wide unlock - Timegating and Alt-unfriendly.

Very curious how lobby game players will respond to Classic.

They respawn.

If you’re a hunter: WAIT UNTIL YOU GET YOUR PET!
---
Brokeback Mountain
---
That isn’t Blizzards problem but cook on
---
Many Will quit fast. Thats why they use a new system called layering for the beginning of classic. This will prevent the game from having many dead servers after a while into the game. 
---
understand. Basically it will be many servers in 1 and as population goes down so does the layers until there is only 1  hopefully
---
The britts are going gehennas aswell?
---
Any source for this?
---
Your are so toxic.
---
Great setup. How much does your mom charge you for rent?

Looks like I'll be joining Stalagg, then.

Less valuable than tanks and healers.  Equally valuable to any dps that doesn’t already appear in said group.  More valuable than doubling up on something.

---
Cries in cenarius.
---
&gt;In pvp they are overplayed.
---
Annoyingly so, since they're not even that useful in BGs. You're right about raiding, I reckon they'll be just as many warlocks or warriors wanting to DPS.
---
Oh.  Yep.  Yeah.  Gnome is probably best for escape artist.  Getting kited is awful for a warrior.  But stone form ain’t bad either.
---
Yeah, maybe it's their thing and they don't even know it...
---
I hope there's never a TSM made for classic. Auctionator is fine, but the raw power of that addon is ridiculous.
---
They will do what they're going to do.
---
This is the only correct answer
---
Getting into a random pug as DPS is hard in general because of the lack of tanks/healers but I would go as far as to say Warlocks have it the easiest out all the other DPS simply because of their utility (summoning, soulstone, etc) and because they're cloth wearers. Either way, this is Classic so it's not uncommon to make new friends after a successful run for future dungeons.
---
The classic experience is your classic experience and it is different from mine.
---
Thanks sugar
---
A) Yes, healing priests are useful in pvp (not solo, more of a support)
---
B) No they cannot heal, You will have to make friends willing to take a dps shadow priest.
---
C) Mages and warlocks are fine in open world pvp, I don't think it's the armor so much as the class that matters.
---
D) Druids don't get much competition for gear
---
E) Only resto can heal well for raids. Same with shadow priests not being healers, people will want you to spec for your activity.
---
F) It's viable... but controversial and making it viable requires extra work put in. Hardcore hipsters only imo.
---
G) Damage/tank druids share loot pools with other more popular classes. Gearing them isn't really easier.
---
Right. These mouth breathers in this sub, man. It's fucked.
---
LF or WTS/T?
---
the PvE routine to get into raids at 60 is a little tougher than it was in all of the following xpacs.  To get into the first raids, MC and Onyxia, you'll need some decent gear that'll make you useful in those raids, otherwise raid leaders will look at your gear and refuse to invite you, assuming you wont be able to contribute enough to make it an overall success, and they'd be right.  
---
In the early 50s you should start farming decent(er) and decent(er) gear from the 5 man dungeons in those levels.  This will help you level up inch by inch, but more importantly it'll help get you geared up for those Raids.   The role you want to play will also play a big part in how much gear you need before you can raid.  Some DPS classes can get away with a little less gear, where as lesser-geared healers and tanks will be felt throughout the whole raid.  If you're a good healer it's just a matter of making friends with those raid leaders that routinely start groups (ask them if they do, if they do, make sure they add you and know you're a healer that loves invites), once you have those friends as a healer you'll gear out faster than DPS in my experience.  Either join a guild and try your best to keep up with everyone else you all level, because once a band of you hit 60 it turns into a 5 man farm-fest that you don't want to miss, or make a few friends as you level up that you recognize will be serious PvE'ers like yourself, and the rest will work itself out.  Grind hard to 50, then start thinking about raids

You're fine mate. Thanks for the video! Having to balance WoW vs many projects, life, and work mainly (and probably for the vast vast majority of us) definitely is a decision we all (hopefully!) consciously make! At least it sounds like your girlfriend isn't entirely opposed to the idea...? Sounds like a pretty big hurdle to overcome...! glhf!
---
&gt; Playing in high pop servers is how you get the best experience.
---
All of these servers will be high pop. Too high, and your experience will actually be worse in my opinion.
---
&gt;You are only accounting for people that organize themselves and reserve names way before the game even starts. The majority of players didnt even choose a realm yet...
---
I dont know how big you think classic will be, but blizzards prediction is 2-3 servers(pvp) are needed, that means that any group of 3-4k RAIDERS that are changing server is a huge difference in the raid population.
---
On live that would mean dead server with no raiding guilds vs medium pop realms and the classic servers, eventho people delude themselves, aren't gonna be much bigger
---
Ashkandi should have been the survival hunter artifact in legion for the lulz.
---
I subbed just to reserve my name. I've been using it since vanilla, and it's the only way I may be able to find long lost friends.
---
We can't be certain as that information hasn't been released by Blizzard.  There were two surveys stickied here recently (I can't look them up currently, I'm at work) that had a lot of responses that you could get a rough estimate.  You could also check out the discords for each server and look at their #role-selection channels to get a rough idea.
---
NA-Pagle is looking to lean very heavily toward Alliance right now, and US-Mankrik is the opposite.
---
You typically don't have to worry about someone's feelings if they are a friend of yours.
---
Lolwut?  There is no zeppelin in TB.
---
You can do battlegrounds when they are released its only in the world running around doing quests that being on a pve server is different. If you see the opponent on pve you basically just wave and run by.  On pvp you might stop in your tracks... decide to run away in that moment especially if they are higher level and the chase might be on.  Or you see the enemy fighting a mob and you decide to bal him quick in his weakened state... or have that happen to you...a lot.  Also corpse camping if you finally kill that warlock that keeps finding you and throwing dots to kill you and run off like a coward... you might want to camp his corpse for awhile because you owe him 5 deaths.  On pve this doesn't really happen and with layering you may be able to escape a camp but basically that's the difference.
---
I played a shadow priest to 60 but didn't get the chance to raid before TBC came out. You can heal all 40-60 dungeon content fine as a shadow priest. For raiding you can probably find a spot as DPS for bosses to boost warlocks and healing on trash. 
---
This is easier if you are playing with friends. If you are solo it will probably be harder getting in endgame content without going holy or disc. 
---
I haven't gotten a druid past 40 but from what I have read the 0/30/21 hybrid spec can heal relatively well while also maintaining some offtank/dps potential. I'm rolling a druid and this is my plan.
---
&gt; The 'frost' pvp spec would be frost+arcane
---
I try to use relentless strikes in any build. I find it makes the rotation more interesting. It may not be the optimal dps output in some cases but it is close enough for me. There are many variations of hemo specs. Especially for pvp. i run  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhe0RxdIZZxzeochoo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhe0RxdIZZxzeochoo) . You can use any weapon type with this build. Also you can swap out expose armor or imp kidney ( imp kidney is very good for group pvp ) for improved poisons. You can remove imp sap for 4/5 seal of fate.

I dont think they count characters for pop numbers, but accounts.

They are great utility and decent damage. Imps Stam buff and fire shield are great. Having vw as an off tank can come in handy. Fear can even save a wipe occasionally or cause one. And of course summons, HS and SS make locks always worth bringing. Every class brings something unique.
---
I absolutely love enhancement shaman and have been one since wrath on retail and got achievements like cutting edge and the chosen in legion (quit during bfa). I’d love to raid enhance in classic even if it meant being a support but from everything I’ve read no guild doing progression would bother considering me. Or I could just roll mage. 
---
So... Enhance Shaman or Mage?
---
Im impressed that not only does the forum still exist but that you remember how to find it!!!
---
What do you mean? They're all dead non dwarves.
---
Love Westfall Deviats

I don't even know what you're trying to prove

Westfall, Redridge, and Duskwood 10-30 is an amazing time lore wise. Really sets up humans and the alliance in general.
---
If they were really friends, one of them would save you name for you.
---
I worry how fast people who play current wow will leave though. I played vanilla through current and loved vanilla and tbc the most. Most people are not ready for what classic wow was
---
You'd need more conditions. Probably the most straightforward way to do it would be to say 1v1 duels in prebis gear. It wouldn't be too hard to fill in then.  
---
   
---
It changes a lot depending on gear level and if it's in group pvp or wpvp or whatever though so it's too open ended atm.

You'll be losing money if your not charging at least enough to cover portal mats

Have you considered enabling export of data in a format compatible with the EQDKP CMS? I'm currently in search of an in-game tool to manage and export the data, but every project seem to have been abandoned around the time that Master Loot was removed from retail.

Fuck this place 😡🤣😂😭😭😭😭
---
Most players are. My guild doesn't want to move haha..
---
Yeah can't even explain that one, replied to the wrong comment after reading this:
---
&gt;Unless you’re SL And then do no damage, a geared spriest/rogue/mage/ele/warrior can easily beat you 1v1
---
completely backwards. Guess I'm real tired, sorry man.
---
Tell your friend to not level as prot, warriors tank on DPS spec on low levels and so do healers heal on DPS spec at low levels.
---
Most people are going to use macros for warlock pets. What you should consider about warlock is, are you ok with farming soul shards? The farm is real, you will always be farming more shards.

no doubt the racial helped, but let's be honest - UD are the blood elves of vanilla.

I'd go for something like this if aoe farming was the only thing I wanted

That's funny because most of the friends i'm goin with are all pvp folks. I was just glad to do Alliance because I raided all through Vanilla on Horde, so it's a nice change.
---
That's exactly what they dont want. Theres no point in having a server for the rush of people at launch who wont be there after a month. Then you just have an empty server.
---
Face melting legendary?
---
If true, big.
---
I think we just dont give a shit and are complacent in our cozy cities. Horde just mad cuz they live in dull mudhut shanty towns and shit infested sewers. I dont blame them. I'd kill alliance too if I lived in such awful squalor.

Hey I like your binds!

I always find this sort of stuff insightful to see how other people like to play.

Doesn't work that well when you want to be on the same realm as your friends...
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers would like a word with you ! Best server name evah.
---
stick with the popular server. Having 1-2 days of bad log in Qs is a small price to pay to still have a bumping server 2 months into a phase when people are raid logging waiting for phase 2.
---
Im pretty confident all the drama and the fables and legendary adventures and battles will be had on Whitemane.
---
Then however, wherever, and whatever you do while you're playing is gonna work best for ya!
---
I'm in the same situation as you, I've spend the last couple of hours trying to find compatible tools for in-game management and exportation to the EQDKP CMS. Please let me know if you find a solution.
---
stay strong, my friend!
---
Yes, all will be wiped
---
So why don’t you just talk to them and decide where you’re rolling??
---
you posted a video of Skarm and Docken giving Kargoz advice for his guild about a week one Rag and somehow Skarm's guild is doing week 1?
---
Yes with cards that have “play x cards with same name” that were added awhile ago
---
They didn't get their 'data' from anywhere. Monster stats are stored on the server and they did their best guesswork based on videos, memory and screenshots.
---
It would probably annoy me a bit but no problem. As a mage I would also be making food before a raid so no different. Oh, I forgot to mention that I hate gnomes and I think humans are boring lol. So that's a factor as well.
---
Yeah for sure. I was just wondering what people did in this situation but considering classic's slower pace. I guess the fact that it's slower it makes it easier for people's level difference to never be that big.
---
That sounds awesome honestly. As you said it would lose the magic if you did it every time, but that is exactly the kind of experience I'm hoping for on Grobbulus
---
Nah everyone just gonna start at level 40 with mounts

&gt; during my private server days
---
##error: experience invalid
---
&gt;I believe it will be way higher than the amount of people played on beta or stresstest.

Wow, quite the observation.
---
oh man forgot about that. Brutal indeed.
---
I'm obviously talking about Europeans here.
---
And yes, i'd rather not see general/trade chat full of italian/spanish/whatever language you speak if the server is advertised as english speaking servers.
---
lol... no im not using that survey at all. I'm going off talking to the guilds themselves. sooo... whatever you gotta say to make yourself feel better. One could even say those facebook groups have a lot of the same people in them.
---
True!
---
It's basically not possible to change servers unless you're a solo player. In the last week I went from being the only person in my guild to having 80% of them joining me in classic and there's like three different outside groups who will be joining us. I wasn't even thinking of making a guild but now I've got a roster of 20+ people. One member asked if we could all roll on a different server because his brother and a friend or two were on there and not the one everyone picked and the unanimous reply was telling him just to get them to play on the server that's already been picked. There is no way in hell I'm going to get that many people to agree to move. If we did we'd for sure lose people. I imagine anyone who's already in a group is facing a similar situation.
---
They can get a decent idea by watching activity on old accounts and classic downloads.
---
They are trying their best. But yes, They have no idea. "You think they do, but they dont."
---
&gt;Can anyone confirm?
---
Why the fuck wouldn't it be wiped?
---
Also, are reps valuable for different city's and races? And then end game raids?
---
lol I'm gonna skip it.
---
You’ll probably know what’s going on when you hear it haha
---
questing will get you there faster than instancing, but it is doable. best bet is to do stuff you enjoy doing, not what others tell  you is the 'right; way to play.
---
Wow, population has gone up a ton since I reserved my characters yesterday.
---
I'm torn between Warlock and Paladin. I don't plan on dabbling too hard into raiding, mostly dungeons and pvp but ya never know.
---
My guild is going pretty casual and my friends don't log in a ton so I will most likely be on my own a majority of the time.
---
I wanted a class that performs well in pve and pvp. I've always been a fan of bringing more utility then raw numbers so Paladins and Warlocks fit that bill nicely.
---
I'm considering Holy Paladin because Ret and Prot will just not be very viable and honestly I've never healed in WoW. Figured a fresh start into Classic would be a good way to change things up a bit. I'm just worried playing solo as a holy paladin is going to be awful especially with the odd dungeon throw in while leveling. Is there even a viable spec to level as a paladin that doesn't involve a respec whenever you want to heal a dungeon?
---
This is where the Warlock comes in. I've always been a fan of the Warlock and it was my first class when I started in BC. Good leveling, good utility, people want your stones, summons and curses. Good pvp viability but will take some time for to get the good stuff in pve. I'm mostly worried about fighting with all the other dps for dungeon spots while leveling as well as end game.
---
I know, right? They should do a classic version. I’m planning to level an Undead Warrior and that would be great!
---
love and hate are two sides of the same coin
---
&gt; its hard coded as a core function of the modern client. 
---
They probably have a feature flag around it. Hard coded is a pretty lame excuse in 2019.
---
Mad I didn't think of it
---
He said no long queues not that there would be no queues he even went on to explain how queueing people into a server made the most sense and would definitely be there day 1.  Even if they were spinning up more layers dynamically they would have to queue the playerbase in not just match the demand instantly per login.
---
No long queues like the 3 hour shit on vanilla launch lol.  2-3 hour queue and then you dc at some point at lvl 3 and wait another hour before playing again.
---
Atleast scandinavians writes english.
---
I'm asking because there isn't anywhere that I could find that said this. Obviously it makes sense, but they should probably make it clearer.
---
My one friend back in vanilla did this. It's possible. Took him a long time to reach 60.
---
Alliance or horde?
---
That made me lol more than it should've
---
Your IT dept uses reddit to troubleshoot issues.
---
Its pretty good =P
---
This is really nice. I'll deffo talk to the group about this, thanks!

I think the better approach is to start as a healing Druid and then experiment once your gear is better. I was able to soak up a lot of feral PvP gear as I progressed through raids and once AQ releases and you can really pick up somebody nice gear, then you’re laughing.
---
You’ll have a great time as a Druid. Walk with the Earthmother.
---
There simply aren't enough servers to account for X amount of languages. It's mind boggling to me that you find this offensive in some way. When, in fact, you'll be among the majority of English speakers.
---
Are you offended when people speak Italian in real life?
---
WHY is Thex?
---
Really cool. I bet the gms do have fun
---
5 mins left be ready!
---
Excluding talents assuming you don't go for passives [it pretty much is.](https://i.imgur.com/PsZHnlG.jpg) That are *all* fury spells available to my level 38 warrior. Past 60 you get 2 abilities and one passive.
---
Even then it's still sad to see how much have been jumbled around in a vain attempt to make you feel like you're progressing, it's still a low amount at 60.
---
You and your friends are staying on Shazzrah :D Alright i'm convinced boys.
---
What is this Thex thing?
---
Don't forget "Near Fail"!
---
I was on a straight up RP server in vanilla. This took place on Scarlet Crusade US RP -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZzrikYqTM&amp;t=42s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZzrikYqTM&amp;t=42s)   
---
There was plenty of WPVP. We didn't have crazy q times or bg q times either.
---
This is the reason that's what I'm rolling.

Slut

Thex Thells
---
Reminds me of Ragnarok Onlines merchant class that did the same thing. Basically hordes of people afk vending items to other people. It was actually pretty cool and made cities feel packed even if people really weren’t doing anything.
---
Blizzard have the data, you don't.
---
we don't need more servers! 
---
If anything we have too many servers!
---
Layering solves que times!
---
Gigantic Reddit and Blizzard brains.
---
For people who coordinated multiple groups to the same server switching now is a tall order. If you don’t have and ties to Herod and want to avoid queues, it might be your best bet.
---
That's not what layering is for. It's so once the initial spike of players dissipates, we aren't left with a bunch I f dead/low pop realms.
---
The gnome int racial isn't impactful until way late game. I Think Pre BiS for BWL it amounts to an extra arcane brilliance buff, but before getting to 60 and beinggeared its not noticeable.
---
Thank you, traveller
---
Yeah.. rogue is just so fucking fun to play. I actually only played one in vanilla and haven't touched the class since, but I had so much fun that the decision to not play a rogue again was extremely difficult.
---
That's because that data does not exist. That's like saying blizzard has no data on how many people will actually show up for launch. Of course they don't. But their 15 years of experience put them in a better position than us to estimate this.
---
There were alot of grumpy rogues in 2004. They leveled to 60 and didn't get picked up for raids then had to resort to ganking in the starter zones for jollies. Plus there were just so damn many of them. I think the rogue character class suits loner personalities better too.
