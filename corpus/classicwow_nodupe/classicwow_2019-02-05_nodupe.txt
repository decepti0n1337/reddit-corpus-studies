If it's crap, don't pay to play it. Speak with your wallet. Simple.

---
Great resource, thank you OP!
---
Exactly what I fear, but more than that; I fear the same Blizzard policy as with Overwatch and the like. "Play nice and play fair." In vanilla there was no intervention other than extreme cases (such as racism), which made or break a player. You say ganking which is a good iconic example, and to add to it shit-talk, corpse-camping, ninja-pulling, mind-control, intentional death by mobs for repair costs, twinking. The legendary living bomb/corrupted blood? These things are counted as negative behaviour and griefing during modern standards. I'm worried to how they will be handled now.
---
If you dated a hobbit, would you tell her to wear shoes? 
---
Oh I will
---
Just relatively recently on Retail there was a warrior who camped one of the "Turtle Made it to the Water" world quests and ganked people as they were leaving the minigame, this went on for 6+ hours.
---
They better not, or everyone might as well play on an RP server.  I am a straight asshole when farming for mats or gold, I want every single mob and node in an area if I can manage it. I will even try to out tag my own faction, all is fair when we are talking about gold and raid prep!
---
Ok Except that
---
Counting the days until I get my troll tank back.
---
Spirit stacking troll warrior.
---
Thanks John, super appreciate the insight.

---
The old exploring Hyjal and stuff before it was allowed was amazing. I miss that stuff.
---
There is a game prior to 51 as well ya know.
---
Teh fuck? Usually it's by who rolled first since that's how the automated roll system works 
---
I’ve been spending the last few days as a lower level rogue in Redridge. Do I kill the same person over and over? No, not really, I might kill you 3 or 4 times, or more if you’re a botter. Where do you draw the line for griefing? Some would have me banned if they could, even though I never fight a gray enemy and sometimes kill enemies 10+ levels higher. I’m just there to have fun. Now if I decided to camp somebody specific and straight up stalk them for hours... I wouldn’t be surprised to have a GM on me.
---

---
Stalking is different from being Angwe though, he just decided to own Menithil, not harass one person alone.
---
Starter areas take like 23 or so minutes to get out of. Its amazing how absolutely rabid people are about these pointless zones. They would rather destroy several servers economies, and smash together several servers communities into one with mergers than to allow sharding for the first 20 minutes of gameplay out of 100+'s of days of gameplay.
---
Gamers can be absolutely mental sometimes. Talk about missing the forest for the trees.
---
Sure but the people in charge of their paychecks start pushing games out before they're done, ignoring the quality of their games, implementing pay to win features and cash shops, etc.
---
LOL, softballs. ;)
---
This is the best when you're the 4 guy, though. You sink into despair thinking you've lost, but then the other guy rolls and lol
---
MC PUG. That takes courage. 
---
PUG anything was always so hit or miss, even the 5 man Scholo and BRD back in the day. Can’t imagine trying MC with a pug wow. 
---
Right, so I believe not having housing in WoW was the best option.
---
Yes, you always will see feet, no ways to hide it, except may be modifications of client but it's against tos, as i know. 
---
You NOT take candle!
---
I saw the same thing,  both of them rolled 94.
---
For resto druid beyond your normal gear and gold needs I don't think they have to farm much beyond anyone else. Still would need pots/flasks etc for progression. Warlocks have to farm soul shards before raids so I'd think lock is more work than druid unless i'm forgetting something.
---
And there’s practically no ranged weapons hunters would use that drop from dungeons outside of the WC bow. 
---
robes will  hide them most the time, but you'll be able to see the bottom of them while running.
---
Would you consider you potato baked or over roasted? What FPS? 
---
Because Stoneform is already stellar.
---
Sounds like my shaman will be a troll then.  I wanted to play a troll hunter, but I don't think I can get over the feet.
---
Increased rep gain and stealth detection and sword spec isn’t stellar? On top of all of that you need mace spec, too? Don’t be ridiculous.
---
Yes, when playing Elder Scrolls games I exclusively travel by horse.
---
Ah but whats the first thing you see in Ironforge? That's right [maces](https://i.redd.it/ftfncvc3l9u01.png) are what you see.
---
Those hooves tho.
---
I working off of the presumption (with Blizzard trying to emulate functionality) that the new API and macro format can duplicate the results.
---
It's a very, very big question however and why I am not leveling a feral or hunter 1st but instead a shaman. I'd level those 3 anyway, but I'd rather not have to learn a new API and find out what differences will affect classes I rely so heavily on macro use.
---
How are things at Penetrode?
---
Thanks. Willing to expand?
---
Ye but you wouldnt play them in PvP.
---
Also, mages and warlocks can be human and they do not play human for pve.
---
You may as well do at least 1-2 runs of scarlet monastery. You’re likely to get a piece or two from this along the way. But I don’t believe it’s worth grinding and the set is not worth buying. It’s overpriced because it looks cool, has decent stats; and - like all 30’s range mail gear - is in high demand by an unusual number of classes.
---
Seems more like it existed to help introduce the concept of set bonuses to levelling players. 
---
Your link doesn't work. Interested. 
---
True, should’ve specified melee classes. Also, humans are still superior in PVP due to stealth detection and weapon skill.
---
By similar level I assume you mean below Lv60 while leveling?  Hunter is a strong choice as pets are simply bananas all the way up into the 50's.  Druids, Warriors, and Paladins do well against rogues, so much so that I wouldn't choose to fight them unless I had some advantage.  You could always just walk away from a pally of things go south.  Once Warlocks get soul link they're best avoided completely.  Once Mages get ice barrier you'll struggle.
---
These are assuming the player is competent.  You'll run into a keyboard turning pally or a warlock that forgets to sac his void at least once making this list obsolete.  If you're just looking to have rogues leave you alone completely then Pally is a good choice.
---
I'm gonna burn down the building
---
Meh, as a tank getting a little bit of extra threat on the pull from a decent ranged wep is nice. At times you’ll get a crit which gives a few hundred threat on the primary target. In saying that I’d absolutely pass on a mild upgrade of my range weapon if it helped a hunter out more!
---
Weapon skill impact in pvp is minimal. Stoneform to disp blind/slow/deep wounds/any poison or bleed is much better than perception. Some even like to go gnome for escape artist and fewer still like shadowmeld for a better chance of getting of charge/surprise.
---
I wasn't much of a raider back in the day, so to me this was just a cool way to experience some new content. It was relatively painless. We wiped on Rag though, and I've yet to clear him. In Classic I'll have my revenge!
---
Nah, just the damage. Talents increase the duration. Rank 1 is 4 seconds and it only talents up to 4.5
---
Yup. It is
---
24 hr respawn

The funniest part to me is the 200+ ping but it's color-coded green! 200ms was considered great! Now it's unplayable
---
Should be a bigger ignore list on classic then vanilla. It will be that same as retail.
---
If that is not the case Spamthrottle or a similar add-on can do the work for you.
---
As much as I want classic to succeed...
---
I cannot help but feel Blizzard is going to drop the ball on this one, at least early on. I can’t tell you exactly what they’ll do, but get ready for a little disappointment. They’ll fix whatever they fuck up, but they will fuck up.
---
The current gaming industry has turned me into a bitter skeptic and I hate it
---
Yeah didn't realize how much less agility Dwarves have compared to other races, but man that stamina is huge
---
I had no idea the races had different stats.
---
if MC drops 30 pieces of gear then it would take about 333.33 runs of MC to achieve this once. Considering you can only run MC once a week that would 6.41 years. Seems pretty low to me lol. 
---
I will be patient. See if this gets implemented in beta. We will have to make a petition or something.
---
I’m thinking probably not, as I know some Humans didn’t even reach Exalted by level 60, and had to do the repeatable quest in Swamp of Sorrows. This was early vanilla though, so quests added later in vanilla, and maybe optimising your levelling route to do every Stormwind rep quest could change this.
---
That was around in vanilla 
---
Oh, I'm definitely not trying to defend the guy or anything. I also played it at launch (and still do, on and off) and remember the blunder of getting to max level and, truthfully, saying "now what?". The devs definitely didn't consider the first "M" in MMO, it's like they designed the game to be a "Mid,low size Multiplayer Online RPG". Most of the game by yourself, maybe 5 man content and group quests along the way and at max level. In the initial stage of the game, SWTOR did a lot of great things, up to the max level.
---
Still, I think him blaming the game being WoW like carries some merit. Definitely, their first and largest bleeding of subs was probably a result from  lack of endgame content. I think that's when Bioware hit the panic button and started to make everything WoW-like, from then on designing the game to follow that "proven, safe formula." By then though, the hemorrhaging was already critical.
---
Still, I usually take a WoW break once a year and go back to Swtor for 2-3 months. Of all the MMOs I've tried and played over time Swtor remains #2 on my list, behind wow.  It's too bad new content only trickles out now, where a new content patch means a new raid boss, not an entire new raid.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I honestly don't like just having 1 macro for a sting. Sometimes you know you won't be able to drain them and would rather have the extra damage. Sometimes you need to toss a scorpio sting on them to replace the current one so you can cc.
---
Macros also won't save any trap spots. I just had macros for each trap for fd/trap. There is no macro that will choose the trap you want without telling it to. 
---
Honestly. I don't see how anyone besides a pure pve player could possibly get rid of half their icons to replace with traps. Any pvper who does that is giving away utility for simplicity
---
Its when they changed the API
---
If your class plays as human, you play human. Wrong. Warlock. Mage. Paladin. Priest. All have very good reasons not to play as human. Change my mind.
---
Throw in some screenshots of the raid gear, and PVP set gear and this will be the best thing ever. 
---
Warlock and mage play gnome, priest plays dwarf. I’ll give you that, I should’ve specified melee classes. Paladin plays human for PvE. 
---
I did it on one of the private servers. But I went a bit out of my way to complete quests that gave SW rep. 
---
Yes. There are more SW quests than darnassus before level 40, it shouldn't be a problem as long as you check this list and do most: https://classicdb.ch/?faction=72#quests:0-3+1+2
---
Hey, I dont feel that 100s of days of peoples gameplay should be subject to mergers that upends the community and the economy just because some people cant deal with 23 minutes of sharding on release day.... /shrug
---
This guy fetishes. 
---
So painfully true, I lost so many rolls in at 97 to their 98
---
Paladin is probably your class.
---
They are very simple to level and play in general, especially because you are tank healing which means you can basically target your tank and then click your heals if you want
---
This is a shity opinion in almost all cases if you have a goal as well as vision for your character in mind. again I'm not shiting on all the meme specs play what you want but the problem occurs when you expect a raid to want to carry the weight of your meme specs. 
---
Nice
---
Why not get a mouse?
---
Me and my friends used model changers on retail for a long while without getting banned.
---
Don't see how it's something blizz can detect if you don't tell anyone you're using it. 
---
What does paladin have for pve that makes them want to be human? Increased spirit? Immunity to bleeds and poisons seems better.
---
hi Tips ;)
---
Weapon skill
---
Every class pay the same for training, except lock and pally which pay 100g extra.
---
Yea. It was obv on a private server, but we had a 2h fury warrior with I think Zin'Rokh, and was often top dps. But this was an old server from 2013 with questionable coding/scripting/stats/etc.
---
Loot trading doesnt bother me. I always assume everybody is going to roll. If I win the roll, I get the item. Highest roll still wins, thats all that matters.
---
Interesting, thanks. Minecraft has been on my radar lately... bought it back in 2011 but never really got into it.

Back in vanilla I got a week long ban for calling someone a “Noob” and all their friends reported me. I still have the email somewhere that has the quote with Noob literally being the only negative thing I said. 
---
From my understanding.. his lvl 1 was mostly just stationary somewhere in wetlands to get access to general chat and for them to be able to ragewhisp him for his site once he/it became a thing. 
---
Im all with you on your stands. 
---
I 100% have sympathy for peoples frustration, but thats a risk you take when joining a PvP realm. There are options for you if you REALLY cant take being camped for a few hours. 
---
is the green isle pandaria ?
---
If you think paladins are using weapons in pve then you don't understand paladin's in pve. 
---
Pretty sure the people who are the most afraid of right click report are the toxic/racist parts of the pserver community. Making up imaginary scenarios where half the server reports you for no reason that will never happen in game anyway. 
---
It’s the biggest milestone in the game besides hitting level 60. You also need to save up 100g if I remember correctly. Between, repairing armor,  buying food and drink, and most of all buying your class skills - saving up that amount of gold is not super easy.  Mounts increase move speed which help you get around much faster. It’s also easier to get away from potential ganks or gank others in world PvP.
---

So what about that map then that lists it as “Kobold Lair”? Is that map real or fake?
---
You don’t deserve to roll Troll if you can’t take the feet.
---
Was the 2nd pet I got after the starter one I got at level 10. Still have it set as my main pet to this day. Only took a brief break when there was the Worgen bug in WotLK, until it was patched.
---
&gt; will never happen in game anyway.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/blizzard_has_dropped_the_ball_on_the_new_report/
---
Read the multitude of comments here about how it's been abused on retail. 
---
3/3 Imp Gouge is +1.5s
---
It happens in game currently. Battlegrounds are being abused. One team full reports, player is auto kicked. Know what you're talking about
---
A system that bans people not based on what they do, but based on what their enemies do to them is much, much better than trying to avoid seeing something you disagree with once in a great while (that you could just /ignore and never see again). 
---
Ok
---
I mean we don't really have any significant data from vanilla wow so private servers is the best we can do and the current ones are pretty damn accurate.
---
Leveling? 
---
What? 
---
Mage
---
I don’t want them to. They are the ones who have basically said they can’t do that
---
That’s the reason their releasing this loot change. They don’t have the money to have a dedicated support staff for tickets/gms for Classic
---
If that’s the way Blizz wants to roll, then it leaves us with only two options for Classic. They Simply say we won’t intervene, or find some alternative that doesn’t cost support dollars.
---
The easiest solution, the one the community looks like it wants, is just don’t intervene. Games been out for 15 years we know how the loot works now. If you misclick, it sucks, but you gotta live with it. It appears this is preferred to parachuting the wotlk/Cata loot system into Classic
---
Don't worry you'll have 897394832794832749 more chances to run Molten Core cus it's such a fun and exciting raid. 
---
&gt; Same safe-space sjw crap we have in the rest of the world.
---
If it was only used for enforcing minimal standards of civil behaviour (or in your terms "safe-space sjw crap") that would be a beautiful thing. All the racist man-babies would be sent to time-out and decent human beings could play the game without them.
---
The problem is griefers and exploiters using it to kick people off the server or mute them maliciously. The solution is to ban people who do that, hopefully.
---
Karazhan and caverns of time isn’t that curious tbf. 
---
Well this sounds interesting
---
Bingo
---
We all know that god damn warrior is a hacker. No other explanation possible. 
---
What may take me a few hours of looking into this might have already been done :/ 
---
Not entirely sure, but shouldn't Gnome Mages have higher base intellect than Human Mages? It's showing them as equal to me.

1am - 3am before school? wernt you tired lmao
---
Unironically my favorite change coming in vanilla, it'll shut those twitch chat and pserver toxic kiddies up real quick.
---
Mulgore is the most memorable for me, just because it felt like a single player game. If you happened to run across someone I got legit excited and had to wave and say hello.
---
&gt; People play classes in Vanilla, not specs. That should be knowledge of everyone. 
---
\+1 to this, as long as the person understands the weaknesses and is willing to contribute to the common cause in whatever form of content they partake in, there's no reason they shouldn't be considered depending on the context they are currently in. But, they should be willing to also play to their strengths of being versatile because that's why folks bring them to raids, premade BG groups, or farming groups because they fill in gaps as necessary and contribute unique benefits that less hybrid class lack.
---
Hell yes!  I was Horde and I ran and corpse dragged my level 19 ass across 3 zones to get this magnificent bastard! 
---
One of my fondest memories was my and my brothers toons standing on the cliff at sunset after finishing deadmines. 
---
In comparison, that is. The curve of active subscribers skyrocketed during Vanilla and BC, spiked in WotLK (much due to referral and resurrection systems) and begun declining ever since, only to spike slightly during expansion releases. This stand as a testimony that it is not a "good game" as you describe it, rather, it is a game that appears on paper to be a good one. A good game would reach better results.
---
Auto ban is stupid, but I need an easy tool to report and ignore the gold farmer spam that is inevitable.
---
You no take candle!
---
I see what you mean and what you're worried about. I think that a lot of people will roll rogues or warriors..specifically warriors wanting to dps but a lot of people also know that those two classes in particular do not provide a group with very much apart from high dps, which is mainly relevant in a end-game raid setting. Anyone who knows the ins and outs of the game that wants to take their time leveling and make friends along the way would probably have a better time if they traded off some raw damage for abilities that benefit a group. If someone were to come from a modern mmo, including retail, and apply the mentality of min maxing without any personal experience with classic then I could see this being of an issue.   
---
I think it partially comes down to why you are playing the game in the first place. If you're trying to be the best that no one ever was and you just want to top the meters that's just one way of playing. Personally I'll be min-maxing from the perspective of playing a character that has the most potential for creating memorable moments with other people. 
---
May I add that I appreciate where you come from and many of your points. It is only the conclusion that I disagree with. As an educated UX Designer with much focus on gaming experiences, there's a world of a difference between the attribute of *usabilty* (under which many of your points categorizes, such as user freedom and content volume) and *user experience*, which is more abstract, subjective and conclusively relevant to what makes a game *good*.
---
Queue the hunter rolling 99
---
Thanks for the reply, some useful stuff. Do you not keep leveling arcane shot? I've always seen it as free damage since not casting it means you'll be sitting at full mana most of the time, and it doesn't clip your autoshot rotation at all. Plus it's super useful for PvP kiting.
---
Also eyes of the beast is great, I use it to drop off cliffs and get around corners without having to dismiss my pet each time. Just set it on stay, EotB, drop/run to where you need them, cancel, and make the run yourself. It's a cheap level 14 ability and will make your team not hate you in dungeons and save you some annoying pet adds.
---
Got banned for RP walkin with my troll and a badass hat while I said ‘pimpin’ 
---
1/100000000 actually. 4 independent rolls all being the same would be (1/100)^4
---
Are pet attack speeds going to be in the game? If they’re going off 1.12, I feel like they had been normalized by that point. I’m confused because I’ve definitely heard a bunch of people talking about special pets and their attributes.
---
Think i moved to dsl/cable around then but even then my computer was Wal-Mart trash. Quite excited to experience 60fps raids. Whole different game.
---
I rarely use twitch and I only occasionally mess around on private servers but man did you're sentence sound toxic. Don't worry, I won't report you for it, I wouldn't want you to get auto-banned for sharing your opinion. 
---
I’ve never played on a RP server but have nothing against it. But I’m honestly torn on PvP or pve. I did PvP last time and play on a PvP server now. Nothing sucks worst than logging in for my 1- -1 1/2 hours I get to play and being ganked or jumped by some twos. Play for over an hour and might complete 2 quests if I’m lucky. Also have had nights where I wasn’t bothered while questing next to another faction member. I know achieving max level is going to be much easier and less stressful on a pve server but I’m leaning more towards PvP. The struggles I’ll endure while leveling others will also endure. I’m also sure I’ll miss having end game skirmishes while out and about. Like fighting over ore or herbs. Loved fighting over mats. You win that fight you in a way help your faction or so I’ll tell myself lol. 
---
You mean they're just gonna mass report you and get you dc'd + chat muted for fun since the system has literally no human involvement and it doesn't matter what you've typed. 
---
please stop trying to be relevant in the community
---
That's hilarious. Was it that zebra striped hat?
---
I have still have faith for classic, I just hope the specific dev's  working on classic are listening to the community feedback and that they have the authority to deny any major changes, as well as the insight to know who their dedicated fan base is. It is Activision's influence that concerns me more than anything. Now is the time to be voicing concerns. 
---
When it comes down to it I am really just wishing that Blizzard's classic WoW is a more authentic and overall smoother experience than some of the private server's that have been circulating. 
---
First guy rolls, second has 1/100 chance to roll the same number. First guy rolls again, second guy has 1/100 chance to roll the same number again. Results in 1/10000
---
Yes it was
---
Didn’t this guy right click report someone for “trolling the community event” during the demo or was that someone else?
---
Most people aren't passive aggressive kiddies and actually want a healthy community experience. 
---
&gt; and they both rolled the exact same number twice in a row.
---
First and second guy roll, same number.
---
First and second guy roll again, same number again.
---
eg, 
---
28 28
---
47 47
---
The description of what happened is ambiguous though, so I guess you could read it as 2 rolls instead of 4.
---
Dude you played to much private server... They can't actually do that in classic, on private servers they can make a new account for free, so its super easy for them to "spam" people, in blizzards vanilla they have to pay, then spam, then gets banned = pay money to spam. That's why it wont work for classic, but works for private servers.
---
But tbh i wouldn't mind a report button that is for spam like this, wouldn't even take much time for blizzard to review the bots that spams this shit and it would quickly be less of them if they just started out hardcore with banning every single one they see. That way they will stop doing it because they know of the ban and blizzard won't even have to put many resources in it, other then in the start to show them that they can't do this in blizzards vanilla
---
If you're talking about Tip's out baby then I gotta say, I appreciate the time he has put in to some of his videos. He's clearly passionate about the game some of his videos have added to my excitement for classic. I'd say that's relevant in the community.
---
or streamers are also scared i bet, or pvp'ers. Tbh aslong as you can't report oppesite faction most of the problems will be fixed too.
---
from the 1.8 patch notes
---
Druids
---
Due to significant talent changes, talent points for Druids have been refunded and can be respent. Training costs for all talent spell/ability replacements have been significantly reduced.
---
1.3 patch notes: Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.
---
Sure. But they're a lot better now than they were then.
---
You're a loser. Blocked.
---
This isn't relevant to classic but in 2004 I received a 30 day mute in Runescape for typing ( . )( . )  
---
I probably deserved it though.
---
All the above are issues.  I was mellowed by madseason talking me through it:
---
https://youtu.be/3YTwfmDZXu0
---
Sharding for first few days is not what I'd prefer, but not the end of the world.  Loot-sharing obviously an issue, but not something that would stop me from getting back into it.  As for the rest, there is still some time to see if they respond to feedback.
---
Story of every HOTS draft in ranked play.  Don’t pick a hero we want you to?  REPORT
---
I want that aswell, but It's probably not going to happen. The devs take orders from the activision cucklords and that is very bad news, they have no authority
---
Private servers have corrupt admins and terrible cultures. It’s night and day dealing with people on private servers vs retail. Also, private servers are largely terribly managed dumpster fires designed that have to make revenue in some way other than a subscription, resulting in selling levels/gear for money.
---
Hotdog balls.  Lol
---
Do you dumb fucks not remember how hard it was to report someone, especially someone with odd characters in their names? It was sometimes IMPOSSIBLE to report someone.
---
Oh wait, wait am I thinking, someone who never played Vanilla wow is telling us how it is and how it was..................
---
personally will lol if streamers get mass reported and silenced or whatever.. you run that risk
---
This
---
Is it even still a thing on retail? I'm thinking no since people only mention at racials, even after the numerous stat squishes.
---
dear god you should be locked up, vile cretin
---
I said "fu john" in LFG chat after an item was ninja'd from me. It was a 3 hour ban though.
---

I really don't get why everyone thinks most of europe can't speak english, it's really sad to see. 51% of europeans in 2006 could speak english. In 2012 57% could, now there is no data after this, but if it kept increasing this way it would be 64%. But now lets just assume it's 60%. This is not even counting the fact that most people that can't is old people. From the group that plays that might play the game (10-45) it's most likely up near 80% of europeans that can speak english. Of course some servers will have communties that aren't english but a whole server won't be non english...

If that really is the case than if Activision wants to call the shots they need to be smart enough to realize that in the long run they will get more subs and hold those subs for longer if they keep things authentic. Of course, we know they probably don't care and would rather bring home the bacon by selling a fat pig mount at the cost of pissing off their player base. 
---
there is a possibility in classic to do that, i presume with at least supermacro addon
---
My punishment for trimming people's mith in the falador back alley was much less severe. 
---
It’s actually hot dog-balls
---
Automatic bans and silences grant the pieces of shit power outside of your chat box. It's the pieces of shit who will abuse such a system. 
---
All the Europeans we played and raided with from 2004 into mid 2005 spoke perfect engrish. 
---
What's the problem with an RP server? It should be even more fun to shit talk there, and to cause mayhem. Even flavorful to tear apart Redridge as a 60
---
Everyone did. The community held a beta pvp tournament and assholes were griefing it. Tens of thousands of people watching this event and blizzard couldn't manage to have 1 gm stop griefing. 
---
It completely disproves him, as it shows that one class had its costs changed while the others didn't. Thanks for playing. 
---
Yeah they will for sure, if they had the brains to think long term like old blizzard did, then they would have success after success. Now they just squeeze everything dry and soon they will go bankrupt when the last blizzard dickriders eventually quit aswell
---
Also there is some shady inside shit going on with the hold sellers I am sure of it on those pirvatw servers. There are many simple drastic solutions they could be doibg to stop the rampant amount of goldsellers wholestop.
---
For 14 years in retail they just hackaccounts take all the gold then spam ads until they are banned. Or they just make trial accounts with a new email. 
---
There were gold spammers in vanilla. They just used stolen accounts to do it. Definitely less frequent though.
---
Well first off, it's talking about talented spells, which are different from the regular training cost
---
Second of all if i take 5 apples from Jack, does that mean Jack and Jill have different amounts of apples?
---
Thank YOU for playing.
---
Wow I guess we need right click reporting with no gm’s because it was difficult to report some peoples names. Good point champ.
---
I dont need some youtube use games for money person who talks in slow motion tell me what is good for the game or not. All the things they want to add is just to reduce cost and they dont give a shit about the impacts on the game. Just look at the ridiculous report system they just added, they knew it would happen but still they did it just because they save money with an automated system. "I can live with this and I will play it still, I have faith" blabla fuck that shit, give authentic classic or fuck off, and why do I have to pay full price for a fucking game that is 15 years old??? greedy fuckers
---
I think it's worse than what you describe.  If I really wanted to use it as a gun, I would share a fake account with some friends, hide my identity best I can, message the guild that if they didn't pay me 500g I would report their main tank right as they were raiding and extort gold out of them.  If that account got banned, I wouldn't care - it's not tied to a real account.   
---
That gun is insanely powerful.   
---
Unfortunately Blizzard does this as a cost cutting measure, and you are correct it's tied into their entire customer support stack.  Expect this to be a long and painful road.
---
I don't believe I've seen a single example of this system causing an unjust ban where information wasn't withheld to further someone's strongly opinionated argument. At the very least, the bans I've seen Blizzard directly comment on did in-fact contain further verbal harassment that justified the ban. 
---
At times like this it's important to remember, people have been posting on forums for well over a decade about "unjust bans" - and they are almost always without a doubt guilty and trying to get sympathy or convince people of their innocence using false information. You shouldn't just trust someone saying they "didn't do anything wrong".
---
Arcane shot is only useful early on, before you get Multishot. It scales off nothing so it’s garbage for damage purposes and eats up your mana to do what amounts to be an extra autoshot at best. It’s decent for PVP but I’ve never had issues stomping people in wpvp leveling without ranks past 2-3. Multishot is a much better use of your mana. 
---
Eyes of the beast is for memes mostly. I’ve never used it to drop a pet off down a cliff. By the time you do that, it’s almost faster to just dismiss it. I’d rather dismiss it manually or by running far enough from it. The only time I’ve actually used eyes of the beast was to position my pet on the melee stack on Ragnaros so I could move it in/out easily for the knockbacks. Every other positioning I’ve needed to do was done with macros of follow/stay/attack/passive. 
---
Mages have a lot of situational spells worth spending money on, especially on a PvP realm. Frost mage will want mostly want frostbolt, frost nova (rank 1), blink, cone of cold, fire blast, mana shield (until ice barrier), evocation, conjure food/water/gem. Sheep and counterspell for dungeons/PvP. Blizzard and arcane explosion for AoE grinding. Fireball for fire-immune mobs and rogues. Teleports and portals. Rank 1 flamestrike vs. rogues/druids.
---
Priests don't need much to level besides a solid wand. Psychic scream, power word: shield, inner fire, heal, flash heal, renew and maybe shadow word: pain. Power word: fortitude, resurrection rank 1, dispel and abolish disease are nice. I buy levitate so I can take shortcuts across water.
---
Remember LLD duels outside Orgrimmar? LOSER LEAVES DETHECUS
---
That guy is a douche, I'd actually like to see some of your macros if you don't mind. 
---
I still remember discovering you could macro fd/trap in retail vanilla. It was such a life changer. Before that I would literally click pet passive, click scatter, click fd, then click trap. I shudder thinking about it, rofl
---
&gt; and are super useful for scouting out mobs while leveling and definitely worth the &lt;1g training costs.
---
If getting all these spells means you have an extra 6g to farm to farm as a level 41 waiting to get your mount you're going to regret any fun flavorful value you gained out of them.
---
Love it. Would love to see a geared comparison, maybe a full T2 set with some other items, to see the difference the different % racials make with some later gear.
---
What's the lore argument to maces being used by dwarves in combat? Because they're blacksmiths and use a... Hammer? 
---
Arcane shot is useful for PVP and dungeons, but strictly for leveling  your mana pool goes to mend pet, multishot, and serpent sting first. You won't have the mana to use Arcane Shot.
---
Yeah the base stamina on dwarves + stoneform makes leveling 1-10 a breeze compared to gnomes
---
Im having a hard time choosing between troll and orc.
---
Been leveling a troll on a private server to try it out. Love ap, pet damage and stun resist. Is it worth trading off for haste?
---
It definitely helps seeing RNGesus blesses you slightly more than others.
---
Reported
---
Weapon skill increase is so OP that you would limit yourself to only one school of weapon and ignore the others, especially as a Warrior.
---
I would hate to play Orc for that reason, feeling the urge to ignore everything other than axes it’s just not fun. At least with Human you have the two more common weapon schools to choose from.
---
If every race had a different weapon skill increase, it would make loot distribution too race oriented and further complicate things.
---
I'm not here to defend Activision - if you have a link to something I can upvote just post.
---
My lil cousin showed me the obsidian portal..That must have been epic to discover yourself
---
As someone who played on an overpopulated PvE server (vanilla-&gt;cata) that eventually cratered. I will never go back.
---
The player base leans PvP in terms of mass population. All the top servers in terms of population are PvP. If you always want to have something to do / a group to play in go PvP server. There is just flat out more people
---
When the game got bad (post Wotlk) my PvE server was just deserted. There were no people pushing content and even now as I check the top guilds are only 1/9 mythic ATM and one at 3/9.
---
This. If there is a market for game currency, then there will be sellers, come hell or high water.
---
Yeah, this is potentially game breaking. Multiboxers, greifers, competitive raiders, jerks and shitpeople will abuse this and it will create a arms race. The only way to battle it is to report them back/first.  
---
  
---
Sooo much is looking like Classic won't work for me because Blizzard doesn't want to change the things needing changed.   
---
Too bad, I was actually excited for wow for the first time since 2012 or so.
---
Accounts gets hacked way less often nowadays after battlenet, also just make trial accounts unable to message people unless you messaged them first.
---
Dwarves as a race are depicted using hammers in combat more than humans are. The Wildhammer clan is known for using them as throwing weapons as well. Iron foe is a dark iron artifact.
---
Yup, you get a message every 40 min and it's contant...
---
Or it would give people a reason to play dwarves in PvE and bring more uniqueness and customization and variety to the endgame.
---
that doesn't really make sense though. Why should streamers get dc'ed? I stream myself quite a bit, i don't think im in the viewership that will get mass reported (always less then 100). But just because you stream you shouldn't get dc'ed. That's just stupid..
---
Somebody needs to tell them potions is cheating
---
It's not strange to me. Raiding in WoW isn't difficult because of the game mechanics like for example Super Meat Boy or Darksouls. The challenge comes from organising and coordinating a lot of people in their free time to prepare for raids on a regular basis, actually show up, do what they are supposed to, distribute loot fairly etc.
---
May I ask how the players were grieving? 
---
May I also ask if them doing so was a breach of WoW’s TOS or anything of that nature?
---
Is that the one where you wake up the sleeping Druids?
---
Yeah, I was with Booms on Stonemaul. He camped the Menethil boat and demanded money to ride. He played a shadow priest so even if he couldn't beat you, he would just MC you and throw you off the side and force you to swim back to shore.
---
So basically play what is strong, not what you find cool. Got it. 
---
I've got a buddy who bought a 2006-era PC and CRT monitor and is planning to throttle his internet speed just for WoW Classic. I've tried to tell him it's not going to work, but he can't be convinced.
---
Dire Maul could easily be Alterac, I think. Dire Maul is just the ogre name for Eldre'thalas as far as I know, so I don't see why it couldn't be another set of ruins the ogres ogred up.
---
I would at least get rank 1 for kiting purposes. 
---
I like the idea, but claiming it makes sense lorewise is a bit of a stretch. Hammers were favoured weapons of the knights of the silver hand. Paladins strictly used hammers, along with both Uther and Arthas. As these two are probably some of the most famous (and powerful) Azeroth-born Warcraft figures, both humans that use(d) hammers, it kind of makes sense that humans have made specialisation. In contrast, Thaurissan was likely the most powerful dwarf, and he was a sorcerer who summoned Ragnaros. 
---
I wouldn't train mongoose bite unless I had to. It does shit for damage and doesn't scale. You are better off using that gcd for the chance of rooting with wing clip. 
---
I can't believe people are actually arguing in favour of this feature. Even here. It's frankly disgusting to me. RCR (Right-Click Report) is a horrible system with a high potential for abuse like Tips easily explained in his video (how many of you pro-RCRs actually watched it?).
---
The **ONLY** way a system like that could work is if you couldn't report someone on the opposite faction. That if someone gets massed reported instead of an automatic DC and muting a certain amount of reports will trigger a GM to immediately come and assess the situation, he or she will ask both members why they were reported/reporting and if the GM finds out the ones reporting had no legitimate reason then **THEY** will get the squish and suspension, not the innocent party.
---
To be honest, even with those changes the system is still flawed, and some workaround will be eventually found and abused.
---
Best thing for all is to simply not use it for Classic instead relying on the old ticket system, it might be slow, it might be inefficient but at least it's a hell of a lot more fair than RCL and it actually works as it was intended with no possibility for abuse.
---
Try breath of the wild, it recreated that feeling
---
It's okay, but it's a largely empty world IMO. Good game, but not WoW good lol 
---
same, we called it "the pity roll".  
---
Guy in bear form was teabagging the players that were dueling in the duel tournament.
---
It isn't.
---
Berserk and +5 bows honestly makes trolls the best endgame pve hunters. Orcs are just always solid PvP choices. But seriously, just play what you want. 
---
What are you talking about?
---
How is this a concern? This didn't exist in classic wow, therefore it can not exist in classic wow, and if they include it, then it isn't classic wow.
---
So what you're saying is not even Blizzard finished Vanillia WoW.
---
I got a 3 day ban in tbc for saying hitler in a group
---
I’m vanilla, there was a minimum level to loot weapon crates (5 I think?) 
---
Just had a group member losing a blue by rolling 20... Against 20.
---
Watch the video. Tips showcases how this could be abused.
---
He isn’t wanting to not have a report feature. He just doesn’t want it automated.
---
People abuse this by going into premades and reporting the enemy FC and getting them muted and therefore kicking them out of the bg.
---
Just because it hasn’t happened to you, doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen.
---
That is some dedication to try to get that nostalgia feeling.
---
Extremely!
---
So why doesn't this happen regularly on live if it's as easy as you make it out to be? 
---
Oh right, because this is hyper-sensationlizing a community concern in order to keep churning out content since there's no actual Classic news.
---
I remember Emerald Dream US blowing up over twitch footage of a multiboxer using 20+ accounts to report someone, and that person getting banned. Oh no!
---
Turned out the reports were reviewed and brought to the GMs attention this person was using bots. It isn't completely automated.
---
Yeah I only meant that about getting rank 3 and beyond. By the time you buy rank 3 you already have multishot. 
---
The issue isn’t the system. It is how it works. I don’t care if a guy is spamming racial slurs on trade chat, a GM should look at the ban before it is put though.
---
Blizzard has the money to pay for people to look at reports all day. It has happened in the past, and it can happen again.
---
There is 0 excuse for a system that allows for the potential of denying a player a rank 14 title because you despise their premade group.
---
If this is put into the game. If you get banned for even 1 hour, that is enough for you to lose 40-70 hours of progress.
---
A counterpoint: Some people just need a swift kick in the arse.
---
Creeps, racists and griefers will all frequently play the "I didn't understand that what I was doing was wrong! Someone please explain it to me!" card. Engaging with that line is playing their game. Far better to kick them out of the game to teach them a lesson. When they come back they'll behave better.
---
Being a dickhead isn't "being genuine" in any truly positive sense. If you are genuinely a dickhead you need to be put in time-out until you either stop being a dickhead or learn to act like a decent human being to get along. Either is fine with me.
---
The problem with this system is the possibility of people abusing the system to punish people who are not being toxic. Not with toxic people getting a short, sharp lesson in decent behaviour from the community.
---
Like the video he posted here earlier today? The same exact video?
---
Sucks that the ignore button is pretty much useless now. Vast majority are assholes and babies who instead of just ignoring they want to escalate because they want punishment instead of moving past it. If you cant handle someone on the internet being rude or trolling you then man... that's not healthy 
---
The only time I have heard of RCR being abused on retail ended up with it coming out that the multi-box report triggered a GM review that found the reported player was botting.
---
But that doesn't fit the narrative, does it? Whoops, I'll get ready for downvotes.
---
Is human mage vs gnome mage broken because they both have the same base mana?
---
As Tips clearly explained in his video (seriously, go watch it!), Classic is a different beast than retail. There are far more reasons to mass report someone. 
---
I mean I enjoyed collecting 8/8 t1 for my priest even though blues were better. Still had it though!
---
BS. People already got banned for the most ridiculous stuff in vanilla and it might even get worse now. The vast majority of temp bans that I heard of or saw were completely unwarranted.
---
Dude this is amazing. Obsidian Blade was the first epic I got on my warrior, I was top of DKP for fucking weeks because I wanted to save it for a weapon. Whole guild lost their shit on vent when it dropped because they knew I wanted it badly. 
---
[Here is an extremely low res screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Uy9wZPw.jpg) I took after picking up some shoulders in ZG. This was right before TBC launched I think. I didn't raid much after MC, didn't have the time to commit. 
---
What I'm trying to say is, thanks for the awesome art of the most iconic weapon in WoW for me. Have some gold.
---
Lots of people give their opinions on how it could be abused. However WoW has had automated bans since at least TBC (I was auto banned before within 3 minutes of typing something edgy and stupid), and not one person has provided a single documented case of somebody being "auto banned" due to abuse of the report system. 
---
Yes they had. Watch the video. And read what other people have posted proving that this system can be abused. 
---
I like the fact that you even asked if it’s ethical. Yes. I believe it is. I ran school countless times on my BiS priest, just asking for the dark runes. I never had any problems, and people appreciated the fact that it wasn’t a wipe fest.
---
I mean, I got my gun from gnomeragan and was very happy.
---
People get mass reported in retail all the time. Streamers with 10,000 viewers tell their whole chat to mass report griefers and guess what? The griefers are NEVER banned in any reasonable time frame (weeks.) Not once. 
---
Whenever I had someone ganking me you know what i did for 10 mins? play a character of a opposite race and class then come back after 10 mins and you are usually good(at least able to hide and hearth and go to a different area) just do that folks or accept the face you will die alot getting far away that you stopped getting chased
---
That's BS. Most of the temp bans I heard of were unjustified and targeted to people who were just normal dudes who said something that wasn't nice. People will report you for the most ridiculous stuff, saying one curse word or something like that. The cases people remember from the forums were heavily active threads *because* it was justified so people posted in there to point fingers and feel good about themselves. Post above is right. It is usually the people who report others regularly in video games who are the ones who drag everyone down.
---
Nobody is arguing that, in theory, the system could be abused if it isn't programmed correctly. I watched the video and I'm starting to wonder if you did, because it doesn't provide any proof of this happening.
---
This change literally gives the power to those people to kick you offline and get you banned. Get a clue.
---
Why are the ones who want/use report systems almost always the ones who say things like "toxic kiddies"?
---
YOU CAN PLAY WOW AND MACRO YOURSELF WITH 1 BUTTON SO EACH TIME YOU TOUCH UR DICK UR CHARACTER WILL PLAY THE **ENTIRE** GAME FOR YOU ok sure kapp
---
the dots of warlock literally all share GCD like how the fuck would you put them in 1 button come on man what is this trinkets burst
---
ooo hes a doosh, wheres muh safe space im a libt4rd
---
yeah a 90+ doesn't hurt, I just assume "yeah he got super lucky no way I would have gone it"
---
But a 2 vs a 4 would fucking blow, "jesus christ why am I so fucking unlucky".
---
Grats to my guildmate, but I can’t believe this shit. 
---
Shadowmeald in BG's, wait until you re behind enemy lines, then mindcontrol their warlock and dott everyone.
---
Much better than fear ward I promise :D
---
No. I'am afraid of the report system because I've seen how it gets abused. Even in Vanilla reports were abused quite regularly. What is *actually* an imaginary/rare scenario is people bullying/harassing you in WoW or saying straight up racist or similarly bad things. Those people are *extremely* rare and avoided by the vast majority of the community anyways. What is much more common is that you get these trigger happy, sour people who can't distinguish between trashtalking/humor and actual harassement, but then instead of resolving an issue or engaging into a conversation, they try to police everyone around with the report system.
---
&gt; Not classic
---
Even as a priest who loathes rogues camping me, world PvP is what makes the game. As much as I would want to report someone camping me when I'm 10 levels lower, it was never against ToS. It would just feel terribly wrong dealing with this system in any way
---
Banned for incorrect grammar.
---
reported for grammar policing
---
As an outsider and sometime mmo-player, i highly doubt wildstar's failure was due to the type of gameplay, because that sounds awesome to me.  
---
I just never heard of it other than 'generic name for yet another mmo that will fail'.  If instead i had heard 'mmo by original wow creators focused on endgame raids' i would have been all over it. 
---
I used to thought I had a lot of keybinds in wow. Then I tried making spots for all my important spells as a Shaman. I've added like 5 shift+ keys, 6-0,-,+bspace. Probably a good dozen keys and I still have more spells. This isn't even counting Mana pots or item cds
---
I don't like Tips as a content creator to begin with, and I don't need to give him a view to confirm for myself that this subject is hyper-sensationalizing a controversial and often-circlejerked topic to generate Classic discussion in the overbearing void of actual Classic news. 
---
Classic is a different beast, sure, but is it a bigger beast? Outside of having more specific mat requirements(Devilsaur leather), there is no factor of Classic I can think of that would generate more desire to abuse a report system to gain an advantage that does not exist in retail. Do you believe that someone with friends wouldn't try to mass report someone who found their herb farming route in the first weeks of a new expansion? 
---
Beyond that, how many stories do you hear of woeful victims of mass-report abuse? How many of those stories are resolved with a "Sorry, false ban" rather than the usual "Actually here is some details you left out"? Silences, sure-- But text content is far more subjective, though removing RCR is not the solution. BUT. Every 'false ban' story that gets a lot of traction quickly turns into another strike against the idea that people are wrongly banned without review. The story I referred to is one such example.
---
TL;DR, if we don't hear stories of this being wrongly abused in retail, the likelihood of it being wrongly abused in Classic goes down dramatically. I am open to receiving *direct links* to false ban stories, but I will not be watching Tips' video.
---
The +5 on bows does nothing cause range weapons cannot "glance" or something. If you wanna min/max go orc which is for most classes favored.
---
Check out madseasons videos on racials and classes.
---
I alternated between him and Echeyakee for a long time.  I still have Echeyakee.
---
&gt;What is actually an imaginary/rare scenario is people bullying/harassing you in WoW or saying straight up racist or similarly bad things.
---
Lol my ignore list isn't big enough to fit every racist I find on pservers. Just the racists, not the annoying/toxic ones. Weirdly enough, I think there's a big overlap between the toxic pserver dumbasses and people crying about report abuse. I've played wow  a long ass time and never been banned. 
---
Ban could for anything. Need more info.
---
I don’t know if it will be abused as much as people make out but I know for sure it will used to dc MTs on world bosses like the Emerald Dragons
---
Wow that’s crazy. He’s actually stated multiple times he doesn’t play on pservers and doesn’t plan to..
---
I assume he got reported too many times by people who thought he was playing live on a private server and got  automatically ban or something like that. Literally every 10 minutes someone comes in chat and asks "what server is that?". Hopefully he gets unbaned quickly.
---
I checked his twitter, he doesn't know himself why he's banned
---
This was my entire vanilla dungeon experience
---
It’s good if your playing with a total noob, it makes them read the description to solve the quest. 
---
Most likely. Time will tell.
---
Man you put a lot of work into this. Definitely deserve more cred than 20 updoots. Love your work mate, best comedic + editing skills out of any classic content creator by far
---
&gt; Mend Pet/Aspect of the Hawk should be maxed
---
Do people get 2 talent points in improved mend pet when leveling or skip it?
---
"great" no it wasnt. 
---
They removed WSG jumps
---
Thats a piece of shit build if i ever saw one. You're way overvaluing armor with full toughness and imp devotion. With only half your gear being plate and a decent shield the diminishing returns for more armor hits really hard, those 10 talents point would probably not even give 2% physical damage mitigation and you take that over 1 point for pretty much guaranteed 6% block chance? You shouldn't even use devotion aura since retribution, resistance or concentration is pretty much always a better option. Those 5 points in devotion will give you only 183 points of armor, i would say 10 or 15% silence resistance is a lot better.  Also, going all in on armor but skipping shield spec? What?
---
It’s almost as if Reddit’s a place for discussion hey mate, op isn’t trying to convict the dude beyond a reasonable doubt 
---
&gt; Probably since every rogue spec does roughly the same thing
---
Rogue specs play very different. Saying they are all DPS so all similar is just not true. This smells of a guy who didn’t actually play vanilla rogue or didn’t ever experiment specs. Maybe you just stayed combat swords. But there were so many ways to build daggers. 
---
Plus, if you think rogues have the most open space you probably didn’t PvP much. OPs example puts hunter as a much higher ability count but in reality you aren’t touching most of those buttons even in pvp. Rogues in PvP have such a fucking huge toolkit you need to know where all those buttons are and there’s one for every situation. Arguably, rogues are the highest skillcap pvp’ers because of this fact. Many classes can get away with using a few key buttons in pvp but not rogue son, you’re using your whole dam kit or you get smoked.
---
that right for 60 base stats? gnome rogue and dwarf rogue has differences of 30 in stamina and agility daamn
---
Especially when they disenchant it right in front of you and pretend like nothing ever happened.
---
My boss' name is John Taylor. I'll get to the bottom of this. 
---
Either put no points or put one to enable the possibility of removing those annoying 10/30 minute debuffs from your pet.
---
I personally skip it but it comes down to whether you want to have the ability to cure your pet, really. You'd usually get r1 mend pet ticks to proc the cure without having to waste a ridiculous amount of mana overhealing the pet.
---
What a worthless comment.
---
Hahaha ok I’ll go hang my head in shame my edgelord supreme 
---
I think it's just a simple misunderstanding. Hopefully he gets the ban strike revoked. 
---
anyone saying rogues had the least we’re definitely not PvPers
---
Maybe if you are talking purely PvE then rogues might be easier.
---
But in pvp, hell nah dawg. I say this as someone who levelled hunter rogue druid mage to 60. Rogue in pvp was nuts. Sooo many buttons to keep track of. I had 3 full rows of shit and still got mixed up often
---
Likewise, is exalted with Orgrimmar possible by 40 as a troll? I want a wolf!
---
I got excited as I read that as hang yourself.
---
May I ask, what is te bagging?
---
May I also ask, how does one teabag?
---
Things like this is what i miss. 
---
A normal albino jaguar was rare and cool hidden in a lowbie zones quests

Hi, /u/Ecchii
---
Just came back to this post to say big Thank You.  
---
PoE is sooooooo much better than D3.
---
Oh yeah you right cousin
---
I never considered 200ms great, even well before WoW was released. 
---
I would guess this. With the classic hype, I assume people guessed he was prepping on a Blizz-like private served.
---
Assuming he was actually playing on retail, I would be surprised if he isn't back well before classic is released.
---
As a warrior main, yeh some of those annoying as fuck debuffs make me hate life.
---
May consider one point then
---
procedural worlds never really come close to handcrafted ones like wow though
---
I played dwarf pala throughout vanilla, both holy and ret. Healing raids was fun and never had trouble getting a spot. The buffing got a bit monotonous but back then I didn't know any different - I probably wouldn't want to do that again now but maybe that's just me.
---
Pvp the pala is really good fun - survivability is fantastic, you're always useful keeping your team alive, pocket healing, and dishing out damage (as ret). Was jumped by horde so many times and could stay alive against multiple players until backup arrived - sometimes I could feel the frustration through my screen - "f**king paladins, goddamn bubble and LoH".
---
I'd always recommend pala, unfortunately got no real experience of shaman to compare for you
---
good job, undead warrior has wrong starting spirit stat (says 50)
---
Agreed. This is the first I've know about these issues. I did look at the classic forums and there are 3-4 topics on it atm.
---
It does happen on live. In Rbg's it's fucked
---
Why would anyone watch a live replaying of 14-year old recordings when they could just watch in on YouTube.
---
Sorry you deleted your comments pal, made me reply to myself here! you’re clearly a little anxious as is evident from that really poor trolling attempt; so you’ll be back to read this. 
---
It’s just a game big fella and I’m a stranger on the net, don’t be so salty, it’s bad on your heart ❤️
---
At some point it must have been an honor-bound duel between you guys, haha.  This is the sort of PvP that makes me want to roll on a PvP server, but I absolutely hate having to literally go offline to wait for high level gankers to stop camping my corpse.  I know some people will say it's part of the experience, but damn if it's not fucking annoying to have zero chance of outplaying the opponent because they're 20 levels higher than you.
---
Sadly this is not guaranteed until seen. Classic uses a much newer engine with a completely different lighting system. There were already many references to the differences in the Classic beta.
---
In Blizzard's defense, they said they were struggling with emulating the lighting to match the older engine and that it was ongoing and improving.
---
Ultimately I don't think it will matter in the long run. New attachments will form to any differences as long as the main game play feels good (not necessarily accurate).
---
And then the hunter rolls a 99
---
Couldn't agree more.  This attitude where "only racists/trolls would worry about this" is no different than "if you have nothing to hide, then you should have no problem with the state spying on you"
---
What kind of a fucking pussy is so afraid of reading a racial slur that they are happy to put this kind of power in the game? 
---
So, a dwarf priest has 124 base spirit on lvl 60 while a human priest has 131. Since this seems a bit extreme, I assume this is after the 5% boost from the human racial?
---
But so worth it
---
I was obviously lucky, I camped him for like 3hours or so, killing lions around the tree. Some other hunters showed up but then left after few min...didnt like the waiting. Then he showed up and I hot him on first shot
---
Didnt he say hes been working on his guide for the past year? And on an alliance one?
---
How is that even possible without pserver?
---
Every story about 'victims' of mass-report 'automation' that gain traction have always ended with "Oh look, there was more information behind the scenes, the action taken was justified." Please feel free to link a contradictory example.
---
I have yet to see a story that does, and until I do, I see no reason not to believe that these bans are justified. Is the timing unfortunate? Of course, but it's not Blizzard's fault that someone uses 3rd party software. 
---
Love your dedication! I’m excited for you to play classic for all that nostalgic glory with a better connection. I’m an Aussie so back in the day would frequently experience 200-400 ms ping as well. I really hope they do provide Oceanic servers for classic!
---
I love you both
---
That’s a good point but there’s a ton of information available through databases and videos. Besides, even if he were privately working on gathering information from any iteration of a pserver, his ban from twitch couldn’t have anything to do with it unless he streamed or uploaded content related to it there.
---
The suggestion that the reports should be manually reviewed won't really fly. I mean Activision got rid of over a 100 of their support staff after all.. x)
---
https://www.engadget.com/2007/03/16/samwise-didier-warcraft-icon/
---
Where on the continuum do you draw the line and whose sensibilities do you use to define it? That's the problem. It's easy to say that bad behavior should be punished because people will agree with that. It's harder to find, within the vast span of subjectivity, the point where a bit of grousing turns into too much boasting. 
---
I'm okay with firm rules like no targeted racial slurs, no sustained harassment, etc. but if you start to hand out bans to people who are having conversations about immigration or to one of the parties in a two-way argument then that's where I advocate for just ignoring the people you don't like. 
---
If people feel threatened by a ban for any bad behavior then we'll lose the summons over cliffs/elevators/under water, the funeral PvP, the social experience of collectively hating ninjas or rude guilds. The dynamic element they add is too great a thing to lose for the sake of a sterile hug box in which we never see anything we don't like or lose four minutes of play time.  
---
After I quit TBC I played an MMO browser game called Astro Empires and soon took over the top guild on a server. It's a game that relies on creating large fleets with mined resources and using those fleets to pillage enemy planets and fleets. You needed an alliance. A leader of a guild we allied with did not have a filter. Sort of a Steve Jobs analogue. He was one of the most effective people I've ever known. If that game had report functions and a staff willing to eradicate players for the things they said then we'd never have created a vast alliance that completely dominated the server for six months. It's one of my favorite gaming memories because of the politics: the behind the scenes manipulation, the traps, the backstabbing. Just an amazing experience, not just for us but for our opponents. Think EVE type stuff. 
---
And he'd have been banned from modern WoW in three minutes for saying the wrong things. That just wouldn't make sense to me. 
---
I was in that guild, actually. It was our second legendary bow drop. We gave the first bow to our longest tenured hunter who was in the guild for the whole expansion. The second bow drop went to the rogue for a few reasons: Our other hunters were new to the guild and still on probation (less than 2 weeks in guild). Also, at this point our Guild Leader was selling gear for money and I suspect he was paid a decent amount for the bow.
---
Lol that was my old guild. Good times in Vicarious.
---
Picture a tea bag that you are dipping in water.
---
Except that it's your balls dipping in someone else's face. In videogames, it's spamming crouch (or sit, in this case) on someone and not limited to dead enemies.
---
The griefers were pretty much following the duelers around and spamming X in bear form.
---
Yah I doubt hes done anything like that. I thought he was playing it pretty smart. I'd assume as much.
---
But in order to make a decent guide forsure hes gotta be using pserver. Or else that guide, gonna be as good as seeing shit on your dick. And you know that face when you see that happen.
---
THE WHEELS ON THE BUS GO ROUND AND ROUND

https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2bw5eb/my_150_warcraft_wallpapers_collection/
---
I always loved Angwe's dedication to ganking and shit talking on his second account in Menethil. Dude was a straight up terror.
---
Isn't there a mature language filter for those who don't like obscenities. You have to opt into swear words.
---
Conflag/Ruin in a raid, bold move!
---
Yep, Im not worried about this at all. On the other hand this can be protested as well and I don't care.
---
IMO barking up the wrong tree here. This isn't being removed because it (like loot trading) reduces the number of CSR's and GMs needed per server to look at tickets and review Mute/Ban appeals. They already said the biggest cost to WoW was the customer service. They are clearly designing Classic so that it requires less staff. Im sure thats an order coming down from the top, and not something the devs get to "change" just because they are being asked to.
---
So if this is a dealbreaker for you, Im truly sorry you aren't going to get to enjoy classic, because Im nearly positive stuff like this isn't going to change.
---
I play on a pserver and the GMs are extremely slow at responding to things (of course they actually respond as a human every time, something Activision Blizzard won't do after hours and repeated copy-paste.)
---
Anyway, I've never, *ever* felt the need to report someone for "chat."
---
Any issue I've ever had was solved with the simple /ignore function. I only ignored a few people. One person was spam whispering me after a wpvp encounter, and the others were all Russian "join my RU guild" spammers.
---
Right click report has no place in Classic WoW, especially for chat. Any issue can be solved with /ignore.
---
Right click report should only be used for hacking or TOS violations.
---
The right thing to do would be to offer actual GM service, but Activision Blizzard won't even properly staff giant money makers like Overwatch. So there is little hope for proper GM support.
---
Best is they just don't enable right click report for chat.
---
Someone is going to be griefing Tarren Mill, in general chat or world chat Horde will say "Mcstabs is griefing Tarren Mill!" = 50 reports, instant log-off.
---
He will get unbanned. He is VERY careful with the twitch rules. He probably got reported by some douches and triggered an automatic ban that he will appeal and win. Sucks still.
---
&gt; Most people aren't passive aggressive kiddies and actually want a healthy community experience.
---
It's going to be a rough adjustment for some coming from private servers where almost anything goes... I wonder if people have forgotten just how different the structure of moderation is since they haven't played retail in so long.
---
It's VERY different. "But its my opinion" really isn't going to save you with Blizzard. 
---
If he isn't streaming it, who cares? If someone said they smoked some weed it doesn't mean you can arrest them.
---
Most probably not classic itself but if they release the other two big ones tbc and wotlk and combine them together it may be close but I guess retail wont die ever.
---
Obviously live chat. He also frequently responds to questions.
---
It’s one player versing another player. PVP 
---
I always think back to this vivid memory I have from my sixth grade classroom as an example of how this way of thinking is instilled. 
---
Our teacher was having trouble with a talkative, joking boy. Teacher threatened the boy that he would miss recess. Teacher told the boy that he'd done enough that WE all had to stay in class for recess. We all stayed in the classroom while the other classrooms got their badly needed recess. 
---
It is through these rituals that we are indoctrinated when young to strongly fear those that "break the rules", whether the rules are just or not. All we learned in our sleep deprived and impressionable minds (seriously...waking children up at 6:40 AM is only good for parents and tired indoctrination) was that anybody that speaks differently than what the group consensus - as defined by the authority figure - mandated was dangerous to us. 
---
&gt; What is actually an imaginary/rare scenario is people bullying/harassing you in WoW or saying straight up racist or similarly bad things
---
You were doing well until you tried to pull this one off. Lets go ahead and not lie. This shit aint imaginary at all. LOL.
---
But yeah the rest isn't far off.
---
&gt; Blizzard has the money to pay for people to look at reports all day. It has happened in the past, and it can happen again.
---
[they definitely seem committed to invest in this](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-blizzard-customer-service-staff-express-concern-as-over-100-accept-cash-to-exit-irish-hub)
---
Pet run speed was normalized by then but attack speed was not.
---
Yes Ion is the worst game master. Yesterday he told me in the ticket he cannot help me... can u believe that?
---
2 mio subs? Where do you get your information?
---
Haha I'll never forget my time on that glorious, God-forsaken backwater.
---
I mean maybe the people using his guides would care? Would you wanna use a classic guide made from vanilla? Or a classic guide made from retail?
---
If true that's a good example of the dangers of auto-bans based on reports. 
---
you can run an offline version of wow apparently. A guy from school did this, he actually plays offline for questing reasons or something, idk
---
I couldn't see why they would care so long as he updates it with any tweaks retail has. 
---
Good idea!
---
I am okay with regulating the toxicity, but Barrens specifically needs to be exempted from that policy. It's tremendously entertaining.
---
Cheers, will fix.
---
I used to play Heroes of the Storm at a high level and can say that human beings absolutely do not review the bans unless they're appealed.
---
At the high end, mass reporting and the report function in general is often abused.
---
It took years, *years,* for Activision Blizzard to remove the ability to report an opponent for "abusive chat"... and in HotS you can't even chat with the enemy team!
---
People would abuse this by reporting good players on the enemy team for "abusive chat," which was the easiest thing to get someone auto-banned for, and everyone knew this.
---
I don't have high hopes for Classic in this regard whatsoever. We're just going to need to adapt.
---
As class leader of the guild Progress said: "Vanilla WoW is designed to make you hate the opposing faction."
---
A lot of things like griefing Tarren Mill and ganking lowbie zones will not be the same in Classic anymore. There will be a new report meta around premade BGs and world bosses. We will just have to adapt to the worse experience.
---
I watched it because it brought back nostalgia in a way that a simple Youtube video that I could pause and restart can't.
---
negative - all base stats listed are as is, no bonus taken into account.
---
/r/wowservers
---
Will look at this, thanks.
---
Its too bad for him, but seriously the less streamers in Classic, the better.  They are the true danger to ruining your Classic experience.
---
No. All base stats are as is - no passives taken into account. Humans just have high base spirit!
---
I hate that there's nothing that can really be done about nepotism in raiding other than just straight up leaving and finding a new guild. If that wasn't more trouble than its worth, I would probably never deal with that if I didn't have to.
---
Banned for reporting and policing.
---
Why
---
Ikr 
---
I wonder if it's schemes more than it is confirmation bias. "We didn't make mistakes when making the expansions! But we'd better torpedo the classic experience just in case. Wouldn't want to feel bad for awhile and have to adjust or anything crazy like that."
---
Thinking of loot trading as minor is just insane to me. Not a chance in hell I'd play that broken trash. Although, it'd be nice revenge on the company that left me high and dry to get to play private servers and save my money.
---
yeah, I watched the stream where he finished on new years, there was not one hour where someone would someone wouldn't come in and ask what server it was
---
What's that? You've been muted? 
---
Exactly!
---
why would someone watch anything on a screen when they could be doing it themselfs
---
Yet at the same time they automate the ticket system?
---
Servers filled with fanboy 12 y/os
---
I wonder how much money they will gain with no GMs vs how much they will lose when players that only subbed for classic and quit a few months later due to people mass reporting and abusing the loot trading and killing the main aspect that made vanilla so good the socializing. I remember when wotlk implemented the dungeon finder and loot trading my friends and I abuse the hell out of it for a while to prove a point but nothing changed and we all quit in cata. 3 dps que up one with enchanting bamm all the free mats ya want between 3 people. please don't get to mad i was a idiot teenager at the time lol. 
---
I doubt he was going to stream his world first attempt, he would have gotten griefed out of contention. 
---
I was wondering about this. Tuned in to continue watching this morning and couldn't find it :(
---
My live ignore list is still full of gold spammers that I never took the time to delete
---
It’s very easy to get a private server up and running to practice leveling on. You can have it done in 5 minutes after you download the files. 
---
It’s not exactly offline if you give friends your IP and open ports they can join you too. 
---
Mind control has got to be one of the most fun spells in the game. I remember seeing a video back in the day of a priest MCing some elite out by the Alterac Valley entrance and destroying everyone around. Good times.
---
Can't wait for that again ^_^
---
In regard to the warrior, I really loved their different long cooldowns (like retaliation and shield wall). Always made me think carefully about whether it was worth it to pop them or not - cuz I wouldn't get to use it again for a while.
---
Since you earth shock, the mage can simply just run not to mention blink or frost nova.
---
Sorry, but any half decent mage will never let you in melee range. But keep dreaming.
---
There are going to be so many warriors early on and so few by the 1st anniversary. XD
---
FROST SHOCK!

Frock.

I ran Uldaman tonight and I can't recall the name but a blue gun with pretty good dps dropped off of a boss. Both me and the warrior tank could have used it, but it wasn't a HUGE upgrade for me and I'd have to level gun skill so I passed, point being there are some ranged weapons that drop past WC that melee and ranged can use
---
Joana isn’t even close to being a big streamer, you have no idea what you’re talking about. 
---
Why warlock this time around? Curious since it's #4 ;)
---
&gt; But in order to make a decent guide forsure hes gotta be using pserver. Or else that guide, gonna be as good as seeing shit on your dick. And you know that face when you see that happen.
---
What? That makes no sense. Private servers aren't the real game.
---
* Priest
---
* Mage
---
* Rogue
---
* EVERYTHING ELSE
---
Please do more lore videos, this is great!
---
Similar to better internet, I'm excited to not have to play the game on a potato computer. I don't miss getting 4fps in Ironforge or taking a boat and hoping I could load fast enough to get off.
---
Seems pretty weird. definitely not the type to invite controversy.
---
dudes a beast wtf twitch? 
---
Its classic mate, leveling up takes time. Beyond level 10, the amount of people who will dedicate time just to follow a streamer will drastically decrease 
---
That's pretty impressive. Thanks for making this tool!
---
After lvl 40 the game will completely change, so yeah you need that mount hon 
---
Totem management is one reason why I never got a shaman alt very high back then. 
---
I thought about going druid for Classic (like you said, they're fun), but I don't really want to try so hard to heal as effectively as a priest half-afk at the keyboard. :P
---
Rogue and hunter are similar for me too. Fun as alts to mess around in the world and stuff, but not something I'd main. 
---
Automated systems like those are always dumb.
---
I got a chat banned automatically for calling out the efc while grinding warsong rep.
---
With people complaining that I call out the efc, while I am only 1,9k at rbg.
---
I am not even holding it against the reporting players. I myself reported people for minor misbehaviour, to make the difference, when it comes to judging those people.
---
IMHO, automated systems are cheaper, but also reduce the quality of your product. In an ideal world, people would use the systems correctly, but they just don´t. 
---
Sounds like someone really likes hybrids ;)
---
They're fun though. Lots of things you can do as a pally, shammy, or druid to add to groups/bgs. ^_^
---
First rule of fight club.
---
Everything is hunter loot ;)
---
i guess i live my dreams becuase i do it all the time to good mages earth shock prevents them from casting other spells of that school and soon as i hit stormstrike they die. They can blink but im always waiting for that.
---
Essentially different games
---
I would hope people like him will continue to exist. Nobody should be crying over pvp happening on a pvp server as long as everything else is within rules (exploit usage or harassment for example would be an issue).
---
A video about the dangers of falsely reporting people to get the in trouble made by a guy who called the actual police on somebody for commenting "lmao" on a video that insulted TipsOut....no hypocrisy here
---
Wow that is very interesting, he has been doing this for so long, why now??
---
yes, because it's about what YOU've heard. this game experienced by millions of ppl is based on what YOU've heard.
---
the clip points out recorded moments of the abuse happening, must be fake because YOU don't know about that.
---
by the same logic if i don't have/hear about cancer then cancer doesn't exists. because, you know didn't happen to me so must be fake.
---
but yes, you are totally right, you're gonna be down voted because "it doesn't fit the narrative"
---
Yeah but they're as close as you're going to get. More accurate than even your memory would be in most cases, and far more accurate than retail. 
---
Highly unlikely it was an auto ban. I mean there are streamers with 10k viewbots watching them and everybody in that game's community knows it and reports them, but they never get banned. 
---
More likely scenario is a moderator who doesn't even know what a private server is just pushing the ban through. 
---
Everything is gonna be easy and as hard as BFA LFR since we start in 1.12. Only Naxxramas will provide some "challenge"
---
Hmm. You make a good point.
---
I bought the special edition of Star Wars: TOR and even rolled a little sith fella named Arthas and everything. It didn't even stand a chance.
---
This is not Ninja lmao
---
Falsely reporting someone is bannable. Sure if the hundreds of hours you spent on your account means nothing to you then sure, right click report away, I wouldn't recommend it though if you care at all about your character(s).
---
Mage is brutal with 6 portals/teleports (I put the portals on a 2nd action bar page tho) conjure/use 4 gems, min and max rank of every buff (PvPers mainly), multiple ranks of just about every main spell like  CoC, Fireball, Frostbolt, Fire Blast, Scorch, Blizz, AE,..  You gotta run a lot of macros to even fit all the stuff you have
---
Not sure how long you were there but I distinctly remember during WOTLK, everyone on the server knew not to go into a Archavon (Wintergrasp raid) pug lead by someone who was guildless, because that was a &lt;Months Behind&gt; trap and the person would switch to Master Looter just before the boss died and ninja everything to his guildies.
---
When the poor saps who weren't aware of this would inevitably cry in trade about it or try to warn others, the everyone would start spamming "gso" and "congrats "ninja' on your newly acquired loot."
---
That server really did have the most god damned, mildly retarded personality of any community I've ever had a part in. I really fucking miss it.
---
&gt; Where on the continuum do you draw the line and whose sensibilities do you use to define it?
---
Any time any moral rule gets enforced, people who are *way* over the line start saying "But where *exactly* do you draw the line? Huh? Huh?". Partially to muddy the waters, and partially to try to figure out how to be the biggest dickhead possible without consequences.
---
Again the answer is not to play their game. There will be some minor fuzziness around the edges of the line, but those are not the important cases. The important thing is punishing the people who are way over the line.
---
&gt; If people feel threatened by a ban for any bad behavior then we'll lose the summons over cliffs/elevators/under water, the funeral PvP, the social experience of collectively hating ninjas or rude guilds.
---
I am not seeing the downside here. Can you explain?
---
I think this is just a narrative dickheads spread so they can pretend that being a dickhead has some redeeming social value.
---
&gt; After I quit TBC I played an MMO browser game called Astro Empires and soon took over the top guild on a server. It's a game that relies on creating large fleets with mined resources and using those fleets to pillage enemy planets and fleets. Your large guild needed an alliance with many other large guilds to thrive. A leader of a guild we allied with did not have a filter. Sort of a Steve Jobs analogue. He was one of the most effective people I've ever known. If that game had report functions and a staff willing to eradicate players for the things they said then we'd never have created a vast alliance that completely dominated the server for six months.
---
(Shrug). So what? Someone else would have created a vast alliance and dominated stuff. Or not. Either way people would still be playing games and having fun.
---
Plus people like that behave badly because they can, not because it is some kind of inherent quality in them that they absolutely have to be a dick. If they got banned in three minutes they'd be back in twenty-four hours, still managing an empire but having hopefully learned an important social skill.
---
No, what I do remember of Vanilla I remember very well. I have yet to go a day without running into some new bug/inconsistency on a private server. I find it difficult to believe that anyone but someone who never played retail Vanilla would think of them as accurate.
---
There is literally nothign wrong with Right-Click Reporting. If you act out of Blizzard's ToS prepare to get removed. We don't want people who act out of turn.
---
Joanas quite the exception to this rule then, because the dude streams his old leveling runs from back in the day. It's not memory, he has those actual moments on a hard drive of his. He knows the quest route and to think he's still having to go "ok now this quest for a subpar weapon and 3m20s off my time, or this quest gives me a good weapon but it's a 5 minute run to get there?...wait am I sure the money the retail quest A gives me is enough for talents?" is ridiculous because he's had these guides with this info available since way back when.
---
How did i ever not get banned from rs?
---
Imagine being permanently banned from the game for falsely reporting people.
---
It's 2019, simple exploits that worked a decade back won't today.
---
Common sense for anyone playing online games, but you morons on reddit because you*like* to feel outrage in your uneventful lives, so you absolutely love to buy into this dumb fear-mongering-for-views bullshit.
---
Ok abusing this function is a problem. Blizzard should definitely be reviewing these bans thoroughly.
---
still requires server emulation with blizzard assets so technically yea against tos but the only way they'll know is nsa backdoors
---
I like the tool, but I think some statements are incorrect. But if I'm wrong, please explain.
---
\- For Warstomp with Tauren Druid you say that it helps build up additional threat. I believe this is wrong, as the ability does no damage. Or does Warstomp have an inherent threat amount that I've never heard about?
---
\- For Regeneration with Troll Shaman you say it aids mana regeneration as well, but the ability clearly states it's only regenerating health. 
---
\- Not really wrong, but with regards to Shadowmeld you mention it makes Nelf druids stealth a bit stronger, also when dealing with a Human's Perception ability, but I believe in WoW Classic you never really fight Humans if at all. Perhaps the only exception is duels. So in that regard, it's not really useful for dealing with Perception.
---
did you read the interview about how warlock pets being dismissed on the start of the new summoning spell instead of the end was not a bug in the beta, but actual vanilla behavior? even though retail and all pservers emulate it the othrr way around? thats a good example of faulty memory.
---
In the end game, with full gear, the differences are negligible. It's probably already negligible around level 30 or so.
---
By all means my good Sir!
---
I apologize to the alliance players. Next time I check the dungeon name lmao
---
Plus Elwynn is the best zone in WoW. 
---
if player A rolled before player B and both players rolled 20s, player A wins because he rolled first. 
---
He could have an xpack and run it solo on his own PC. Not sure how that stacks up with the rules, probably the same boat as pservers. 
---
Because the GMs shouldn't stop him? It doesn't automatically become 'griefing' if you just don't happen to like what another guy is doing.
---
A "community held event" doesn't entitle you to special treatment, it's still just open world barrens.
---
For me, who's stopped and restarted WoW many times since its release and has never hit L60.  It would be blatant curiousity that someone actually did a speed run and why I suck so much at it.  Get some good pointers that way too.
---
&gt;Any time any moral rule gets enforced, people who are way over the line start saying "But where exactly do you draw the line? Huh? Huh?". Partially to muddy the waters, and partially to try to figure out how to be the biggest dickhead possible without consequences.
---
I think this says a lot about your mentality. You appear to believe that people need to be controlled: both the people who say or think the "wrong" things and the people who would be influenced by the wrongthink. 
---
I believe that I need to control how other people affect me. If there is a system that enables me to do so (/ignore) then that is all I need. I do not want the deleterious effects of anything beyond that. 
---
&gt;I am not seeing the downside here. Can you explain?
---
Trolling events, pranks, and creative chaos comprise some of the funniest WoW videos on youtube. Similar organic events made for some of the funniest moments in my Vanilla days. Also things like Angwe patrolling Menethil and kiting world bosses into cities. I'm...really not sure how to *explain* the value of chaos in a virtual world. Your question is kind of like asking me to explain the necessity of carbon to life on Earth, in that we can drill down to the science but most people just understand that a vital element is a vital element. 
---
&gt;(Shrug). So what? 
---
Total war. Some of my favorite gaming memories. Extreme immersion. If you inhibit the ability to create organic fun then you lose the extremes. Might as well play retail if all you want is a rail to ride.

&gt;Plus people like that behave badly because they can, not because it is some kind of inherent quality in them that they absolutely have to be a dick. If they got banned in three minutes they'd be back in twenty-four hours, still managing an empire but having hopefully learned an important social skill.
---
It seems that you have a very specific type of person in mind and then you paint a bunch of other people with that color. I do not think that is accurate. The extreme assholes will still get banned. If you're the dude who thinks that everybody who swears or attacks your character or inconveniences you is similar to someone who genuinely deserves a ban (for cheating or targetted+sustained harassment) then we can't hang out because I'd feel like I'm walking on needles.

a good grind spot during launch and for those who wants their wands - they drop plenty of cloths.

Again, irrelevant if he isn’t steaming or uploading it on twitch
---
&gt; I don’t understand why no one is talking more about on of the most crucial topics that blizzard implemented in 2016, right click reporting.
---
Because false reports will get your account banned. Yes the system can be abused but it comes at a very high cost, the loss of your character and your account.
---
No sense, really? 
---
You seriously think that private servers are so different that it’s not applicable? 
---
Have you ever played on one? It’s the same quests, the same classes, and the same world. The numbers aren’t 100% correct, but the gist is the same. 
---
Lol. This again. Mr butthurt for no reason over here.

“He make play vanilla wow? Me ban!” 
---
You really that stupid mate? Same quests, same routes, same map... how does your brain work? Because technically a private server isn't retail, suddenly leveling on it is an entirely different experience? Genuinely interested how your brain works.
---
You're really good with video editing.  
---
In Vanilla people were pretty clever about mixing abilities in macros to save bar space (such as mage mana gem summon if you don't have one, use gem if you do)  
---
I wonder if we'll be able to do something similar with the new API.  
---
the right click report feature is all about cutting costs. same is loot trading. my link points out that they've fired ppl, ergo cost cutting.
---
it is hard to believe they are gonna spend anything on classic (hire ppl to look at reports) when they are in the middle of cutting costs policy.
---
furthermore they aren't asking anything for classic. they don't sell the game, they don't ask for a separate subscription. they most definitely won't be hiring ppl to look at reports.
---
Almost forgot, no flying mounts! Yikes!
---
why on earth can you report a player from the opposing faction? (or do they mix alliance and horde players in BGs now (I hope not lol)
---

I'd trust Joana's guide all the more if he was speedrunning on private servers to help tweak the route.

He does play on them to develop his current guides, but he doesn't talk about it or advertise it.

My mage on pservers have 3x 12 buttons of keybinds and 2x12 buttons that i click(conjure mana gem, water, portals etc) so that's 56 abilities i have out and actually use.
---
That's just bullshit.
---
Hi, /u/Tinderlokker69
---
Anyone serious about speed levelling does this. Transport yourself anywhere, instantly test different classes/specs/routes. Obviously it's not a problem legally if you do it on your own computer and don't tell anyone.
---
Not Vanilla but I have a tattoo of Ozzy Osbourne holding a dagger and casting a spell in Nagrand and Shattrath city in the background. My tattoos are just things I have nostalgia for, I don't pretend they have any practical meaning.

I just started following him yesterday. What a coincidence 
---
Hi, /u/justsomespecial
---
I don’t believe the issue is how easy it is to report but rather how quick and automatic the sentence is carried. 5 reports are way too few.
---
More like uninformed.
---
I said in another comment why I won't watch the video. I don't like Tips for unrelated reasons, and this is plain-as-day hyper-sensationalized to generate discussion about Classic in lieu of actual news. I will take links to threads, but I will not give Tips a view. If Tips did not link to these recorded moments in his video? That's a huge strike to the credibility of these moments.
---
Please do link them to me, because as of now, *every case of 'abuse' of this system that I have witnessed* via reddit and WoW forum threads, and there has been a *lot* of them, has ended the **exact same way.** I actively seek out these threads in hopes of seeing one where Blizzard *was* in the wrong, but this is a constant theme across every Blizzard title. OP withheld information, and the ban was 100% justified. 
---
You have a point about 'what I've heard'-- *but it applies to you just as much as it applies to me.* If you don't follow up on a thread where a Blue later replies to clarify that OP is full of shit, your perception is that it was a cut-and-dry case of a false ban-- Does that define the reality of the situation?
---
Rage about this all you want, it doesn't make you right. And **please.** Prove me wrong.

---
Oh shit, maybe that's what he was doing, questing with friends only. Seems legit.
---
Same here. I'm not sure how he would make an alliance guide suddenly if he wasnt playing. I'd expect the tweaking of horde to come from pserver info. Not notes from the past.
---
The greatest exploration game i've played in the past 5 years alongside Witcher 3 is Subnautica. Definitely recommend it.
---
Nah let’s keep it to humans as it was in vanilla.
---
How do you think he's refining his levelling route? Questing on retail ? Ofc he's playing pservers privately, and they are not that far off vanilla, quests are working and obviously some numbers may be off, but it's the closest you'll get. I don't understand this pservers hate.

We're talking about Twitch here, not the players. Why would *Twitch* care what he does if he's not streaming it.

Private Servers are servers hosted by people or groups which are not affiliated with Blizzard, and not licensed to run a server on Blizzard's behalf. Some try to emulate the game, others try to create whole new experiences in it.

Okay so before I go into detail, I am just going to say that playing on private servers goes against the Blizzard terms of service and shouldn't really be encouraged on this subreddit according to the rules. I am just going to describe what specifically they are and why they got popular and nothing more.
---
Basically, private servers are any server not hosted by Blizzard. They are usually of earlier versions like Vanilla, BC, and Wrath, and are free but often have cash shops, very non-Blizzlike elements such as bugs and unusual populations sizes, and are overall in an extremely gray area of legality.
---
While private servers have existed since even as early as BC, they gained much more traction during 2015 because the idea of classic servers was, at the time, deconfirmed and even made fun of by Blizzard, while at the same tie retail WoW was in a sorry state with Warlords of Draenor, these private servers were and as far as people knew, always would be the only way to experience these early versions of WoW. Due to these factors, a new private server named Nostalrius, which was unique for having no cash shop and being the most accurate Vanilla private server out there, got really popular and brought private servers from the underground into and even outside the mainstream WoW community. It got shut down in early 2016, but the popularity of Nostalrius was what caused Blizzard to finally change their minds and start development on official Classic servers.
---
Since then, many other private servers were created, but discussion on those belongs in r/wowservers, not here. And since Classic will be releasing in a matter of months anyway, I dont really see much point in playing on one anymore.
---
This was beautiful.
---
Indeed, just odd. why would he say hes not on pservers and not going to? Somehow he miraculously developed an alliance guide. Obviously hes playing something to do this.
---
I dont think anyone really cares. But it's obvious imo
---
It's a huge issue for sure. That said, if I could right click and report this video for these awful clickbaity splash screens, I wouldn't think twice.
---
Difference between classic and retail: being happy for someone else when they get a good item from dungeons 
---
I dont hate on pservers. but you're calling someone a liar without any reason beyond "there's no way he could NOT try it on a pserver!" when that's actually wrong when you have recordings of the full WR leveling process to reference instead of a pserver. the argument was memory isnt a contest to the real game, but there's no memory involved it's right here in your face, well not anymore.
---
When you speedrun a game you dont speed run it 25000 times to perfect every step. You'll do what joana does, record it, and rewatch it to see where you can cut times down, first. You can fast forward through routes to skip to the prevalent information instead of worrying about all the minor errors before that big one. That can add to your /played and would affect your decision making in future runs. And of course this perfection does need some fine tuning in game, which he did back in vanilla when get got the wr.
---
Weren't we all?
---
The payment method has already been confirmed. You will need to have a subscription, but if you already have a BFA subscription, you dont need to get a Classic subscription; they are one and the same. That is all you need to pay; there is no one-time fee (outside of maybe a Collector's Edition).
---
People forcing other people to change names... What the actual goddamn fucking hell... That thread you linked is so fucked up it would be automatically banned even from pornhub...
---
Do you have sources or you just want to bash retail?
---
Swap Tuborg for Carlsberg and pizza for Gerner's grill burgers, and sign me up!
---
And everyday Icelandic speech, especially among young folks, is chock full of English expressions too now, right?
---
Also as an outsider, it seems to me like Iceland got hit especially hard by touristy hyperrealism, like the way they sell tourists all the "skyr gives u viking strength", elf/ásatrú/rune, etc memes. All the cultural symbols seem so whored out. The intensity with which Icelandair is advertising Iceland as a stopover country scares me too, like how much more tourism can such a small island take?
---
Sadly very true
---
Indeed!
---
Looked through some gear lists for druids and tbh I don't care if pre-bis beats T1, still gonna go for T1 just because it's a set
---
I care
---
I am also worried about this, this has the potential to destroy like for example barrens chat. Remember guys, the problem is not that there is a report feature, but that it is **automated.** I have been muted numerous times on official for dark humor jokes, because people were offended and I then had a interesting conversation with a GM. He told me that I must first think, "would this offend a 12 year old or not and if it will, then I shouldn't say it." How the hell should I know what offends a 12 year old and for that matter, what doesn't offend a 12 year old? Remember jokes by nature, usually has someone as the butt of a joke and that someone will have cause to be offended. It should be no surprise that it is comedians that are suffering the most from the SWJ backlash.
---
Fundamentally the word "offended" has way to much credibility. Replace the word offend with a suitable synonym like "angry" and we would scoff at the idea that we should be able to report someone, because he makes me angry. What offends us can be both positive and negative. Even if it is negative, it can lead to positive outcomes. A jerk in a group can cause someone to rise up and defend you, perhaps earning you a lifelong friend you otherwise wouldn't have, because the jerk had been muted. So this is way more complex than we allow it to be and we should be careful to hand over the reigns of these judgments to perhaps a few insecure individuals, because that is what **automated** will allow.
---
You totally didn't understand anything OP is talking about.
---
:D
---
Fu John.
---
How can you look into mirror every morning, you monster.
---
just because it's run via Emulation doesn't mean it's not fundamentally the same game lol
---
These stories are getting less and less believable.
---
Mass report the main tank of a raid attempting a world boss to wipe them and get it for yourself.
---
Mass report other ranker to make them lose time and rank easier.
---
Seriously, this is actually downvoted?
---
An automated system will always be bad, simply because the PUNISHMENT comes before INQUIRY. Retail WoW is a very different game, it is basically a SINGLE PLAYER game for like 90% of the player base. Only a small fraction is actually doing serious raiding and serious mythic+.
---
All the rest can play the entire game without talking and without interacting with other players. Personal loot, optional PvP, LFD and LFR, are all tool that allow 90% of the player base to simply play retail WoW without any sort of interaction with other players.
---
In Classic...YOU HAVE TO INTERACT with players, if you want to play the game. And I am not talking about pushing high PvP ranks  or going for Scarab lord, I am talking about simple world PvP, that takes place almost everywhere and anytime. STV, Ashenvale, Tarren Mill/SS, Badlands, Searing Gorge, EPL, Arathi Highlands, Blackrock Mountain, are all zones and areas where world PvP is basically omnipresent.
---
This automated system allows you to report players of opposite faction, and while it sounds good that a stupid ganker should be logged off and prevented to login for 24 or 48 hours...well, you snowflakes that report that guy should have rolled on a PvE server.
---
How about FARMING in Classic? Any group can report a miner/herbalist from the opposite faction for w/e reason, because the automated system will punish that player, and will not touch the reporters. The reporters are basically "free of charge", and it will all come down to MONEY for ActiBlizz. Will they spend TIME and MONEY with a GM that will have to inquiry 10 players that reported a single guy? Or will they choose to KEEP those 10 guys keep PAYING the game and be ok with the SINGLE guy quitting the game? 
---
I guess we all know the answer.
---
How about ninja looting? How about out of game chats on general or trade or guild chat, where people are talking about multiple topics and plenty of today's kids are offended by a sneeze? How about an experienced player giving advices in a group/raid? Plenty of snowflakes will consider him an elitist, or w/e, and they will feel offended.
---
Oh, you might say that those players are exceptions, and the game would be better without it. 
---
Well, you are WRONG. Farming and world PvP, PuGs, loot drama, various out of the game topic chat...that is basically covering pretty much every single player out there.
---
You think YOU will not be affected by this system because you are a good guy?
---
Well, after me and my buddies will report you for mining in our favorite area (regardless of your faction), good luck reaching ActiBlizz and starting a massive inquiry on us...WHILE YOU ARE BANNED FOR DAYS because of AUTOMATED SYSTEM.
---
And if you manage, by some miracle, to actually MAKE ActiBlizz listen to you...what do you think ActiBlizz will do? Ban me and my other 9 game payers and keeping YOU, a single payer, in the game?
---
THINK AGAIN.
---
You welcome

I‘ll play on german Servers as i am Austrian. But it will be really strange to not use my now 15 years of professional gaming English. 
---
Nowadays I play games that is mostly English only (GW2, ESO) and it will be unfarmiliar speaking German only
---
I've [said it before](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a9qbj7/unpopular_opinion_not_implementing_the_wow_token/ecpoedz/) and I'll say it again: 
---
Not offering a legitimate way to purchase gold in 2018 is like [a company trying to sell a perfect replica of a Model-A Ford without any seat belts](http://www.mafca.com/seat_belts.html) to modern consumers... and a crowd of self-entitled idiots defending the design because muh nostaliga.
---
Unfortunately the devs have chosen to placate the community by refusing to use the best tool to combat what used to be a [multi-million dollar gold-farming industry.](https://venturebeat.com/2011/07/22/the-china-conundrum-the-rise-of-gold-farming/)
---
And no, self-policing does not work (it didn't work for a decade) and no, players don't *deserve* to get their identities stolen, accounts hacked, or bank accounts emptied just for wanting to buy in-game currency in a fucking *videogame.*
---
While leveling a warrior, my bars were absolutely filled by level 40.
---
Sure, you don't "need" all, but macros are a huge difference and having a disarm macro to swap+disarm is something I need in all stances.
---
Same for charge, intercept, shield interrupt, pummel, anti-fear, weapon swap, etc.
---
Warrior seems very simple, but there's so much potential in the class.
---
The question mark at the end makes me feel uncomfortable. Is this now a question or a fact?
---
Wait, there are spiders in the Jasperlode Mine? (i've never gone deeper than the quest completed pop-up and with no reason to go back and my severe dislike for these types of mines/caves with quick respawning enemies never went for a quick exploration run)
---
You didn‘t even mention the spell batching. Most of the people concerned also mention this. 
---
I guess it‘s senseless to kill your head with these thoughts and wait for what happens. All of the concerns were mentioned 1000 times Minimum here, so if Blizz just took a 1 second look into this subreddit, they will know. 
---
I didn't see the word "liar" anywhere up there, you might just be taking this too hard. All he's saying is he'd be surprised if Joana wasn't using one because they're more accurate to vanilla than current retail WoW.
---
Imagine having dedicated account for false reporting so you dont care.
---
If you grind/kite mobs, you won't loose this much time, you'll greed good XP and avoid being stuck without quest.
---
Paladins shouldn't waste gold on:
---
* Seal of the Crusader
---
* Exorcism
---
* Divine Protection ranks
---
* Redemption ranks
---
* Turn Undead
---
* Hammer of Justice ranks
---
* Lay on Hands ranks
---
* Seal of Justice
---
* Holy Wrath
---
* Divine Shield
---
* Blessing of Sacrifice
---
I love doing this. I also install a mod that lets me have more followers so I travel around with a group of npcs I enjoy completing quests slaying dragons etc. It does get kind of sad when a character I particularly love dies on the field of battle. Most recently it was a dunmer priest. That was a tough one.
---
I've seen you beat this horse over and over.   Gold farming is coming back, and that's fine.  No one is afraid of losing their account to hackers when they don't buy gold.  Especially with Dual factor being enabled. 
---
&gt; Please feel free to link a contradictory example.
---
i will. right after the link where you prove that :
---
&gt; Every story about 'victims' of mass-report 'automation' that gain traction have always ended with "Oh look, there was more information behind the scenes, the action taken was justified."
---
If losing one tank is a death sentence to the entire raid, why are you only bringing that one tank? This goes beyond losing a tank to reports. 
---
In terms of time-limited competitive events; When was the last time you heard about a mass report ban delaying a group's progression? There's only one time I remember a top 100 guild being banned mid raid-- And that was for account sharing.
---
The effectiveness of both of these scenarios relies on having a complete understanding of how the report systems work, and an underestimation of Blizzard's understanding of how capable players are of being assholes to each other. Given that votekicking players will lock that feature for some time, I'm confident they have a solid grasp on this.
---
these stories are getting more and more believable. also as the time passes there are more ppl to sustain them.
---
&gt; No one is afraid of losing their account to hackers when they don't buy gold.
---
So you believe that people who do seek gold from third-party companies deserve to get hacked?
---
If you pvp as a druid you also want rank 1 rejuv regrowth mark and thorns to bait dispell with no mana, rank 1 moonfire to destroy totem. 
---
And you most likely need to bind your 5shifts. 
---
You also forgot abilities like hibernate
---
Where is Furbolg Totem?
---
Why on earth would a group of people pay monthly for that, and would it really be the epidemic people make it out to be?
---
I know the private server community is toxic but that's some next level dedication just to fuck with another player. 
---
Rogue have the most free space in the action bar, Shamans have the least.
---
It's just the last line that got me. Retail=BFA and of course it's a departure from vanilla. Anything past cata is null and void imo. hell, anything past BC is null and void because they've messed with that info since then. just like a pserver. 
---
no one in their right mind is going "bfa speed leveling will pave the way for the classic version"
---
coincidentally. I seen a thorium vein once in mulgore on a blizzlike pserver, never before have I seen a thorium vein in mulgore. that alone makes it unreliable because there's not supposed to be thorium in a level 5 zone. (My opinion is, it's a like a fake city you put on your map as a trademark. It's supposed to be a way to tell that a pservers using your version instead of making one themselves. or they're like "no one comes here for thorium. I can stash a node here and by the time they're 60 they won't remember it and i can come by for a free ore every now and again.. or it was just an error. mind you an error that vanilla didn't have.)
---
My only idea for Dire Maul being in the Eastern Kingdoms is that It's an elven ruin but what complicates things is that it's not a High Elven ruin, It's a Highborne Ruin. Maybe the liens between Highborne and High Elf were dulled before launch?
---
I didn't get to experience Wintergrasp so Tol Barad was my first PvP zone that unlocked a raid and I LOVED it. Nothing quite matched the feeling of stealing the druid spell "Symbiosis" as a Death Knight. I loved death knights and their silly abilities. Corpse Exploding players for a disrespect. Army of the Dead. Nothing better.
---
That proud feeling of completing dungeon. I love it..
---
Haha the weak auras API fake news? I didnt thought people still believe it^^ Nothing trustworthy.
---
I don't see anything wrong with tanks selling their services or reserving specific items.
---
c is autorun for me and v is mount. shift v is hearth
---
Wow you’ve twisted his words on that one. Don’t twist something to fit your agenda, this isn’t CNN 😂.
---
World pvp isn't griefing. I hope he will start playing again just not on my realm.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. 
---
Losing your wow account is a relatively cheap way to learn the important lesson of not trusting shady strangers on the internet.
---
Supposedly there's more automation in the squelch system. It silences you for 24 hours (with longer time for every time you are squelched) AND disconnects you from the game. Being used in Rbg.
---
Check the links especially the third one and the responses to that tweet. Of course it's impossible to prove that all of those people are not embellishing their experiences but it's not like the system is transparent enough to check. 
---
 I know that atleast paladin's judgement is off GCD.
---
I recalled it from WC3 and not Vanilla
---
A lot of modern "solutions" have been cut out of vanilla. Go back to retail if you crave them so badly.
---
PLEASE do more of these for other dungeons! I absolutely love all of this.
---
Have I? I was born at night, but I wasn't born last night. I ain't falling for these sleazy comments. Here. I'll explain it to you:
---
It's so easy to dogwhistle like u/Verdyn, saying some real sneaky shit like: “No one is afraid of losing their account to hackers when they don't buy gold.”
---
Lol, *when they don't buy gold.* No shit sherlock. What a brilliant, fucking take. That's not what we're talking about, and it's not what they're *implying.*
---
You see, you might not have thought about this, but the [*implication*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yUafzOXHPE) is that players who *do* seek to buy gold *should* be afraid of losing their account to hackers.
---
If people want open world save spaces there are PvE realm made just for them.

Haha, you are more than welcome. It's quite eye opening once you realize how much Blizzard dropped the ball. PoE is an incredible game. Glad I could help.
---
Not that I disagree with you, for different reasons, but gold sellers usually use hacked accounts to both farm and advertise.
---
As a hunter is eazy to walk to your next quest point while killing mobs on the way.
---
Other classss can do this aswell but as hunters its slightly more eazy.
---
Twist as you like.  I bought gold without dual authentication and never had issues.  I would have deserved any consequence that came with my decision.  Yea, I've seen people talk with this guy.  It's dealing with a Dunning-Kruger.
---
Hate to break it to you, but you are the very person you hate.
---
Killing mobs as you go is very good xp, more so than the quests themselves.

At this time can't possibly know more than we'll start with 3 days each week (2 of them in week days, 1 in weekend), 3-4 hours sessions starting late afternoons-early evenings. More closer to release we will update with more info.
---
This is really cool. It's like watching a speedrun except relaxed and learning. Good shit man!
---
Shamans have a shitload of abilities and downranks.
---
Who?
---
&gt; You see, you might not have thought about this, but the implication that u/Verdyn is making—whether they're honest enough to admit it or not—is that players who do seek to buy gold should be afraid of losing their account to hackers.
---
Exactly, fuck em, if you want to buy gold you run the risk of losing your account or being banned by Blizz. In a game where gold is a very important resource I don't see why this is much of an issue, Classic will be ruined with tokens. 
---
This is you. The undead right of you with the Blessed Qiraji Acolyte Staff is the guy your girlfriend tells you not to worry about!
---
Golly. Yeah That'd make it important huh.
---
Welp. Guess I'll be taking a more homicidal approach to leveling this time around.
---
Thank you for your Feedback :)
---
One of the latest examples was this reddit thread where someone who got banned claimed it was due to "mass reporting" because he engaged in Wpvp (basicly saying he was ganking ppl and got banned because they reported him). Where in the end it came out he wasn't banned at all due to being reported after engaging in wpvp, but he was banned because he was harrassing several ppl through ingame mail. https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/a6va7p/account_suspended_for_disruptive_gameplay_world/?st=jrrkniw7&amp;sh=3f7f5a53
---
That's Ferals.
---
They said it during their bkizzcon presentation that it is not a permanent feature after the initial rush. But not sure if they've changed their mind as nothing further has been said.
---
I can tell you Arcane power and Presence of Mind are. That's about as far as I go tho. 
---
- No loot trading
---
- No store
---
- No wow tokens
---
- No automated report/ban system
---
- No sharding ( fine at start and max first 2 zones ) 
---
These are my biggest conserns
---
This! One of us! One of us!
---
&gt; Exactly, fuck em
---
That's fine, as long as you have the integrity to admit you're a sociopathic piece of shit human being for believing that other people's real life safety come after your enjoyment in a videogame.
---
I do this but I usually only pick the squishy ones of appropriate level. Sometimes if I find a few, I'll go off track a bit. grind a bit if it's a good fast mob to kill.
---
&gt;Considering hunters and melee never want the same ranged weapons, not really an issue.
---
Blackcrow.
---
That was fucking rad. Reminds me of the Slimjim WoW commercial.

Blue suede shoes

It's not just your WoW account. It's identity theft, credit-card theft, etc.
---
But it's fine to take that stance, as long as you also have the integrity to admit you're a sociopathic piece of shit human being for believing that other people's real life safety come after your enjoyment of a videogame.
---
Actually he plays on private servers every day.. he probably means that he would never stream or promote them?
---
&gt; WoW tokens would ruin vanilla far, far more than third party goldsellers.
---
Sure, as long as you also have the integrity to admit you're a sociopathic piece of shit human being for believing that other people's real life safety come after your enjoyment of a videogame.
---
Also warriors' shield block

&gt; I would have deserved any consequence that came with my decision.

Welp, damn. I'm farming the sociopathic takes in this thread like a fucking gold farmer myself! Lol.

Mages don't need wands past lvl 20ish. The early wands are incredibly useful, especially if you get a Lesser Magic Wand at Lvl 5.

Nope, permabanned.
---
Wait, really?
---
I don't remember that at all and I played from US launch. Granted, that was like 14 years ago, but still.
---
Bruh, basic stats tool references str as adding to druids block value 😂... if only.
---
In a game where gold farming is part of the progression, no there should be NO way of buying it. And people who buy from third party's should get permabanned.
---
Can pserver footage on yt get you in trouble, though?

And so, basically the same (Actually not the same, because it has less viable options mentioned than the one you get as 1st result in google) item list was copypasted above and upvoted.

So you believe that players *deserve* to get their identities stolen, credit cards hacked, or bank accounts emptied for seeking in-game currency?
---
If you're dumb enough to give your card details to some chinese gold seller then that's the risk you take, I don't want Classic ruined for the community to protect morons like yourself. 
---
So you're a sociopathic piece of shit. Got it.
---
Hey everyone!
---
I started playing classic few weeks before BC, and I really enjoyed levelling through classic and later on in BC. I played a lot of PvP back then until Cata, so now I am happy to revisit classic in a RP/PvE light. However this time with my wife:D
---
She did not play WoW before, but she will give it a go with me. We are thinking Alliance, cuz Horde is ugly she said, and I always went with Horde so a change could be nice. 
---
She is thinking about going Warlock or Mage, which were also 2 out of 4 of my preferences, remaining two being Paladin and Priest.
---
What do you think would be best combo for levelling, dungeons etc? We are quite capable and mechanically competent to do high end stuff in most games, meaning possibly doing some dungeons by us 2 only. 
---
My main idea is if I she went Warlock, she could have a pet tank, which could tank while we both do dmg, and me occasionally healing on priest. 
---
Is Warlock + Shadow Priest fastest and most competent combo &amp; how viable is the voidwalker for tanking dungeons?
---
We would have resurrections &amp;&amp; soulstone, healthstone, a lot of overtime damage, cc, no need for drinking/eating(lifetap/spirit tap), good tanking with pet, heals, drains.
---
Any tips and/or other combinations we could consider? Thanks a lot!
---
It's not like paladins are actually hurting for gold but
---
Definitely a very good spell to pick up for leveling, there will be plenty of undeads and demons
---
Not a must but still very handy
---
* Hammer of Justice
---
There is absolutely no point in gimping yourself for PvP or Elite soloing while leveling
---
Even as a paladin not having enemies flee while fighting is pretty damn good
---
This may or may not be your fault then.
---
I want a right-click ignore. Report should be more involved.
---
A way more important issue is trading Needed items. We really should try and get a response from the lead devs on this subject, and let them know how bad it is. If they want less CS staff, fine. Just make it so GMs can't trade items under any circumstances and have a bullet point in the create a ticket that makes it clear that items will never be traded, and if you make a ticket requesting it, you'll be banned from submitting another for 1 week and it doubles every time.
---
You do understand what we're talking about right? Maybe you need to do [some reading](http://meminsf.silverstringmedia.com/labour/a-history-of-world-of-warcrafts-gold-economy/) before dropping these non-sequitur takes.
---
is it possible, to include the numbers in the racial texts?
---
Ghost Saber\*
---
Yes, you're send there from Ashenvale.
---
&gt; you need to be using your whole dam kit or you get smoked. 
---
When a rogue uses his whole dam kit he doesn't even need gear to kill rank14 players, ever seen World of Roguecraft?
---
Yep, fuck em for making the game worse, wouldnt give a shit if it turned out my mom was buying gold and got hacked. Well deserved.
---
&gt; Definitely a very good spell to pick up for leveling, there will be plenty of undeads and demons
---
Not until 40+. You don't need Exorcism in Duskwood. Maybe buy it at 40, but earlier is a waste of gold.
---
&gt; Not a must but still very handy
---
If it's not a must then it's not worth the gold.
---
&gt; There is absolutely no point in gimping yourself for PvP or Elite soloing while leveling
---
You're a hybrid. You can self-heal. Therefore, the higher ranks of those spells would not have saved you in any PvP fight you were destined to lose. That's why they're a waste of money.
---
&gt; Even as a paladin not having enemies flee while fighting is pretty damn good
---
After leveling three different Paladins on private servers, the amount of times this was actually a problem was... never. Even in dungeons, mobs die too fast for it to matter. It's a waste of a GCD. Just use JoR at range, and then SoC/SoR.
---
I think it's perfectly fine for early development of a guide. It's a pretty iterative process, you're gonna be doing it a lot, so it does make sense to me to get your rough outline ready on a private server til Classic launches.
---
I agree that they're definitely less reliable, but nobody was gonna be mining to power level anyways. PServers are very good at approximating the quest experience, in spite of oversights like that.
---
I dont want to live on this planet anymore
---
You're a piece of shit human being, my dude. 
---
Wow. I'm farming the sociopathic takes here almost as hard as a gold farmer, lol.
---
It's more about the fucking up of the ingame economy that gold farming brings, as well as a shitload of spammy bots.
---
There is already a way of buying it. You have two choices.
---
1. Gold selling by chinese farming bots. Fucked up server economy. Lots of spam. Stolen accounts. Stolen credit cards.
---
2. Gold selling by other players without the negative consequences above.
---
It's your choice. You're free to take #1 but you need to realise they're the same, except that your choice is a lot worse.
---
Fuck SJWs. The internet is not their safe space.
---
Sounds like you want a save way of buying gold
---
If you're going to be a warlock as your flair suggests, this will be very easy for you.  
---
You can use your pet to pull mobs which are slightly out of your path. I think you'll find it rather enjoyable doing this on a warlock.  
---
isnt this the same model as the lions in dun morogh ?
---
Yeah I read on his website he intends to unless he is griefed which is likely to happen. But he is an experienced speed runner and will do what’s best. If he is streaming I’ll be watching. His guide helped me to 60 for the first time. 
---
I hope he gets unbanned soon. 
---
Mage iceblock
---
Natures Swiftness for shaman and druid
---
I strictly play on private servers, so I don't care about buying gold myself, but I understand the gold farming problem and I'm a rational, compassionate person. 
---
That's why I understand how important the security measure of having a legitimate way to RMT in an MMO is.
---
Correct but I doubt they’ll send the goons after you unless you monetise it or broadcast it. 
---
That's okay, icarebot.
---
It's critical until you get your mount or some other fast travel ability. Because otherwise have fun getting daze/stun locked until the mob tethers back to its starting location, taking a bunch of damage and probably pulling a bunch of other enemies.
---
Once you have that... it depends on how efficient you're being with quests. If you try to 100% complete as many zones  as possible before their quests turn grey, you won't have any issues reaching 60.
---
enhance needs agility in endgame to get critcapped with buffs, there are very few pieces for enhance in raids and some of them nobody else wants. Ret pallies should really only contest with warrior dps, but there may be a few pieces like crow of (destruction?) from rag that hunters can also use. 
---
Its the price of playing the best 2 specs in vanilla (ret pala and enhance shammy) :^) 
---
Old news but yea. The whole industry is fucked, everything depends on shitty micro-transaction p2w idea and no gameplay at all.
---
I dunno man. Vanilla stretched across some 10-15 different patches all which introduced changes, big and small.
---
Pretty much! 
---
Faerie fire is amazing for pulling, you don't waste mana or GCD to switch forms, you can keep your rage. It is also powerful against enemy rouges and druids.
---
Ranking up might not worth it, but the inital rank certainly does.
---
I am 100% agreeing with you. I got muted many times for making jokes (mostly with guild names), and they got offended (and no, they were not 12 year olds). I hate that in 2010s gaming you can't say anything, because it is "toxic", which is a term I have never heard when I grew up on playing COD2 and such games. There is an option for  mute and ignore in nearly every game, use that if someone offends you, but going to the teacher and tell him what he said, is just simply childish.   
---
Report function should be about when someone breaks the rules, exploits, sells gold, and things like that. Not because someone said something rude on a chat. Grow up, and ignore it, it's that simple, the world is not around you and your little feelings. If someone is actively a douche, the server community will know that, and then he gets his punishment.
---
It should be a good combo for questing fast, but you won't be able to duo dungons with a void walker as a tank. You're free to try, but it's not really that hard to wipe in a dungeon even as a 5-man group when people have shitty gear. Your damage will be too low for you to be able to heal up a voidwalker without going OOM, even if the voidwalker managed to keep aggro from everything and kept the mobs from killing you outright.
---
Or retail cucks mass-reporting just because they hate vanilla.
---
Could you please elaborate on what the training costs are for druids compared to other classes in patch 1.12 by using your quote as a source?
---
The possibility to be disconnected by this kind of abuse is something not unique to Classic, and while it is an issue, I think people are being overly dramatic about being completely banned due to mass reports. My hope is that seeing players abuse the disconnect in competitive play pushes Blizzard to fix it overall, though I can't help but imagine they have safeguards/shadow ban functions in the report system for malicious reporters.
---
Sadly, it does make sense why the system isn't transparent. If players could know the specifics of the system, they would know how to exploit it. Due to the subjectivity of chat-based offenses and the pressure waiting for a GM to review the case, I don't think removing autosquelch would be the right move, but the disconnect is certainly unnecessary, and is hopefully a technical failing that can be corrected.
---
Just imagine a world of warcraft where leeroy Jenkins could be banned that easily. 
---
That system has to go for classic. 
---
Yea, because I still don't get gold seller spam anymore. /s 
---
Even with Tokens, third party services still live on.  In some cases I can get more gold from them than a token.

---
i don't like tips either with his videos about how that grass is growing but to deny a problem just because you don't like the person that presents it is as prejudicious as saying black ppl are inferior because they are black. 
---
want more proof? [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skWzi3o4oGI). asmongold got silenced with an automated ban. wait, this one isn't good because asmongold is a clown. and while i agree with you, the proof is still right there. caught on tape just like in tips video. want more? scroll up and see the most voted answers in this thread are about abuses. also the fact that actiblizz [lied about bans/silences not being automated](https://youtu.be/3Ry7eGwFIPs?t=70)"any player who is reported multiple times under the spam or abusive chat categories will, **after investigation**, receive an account wide silence penalty". later, pressed by the community they admitted that indeed the bans/silences are automated and only the appeals are investigated. because actiblizz enjoys sucking dick for money.
---
no it doesn't apply to me as much as it applies to you. the fact that you know that some cases are shady(in actiblizz's favour) doesn't imply that ALL cases are shady. even more so considering the fact that you cannot present proof that all cases were justified bans. isn't this what you are claiming? the system is not flawed because all the cases you have witnessed turned out to be in actiblizz's favour. and that is false because : 
---
a) you have not witnessed all the cases. 
---
b) actiblizz will always try to limit the awareness of the fact that they can be wrong some times or that they have taken a decision that diminishes the social factor of the game on behalf of the economic factor(shareholders).
---
c) also there are bans that have been revoked. if you haven't found them doesn't mean they don't exist. clear proof that the system isn't flawless. and vanilla relying on the social aspect of the game more than retail make these unjustified bans gamebreaking. also the abusers can use it while they compete with you for devilosaur skins, break your premade for pvp, kill your advantage on world bosses, etc. this is virtually ddosing you.
---
&gt; Does that define the reality of the situation?
---
the reality of the situation is defined by the fact that you haven't seen all the cases investigated and the fact that the company will not willingly present cases that will break its reputation. in fact it will try to cover up those cases the same way they did with the fiasco that was wow immortal at blizzcon by removing the youtube videos with negative reviews or plainly deleting the negative comments.  because we are a billions dollar company and we can shut the fuck up idiots that say they will not buy our products. i WILL NOT PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET AND UNLESS YOU"VE LIVED IN CAVE YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS. that's just one example.
---
 &gt; Rage about this all you want, it doesn't make you right.
---
am i to guess that you have problems understand basic human emotions because you have a mild delay in your development or is it an unnecessary exaggeration because you lack arguments and proof?
---
It's not remotely critical unless you care about getting some kind of speedrun time.
---
If you want to play the game like that, then that's your prerogative, but personally I think rushing is a waste unless you're a private server player who's already done everything recently.
---
Isn't it against ToS to buy gold from third party websites?
---
Appreciate the post man!
---
I haven't played any private servs so honestly I have no idea what are the possibilities. Just thought that maybe for first few dungeons I wouldn't be needing real tank, real healer and 3 good dpses. Dungeons like:
---
The Deadmines 17 - 26 
---
Shadowfang Keep 20 - 28
---
Blackfathom Deeps 23 - 30
---
However I am probably mistaken.
---
Try the math of going from point a to point b directly vs killing mobs in comparison to the direct quest xp, comparing xp per hour.
---
Killing people 40 levels lower than you is no more PvP than a grown man kicking the shit out of a toddler is MMA.
---
Yes.
---
mods arrest this man pls
---
&gt; other people's real life safety comes after your enjoyment of a videogame.
---
A gold buyer is sacrificing their own safety for their own enjoyment. Why would we have any sympathy for such an idiot? Give up our enjoyment for theirs, just because they're stupid enough to hurt themselves if we don't?
---
Ironfoe/Felstriker or Ironfoe/Thrash Blade if you want to be hardcore for Alliance.
---
Alex also beat him to the punch with making a video about this. 
---
That is indeed how noobs heal raids. Which is fine 99% of the time. However, if you learn your class properly and understand what you are doing it can be way more engaging than that. And by skillful healing you can drop 1 healer for 1 extra DPS in the lower raids like MC, Ony, BWL, ZG, AQ20. 
---
SMOrc
---
1&gt; You will need to grind for the fastest level time
---
2&gt; Running from quest hub to quest giver 'wastes' time
---
3&gt; Grinding on the way from quest hub to quest giver saves time since the mob is litterally *in your way*
---
Conclusion:
---
4&gt; Killing mobs on the way from quest hub to quest giver takes the place of 'going out of your way to a good grind spot' and actually saves time during your leveling process.
---
I never did it either, but the logic is there.
---
Bad bot.
---
I can't believe no one thought to crosspost that post to this subreddit before...
---
Oh wait.
---
I leveled on a pserver with decreased mob xp (so you have to do all the quests). I did not hit exalted at all on any of the factions by lvl 40. Don't think it's possible.
---
Young and naive players can seek there ingame currensies savely ingame like everyone else.
---
If you are old enough to get a creditcard and still dump enough to fill out there info on shady sites. They have a problem, not blizzard.
---
&gt; Not until 40+. You don't need Exorcism in Duskwood. Maybe buy it at 40, but earlier is a waste of gold.
---
There is no point in skipping it if you're going to pick it up later anyway and it will certainly help in duskwoods and desolace
---
&gt;You're a hybrid. You can self-heal. Therefore, the higher ranks of those spells would not have saved you in any fight you were destined to lose. That's why they're a waste of money.
---
Again if you're going to pick the up later there is no point in holding it off besides what they do is give you more time to do self heals without interuption, especially bandages. They are complete game changers in pvp.
---
&gt;After leveling three different Paladins on private servers, the amount of times this was actually a problem was... never. Even in dungeons, mobs die too fast for it to matter. It's a waste of a GCD. Just use JoR at range, and then SoC/SoR.
---
It's incredibly good cramped spaces like caves, it's honestly worth the money just for getting through the Curzen Compound. A single judge won't give you more value than avoiding a potential chain pull and the cost is absolutely not an issue.
---
Joana was streaming the old videos they had on their 1-60 run through twitch it was probably incorrectly assessed and/or reported as a private server

&gt; "Big servers ruin communities!" - Oh and mergers don't? 3 Scarab Lords on 1 server due to mergers doesn't harm the community or the feel of classic?

Why are you under the impression that the big dropoff of initial tourists will last until the gates of AQ have been opened, several months afterwards..??
---
Ye it's the disconnect part that seems easiest to abuse. That it seems to persist on retail is what worries me. Not to say the the squelch itself can't be a problem and that a system meant to reduce harassment can be used to harass isn't great. Another thing is stuff like this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/comment/efq89hs
---
Mass reporting to DC someone who gets a forced name change and that the reporter can then steal the original name. Either for wanting the name or just to spite someone. One or even several times
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/comment/efqndub
---
&gt; Using fear as a tactic to take away a choice.
---
What choice are you talking about? You either have gold selling that's very disruptive, or gold selling that's less disruptive. You don't have a choice. It's like the retarded war on drugs where people say "We can't allow more drugs into our society" while completely ignoring the fact that the drugs are there anyway.
---
You don't have the choice of "no gold selling". The only choice you have is what kind there is and the effects of it.
---
1/1000000 then. First number does not matter, only 3 subsequent rolls matter. Though I understood initial message like they rolled the same number twice but those numbers were different.
---
Power trinkets are off gcd

There are many guilds and many servers in the world. 6 guilds attending MC for a year and one of them would see that situation.
---
The token is not a gold sink. It does not remove gold from the economy, only shifts it between players. It does not prevent inflation.
---
You won't be needing a real tank, as in "a protection warrior", but you will need a tank that is a player character. If you're really patient, and really, really good at managing CC and mobs then it might be possible for Deadmines but I'd say the time it will take you will be a lot more than just finding a group for it.
---
i feel the need to point out that you should read more carefully :
---
&gt; **Every** story about 'victims' of mass-report 'automation' that gain traction have always ended with

somehow i doubt that 5 links represents **EVERY** story

&gt; I can keep going, though.

it looks like you have a long way to go.
---
[on the other hand this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/an8jpd/the_rightclick_report_feature_as_it_stands_could/efrljc8/)
---
Yeah I can imagine, he’s a careful guy in my impression
---
It might fall in the category of 'not done' or 'game etiquette' though. You might get a name of the server of the dude who expects payment for being the tank while still needing items and might get ignored over more friendly guys. 
---
Because face it, tanks who expect payment while still needing items do not tend to be the most social of people.
---
&gt; Why would we have any sympathy for such an idiot? 
---
Because gold farmers prey on naive, handicapped, or younger players. There is a huge population of players at risk for having their (or their parents') identities stolen, credit cards hacked, or bank accounts emptied.
---
Furthermore, this is a problem that existed for 10+ years and no amount of self-policing or lack of sympathy was able to fix. Only the token was able to [undercut gold farmers.](http://meminsf.silverstringmedia.com/labour/a-history-of-world-of-warcrafts-gold-economy/)
---
Not to mention the ethical implications of not implementing a solution that we know works to dismantle [an industry https://venturebeat.com/2011/07/22/the-china-conundrum-the-rise-of-gold-farming/](https://venturebeat.com/2011/07/22/the-china-conundrum-the-rise-of-gold-farming/) that oftentimes relied on slave-labor.

It reminds me of the analogy of a vintage car company selling replica vehicles without seat-belts for their “accurate experience,” and then acting like they're not implicated in an increase in car deaths.

Blizz should activly ban gold sellers and buyers.
---
Security had inproved alot.
---
First your wow account was at stake, now your full battlenet account.
---
Certain gadgets such as engi bombs are off the gcd.
---
The goldfaming problem is there because people "dont care about buying gold".
---
People should care that no gold gets sold/bough.
---
A lot of old games had that gimmick. Presumably they thought it was "more immersive", like someone is reading the quest text for you (before fully voiced games). Other such things were page turning animations and so on.
---
However, because everyone reads at different speeds it was mostly just a hindrance. I do read all the quest text but I prefer the instant option.
---
Yeah, then we can't have a conversation about this because you're not arguing reality. You're arguing fantasy.
---
People *will* gold farm and exploit that to commit crimes against the community. Period. To say and think otherwise is irresponsible and delusional. That's just the world we live in.
---
People *will* seek gold from gold sellers. Period. To pretend that *just say no* campaigns work, or that these people *deserve* get their identities stolen, credit cards hacked, or bank accounts emptied is sociopathic.
---
Any conversation that starts without acknowledging these truths is not a fact-based conversation.
---
Orcs are the preferred horde race for locks due to Command which increases Warlock pet damage by 5%. This is a substantial gain but does not scale well past 60.
---
That seems like you might be giving it more credit than its due lol

Matters a lot more at levels above 30 in my opinion. I always got stuck around 37-45 and get bored, i think. I was also little then.

As I already said, it takes Einstein brain to cross these items out from the list. 
---
The choice is if you want to participate in gold buying for a ban or information stolen. Clearly placed in the rules not to.  Now you want to add an avenue that is legit, that a portion of people feel undermine the spirit of the game.  Tokens IMO just added more profit for Blizzard, and an easy way for casuals to skip working for gold. 
---
   Blizzard fucked their own economy  up more SINCE the start of WoD (Including Legion &amp; BFA)  than the third party market.  
---
[History disproves you.](http://meminsf.silverstringmedia.com/labour/a-history-of-world-of-warcrafts-gold-economy/)
---
Stop saying I want people to have there identities stolen. You are putting words in peoples mouths.
---
And I dont want NEE-sayer campaigns. People already know the risk.
---
Fuck, how can I deal subtle, offensive jokes with that feature around
---
Doesn't work as well for male streamers
---
&gt; Stop saying I want people to have there identities stolen. You are putting words in peoples mouths.
---
*Not* implementing a solution for gold farming is supporting the old status quo, which meant people having their identities stolen. You can't be safely neutral on this topic.
---
&gt; People already know the risk.
---
And it still didn't work to curb the problem for a *decade*. It wasn't until a legitimate source of gold was implemented that gold farming became a shell of its former self.
---
So either accept that you're a sociopath or give me a different solution that isn't mongoloid-tier, like: “Hurr, [people should just not want to buy gold](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/anbwl1/i_hope_that_a_subscription_and_a_one_off_fee_is/efsds9n/), durr.”

Gonna get me a lvl 40 horse that way:))
---
However the beginning is important, I’d say make sure to do nearly all low level quest
---
The most important are:
---
Northshire Abbey
---
Elwynn Forest
---
Westfall
---
Redridge Mountains
---
Duskwood
---
And ofc Stormwind. Then later on,
---
Hillsbrad Foothills
---
Arathi Highlands
---
Altarac Mountains
---
Stranglethorn Vale (rebel camp stuff)
---
Dustwallow Marsh
---
Swamp of Sorrows
---
Especially the elite quests give lots of rep (don’t miss Morganth)! Very important also to do these dungeons:
---
Deadmines
---
Stockades
---
Scarlet Monastary also has a good rep q. 
---
99,99% of people who buy gold are never hacked. That's why there's a market for it. You don't fuck over your customers, everyone knows that. The people who lose accounts are not the ones that buy gold.
---
Using tokens mean that the gold moves between players and isn't artificially created by using an army of bots. Casuals can only get easy gold if someone is willing to sell it for a token. I also fail to see how you think casuals getting gold is a worse scenario than spammy farming bots taking up farming spots and server real estate. 
---
Interner security have inproved 100 times. Its history and not current for a reason.
---
If they were interested in vanilla they would recruit someone who actually knew something about the game though..
---
They are just about publicity, method is a company at this point.
---
They always have, and gold selling has always been a problem. Again, it's like saying "police should actively arrest people buying and selling drugs". Doesn't really fix the issue, does it? 
---
Looks like anyone that ganks anyone on a PvP server will get a ban with this shit system. 
---
All it takes is for one person to tell their friends to report you and you'll be looking at disconnected from server message. 
---
Hahaha jesus you're actually insane. Did you get scammed by a nigerian prince and now you want to police everyone else because you're too fucking dumb to stop yourself from falling for this shit? You're like the idiots who want to prohibit encryption on the internet in the name of preventing "illegal activity". Just scream bloody murder about how everyone who disagrees with you is a sociopath because you have no real ground to stand on.
---
&gt; Interner security have inproved 100 times.
---
You literally didn't read what I linked, which is how the WoW Token killed the multi-million dollar Chinese gold farming industry—which has nothing to do with “Interner security” and everything to do with fraud.
---
Read that first, then reply.
---
I will get downvoted for this but unless they are willing to throw out permanent bans for both buys and sellers without prejudice, the token is the better option.
---
Shares many of the same qualities with the war on drugs. Legalizing and regulating is always better than letting a black market run wild.
---
I too link random bloggers' theories as "proof" to make myself look smart even though it inevitably just highlights how stupid I am.
---
Not true. Look literally anywhere in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sj21TAmQ-M).
---
You appreciate him milking the scene for youtube money you mean
---
imagine actually thinking tips does this for the community LOL
---
Honestly it adds up over time absolutely. I highly recommend. That you spend a level here and there just strait up farming. You'll have zero issues with gold.
---
The very fact that Blizzard did not reply to this open letter just shows how far they've drifted away from their community...
---
agreed. Esfand doesn't know that much and literally just uses Classic for self-promotion and profit. 
---
Blizzard just need to put in very harsh penalties for false reporting. Like month long bans.
---
I think that statistic is bullshit.
---
Moved from players from any server to any server (Region wide.)    Sounds like that fucks a servers economy somewhere.  
---
There is a top post on WoW reddit right now talking about the annoying spam.  It's not gone. That point is moot.   
---
yup, but other classes got more. cos rogues don't have downrank spells, which sets them back in comparison. 
---
in pvp all classes in vanilla got a ton of buttons. but in comparison its less. 
---
I played rogue in pvp quite extensively.
---
Honestly, if you grind a few levels every here and then you will have more than enough cash for your spells and mount at 40.
---
Yes it's a PIA, but well worth it
---
Wow tokens also killed the possibility of progression true gold without becoming pay to win.
---
Vanilla was good because of it. Tokens would kill it.
---
It all makes sense now. Your assertion in another comment that I am an unempathetic sociopath is projection.
---
Most people understand that absolutes are either exaggerations, or a statement of opinion. In this case in particular, you are latching on to my use of the word "every" as a quick 'gotcha!', while quote mining to omit the apparent context with which it is referring to: Mass reports directly leading to bans.
---
Name changes should not be automated, but squelches are in a good place being automated, but subject to review, due to the subjectivity of chat infringements, and that abuses of the report system are likely a small fraction of total flagged incidents. The crux of the issue is the disconnect. This is likely a technical issue, but it should be at the top of Blizzard's fix-it list. It is essentially a DDOS.
---
**However.** In the course of your quote-snipping crusade, you ignore the key phrase of my post: Mass-report *bans* are not over turned. Yes, there are over turned bans. I linked one, but it was not the result of mass reports. Your links do not contradict this, because we are pushing two separate issues. You; Gameplay disruption due to disconnects. Me; Idiots getting rightfully banned for being idiots and cheaters and blaming the report system.
---
What's that? Is that... Empathy and understanding someone else's argument? No no, according to you, I can't do that.
---
There is fault in my previous arguments, because to all appearances, this was yet another thread appealing to the bans of the poor player who was unfairly banned, woe is me. On the issue of automated squelching disconnecting a player, that *is* an issue, one which the post of mine you've quoted from was *not* referring to.
---
I'm excited to see whether or not you're capable of admitting when you're wrong too, and/or how you manage to misrepresent and take my points out of context this time.
---
Maybe they chose him because he has an established fan base and not for his knowledge?? 
---
&gt; Hahaha jesus you're actually insane.
---
I don't care about buying gold myself—but I understand [the gold farming problem](http://meminsf.silverstringmedia.com/labour/a-history-of-world-of-warcrafts-gold-economy/), and I'm also a rational, compassionate person.
---
That's how I'm able to see how important of a security measure it is to have a legitimate way to RMT in an MMO.
---
Gold farmers prey on naive, handicapped, or younger players. There is a huge population of players at risk for having their (or their guardians') identities stolen, credit cards hacked, or bank accounts emptied.
---
Not to mention the ethical implications of refusing to implement a solution to [an industry](https://venturebeat.com/2011/07/22/the-china-conundrum-the-rise-of-gold-farming/) that oftentimes relied on slave-labor.
---
But hey, I get that you're a little Johnny Law over there, who hates *Acti-Blizzard* 99% of the time for being “a sleazy company,” but will hypocritically defend them when it comes to bringing back a multi-million dollar, exploitative industry, all because *muh nostalgia.*
---
That makes you as sleazy and slimey a person as you personify Blizzard as being.
---
How about the ethical implications of a huge corporation making off with buckets of their customers' money that they "earn" by damaging the quality of their own product while hiding behind the Orwellian cliche "It's for your own safety"?
---
And *please* keep repeating things from your earlier posts as if you didn't post them, pretending it's an original thought that just occurred to you. It's a wonderful performance.
---
The freedom is what made vanilla great.
---
The SJW cuck snowflakes who get offended by everything have caused this. 
---
Thanks, Kikes. 
---
K.
---
Would upvote twice if I could for the effort. 
---
no
---
But is streaming your playing session on private servers not allowed by Twitch or something? Morals aside, why would it matter whether he's playing retail or private?
---
Dude, cmon. If you like fucking feral druid, level as one, do dungeons as one and do PvP as one. Try to get into raiding as one but if they say they don't want one, be fine with being a healer in raiding. Playing does **NOT** mean just raiding!
---
Thank you, icarebot. I care about *you!*
---
I worked with a John Taylor, dude was a creepy jerk.
---
RMT will be there regardless of what Blizzard does. There is only one type of MMO where there is no RMT: where there is no real value behind the tradeable currency (gold).
---
If you can buy gear and important consumables, not to mention skill training and mounts for gold, you have to farm gold. Gold earning becomes part of the progression. This creates a demand for gold farming and you can never, ever, curb down the supply when there is demand.
---
Since vanilla relies heavily on gold to progress, RMT will be there. Question is, will there be more if its official, or will it be the same amount, just better regulated?
---
The only one preying on the naive here is you, trying to make this very simple issue about A VIDEO GAME into a matter of _human rights_ and similar virtue signaling. 
---
Your type of people aims to polarize every single discussion with misinformation and a focus on demonising any opposing viewpoints by making vile, hyperbolic, and even straight up untruthful statements about them as a person, because you lack the ability to argue against the actual view they present.
---
You're a genuinely disgusting human being.
---
Whoa everyone! We got a badass over here!
---
Can you explain to me what the writer got wrong? Do you have any sources to back it up? What are you in disagreement with the author?
---
All your comment shows me is that you're triggered as fuck, my dude.
---
This is rich coming from Tips, [who was abusing it himself during the demo](https://streamable.com/4vtik). 
---
I don't get what people see in his clickbait videos where he discusses nothing new for just over ten minutes. Even his so called 'analysis' or 'ranking' videos is only him is reading off the screen. He doesn't even provide any sources what so ever, which is not only dick move, it also doesn't help with his credibility.
---
For that matter, why doesn't his spam violate the [self-promotion rules?](https://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) He won't even participate in this community other than dump his videos here and occasionally comment on them.
---
Druids get block in bear form.
---
Well, the hunter needs to be invited to the raid in the first place.
---
I was aware of this when building it - hopefully this will raise awareness of where the differences are actually pertinent and where it doesn’t really matter at all.
---
It's literally some dude's opinion, and he even clearly presents it as such. You cannot use _opinion_ to "disprove" someone. Nor can you ask for "sources" to "disprove" someone's _opinion_. You're reaching mind-bending levels of stupid, my dude.
---
Thanks for observations 2 and 3, will make changes.
---
this english gave me cancer
---
Yikes
---
&gt; that they "earn" by damaging the quality of their own product
---
Ever since WoW's launch [the playerbase has begged for those same changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/akuu1b/today_i_resubbed_to_retail/ef86841/) that you seem to think *damaged* the quality of their product. So don't be hypocritical.
---
&gt; And please keep repeating things from your earlier posts as if you didn't post them, pretending it's an original thought that just occurred to you. It's a wonderful performance.
---
Hey, it's not my fault r/classicwow is full of NPCs who keep repeating the same, stupid, fifteen year-old irrational crying over the effectiveness of legitimate RMT.
---
So far no one has given me a good, or new, counter-argument that doesn't ultimately necesitate being a piece of shit human being to believe.
---
stranglethorn will definately be bad, even at lower server populations. arathi maybe too, not too sure about the other zones for now, depends how fast people will level, and the realm size etc.
---
What is shv?
---
Isn't the problem that you can't stream gameplay that is not live for an extended period? I can see how he got banned even though I don't agree with it either.
---
&gt; ... and similar virtue signaling... Your type of people aims to polarize every single discussion... making vile, hyperbolic, and even straight up untruthful statements... You're a genuinely disgusting human being. 
---
Lol, found the r/FragileWhiteRedditor!
---
Think you could dump your macros somewhere so that we can pick them apart and use them? I've been tinkering with some on different classes with varying results.
---
"an established fan base"? you mean the 300 or so viewers that turn up whenever Asmongold is offline? 
---
"Hey guys, I have never raided in vanilla or retail but listen to me talk about the differences between them for hardcore progression raiding. Also please sign up for my patreon."
---
I may have to try this for the lols
---
Can you show me sources that disprove the writer's takes on the history of gold in WoW?
---
Cuz I just see you pivoting the fuck out of any real conversation, damn dude.
---
False. Reports. Will. Get. You. Banned. 
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
Alexensual must be on a furious rampage because of this. 
---
Are you dense? The writer doesn't have sources, thus there is nothing to disprove. His _opinion_ without insider information from Blizzard is worth as much as mine or yours. That is to say, nothing at all.
---
"He is wrong".
---
There's my "source" using the same standards you use.
---
You forgot the hunter roll of 100.
---
Yes this works in Classic, it uses the modern macro system 
---
Nice tool thanks !
---
However it seems you put the same stats for the paladin and the priest. You need to correct the paladin I think (since I doubt paladins have 35 str at lvl 60).
---
Ik hardcore progression guilds will always exist, but Method is more of a company than a band of players having their own fun. I think Esfand made a bad choice if he just wants to have fun. Besides, he is always playing ret, and thats a no-no if they want to do world firsts.
---
Try to win a roll when there are 3 people rolling vs there are 10 rolling.
---
But I care about this the least to be honest. I don't like to pug 5-mans, let alone raids.
---
Your discord link doesn't work on my phone. When I click it, it says you invited me to a group. It then goes to an error splash page. 
---
Guess i'm not playing then. Fuck this easily offensive generation.   
---
How do you deal with life if you managed to get offended by online content? ignore and move on with your life.  
---
not make pointless abusive systems that have no real purpose except to protect your fragile integrity.  
---
Goddamn do i fucking hate the 21st fucking century. 
---
I went for a more reasonable pre-bis since I'm not sure how easy it will be to get Ironfoe; drop% difference, or maybe impossibility of not taking damage while lavajumping due to new client. Also didn't include Ironfoe because I'm not sure how good it actually will be. If it's 1ppm, like people expect, then it'll be pre-bis and then some, competing with early raid weapons when world buffed. Any more than that and it becomes too good to not get and any less and it becomes a meme/flex item.
---
Lets read an actual interview with a Chinese gold-farmer circa 2015, around the release of the WoW Token. 
---
[World of Warcraft and the battle against black market gold: Is the WOW Token working?](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-29-world-of-warcraft-and-the-battle-against-black-market-gold)
---
&gt; The gold-sellers are putting a brave face on it. After days of unanswered emails, I eventually get to speak to someone from SSE-Games in China - after I convince him I don't work for Blizzard, that is. Alex (probably not his real name), acknowledges that the Token has had "lots of effect on business" and that SSE will earn less money now. This is a company of around 60 people and WOW accounts for half of its business. It's not even one of the bigger companies in China, where he believes most of the gold-selling business to be located. "There are hundreds or thousands of companies like us," he says.
---
To reiterate what the author said (and my entire point in this thread): Whether you like it or not, the WoW Token has been one of the most effective solutions [to reduce the size and power of the black market gold-farming industry.](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2228-im-paid-to-play-mmorpgs-its-nightmare-5-realities.html) This is from another interview with a gold farmer in 2016:
---
&gt; “Jeremy thinks he has only a few years left in his job, and here's the big reason:
---
&gt;[Image of WoW Token]
---
&gt; If you're a player looking to buy your way to better gear in WOW, you can buy a $20 token that can then be traded in an in-game auction house for gold. The purchaser of the token can't redeem it for cash—they can use it only toward free months of their game subscription (to prevent farming).
---
&gt; Jeremy says the decision caused a panic among the gold farming community. And although the demand for black market gold still exists, Jeremy has seen his income fall, despite putting more hours in this year than last.”
---
Here's an article in Eurogamer that illustrates how [we finally understood how to responsibly manage black market gold farming](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-29-world-of-warcraft-and-the-battle-against-black-market-gold) in 2015.
---
You can keep Googling. The WoW Token has been a resounding success is ending the exploitative, harmful, Chinese black market gold farming cabals despite the fact that you really, *really* don't want to accept the truth.
---
&gt;Aimed shot
---
Try leveling as BM spec instead, you owe it to yourself to experience how fun and fast it is.
---
Just saying but, wouldn't something like
---
1) disable report function inside BGs
---
2) disable report function inside dungeons
---
fix everything?
---
Even in vanilla when a ton of people only ever ended up partially leveling a character people acknowledged that raiding was the main important 'thing'. From the start of the game up until today, not being useful raiding is the common way of determining whether a spec is viable or not.     
---
     
---
I loved vanilla, but the fact that most specs were nowhere near as good as in TBC was its biggest flaw by a long margin.
---
I've been aware for some time now that the definition of "hypocrite" is "someone who said something that does not apply in every conceivable scenario", so you're right.
---
&gt;Hey, it's not my fault r/classicwow is full of NPCs
---
It literally is, because you're one of them. "Haha I'm farming takes" is a nonsensical catchphrase that you've used at least twice in this thread. There's no other explanation than repetitive NPC behavior.
---
Robes are trash, weapon is ok, but class quests at 50 "should not be available" till BWL era. So well into the game. 
---
Those Quests were introduced after BWL. And we have no idea if they're going to be in game from the start.  
---
As to your question: The Staff looks cool, however its easily replaceable. The trinket is widely accepted as the best reward since its unique and you'll be using it for the longest time, even in TBC if we get that.
---
Still my all time fave
---
Sure I mean I don't care that much I was posing it as a question and my own opinion. 
---
Showtooltip is one of the greatest additions ever made to WoW.  
---
So then what's the issue? Ban players that violate the rules, same as botting or hacking.
---
The trinket is unique but not very useful. Id still pick it though since you can replace the other two items. 
---
You didn't answer my question:
---
Do you believe that people who seek gold from third-party companies deserve to get their identities stolen, credit cards hacked, or bank accounts emptied by these third-party companies?
---
This is why tanks never run dungeons with other warriors. They get instant invites anyways. And when you have a warrior that doesn´t want to tank your group is doomed to find a druid. 
---
And heroic strike
---
Some asshole cheats in the game and gets dicked by hackers, but I'm the POS for simply not giving a damn? Ok bro. Ok.
---
You will be running up until lvl 40 where youll get your mount if youre lucky, few people get their moount at lvl 40 if they dont have a 60 already. So killing a mob in your path wont slow you down that much. 
---
I mean the world didn't end last time.
---
Noticed that too but saw night elf paladin which I don’t think is a thing. 
---
Nice tool! 
---
Yes it can. Blizzard own the rights and do not permit Pserver footage to be broadcasted. They could if they so wish, request removal of all Pserver footage at anytime (They just haven't done so yet, and hopefully wont).
---
orc lots of strenght me like
---
So with what reason Twitch banned him? Some twitch staff thought he is streaming pserver? Even tho i seen staff in his chat when he started streaming his original vanilla gameplay footage, so i don't really understand. Later there were even chat commands and descriptions telling you that it's original WoW footage, not private server...
---
very hard to solo that one
---
Yeah, you are. I hope you're man enough to at least admit it.
---
To not do something about it is irresponsible on part of the company who manages the community—and players who let this slide because *muh nostalgia* or because *they deserved real life harm for cheating in a videogame* are complicit.
---
big problem if they keep it like that
---
He didn't stream it tho..., and that's what would be againts Twitch ToS.
---
sick ui
---
every shaman dreams of being a paladin
---
His Twitter to stay up to date on this: [https://twitter.com/furiouspaul\_](https://twitter.com/furiouspaul_)
---
tldr; dont stand in the fire
---
Seems to be an issue at your end since we tested it ourselves and also some new guys joined minutes ago.
---
That is faerie fire (feral), which I will get
---
&gt; I'm excited to see whether or not you're capable of admitting when you're wrong too, and/or how you manage to misrepresent and take my points out of context this time.
---
this is funny because :unempathetic sociopath is a person with a psychopathic personality whose behavior is antisocial, often criminal, and who lacks a sense of moral responsibility or social conscience.
---
**However** i was pointing to a delay in development as in:
---
 * a genetic defect such as [down syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome)
---
 * [fetal alcohol syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder)
---
 * [fragile x syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome)
---
i have never called you sociopath or suggest you are one.
---
**also** don't try to push the subject into your corner. the subject has to stay in the middle of the room right between us.
---
the gameplay disruption due to disconnects is a consequence. the real issues is that actiblizz agreed to such rule that is damaging to its customers just to make more money. this is on par with sharding, loot trading etc, all about cost cutting.  this game was fine for *a decade* before this rule was implemented. this game had its greatest success when this type of policy was nowhere in sight but when it was more focused on the social factor. but the social factor, the massive multiplayer coming together factor is expensive.
---
so someone from the top decided that the game is too strong to fail and we can just milk it now. so were switching the "care for the customer" mode from "plentiful" to "survival". whatever breaks we will try to fix it PR, astroturfing, influencers. we have the money now shitheads, we can play you!
---
 "- but some players will be disappointed and vocal about this or even leave.
---
 - yeah, fuck them, as long as pavlov's reflex is still a thing were gonna be cashing in"
---
tldr: i think actiblizz is on a wrong path and will continue to alienate its player base with rules like this and its crave for money. the kids will take whatever they can get, they can not be picky because they have no memory of what vanilla was. the veterans on the other hand are not that easy to push around.
---
**Down syndrome**
---
Down syndrome (DS or DNS), also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is typically associated with physical growth delays, mild to moderate intellectual disability, and characteristic facial features. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.The parents of the affected individual are typically genetically normal. The probability increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45.
---
**Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder**
---
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing. Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol or other drugs. The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
---
**Fragile X syndrome**
---
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder. Symptoms often include mild to moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ in males is under 55. Physical features may include a long and narrow face, large ears, flexible fingers, and large testicles.

Yeah, in caster form you better spend your gcd on moonfire in pve, or heal / roots in pvp. Fair enough.

If he's got a pulse and knows to use tranq shot at the right time, he'll get a spot :P
---
I cant wait for the meta to shift to the point where you bring so few healers that the best paladin you can bring is ret.
---
except calling the police has fuck all to do with classic lol
---
No changes.
---
Isn’t there some sort of rule, that you have to actually play live content, at some point or at least for some hours ever now and then? Dude’s been back to back streaming recorded footage for some time,  I could are why s mostly livestreaming platform would have rules encouraging their broadcasters to create actual content live, and not run pre-recorded stuff all the time.
---
This needs to go, the sad thing is they already mentioned they don't want to manage to many tickets manually and that's why they want to use loot-trading. I guess this exists because of the same reason. I just hope they realize how bad it is for a game like classic.
---
Lol I agree with OPs concern, but ooh boy this topic sure did bring out the incels.  Whatever will you guys possibly do if you can't call someone a "retard" without fear of consequences?  You poor oppressed snowflakes.

Now to be clear, I'm no stranger to raging in-game.  Honestly, I'm shocked I haven't been suspended from Overwatch yet - there's been more than a few times where I fully expected to log in the next day and discover I had been suspended.  But fortunately it hasn't happened yet.  But you know what, if one day I find out that I've been banned because of raging the prior day, you know the only person I have to blame?  It's not Blizzard.  And it's not the person that reported me.  It's me.  Only me.  You don't wanna be suspended for acting like an asshole, then don't be an asshole.
---
But that's not what this thread was supposed to be about anyway.  Y'all took it over with your little anti-SJW mission.  The point of this thread was supposed to be about people abusing the report system to flag people that aren't in violation of anything.  And *that* is a genuine problem.
---
so whats considered a false report though, like if you report someone cause they where making jokes about politics, or camping you in STV, or ganking people in redridge, are these considered false reports. Isnt that like a super slippery slope
---
At that point you just bring another warrior instead of a pally buff.
---
Yes, in the same way that people who fall for "sexy singles in your area" adverts get their money stolen. Sorry, not stolen. Because they willingly give their credit card details to them.
---
* Dodging can be prevented by fx. giving deserter from leaving queue
---
* Premades will farm pugs yes, will pugs lose interest? unlikely.
---
* Unlikely that there will be premades to waste time. Never happened on pservers or retail
---
* Why can alliance afford flask and other consumes? wtf?!?
---
* rerolling to dead server would mean unlikely chances of even having a br1 required for r14
---
6. Vanilla ranking, or well pretty much everything in vanilla is about TIME INVESTMENT, not skill. Skill helps makes things faster but ultimately TIME is the real requirement. This goes for leveling, raiding and ranking.
---
* There's many reasons to continue playing the game, you need to seriously no life this game in order to be able to raidlog. But having r14 players raidlog isn't rly a big deal as they make up a very small part of the server.
---
how your shit idea works:
---
* So you want a rating version? completley throwing out all the time investment? World pvp? etc. from the game?
---
* Who gives a shit
---
* So you want TBC/wrath pvp system? Go play wrath/tbc
---
* You can have premade tournaments without this retarded idea. Just use a tournament server with people transfering their toons over. Obviously you would have to do invite only or similar to find teams, there won't be a ladder to pick the top X from. 
---
When I first started playing we had dial up. Every time someone called I got disconnected. It was super frustrating especially when I was in a dungeon with other people. I would beg my parents to get off the phone and hope my group didn't ditch me when I got back on. Those days are long gone now baby! 
---
Most likely he will be just a streamer for them even if they go for hardcore progression. I mean he's quite popular and should get good views once classic goes live, not a bad move by method to get into the classic community.
---
There you go, actual sources! Still missing the point slightly though and I will explain why:
---
Even though the exact impact is inherently difficult to quantify, there's definitely no denying that the WoW token impedes on gold sellers ability to sell gold. 
---
Whereas this has been "worth it" for retail is easy: Yes! It has very few downsides in retail, a game where gold is used purely for cosmetic purposes. Retail even has level boosts, bringing you right into the action. That's fine for a game like retail where your actions prior to max level are really mostly just a distraction.
---
However, in classic, gold is not cosmetic. Gold is _power._ There is BoE gear that is BiS until Naxxramas, very powerful consumables, expensive mount skill with significant impact in PvP, reputation reagents which lets you get better gear, buffs, enchants, and recipes, and much more. Vanilla really rewarded you for grinding. Simply spending money to bypass this defeats the very spirit of the game. In vanilla, this would actually be pay2win (or at least pay for power, though the terms are mostly used interchangably).
---
Ontop of that it means a lot of people who would normally just farm what they needed, now have an incentive to farm _more_. This leads to inflation and an in general fucked up economy. People who do not purchase gold fall behind in progression. Classes that cannot reliably farm gold will have little recourse but to buy gold if they want to afford to raid. It's already not cheap!
---
Furthermore, gold sellers didn't stop. They changed focus, forced cut prices to stay competitive, but had to compensate for their prices being cut. The spammers you see on retail today are not using their own accounts. They are using hacked accounts (usually obtained under the guise of "selling boosts" instead of selling gold), gametime purchased using stolen credit cards, and selling assets that they stole.
---
All in all, it's just substituting one problem for another. And where do you draw the line? Retail has purchasable level boosts. Goldsellers didn't and don't just sell gold, they also sell level services. So should we add a purchasable level boost too? $60 for level 60? Just because it can be hard to combat does not mean we should legitimize it. More awareness surrounding the risks of being scammed, and stronger push for 2FA to prevent account theft may do just as much, without impacting the game.
---
I think Warlock has the most spells if u actually want everything on the bars.
---
A false report is people reporting you even if you did nothing wrong. This will cause the reporters to receive a punishment instead and if they don't fix their shit they'll be permanently banned. It's the same system across all of Blizzards games, if you abuse the system to grief people you better be prepared to face severe punishment.
---
In a game like Overwatch it's not as big of a deal, you can just buy a new account and be back on track within a day. In a game like Classic where you pay a monthly sub and spend hundreds of hours progressing your character a permanent ban is pretty much game over and A LOT of money down the toilet.
---
BGs before? Very very bad. They were horrible BGs. The worst BGs in the history of BGs ever.
---
I can make them better. My solution will make BGs the best BGs in the world and i will make Activision-Blizzard pay for it. We will win bigly!
---
Can it get you in trouble with blizzard? sure! Should youtube footage get you in trouble with twitch? no!
---
I thought they meant can pserver footage on yt get you banned from twitch.
---
imagine thinking youtube pays shit when you have less than 30k subs
---
If you really find it boring you don't *have* to but it does make leveling smoother, you will find yourself having to continent hop less to get more quests.
---
if that's true i suppose it's fine then. I just have always known that automated report systems tend to devolve communities a bit.
---
Here's hoping they can recreate this in the new engine. The lighting has already proven to be a challenge...
---
the weather effects are non-functional last we saw...
---
here's hoping the devs put in the time needed to recreate these awesome atmospheric effects in Classic.
---
Some consumes are off the GCD as well, while others are on it.
---
it should be right click ignore and that's it. nobody should be getting banned for anything in the game aside from racism and homophobia etc.
---
politics and trolling should be allowed. 
---
Wrong answer. It's not a matter of whether or not Activision Blizzard will "allow" it, it's a matter of automated ban systems being triggered by mass reports.
---
Even if a world PvPer gets mass reported, appeals, and an Activision Blizzard CS employee sends a copy-paste response and removes the ban after anywhere between 15 minutes and 2 hours,
---
we've already lost something in that scenario. wpvp is already tainted with the possibility of mass reporting.
---
He technically was breaking the rules though. They had a rule that you could only play one faction on PVP servers, and he clearly was breaking that in bad faith.
---
As one of the class officers of the guild Progress said:
---
"Vanilla WoW is designed to make you hate the opposing faction."
---
The old Blizzard design and the new Activision Blizzard behavioral policing policy are totally incompatible.
---
Worst case scenario I go back to pservers or move to another MMO. 
---
I fear blizzard will hit pservers hard once classic gets out though :S
---
Arounr level 12-20 kills give you about 100xp and quests usually only give 1600-2000.
---
This comment gave me autism
---
According to you:
---
* World PvP exists only because of ranking.
---
* PvP is all about farming PuGs for 16h every day for 2 months straight. Investing time.
---
* System that increases player pool and forces you to play against opponents with equal gear and skill level is bad.  
---
How bitter do you have to be to report someone for playing a game...
---
Blizzard, obviously. 
---
Not OP but he is referring to using a slow 2h and kiting the mob back and forth with hamstring. That way you trade hits with it every 2-3 seconds. If the mob is a cat or other fast attacking type of mob this makes you take 1/2 or 1/3 the dog you normally would while still dishing out the same damage.
---
You're going to run out of quests at certain points and be stuck grinding mobs. This counters that.
---
Joana does it, so it must be good. He won many leveling competitions. It depends on your class, but with hunter its very easy to do so. 
---
You strike me as someone who genuinely believe that poor people *choose* to be poor and should just pick themselves up by their bootstraps.
---
Nice strawman you made there
---
\*heavy breathing intensifies\*
---
pretty much this  
---
This is Vanilla. If you don't like it - no problem - play TBC/Wrath.
---
Okay I see your point. Which raised another question:
---
Would it be possible for voidW to tank if we had another 3 dpses. To overwrite your statement of "OOM" before we kill? Or now the problem of threat is way more present even if he is decent tank pet.
---
Not sure if you know about voidwalker stats in comparisson with random warr or paladin we pick up with shield.
---
Yeah I guess, I like watching him sometimes, I just dont want it to shift into the usual boring method tryhard streams. I mean the wf races are exciting and all, but in my case, only for the player.
---
&gt; In vanilla, this would actually be pay2win
---
Yep, pretty much. I got flak for making this analogy, but I still think its apt: Somethings just can't be brought back safely. I'm not going back to an era without vaccines, for example.
---
[When I started making posts about the WoW Token](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a9qbj7/unpopular_opinion_not_implementing_the_wow_token/ecpoedz/) I tried to point out that:
---
&gt; ... it has never happened before that an old version of an MMORPG is brought back a decade and a half later. Retro re-releases happen, but to bring back an MMO is unheard of. This is the first time. I think players don't understand the ramifications and are only thinking of this as every other re-release of a “classic game.”
---
Vanilla was programmed without any knowledge of what was to come. It's a product of its time. But I'm interested in the long term health of Classic. At the end of the day, it would be the height of irresponsibility to not implement a solution that we know works in 2019.
---
&gt; Furthermore, gold sellers didn't stop. They changed focus, forced cut prices to stay competitive, but had to compensate for their prices being cut.
---
This argument is letting the perfect be the enemy of the good; by all measures, gold farming is over as an industry—except in the weakest, most *automated* sort of quick-buck victim-fishing.
---
&gt; Just because it can be hard to combat does not mean we should legitimize it.
---
Come on, this is backpedaling. The argument over how to combat this is over. The *only* solution to these services is to offer a safe, legitimate source of RMT.
---
&gt; More awareness surrounding the risks of being scammed, and stronger push for 2FA to prevent account theft may do just as much, without impacting the game.
---
If this worked, it would have worked over the ten years Blizzard tried this before finally giving in and implementing the WoW Token.
---
&gt; Where do you draw the line? Retail has purchasable level boosts. Goldsellers didn't and don't just sell gold, they also sell level services.
---
I haven't thought about this either. I mean, you're kinda right, haha. I know you don't want to hear this—and I don't like the thought of saying it—but at the end of the day, data and sociology and economics don't lie. Legalizing and regulating is always better than letting a black market run wild.
---
:(

[Buy this and you get partnered. I promise! Just make sure, twitch knows where you bought it..](https://www.amazon.de/plastikbr%C3%BCste/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aplastikbr%C3%BCste)
---
Expose fucking armor. I am never paying for that.
---
Not gonna happen on alli side, only at horde maybe. Pretty much only rshams have good aoe healing, and purely by numbers holy pallies are the best healers, but even utility wise they are unreplacable. And healing 40 people is hard to do.
---
This is a problem with automation, not a problem with right click to report.
---
Please refrain from further hypersenationalized click bait retarded nonsense.
---
He was actually streaming two days ago with webcam and all, talking with viewers then played some Warcraft III live. It's most definitely an automated ban or a low IQ mod that thought he was streaming private server content.
---
Are they going to sign on private server players? If Method actually wants to push world firsts in classic, they need to start signing NOPE players
---
Well now no matter how classic turns out esfand will have to play it even if ActiBlizzard destroys it with a cash shop and WoW token 
---
Improved WF gives 105 additional AP to every extra hit triggered by the totem. That's pretty much nothing.
---
There's a place for one enhancement shaman only if you're sorely lacking resto shamans. You need totems for 3 melee groups, 1 for tank group, and 1-2 for warlock group (s) - 5-6 shamans in total. If you can put together 5-6 resto shamans, the enhancement shaman's support will amount to whatever totems one of the restos can give to a group for which totems are not essential. That is, you will be essentially providing only 105AP on windfury hits for your melee group and a healing stream/mana spring for the healers.
---
&gt;That way this bullshit idea that everyone needs to be competing on meters can stop. Enhancement is a support class. 
---
You can't just say "I'm a support class, personal DPS doesn't matter" and be done with it. What matter is whether the exclusive support you provide increases the DPS of your party by enough to bridge the gap between your personal DPS and the personal DPS of others (minus the bonus you provided). 
---
Let's say four mainspec DPS players each do 800DPS. After you provide your buffs, they each do 850DPS. You do 200DPS. 200DPS+4x50DPS=400DPS=still garbage.
---
Truth, min/maxers will take racials into account rather than stats
---
Hmmm never thought of this. I guess you have a point, but there are always the European server that have different laws, maybe they can not be shut down. 
---
But let‘s hope Classic is what satisfies us :D
---
You’ll run out of quests and eventually have to stop to grind. At that point, you have travel time from mob to mob.
---
Travel time for a mob on your path is 0.
---
Less travel time is faster than more travel time 
---
K
---
That's true. But maybe if they destroys the game by changing the server sizes or removing cross realm BGs or shit like that he has a bail out policy in place. 
---
Great way to get xp and make money. I wouldn't say I kill EVERY mob because I play pally and it takes me 3 months to kill a mob half the time, but I do attack most mobs I come across, especially if they're within a couple levels of my current level. 
---
They better fix that s**t.. this I felt on a personal lvl for some reason
---
I felt SO BAD when I found out in Legion WHY they were protecting their candles.  There are monsters in their caves, hiding in shadows, and the candles protect them.
---
Gonna throw it out there that I've never seen any dal'rends weapons drop after over 50 runs of ubrs on all sorts of servers. Maybe just bad luck on my part. When I tried being a fury warrior I went with Krol Blade + Thrash Blade fwiw. (Alliance)
---
my workaround was to make a stance macro that could bind all stance combinations to the mouse wheel up and down depending on which stance you were starting on.
---
once you have the ability to change stances, and therefore stance bars, then you can just bind stance specific spells as you wish.
---
Ony kills him asap I thought. Bolvar is the one who kills the dragons. My pserver experience may be muddled though. I only had one 60 in vanilla so I don’t remember that one.
---
every class has way more key bindings in pvp, considering macros and such.
---
Didn’t cross realm bgs fix a lot of these problems after a certain patch? Considering we’re getting 1.12 patch wouldn’t that mean we have cross realm bgs too?
---
No shit . . . that's not even first world problems, that's 0.1% world problems. Go read a book or fuck your wife or something.
---
Agreed. It is 2019 after all. 
---
With that said though, a lot of developers that worked on vanilla have been on his podcast and told some cool stories and older design philosophies.
---
I've had this view on it since the start. Thinking that blizzard will deliver a game the players want after years of fail with all their games is ignorance. 
---
I have hope that blizzard will do well, but I am fully expecting failure.
---
So esports is coming to vanilla.
---
That's bad news.
---
I have a question because your post was pretty vague; what is he actually streaming? Strictly speaking from a ToS point of view, Twitch isn’t YouTube so you can’t just throw up old gameplay footage you have lying around.  And since Twitch wasn’t around during Vanilla WoW and he doesn’t play on private servers (which would also against ToS if he did) what exactly is he streaming? It’s not a rerun because he didn’t stream the gameplay on Twitch and he can’t go live and just play old gameplay footage because that’s not what Twitch is for. 
---
You’re right that it’s retail so I doubt they banned him stating the reason being that he was streaming private server gameplay. Most likely he was banned for going live and then just playing old footage which is a justified ban. 
---
The option was not in the release version, so... I leveled without instant text. 
---
Yes, you’re correct. He can’t use the Twitch platform to stream old gameplay footage from back when Twitch wasn’t even a thing yet. 
---
If you do a thing that can get your identity stolen, credit card hacked, or bank accout emptied because you are do I g something shady you do deserve it.  Dont take risks over a video game and dont blame others for your poor decisions.
---
Yes, Twitch is providing a platform for people to show their gameplay, and Blizzard doesn't like it when people show themselves playing a game that only exists on a pirate server. Essentially, Twitch becomes a partner in promoting piracy when people use their service like that.
---
I don't feel like it is that simple. I'm going to play this one way or another. If it is shit I will leave after a month or two but I will feel unhappy because I won't get the classic experience I'm hoping for. This is the best chance, maybe the only chance for many years to have this experience. If they fuck it up, we will all miss out on the content that we want and are willing to pay for.
---
Bit late for a party but if his server was PvP, he should be banned for sure.
---
Why?
---
Cause he is having characters on both factions, and this can be achieved only by having 2 accounts.
---
Now, you can debate all you want on "oh its different accounts" or whatever but WoW policy was set to disable chars on opposing factions for a INDIVIDUAL due to various things, like "Spying", "Gank revealing", "Baiting" etc. There is much more on why its set but yeah, only way he could be "somewhat" approved is if his friend was on that separate account "AngweSpy" but in that case instead of ban I would force a realm transfer for them as they are being obvious traitors as they are in direct contact with opposing faction.
---
If the server was PvE or RP it makes less sense to ban him as cross faction was enabled there, I think*? But on those there are different rules regarding PvP.
---
Anyway, camp and kill all you want, but spying your way to do so is well worth a ban.  
---
Even he was banned from Twitch for some reason, he can just move to another streaming service such as YouTube. As far as I know, Blizzard has not had any success getting people kicked off of YouTube. (Alex did this for a while.)
---
I imagine Blizz could tell Twitch to take it down since it is technically illegal use of their property and Twitch would comply.
---
Twitch probably has policies in place which allow them to take action on accounts streaming illegal behavior.
---
I could do without the insults, but I agree with the sentiment that long term-sustainable profits are possible in this game, and Activision need to decide if that is more important than quarterly spikes. Unfortunately, as a multinational company, I think they may have already decided on short term profits, because don't they always?
---
Hunters, since they level fast and also very strong in pvp early on. Mage is also nice because of sheep.
---
I agree, I think these story's of guilds targeting other guild leaders with targeted bans before raid night are total BS otherwise people would do it to the world first racers all the time. 
---
Most people on this sub: "Man, you know what i miss about vanilla? The Community! Full of nice people you had to interact with and make friends with."      
---
Also most people on this sub: "The Community is full of dicks who will steal my loot and then mass report me."        
---
Make up your minds people, just because it's easier to be a dick doesn't mean you have to be one.
---
Yet it is never used to disrupt mythic or limit during world first... I don't buy that it actually happens. 
---
Method is clearly very serious about Classic when the only member they have added is a Ret Paladin. Going for world first clearly.
---
That's the one!
---
This. How come players from Mythic and Limit havnt been hit with this during world first if it so "easy" to ban people. 
---
They are absolutely monitoring the subreddit, they would have a media reviewer on the payroll checking sources like Reddit and Facebook; all big companies check the social media reactions to their actions. 
---
However, I think that the decisions that govern changes will be based on predicted profits as a function of losing initial players vs. retaining ongoing players. Also, this subreddit shows pretty clearly that the community is divided on a lot of issues.
---
It's not a simple not to crack. P.s. High Jonathon from Blizzard.
---
That’s not what I said. I said, I think Twitch got some rules regarding how much non-live content you can stream as a ordinary streaming channel.
---
Dal'rends are tough to get unless you got a squad of reliable people with you so that you can reserve the swords. Sword of Zeal is a highly underrated main hand weapon, considering that it's much cheaper than Krol Blade (and probably as good if not better), then OH could be Mirah's Song from the scholomance chain quest - that dual wield rivals Dal'rends and is way easier to get.   
---
As for Brigam Girdle, like my original post states it depends on how Blizzard deals with itemization. Brigam Girdle got a significant upgrade in 1.10 (the catch-up dungeon loot patch), before that it's pretty mediocre. Also, I expect almost everyone will have Omokk's since it's just an LBRS quest run.
---
What if Blizzard let's you choose low/medium/high pop servers, with 2k, 4k and 8k playerlimit?
---
I tell you what would happen: Everybody would roll on the 8k Server, because this is where hell breaks loose and stories are made that everyone talks about (like on reddit). You would grudingly accept to not have quests and all lined up for you, because you know, this server won't die.
---
Which they clearly do since Mythic and Limit don't get hit with hate bans to ruin world first races. 
---
&gt; you do deserve it.
---
Not to mention the ethical implications of refusing to implement a solution to [a criminal industry](https://venturebeat.com/2011/07/22/the-china-conundrum-the-rise-of-gold-farming/) that oftentimes relied on slave-labor.
---
So I guess you're willing to admit you're a piece of shit human being to preferring this state of affairs over one that negatively impacts your momentary videogame fun?
---
During wotlk times I made a warlock alt and it was a lot of fun. The spells look really cool and I like how your this tanky spell caster that can summon demons. Only thing I’m worried about for vanilla though is lugging around soul stones and finding good spell power gear. 
---
Hahahah, nope, but you seem like a sweetie.  Actions have consequences.  We call this life.  Dont do something you have been specifically told not to do because it causes these problems and you'll be fine.  
---
He forgot you need at least a 5-10 minute twerking session half nude.
---
You'd think so.  Even if he was streaming live content a few days ago, there's no reason to stream content from 2006 unless you're trying to indoctrinate a few more subs/followers into your cult.  I don't know who this Johanna person is because guess what...back in 2006 Twitch didn't exist.  And aside from people who may have played with him on the same server, noone would care either.  
---
I'd go into this further but the TLDR of my comment is this: Stop deifying/idolizing streamers.  Someone rushing to 60...especially in a classic wow environment is missing the point of classic wow's purpose.  It's 100% purely a nostalgic game re-release.  Why would you rush through a nolstagia trip?  Even if you did, congrats.  Now wait for 4 other people of EQUAL skill/gear to reach your level range before you can even begin to do dungeons. +39 more people to raid.
---
Addendum: Not to mention but the mentality of rushing content, chewing it up and spitting it out is the whole reason we are in this situation in the first place.  People chewed up content, so they started making raids more accessible, easier, leveling easier so everyone could chew up content at the same rate, and then here we are multiple expansions later with a bunch of new mechanics and a lack of intimate gameplay.  Don't trivialize WoW Classic.  **Enjoy the ride,  stop and smell the Dreamfoil.**
---
RP Servers always had a negative stigma about them and I never understood why. It's just people enjoying the game - after 15 years of mindlessly chopping things, adding a little thought to WoW game play sounds like a good thing.
---
P servers are shit in my experience. I've got all my bets on official classic. If they ruin it I'll leave, but the p server emptiness and lack of proper mob behavior ruins those servers for me too. I just really hope this doesn't suck. I want it so bad. I would figuratively suck a dick for authentic classic that feels and plays right.
---
You strike me as the privileged kind of dude who thinks poor people *choose* to be poor and should just pick themselves up by their bootstraps, yeah?
---
&gt;but the p server emptiness
---
What do you mean?
---
Best money maker is mage with instance runs
---
With no info either way, it’s just as likely that he has old HDs full of alliance leveling from retail that isn’t published to perfect a guide vs. playing on pservers. 
---
&gt; Method is committed to support Esfand as a content creator. You will see many collaborations at upcoming conventions, at Method events and of course in WoW Classic which is scheduled for release this summer. 
---
I guess that makes sense, Esfand is a growing streamer and actively gets 600+ viewers now. The one thing is though.. I don't think he will stay very relevant post-classic launch, there will be sooo many larger streamers streaming the game that it will gradually dry up Esfand's channel IF he doesn't actively do collabs with Asmongold. I have nothing against him, it's just the truth.
---
I tried a few p servers and they were pretty devoid of players. I never found groups leveling and didn't encounter players in the world except in major cities. Maybe I was just in bad servers, but that was my experience.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.
---
Hard to tell at this point what Blizzard has in mind, but I hope that will be the case.
---
My (recent) experience is quite contrary to this. I play on a __highly__ populated one where every zone is filled with players.
---
US-Staghelm Heaven's Judgment
---
\#FreeJoana
---
How far do you trust them though? What if they need to extend/keep it because of reasons? 
---
He was streaming. He actively talks in chat along with the video pretty much every day while he works on his guides.
---
He right click reported a guy for tea bagging people ingame in bear form... i Don't know why it's relevant that he was in bear form but it makes it funnier 
---
sad but true
---
Why do so many people love Asmongold? Whenever I've watched him he seemed lika a bit of a douche. 
---
Well that's good to hear. If this official doesn't work out I'll pm you and get the advice on which ones to join.
---
I thought he got one Shotted? I haven’t done the quest in over ten years though. 
---
A random anything with a shield will have much better stats than a voidwalker. This is anecdotal for sure, but as I recall a voidwalker basically can't tank an elite mob witout requiring constant healing. It's also not great at managing aggro, and most obviously it's not a player that can take own decisions.
---
For deadmines, with 4 good DPS players, it's possible to go without a tank. Wether or not you have a voidwalker summoned is probably not going to matter much though.
---
It's still highest roll gets the item. No matter how many people "group up", it is still fundamentally a fair way to do it.
---
The question to me is going to be did a Blizzard Rep see this and send that to twitch. They seem to be on a crusade agaisnt private server people and may have seen it and just reported it instantly. 
---
Its sad we wont know but if that was the case i hope that person feels some shame over the fact they couldnt tell a recording in 720p over actual game play. I would guess they dont ... but maybe...
---
Cool downvote for asking a question about your extremely vague post. OK, so he was banned for streaming old gameplay that wasn't originally streamed on Twitch. That's your answer.
---
lmao imagine thinking your community event has any bearing on the ToS or that it's some sacred institution ingame that cannot be desecrated. streamers are truly a psychopathic bunch
---
Yes, that is what I'm agreeing with you on. He cannot stream non-live content as consider himself "live" even if he's in chat. Downvoted for agreeing with you. Fuck this sub is a bunch of children.
---
Haha wife. Ya right. 
---
Druid. Don’t listen to the haters
---
I never downvoted you but well done for being a dickweed. 👍
---
Mage/Hunter doesn't matter that much. Both are T1 Levelers (If you know how to AoE grind the Mage) And at top level you can make lot's of money with both classes. Just play what you like. 
---
Tank is Warrior of course. All the other classes are inferior tanks to the warrior especially at end game.
---
Healer I would go Druid,Shaman or Priest. They're more fun to level then Paladin, less gear depended so cheaper to run. 
---
Buy recipes from vendor and sell them. Sold many gnomish cloaking device in my day. Also crafted lots of Imperial Plate gear for some nice gold. Just look for raw mats and AH and see if you can sell for crafter items more. Some people will craft stuff for a little fee.
---
None of what you pointed out is ban worthy though.
---
Sure, kid. Stop running to Reddit to whine about your favorite streamer getting banned because he clearly broke ToS.
---
Blizzard may care, but that has nothing to do with Twitch TOS. 
---
It's illegal but nobody will come after you just like nobody will come after you running cracked Windows XP, LoL.
---
&gt;  Even if he was streaming live content a few days ago, there's no reason to stream content from 2006 unless you're trying to indoctrinate a few more subs/followers into your cult.  I don't know who this Johanna person is because guess what...back in 2006 Twitch didn't exist.  And aside from people who may have played with him on the same server, noone would care either.
---
Joana is definitely one of the more 'famous' WoW players from back then. I think a lot of people from back then know him by name, because of the guide(s) and probably a lot of people who don't, have still used his guide. 
---
&gt; I'd go into this further but the TLDR of my comment is this: Stop deifying/idolizing streamers. Someone rushing to 60...especially in a classic wow environment is missing the point of classic wow's purpose. It's 100% purely a nostalgic game re-release. Why would you rush through a nolstagia trip? Even if you did, congrats. Now wait for 4 other people of EQUAL skill/gear to reach your level range before you can even begin to do dungeons. +39 more people to raid. 
---
Not sure why you're mentioning these things in a thread like this.
---
You really can't tell what people to do, or talk like missing the point of what you think Classic is there for, is the wrong way to be playing the game. Dude obviously loves speedrunning, did it back in Vanilla and did it afterwards (attended AGDQ and had several world records in old games like Castlevania). To him, speedrunning a game is what he think is fun, and it also made him able to become rich off it, so running Vanilla content in the fastest way possible is his fun of playing the game. Then how exactly can you tell him and people praising his content, that it's not some 'right' way of playing the game? He's literally playing the same content we do when leveling, the only difference is that he's faster or we choose to take our time with it. 
---
Some people rush through the leveling process, because to them, the Nostalgia and/or fun isn't leveling or grinding levels. It's the content at 60 and the overall server community which happens already from level 1, but doesn't stop because you're 60. There's plenty of things to do at 60, even though you're the first. Plenty of consumables, reputation, quest items or ranking to be done. All different based on what patch the server is running on, but the point still stands. Even then, there's likeminded people leveling fast, so it's not like you're weeks ahead of everybody. There's usually full groups being made by max levels, 2-5 hours after the first guy dinged. This doesn't change no matter if Classic is launching on early patches or later ones, which determine XP and/or which quests are available.
---
&gt; Addendum: Not to mention but the mentality of rushing content, chewing it up and spitting it out is the whole reason we are in this situation in the first place. People chewed up content, so they started making raids more accessible, easier, leveling easier so everyone could chew up content at the same rate, and then here we are multiple expansions later with a bunch of new mechanics and a lack of intimate gameplay.
---
You really can't fault people for being efficient these days. Literally any somewhat popular competitive game will be theorycrafted, because that's exactly how most people play games these days, even casuals. Back then the 'media' we consumed were PvP/PvE videos barely explaining anything, because there were limited knowledge about mechanics and so forth, but also because the general 'meta' wasn't to min-max in almost anything you do. This is how it is these days, for most games. There's a reason why there's guides for about every game and character in that game, with dedicated websites in hosting these guides. 
---
&gt; Don't trivialize WoW Classic. **Enjoy the ride, stop and smell the Dreamfoil.** 
---
I don't agree at all. Enjoy the game, play it how you like it, as long as you follow the rules.
---
**&lt;Always East&gt;   |   Semi-Hardcore   |   PvP   |   Server Region: NA, but all are welcome!   |   Faction: Alliance**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"**  Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
\- We are players spanning throughout multiple expansions of Retail WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content.
---
\- We look forward to reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts.
---
\- Everyone earns their spot with us, regardless if you are a Raider, PvPer or Social.
---
\- Above all else, we strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"**
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever!  At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up.  Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but again - as stated above - we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people!  We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics.  Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week, with a floating third when/if needed; **Wednesday and Thursday** (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - **NOT** when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than **8:15PM EST**.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around **10:00PM EST** for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than **11:45PM EST**.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be **READY** to raid when the time comes.
---
**Reach out if you have questions!**  
---
We can be reached at  Parker#1571 or Tharkun#4460 on discord.  Or drop me a DM via Reddit.

---
I wrote my reply to you, because to me, it sounded like you were writing it sarcastically, because you simplified what I said into saying you couldn't do it all. I definitely do think you can stream non-live content without making it clear to everybody, I just don't think you can do it for a huge majority of the time, which is what I think he did.
---
I think people downvoted you because they thought you were sarcastic as well.
---
No, it's not. You are twice as likely to lose an item if twice as many people roll (not counting you) regardless of what number you personally roll.
---
If you can't do basic probability calculations we can't really argue this any further.
---
You are fucking dense 
---
Very enlightening!  Thank you!
---
You are really this dense?  How many people have to tell you that youre wrong before it sinks in?
---
Yeah guys don't rush to 60 or you will not have fun!!! Everyone slowly level the way I want and enjoy the game my way or you're wrong. 
---
Also totally unrelated but WTS devilsaur set 700g 
---
&gt; If you can't do basic probability calculations we can't really argue this any further.
---
You're an idiot. I stated my opinion that I always assume everybody is going to roll, so I don't care when everybody does roll.
---
I don't want to argue, because honestly, I don't even care that you exist. You are nothing to me. Kindly f@$% off.
---
exploration leveling on fresh is a meme and always will be.
---
He has been a huge douche recently. He did used to say some very real poignant hard-hitting stuff. Mcconnell keeps him up to date usually, because he's pretty basic otherwise. 
---
But in recent times, he, like other big streamers when they're growing.. he developed a god complex to the point where himself and many of his followers believe that Asmon's opinions are his and his alone, when what really happened, in actuality, was that people with those opinions came to Asmongold and Asmongold developed a personality to appeal to and profit from those people. 
---
Long story short and TL;DR. He seemed super real and genuine and straight-forward at first, but the reality is he's pretty fake and does what he does mostly for money, he promotes people like Esfand which, like him, only care about what profits and engagement they can generate promoting causes like Classic.
---
I doubt he even likes the idea of Classic WoW that much, in-fact, I remember clips specifically from before he got big stating that he didn't like the idea of Classic. 
---
I actually would rather see people have their credit cards hacked for actively trying to ruin something yah. It's kinda a catch 22. The people who discuss about it arn't really the ones who get hacked, because by the time you have the brains to discuss about it you realized you fucked up. I don't really see anyone being like "i was a victim" and anyone caring. I remember back then whenever i saw hacked accounts I didn't care because i knew why it was hacked. It's actually kinda worse for blizzard to sell gold because now that you make it a "legitimate" option, its now feeding off those same people your talking about except "acceptable"
---
Solid answer. Thanks! 
---
I know people are going to flame this gut but I have heard some former rank 14s call for these changes.  I believe a couple of podcasts back on Countdown for Classic this was discussed.
---
I dont think they will make these changes but I wouldnt be against it.  I dont think it would take anything away from the game.
---
Did this to my former GM on the second Sarth25 mount drop for guild. He wasn't thrilled. He made it known. Lol
---
&gt; The trinket is unique but not very useful.
---
Lol that trinket is used even in TBC.
---
I don't know how recently you tried killing Omokk but that boss is a pain in the ass and most people skip it unless already overgeared or with an excellent team composition from my experience.
---
I will never forgive the guild Hunter for taking my CVoS in BT. NEVER. lol
---
I noticed that too.  According to [this source](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Gnome_(playable)), Gnome Mages should have 15 STR, 23 AGI, 19 STA, 26 INT, 22 SPI.
---
Human Mage stats appear to be correct.
---
&gt; What I'm saying is that it's very situational 
---
That trinket is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than some silly loot you will quickly replace. Its unique and you will use that even in TBC.
---
Learn to switch between mouse and keyboard while grinding. Use auto run as much as possible. Don't keyboard turn, bind A and D to strafe. Cut down on unnecessary movement and key presses as much as possible. Make your binds as ergonomic as possible, with your most used keys on Q, E, 2, 3, R, F, and mouse buttons.
---
I think you might be a bit too invested
---
Hunter is fine for that. Mara at ~30g an hour, or trib runs for way more if you're good and don't mind speccing engineering.
---
&gt;most mods 
---
ftfy
---
In general, take the reward thay won't be replaced. Yeah the scythe is cool, but you'll replace it once you start raiding.
---
I mean unless you're doing rp server things I guess.
---
3 60s in classic wow with no xp modifier. Should have your 3rd 60 sometime in 2025
---
So this is the next outrage, eh? First it was Sharding, then lack of progressive itemization, last week it was Loot Sharing, and now it’s Right-Click Reporting. Who wants to take bets on next weeks outrage? I’m thinking... OG Armor-less Mounts.
---
People will argue about the timeframe for them, casuals will say they don’t have time to farm 1000 gold in 3 (or however many months), and then we’ll all get bored and move onto the next topic. People are really starting to go stir crazy here, Blizzard needs to release some more information before people start eating each other to gain their Classic experiences. 
---
It’s better to be useless than to be a dick
---
Omokk's girth restrainer is just the name of the item, you need to finish an LBRS quest run to get it - the quest being mandatory to finish on Horde since it starts your Ony attunement.
---
I bought a Tartarus, it has a directional stick at the left thumb that works as a second set of direction keys, using that I rarely need my mouse anymore except for looking around
---
&gt; real life harm
---
It's a hacked account you dingus.
---
If you go and watch and/or read interviews with Devs at the time, quests were really more of a push in the right direction. They brought you to areas where you were supposed to go and grind. Blizzard was actually surprised at the response to quests which is what led them to improve and redesign the system over the years. It's pretty well documented.
---
So basically since the design philosophy was to push you to new areas for you to grind in for awhile, it also follows that grinding along the way between these areas is an effective and efficient strategy.
---
So wait, crimes are legal if you just don't tell anyone?
---
Gonna sound like an absolute heathen for saying this, but click-to-move helps.
---
Auto run is also a lifesaver for those with their middle finger married to W key.
---
PoM+Pyro isn’t a good spec, but it’s a damn satisfying one. PoM + Poly is good more some “Oh Shit CC” as well.
---
But, hands down the most satisfying combo in the entire game has to be: Poly, Arcane Power, Hardcast Pyro, PoM, Pyro, Fireblast. It’s an absolute death sentence, usually. 
---
Classic is far from retail.
---
Realize this: WoW was build as a grind-game. Quests have been added at a later stage AFTER the first alpha tests because testers wanted "guidance" as to where to go and what to do.
---
With this in mind it becomes clear why you'd want to kill about everything you see (not to the extremes but you get the point). Experience is difficult to come by. It's quite easy early on but once you reach the late 20s / early 30s you'll notice that reaching the remainder of your levels is taking a bit of farming as some quests may not be acceptable.
---
Also: WoW Classic is NOT about the endgame. Rushing to 60 will remove so much fun from the game...
---
you are greatly underestimating the autism of classic wow players
---
Best "I gotta run to the bathroom" talent there is!
---
I watched him play super castlevania 4 like 12 hours a day for 3 years straight bro. The dude has put in more hours into speedrunning than you probably did at mcdonalds. I cant believe you would sit here and try to call him out like this when you have no clue who he is or what you are talking about.
---
You're NEVER really STUCK with grinding mobs. But grinding a couple of extra mobs here and there surely will save you some annoying travel time between the continents.
---
I didn't say he couldn't min-max.  Speedrunning isn't min-maxing. **Min-maxing is at it's heart**, about the **efficacy** of a build.  You want to be the best DPS'er in a raid.  You min-max your gear, the BiS items, enchants, food buffs, etc to try and improve the efficacy (or the desired result of being the best DPSer in a raid) to get the result you want.
---
**Speed-running is about efficiency**. I know it's hard to discern the difference between the two at a nescient level, but in reality that is the difference.
---
**Efficient is also vastly different than actually speed running.**  Speed-running is to efficient leveling as a proton accelerator is to a rocket engine.  They both are meant to accelerate things, but one is vastly better at doing so than the other.
---
Apparently through the downvotes on my previous post I hit a nerve with this thread.  Even though this is the "WoW classic" sub, not the "joanna speed running sub"; but moving on...  All I said was stop deifying streamers and to enjoy the ride.
---
 You're right and wrong though.  I can tell people what to do, they can choose to ignore it, or not listen to it. And that's fine, I don't care if you don't listen, or want to heed advice from me.  I don't take it personally in that regard, so why are you getting personal and vehemently defending this streamer as if they were your flesh and blood?
---
Based on your response, you're clearly a fanboy of this streamer.  Let me put it another way then:  Tom Brady has fans.  He has fans because he's trained his ENTIRE LIFE, put in LITERALLY blood, sweat, and tears into becoming a famous NFL quarterback.  I don't like people who deify/idolize celebrities or athletes any more than I like people who deify/idolize streamers.  However the difference is that athletes and *some* celebrities (like actors) put forth a ton of effort and train from a very young age to achieve their goals.  You'll never be able to convince me otherwise that this "joanna" person is on the same level. I could go into the reasons why, but that would take this thread from a somewhat friendly debate into a more hostile argument, so suffice to say we'll disagree there.
---
 [I will say this though, I enjoy how you glossed over my initial statement about him streaming old content from 2006, and proceeded to strawman the rest of my position/opinion without ever touching upon that little tidbit and also proceeded to list off things like ADGQ (whatever that is) and that he was world famous as valid reasons for him to stream old content?)](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority)
---
TLDR: I **never said** you couldn't rush through content.  **Stop using logical fallacies** based on your own person bias.  I just **encouraged the idea that MAYBE because you have the opportunity to play a fresh vanilla server in the near future, you might want to enjoy the ride**.  There's nothing wrong with being efficient, but perhaps it would be a more enjoyable experience to enjoy the re-release of WoW Classic instead of trying to be hyper efficient and emulate a "world famous" (sic) speedrunner.

Not 1.12
---
Go with the Staff.
---
Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't - know what I mean?
---
And if tomorrow the federal government came out and said "hey guys we made all drugs legal and you can even buy them at your local post office" it wouldn't really fix the issue either would it? 
---
My real concern is, how am I going to find a poop sock big enough to last me a month?
---
Ergonomics are extremely important for Vanilla WoW. You'll probably be playing a lot, for long periods of time, and doing the same repetitive motions.
---
Using auto run as much as possible (when appropriate) is a big factor. Pressing down left+right click or holding down W for long periods of time can really strain you.
---
Another big thing is general posture. This is even more important with MMO gaming. Be sure that your hands are in neutral position, back, neck, etc.
---
I use a large mouse that fits my large hands, and is wide. (Mionix Naos 7000)
---
I'm yet to find reasonably priced full featured "ergonomic" keyboards. Though experience, correct posture is most important.
---
Another big thing is to intelligently bind your skills.
---
Put your most used abilities in easy to reach placed. You don't want to be reaching for the 7 key very often, or putting your hand in awkward positions. Pay attention to how your hand moves during normal gameplay and alter your keybinds accordingly.
---
Take breaks. If you're on a flight path or on the boat, etc, instead of alt-tabbing, just get up, stretch your hands (you can look up hand stretches for office work or "for gamers"), and also get the blood flowing in your legs so you don't die from deep vein thrombosis (a legitimate risk).
---
There was an 'auto loot' feature in Vanilla which was also in the Classic client which consists of pressing a modifier key like shift and shift+clicking to loot everything on the mob you clicked. (no AoE loot thankfully)
---
You can use this to reduce your clicks. You might want to change the modifier to ctrl (since it's easier to press) if the client allows this. The fewer key presses and mouse clicks you perform the better. This is why macros and such are so important.
---
Some addons which existed for Vanilla (but may or may not be able to be recreated in the Legion client) really helped reduce repetitive clicking, like auto-quest turn in addons for rep quests, and auto selling addons which automatically sold all grey items, for instance.
---
You have a lot of options. As long as you're not ignoring it, you should be fine. Pain is a hard stop, it is a very bad idea to keep playing through pain. If you're getting pain then you have to think more about what you can do.
---
Tips your such a joke, you yourself has abused this system in the demo. And literally called the police on someone for indirectly saying "lmao" at you.
---
Cant blizzard contact twitch and have them take content down if it violates their TOS?
---
Heya, I'm the person that made the original post on r/wow; thank you so much for making a video on this and continuing the discussion. I plan on playing classic myself once it comes out and I get worried thinking about the future of classic if this report system goes unchanged.
---
&gt;that’s not what Twitch is for.
---
You can go live with anything you want on twitch. Theres thousands of channels that exist only to play vods. We see this across pop culture like the bob ross/pokemon/cooking shows. We see dedicated channels in not only respective games but genre of esports tournament replays.  Theres people literally just sitting smoking weed on twitch, brushing their teeth, eating, and just sitting with their tits out. Joana aka FuriousPaul has been at this game for many years, has many hours logged, and a reputation as a legend. Not that anyone needs to blink twice, but its sad that this shit even hit him, anyone whos ever watched his stream knows hes just a straightforward stand up dude.
---
If certain mods even on this subreddit are anything to go by, that is the most true statement around.
---
Nah, stopped watching him, been a while now. 
---
This sub is a bunch of children.  See that user a few posts up named "garyVonDuzen".  it's replies and hyper-fanboyism like that that makes gaming culture toxic.  The ironic thing is, 99% of the people fanboying over him will never even reach level 60 close to when he does, even though they probably will drool over his guides like it's the new edition of the king james bible. 
---
Oh well,  maybe one day the internet will just implode on itself due to some event, and we'll actually get regulation and accountability on this failing medium of communication, [until then we'll have to unfortunately deal with the hyper aggressive/caustic nature that anonymity and an audience breeds.](https://static.miraheze.org/allthetropeswiki/f/f1/Greaterdickwad_6440.jpg)
---
Exactly. The people actually stirring up these fears are the ones who will likely be banned for shitty behavior, while the ones parroting it were told to do so because their favorite streamer got a suspension because they were streaming and people are assholes. Do people get banned unjustly? More than likely. Is it an epidemic that affects everyone? No. 
---
It mainly affects toxic individuals that don’t like the fact that their actions can have consequences. Just /ignoring someone for shitty behavior isn’t a punishment, a suspension or a complete removal gets them out of the community and stops them from potentially ruining someone else’s experience and I applaud it.  
---
No one cares about raids or raid pugs. 
---
Loot trading will ruin dungeon runs all through the level from 1-60. 
---
Completely agree
---
AoE leveling is going to be nearly impossible for Classic launch and for quite a while after. Hunter will put you at 60 much faster. 
---
If your only goal is compiling a decent amount of gold to fund other characters as fast as possible roll Hunter and don’t level any professions until 60.
---
Not what I said at all.  Please take the time to read or don't bother responding.  Not being mean or derisive to you,  just stating something your mother probably told you: If you can't respond nicely, best not to say anything at all.
---
(read: dissenting opinions is not the same thing as being mean)
---
&gt; almost every mmo
---
Lol
---
&gt; there are very few cons to this
---
The system Blizz is parachuting into Classic is the Cata/wotlk system. Tons of cons. Was an absolute shitshow when that came out. Average player was screwed so often by duos of friends or triples. It honestly has lots of holes to it and imo the reaction here is justified
---
You responding to me? Because it sounds like we're on the same page mate. Unless you accidentally used a double negative?
---
&gt;  Someone rushing to 60...especially in a classic wow environment is missing the point of classic wow's purpose. 
---
You don't get to decide the point of an MMO for other people. 
---
No thanks, I suggest you start up a petition for Blizzard to bring back Cataclysm if you want to play ranked BG's. 
---
They stated why they’re doing it - they won’t have resources dedicated to support teams for classic. In other words not much cash for gms/support.
---
So they either have to say we won’t intervene in loot issues, or they will parachute the Cata/wotlk trade system into Classic.
---
The latter is a terrible decision. That system was so abused by groups of friends it’s gonna screw over the average player levelling from 1-60 every dungeon run
---
He should be
---
It absolutely is against terms of service, lol.
---
Well I agree with your overall concept which is that everyone is so formal now, and this then gives a feeling of not really being considered as a person. 
---
I don't  think schools prepare students to transition into a professional work environment, because they don't give you insight into things like how to create a proper CV. I'm thankful my school at least told me what a CV is, but otherwise, there are quite a few things glossed over.
---
However, employment methods continue to change because organizations want to be efficient. Which is reasonable, it's just it can become a grey area. You get a lot of jobs that require you to sign up to make an account, then run through a couple of very trivial and tedious online tests.
---
The benefit is you get candidates that really want the job, but I think the bottom line is there's this curtain of garbage.
---
I want to be able to walk into a place, ask to speak with the manager, and just ask if they would consider looking at my CV.
---
However, what with the state of the world, with a bunch of people that disregard other peoples lives and hurt others etc, there's worries about security.
---
Another thing is the lack of jobs.
---
Hey, it's not my fault r/classicwow is full of NPCs who keep repeating the same, stupid, fifteen year-old irrational cries over the effectiveness of legitimate RMT.
---
Are you dense?  At this point I have to assume you're trolling in which case the golden rule gloves are coming off.
---
I made a statement with my own opinion of what the point of Classic Wow's re-release is about.  You don't have to agree with it, but I'm not telling others they HAVE to level the same way I am.  I'm making a statement that MAYBE they are missing the point.
---
Seriously....are you THIS dense?  I'm not telling anyone they HAVE to speedrun, nor am I telling anyone they have to stop stare at each gravel of dirt on the new servers.  I'm just encouraging that you don't very often get a "2nd time" for games like this, so maybe it may be fun to enjoy the nostalgia instead of rushing to 60.
---
Jesus tap-dancing Christ.  Stop typing and fucking think for once in your god damn life.
---
this is why you DONT SAY THE N WORD!
---
&gt; you dingus.
---
Were you born yesterday? You literally know nothing about the topic, yet felt like making these NPC-tier comments.
---
Is he going to play Ret? 
---
If so, do you think there will be a bombardment of new Ret propaganda?
---
if it's still a thing, it's so incredibly small that it just doesnt matter at all. racials have a way bigger impact than ~10 or so  stat points
---
&gt; I actually would rather see people have their credit cards hacked for actively trying to ruin something yah.
---
Jesus fucking christ, you're a piece of shit sociopath monster.

C'mon. We both know he's fucking healing lmao

I agree, although it would be better to take out the automated part totally. Leave in right click report, but just make it ignore them and send the report to be looked over later. If they did something wrong they can get a mute/ban when it gets looked at by a human.
---
You are so upset lmao again tho
---
&gt; Someone rushing to 60...especially in a classic wow environment is missing the point of classic wow's purpose. 
---
Now stop being so grumpy
---
Not really. But do try to do some dungeons and skill proffession  up, that way you naturally have to kill some more mobs while you are at it and it doesnt feel that grindy as killing every stupid mob on you way to the next quest objective/giver. Unless you want to reach 60 asap ofc..... 
---
One of my fondest memories was reaching the Stonetalon Mountains for the first time and admiring how well place the moon was in the sky, bang in the middle of the valley.
---
I can’t wait to get back either!
---
If they screw it up, there will always be private servers.
---
They’re trying to claw back those lost players for profit. They know they have to deliver on this, so I’m not too worried.
---
Yet.
---
Horde, at level 45-50, there's a huge lack of quests, you will be grinding mobs. Same at 55-60, you will be grinding for those last levels.
---
You ignored the entire reasoning and just called me a sociopath, that's not really how arguing about something works so i don't think you have any place to have a opinion on the matter.
---
What reasoning did you give? You gave no reasoning other than “naive, handicapped, or younger players *deserve* having their (or their guardians') identities stolen, credit cards hacked, or bank accounts emptied.”
---
Why do they deserve it? Because your enjoyment of a videogame is more important than a safe community?
---
I can't respond to that. It's literally a sociopathic take. It's not a solution. It's sticking your head in the ground and hoping no one else notices the obvious problem.
---
It’s really good for early levels too as you can set pace to make sure you’re at certain levels by the time you hit certain points. Exp gained per mob is pretty good early on and time invested per mob is pretty low. 
---
I’d say killing as you progress quest objectives is efficient at every level for Hunter so long as you’re not over prioritizing it (keep moving towards the next point) and you’re not hitting mobs too low or too high compared to your level.
---
Ex: Orc/Troll hunters should kill all mobs en route at Valley of Trials but when you hit level 5 the level 1 Boars become pretty inefficient (~2 per 1% of the level). Level 2 Boars are like 1 more auto shot to kill and almost double the exp at that level.
---
Why need sqeulch when ignore is a feature? Why don't people talk about this.
---
What you described is either live footage or licensed media contracted to play on Twitch. This is not the same as some dude playing his 15 year old footage over and over again while he types in chat. 
---
You can play pre-recorded VODs as 'Reruns' on your channel that were previously live on Twitch but you cannot use it as if it were YouTube and just go live and show old footage. He could get away with this if a majority of his stream was actual live gameplay with this pre-recorded gameplay as filler once in a while but that is not what OP described. Hence why I asked for clarification what OP wrote to which OP was equally vague and decided to be a dick about it. Then the post gets downvoted because I didn't immediately and blindly take out my pitch fork and join the circlejerk. Honestly, out of all gaming subs this has to be the most childish and hiveminded sub out there.
---
No changes... Period... Vanilla WOW as Vanilla WOW was in 2004-2006... Play retail if you don’t like Vanilla...
---
Ret Bulls don't heal!
---
lol, yeah. platform going to shite real fast.
---
If it's a dead server who gives a shit about it's economy over the fact that it's dying....really your gameplay is just going down the drain if your server is in need of a merge.
---
That is true and I haven't thought about it.
---
I am more worried about the loot trading
---
Well, I also typed a whole bunch of other stuff like a community is defined by the limiting factors in which you set rules in something. This is why there are games like fortnite, and games like dota 2, and games like hearthstone. But you kinda ignored that and went straight to ignoring the single sentence hence you not having a valid opinion
---
A might or king on the whole raid will always be better dpswise than a warrior.
---
Right now, it's probably helping them market/build hype for Classic.
---
yo, I was Lothar alliance named Eromar. Night Elf warrior. 
---
Lothar Horde sucked lmao. You had like one good guild Tornado of Souls. We had Good Game, Underscore, The Bit Players, goes on and on.
---
See you on the battlefield my man.
---
The voidwalker can be useful but not be the primary tank.  You can kind of use it as a CC- let it take an add (not the focus target) and build up threat and get occasional heals.  Then once the VW's target becomes the group's focus, the VW has a massive threat lead and everyone can just nuke it down. 
---
The VW doesn't have enough abilities in its toolkit to maintain aggro with 4 DPS going after it's target.  It has no 'emergency' taunt- only the one that can be spammed but even then if you spam it constantly the VW will go out of mana in a fight with 2 elites or more.  
---
You would have to CC all mobs except for one, have VW on it and DPS focus, then focus the next one and maintain all the CC on all the mobs.  It would be kind of silly and slow, and the VW would still run out of mana unless you all intentionally sit there and wait for spirit tics. 
---
Making engineering the best profession for PvE as well, not just PvP.
---
That's true, but it does really depend on how much time you can invest. If you can take a week off work for example you could stay ahead of the curve which will make mobs much less contested. But I do agree that AoE farming will not be possible unless ahead of the curve or way behind. So probably Hunter is indeed the better pick. 
---
Pyro has a cooldown, doesn't it? I recall it having one, but it was more than a decade...
---
A good choice to handle this is, don't kill every mob in your way.
---
for the level 40 mount you need gold.
---
skilling professions need gold.
---
talent teacher  need gold.
---
i make a rotation, questing to lvl 10 then switch to farm mats for professions skinning/vendor and tailor/bags then if i see farm mobs to high to  farm i make quests and so on. this brings you more gold and more fun in endgame because  you have the money to buy all what you need in the ah.
---
after 60 you need about 2000-3000 gold. for good enchants, if you must pay a healer to escort you in some dungeons. and for the epic mount. but this is the faster way to get later raid ready.
---
8 weeks to get 60
---
another 8 weeks to get t0 set plus enchants.
---
2 weeks having fun.
---
then pvp bgs and raid time. raiding and pvp cost you money. this is why people need gold. for buff food, mana pots, repair and so on.
---
its better to farm 2000 gold while leveling instead of farming when 60
---
Some losers probably reported him because they thought he's playing on a private server or something.
---
Oh, I saw. He responded to another one of my comments by basically saying that just because Twitch allows Bob Ross and Pokemon to play pre-recorded video on their channel than that means this dude should be able to as well. lol The logic is lost on them. 
---
fuck tip, he's a legitimate poser, and hypocrite.
---
Nope, just a 6 (iirc) second cast time. Trust me on the no CD part, native may not have done it last night. Can’t prove nothing.
---
This is what Nixxiom does for his machinima videos.
---
I agree with you. Raiding is not something on the side, it is the main dish, but I am saying that you can have a soup, a desert and a meal at home later, which are all different and may be according to your liking, even if the main dish was shit!
---
What stories? All the stories I have or heard aren’t from 8k retail servers cause there weren’t any. 
---
playing on a pserver right now, have yet to this mystical groups of toxic/racist people, maybe just got lucky with the guilds. Good luck.
---
Well, Warlock and Paladin essentially have 90g free extra when they ding 60 relative to other classes. Warlocks can farm decently, so I may suggest that, at least for your first toon to 60, then use the spare gold on that toon to fund your second to level 60.
---
AoE leveling is quite mana intensive early on and even the slightest disturbance can ruin your pull. Virtually any opposing faction player can make it very inefficient with minimal effort. It’s much better post 40 when you have mount and Ice Barrier to help with pulls and more options available for high density AoE friendly mobs.
---
Arguably the best toy in game. Here it is:

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13379/piccolo-of-the-flaming-fire

&gt;people who take risky actions and pay the consequences are victims
---
Now THAT'S really fucking sad, dude.  
---
I use the mouse and keyboard with either hand without any issues, so I swap every now and then just for fun. Training to swap might be a good way to spread out the wear and tear between both hands.
---
Piccolo of the Flaming Fire is BIS for every class at every level of play.
---
People can get account dedicated to abuse report. I mean some people even pay gm hundreds dollars to have other ranker temp banned by «mistake»  for a few hours to get their rank easier. Paying a few account dedicated to such thing is nothing for players like that.
---
Pretty sure what he cited is a classic [bandwagon or popularity fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/bandwagon)...but yea.  I already blocked one of the guys who responded to me because he just kept quoting a single line I made instead of using his brain to think for himself.
---
No, but saying "we're not going to continue prosecuting people when the effects of that are worse than to leave it" would have a huge effect. Allowing gold selling by tokens is simply the best option because you limit the bad effects of something that's going to happen regardless. You have two options
---
1. Bad
---
2. Even worse
---
Choose whichever you want. They won't bring tokens to classic anyway so you're stuck with the more spammy, botty option. 
---
You are so far gone.  I'm wondering if you are serious or actually trolling at this point.
---
What does Blizzard TOS have to do with Twitch TOS?
---
Yes, and Worldcarver was from Ulduar. 
---
I'll have to check the book but pretty sure John Staats said it's the first thing he made. It got remade twice before it's final iteration.
---
Certainly it got made early before they knew how big anything should be. Wasn't scripted or texture iirc just modelled.
---
Isn't one of the better specs for aoe farming Frost Mage?  I think the 2nd best aoe farming spec in the game is hybrid holy/protection paladin.  Consecrate+Retribution Aura+Shield Spike (and if you can get it, thorns from a druid) and you should be able to do some decent aoe farming.
---
&gt; The people who discuss about it arn't really the ones who get hacked
---
Can you provide a non-anecdotal source to back up this claim?
---
&gt; I don't really see anyone being like "i was a victim" and anyone caring.
---
More personal opinions with no bearing on reality. Do you think that anecdotes are data?
---
&gt; I remember back then whenever i saw hacked accounts I didn't care because i knew why it was hacked.
---
More stories that have nothing to do with the topic.
---
&gt; It's actually kinda worse for blizzard to sell gold because now that you make it a "legitimate" option, its now feeding off those same people your talking about except "acceptable".
---
Ah, finally, an actual *attempt* at a claim. So your framing of this is just... fucking stupid. You essentially have two choices:
---
* Gold selling by Chinese farm bots. Fucked up server economy. Lots of spam. Stolen accounts. Stolen credit cards.
---
* Gold selling by Blizzard without any of the aforementioned negative consequences.
---
One of these is harmless to players (in a real life sense, not in your fantasy videogame *feelings* sense) and the other isn't. Period. The issue here isn't over fairness. Fuck fairness if people's safety is in jeopardy.
---
&gt; Also I want to associate with the type of people that have the mindset of enjoying a slower pace game and grinding. 
---
So you want to plug your ears and pretend that a black market for gold isn't happening. Okay, that's cool for you, bro, but it's going to be an issue whether you like it or not, and it took Blizzard ten years to finally accept the only solution to black market gold: Legitimize and regulate it.
---
&gt; where the chinese farmers would consume a lot of retards.
---
Are you twelve years old? The fact that you're calling victims of fraud “retards” says a lot about your humanity. I'm trying real hard not to call you a dim-witted piece of shit human being for being so callous, sociopathic, and irresponsible toward your fellow players, but you're making it real difficult.
---
You understand you argument is "ima a fucking lazy idiot so make it so I'm not punished for being a lazy idiot and anyone that points out I'm a lazy idiot is a big meanie", right?
---
That guy owes me so many drinks for how often I hooked him up with Maybell

That's because your cognitive dissonance about this subject is making you uncomfortable. :)

Heroic strike is tied to melee swing timer, just like cleave, so it’s not really the dame as abilities off gcd. 
---
Main difference is you have to wait for the swing.
---
Source: tank in vanilla, MT in tbc, wotlk. MT on xxxx private server. 
---
Sure, but I think Blizzard loses more by missing out on Twitch. Their game is already in a bad spot in terms of reputation, the last thing they need is to be pushed into obscurity on Twitch.
---
It's still a lot less than hunter, shaman, warlock.
---
I strictly play on private servers, so I don't care about buying gold myself—but I understand the gold farming problem, and I'm also a rational, compassionate person.
---
That's how I'm able to see how important the security measure of having a legitimate way to RMT in an MMO is.
---
Assuming they don't break that to be more blizz-like.
---
If you're a group of people who wants to give Blizzard 15 dollars each in order to falsely report a couple of players then go ahead, I doubt it'll be the epidemic people make it out to be and if it is Blizzard will make MILLIONS in subs
---
I will have to agree.  
---
They already added sharding, right click to report, new macro system and I am sure that corpse camping, turtling BGs, spitting on people etc will be bannable.
---
It's pretty evident that people thought he was playing pservers, I have joined the stream for a few hours here and there and that is a constant question drive-by viewers start to ask and they get the same response all the time.
---
Very insecure people reporting other's because they might be breaking the rules, twitch is so poorly ran
---
Holy crap, whats up with the downvotes? it's incredibly common to get banned for clicking a link that wasn't what you'd thought it be. 
---
&gt; piracy 
---
Modded outdated version
---
No they didn't break it. It works exactly the same.
---
That's why I was asking.
---
Can you stream illegal things on twitch and not have the outside company do something about it?
---
So, bottom line, despite this looooong argument: you would obviously be happier sticking with retail where you can buy your gold from Blizz and not fall victim to the gold farmers... As for Classic WoW, as has been said many times before: NO CHANGES! WoW as it was in 2004-2006, gold farmers and all, lol...

I roll sooo bad that statistically Classic must be a dream come true where I win everything just to get my average statistical win-chance back to where it belongs.
---
See, this is just sad, and why I honestly don't give two shits about this.  His guide helped you to 60?  What, the game was too hard for you to do it yourself?  The whole streamer culture is just idiotic, imo.
---
The release date will be announced tomorrow. Because tomorrow it's Vanilla patch day. (That was on Wednesdays during vanilla. Not sure if it is still in retail.)
---
(Wishfull thinking)
---
The whole idea is to leverage your health and mana. If you didn't kill mobs as you went from A to B then you'd be sitting at full health and mana, effectively wasting resources. 
---
This is really silly hyperbole tip, stop trying to make videos for the sake of making videos, if theres no news just dont post anything
---
Wish the same thing every wednesday?
---
Yep, exactly.
---
Am I the only one that really doesn't care?  Streamer culture is stupid as hell.  Play the game yourself; why do you need someone else to show it to you?
---
30 yo boomer? So you want to play a dps besides boomkin? I'm confused

Shaman: Sentry totem. AKA I only use this when waiting for zeppelins or boats.

RCR might be fine for the retail community, which has been fucked for quite a while. I remember doing this in the Cata or MoP era (forgot which) in our AV premade which was on Vent. Occasionally, some random would queue into our instance and was assigned BG leader - whenever the random refused to relinquish lead, 30 people would RCR him at the same time, and he would be removed automatically. This was an abuse of a mechanic that existed in BG's to combat toxic behavior, botting etc. The RCR feature does NOT belong in the game at all, unless they can limit its use to very specific circumstances where the target is going against community standards, beyond any shadow of doubt. Simply inviting the community to police itself in all matters through the use of RCR is simply a wide-open invitation for abuse.
---
Yet it opens up flagrant abuses by groups
---
When this system dropped in cata/wotlk it was notorious for abuses. Every group of friends rolled need on everything, deequipped their gear to make it look like they needed it, and since you didn’t know who was on the phone with each other or on discord or whatever, you never even knew you were being taken advantage of.
---
Then after the run the buddies split loot amongst themselves.
---
I did it ALL the time with my buddies. I don’t want this to ruin classic.
---
How do you know this?
---
Have they stated the #showtooltip will work?  Or are you basing it off of the demo that still had stun movement and didn't have the proper health regen?
---
Ferals hate rogues and hunters in their groups. True story.
---
Yeah like when tips mass reported someone in the demo for ruining his RP event.
---
If searing gorge and silithus quests are live, then it will not be too bad. Otherwise, you gonna kill yetis.
---
For when your bear tank absolutely refuses to dance on command.
---
feral is good off-tank.
---
and shadow priest bad damage dealer ;)
---
I made the exact same post like 3 months ago and it got deleted by the mods for violating the sub's rules.  The mods on this sub are about as consistent as the refs in the NFL.
---
Gee I don't know, maybe the same reason people watch professionals athletes / artisans / educators perform their craft?
---
Thank you
---
In guild chat :(
---
Rogues and warriors definetely need the least, multiple action bars with stances amd stealth and no down ranking.
---
Druids would be third, also have abilities split with different forms, but much fewer shapeshift specific abilities as well as havimg to downrank compared to warriors and rogues.
---
The rest all seem about equally inundated with situational spells. Shamans might be the worst by a small margin due to totems
---
What kind of inane strawman is that? goldsellers are gonna empty the accounts of handicapped children? Dear god link me all your "research material" into the deep conspiracy of how chinese goldsellers steal the identities and pocket change of our retarded children.
---
Anyway, i find it hilarious that you keep spamming your opinion everywhere and just continue to pull this hyperbolic shit out of your ass, but fail to acknowledge/realise that there are other ways to prevent goldsellers account hacking *without* the P2W inflation-machine that is tokens. 
---
it was normalized in patch 2.0.1 (tbc patch)
---
Except that analogy completely fails.  Anybody can spend 12 hours a day playing video games.  Not everybody can even get enlisted on their high school football team.
---
I farmed librams in dire maul in retail. Use the hidden back entrance inside that pillar structure. Farm mobs for librams and bosses for gold.
---
This tool nicely proves how little the stat differences matter at 60. 120 agi vs 127 agi...where at lvl 1-10 it may matter more.
---
It also gets you extra crafting mats to level professions along the way.  I in no way intend on rushing to 60; I'll be leveling cooking and tailoring at the minimum, maybe herbalism, but I feel like resource nodes are going to be few and far between.
---
Agreed.  And to be honest, I often found people skipped emperor runs completely.  Which back in the day I was so sad about.  I ran an enhancement/elemental hybrid shaman with Dragonscale LW so the Emperor's room was my white whale (IIRC Ironfoe a really really good 1H mace had a chance to drop from Thaurrisan. And the guards in his room had a chance to drop Black Dragonscale Chestpiece recipe (I think))
---
The hardest part of the Emp runs was the hall before his room.  Those stupid flame keepers and infinitely respawning mobs...I can't count how many times my group wiped in that room cause the ranged DPS hung too far back and aggrod respawning packs.
---
Last night on our way to MC for a guild raid we sent the rogues out ahead in blackrock mountain to scout for horde (since we all had world buffs).  Four of us rogues encountered a shaman from an opposing guild hiding in a corner.  All 4 rogues simultaneously coordinated cheap shots and ambushes and just melted him lol.  It was glorious.
---
Commenting to stay up to date on this. Another black eye for Twitch. They really need to evaluate their suspension policy.
---
So sick of hearing about him, really don't give a shit.  Just play the damn game.
---
You forgot one crucial thing the Shaman brings to the raid that the Warrior with Nightfall doesn't: Windfury totem.
---
Why do you care what other people watch for entertainment? Damn bro, did the superbowl trigger you that hard?
---
Well I’m pretty sure you need a horde raid team to pull off that trick of because Onyxia untargetable until  after her big reveal, you would need the horde to pull her as she transforms but before she can kill Windsor. 
---
On a similar note, Bolvar is totally fare game while the event is going on and this one the best strategies to killing him in a raid. 
---
Once, I shit you not I was in VoA and hunter pants dropped that were really good for me.
---
I had shitty AOL internet still back then, so I dc'ed during the loot roll.
---
When I logged in, turns out the other hunter that wanted the pants rolled a 99, and the lead had already given him the pants. 
---
I said I couldn't roll because I dc'ed. and the group leader said if I rolled a 100 then I should get the pants.
---
So, I actually rolled the 100, but they kinda just blew it off. I didn't recieve the pants. 
---
It was a great injustice and has stuck with me to this day. 
---
Druids have auto-changing bars depending on the form...that makes all the difference.
---
Have you purchased gold and are you a victim to it. If the answer is no then what are you arguing for. If the response is yes then okay get rekt. the "data" comes from observation of how communities grow. From the wild communities of 4-chan to the tame ass communities of hearthstone and everything inbetween.
---
Your argument is stating that this is only videogames of a "feeling" sense while overlooking the fact that accomplishment based off set challenges due set the people who you talk to. BFA is a large buildup of years of simplifying WoW, which can be seen as begun even in BC back when quests because more streamlined and loot became easier access and also more simplified with less random factors. If you havn't spent the time to actually research on how these changes affect communities which based off the fact your spewing a bunch of insults and calling everything else stories or demanding where the data is, then once again your point is invalid. I suggest spending some time hanging out around different communities and seeing how changes to rules create certain groups of people
---
&gt; So basically since the design philosophy was to push you to new areas for you to grind in for awhile
---
I mean yeah, in older games that was the *only* way to level.  Hunting spot A for 10-20, hunting spot B for 20-30.  But those were also games more heavily focused on the rpg aspect, less on the dungeon crawls and story lines.
---
One thing I don't often see mentioned in this type of discussion is the position of your keyboard and mouse.  Sometimes raising or lowering them (if possible) can make a huge difference.  I realized that any occasional wrist pain I had from gaming went away when I used a desk that was a couple inches lower than what I was used to.
---
Not everyone can play at the level of play pro gamers are at?
---
Anyone can play some friendly pickup football with friends.
---
If you could only name your new toon "Fujohntaylor". or "Fujohn" or "Fujt"
---
I actually watched his stream quite a bit, he doesn't share what private server he plays on and doesn't stream it, and doesn't wanna talk about it on stream.
---
Also he just plays his oldschool video where he speedrun since he knew he had no reason to get banned for that since he doesn't break TOS that way.
---
Yes, but it's transparent, ghosty.
---
That's why it is cool.
---
And then we are back to: As long as he didn't stream it on twitch, what is it Blizzard would ask them to ban him for?
---
Ok Tips

[https://streamable.com/4vtik](https://streamable.com/4vtik) 
---
You can watch whatever you want, I just think it's stupid as hell.  And it cheapens the game if you end up stuck on a server with some streamer and have to deal with packs of their adoring fans, and it promotes the absolute min/max try hard mentality where again people can't just relax and enjoy the game.  Playing video games is not the same as becoming a world class athlete or musician.  It isn't now, nor will it ever be.
---
The good time Before toys had 4 hour cooldown, and 5 seconds of use.
---
The problem with this would of course be that a private server set up like this wouldn't be the same as vanilla, since a lot of the numbers they deal with on private is unknown server side variables.
---
So making a guide on a server like this could very well be useless for vanilla servers.
---
Anybody with the free time can sit down and play 12 hours a day of video games.  Your friends are not always going to be available to meetup on a field.
---
Could just be that he is refreshing his original guides in a better format (in game guide or similar) than the PDF files/web site it used to be.
---
The guide isn't just for leveling, of which anyone can do given enough time. The guide is years worth of work to level as efficiently as possible and as fast as possible. 
---
Staying in one zone doing each quest one by one is almost never going to be the fastest or more efficient way to go. It is intended for people trying to hit 60 as fast as possible
---
Youre just plain wrong on your understanding of the channels I was describing, theres tons of replay only content that isnt licensed content or live replay footage, it seems as if you think being ignorant to their existence means they simply dont exist. Though that is neither here nor there, since what he is doing isnt against the TOS. The guy has put in many a 12 hour days in streaming over the past 5 years like any other full time job, I would know because I used to watch for years. Either way I dont think you should let people downvoting you hurt your feelings. If you truly think everyone else but you is in denial then its totally worth it to die on that hill alone and you well within your right to do so.
---
Not at all, if you play smart and start them all together none will have more than 7 days played due to rested exp.  An efficient player with 2-3 hours a day will easily have 2 capped players within a year.
---
I was always spamming traded Chat with

WTS 66x [cat figurine]
---
watch this video, a test comparing just questing, and questing+killing mobs on your way: www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6QvouurFMo
---
its just more effiecient. why did you caps "every"? its all situational, class depended, location depended and so on. but generally its a good idea to kill mobs on your way, cos you are spending resources to kill them (mana, hp, cds) and then regening. while still moving form point a to b. 
---
This is risky. It can spawn as lvl 20 too
---
1. It's not "streamer culture", Joana's runs predate Twitch by 5+ years.
---
2. Classic WoW was quite difficult, and it certainly helped to be have some insight from the world record holder for leveling.
---
3. I understand that the Pats tilted you hard this weekend, but it's time to take a breath and let it pass.
---
And again, why?  I can think of any number of more worthwhile things to put years worth of time into.
---
Hi, /u/cooplooper
---
Guilds will just bring resto shaman for that.
---
What's your source on the payment method being confirmed? If so, they just lost another potential returning customer.
---
Wow, had to cycle through my comment history for those burns?  I made it to 60 two months before TBC came out, did it without any guides, and leveled professions along the way.  It was not hard.
---
Except things like going to jail and getting your account banned act as a deterrent to buying drugs or buying gold.  
---
And actually back to your original point there is a great chapter in Freakonimics that outlines why and how the us government has basically lost the war on drugs over the last 50 years. And what it comes down to is by only going after the sellers and punishing them severely they end up shortening the supply and increasing the demand, making it more lucrative for new sellers to enter the market. 
---
So imo blizzard should be zero tolerance on gold buying, you get caught one time, your account is perma banned. You would have to be pretty low on brain cells to buy gold then and risk losing your account with hundreds of hours of playtime invested.

A small tip to players that are not familiar with Strat, you will see a good few "citizens" inside that are neutral, however a stray AOE or cleave may agro one adding to your troubles.  By using /dance on the citizens they will drop agro and reset.  HTH
---
Cycle through your comment history? You posted it *yesterday*, on *this sub*.
---
Sure.
---
But we're not talking about watching someone play video games just 'cause.
---
It's either people playing at a level you can't play yourself (pro / high end) 
---
Or, very entertaining people who you watch because of the persona more than the actual game itself.
---
Ahh, i see. Well, double pyro is just naaasty then.
---
His death is a scripted event.
---
Seems the ones who complain the loudest are the ones to abuse it.
---
I'm also considering a druid, what is your approach to being "master of none"? is it enough for you to be "good enough"?
---
Wow, get over yourself.  I dinged 60 two months before TBC came out, sorry if I didn't get my lawyer to fact check all of my statements!  The game isn't hard; needing someone to guide you through it just shows you're pathetic.
---
I think he's saying Blizzard has pull with Twitch to get stuff pulled, since not only do they give Twitch license to monetize streams, they are business partners through their esports events as well as Blizzard probably buys a lot of ads from Twitch.
---
Take a look at the AV  patch notes during vanilla. The east and west sides of the map were gutted along with loads of quests tied to them. Don't be so ignorant and blind to private servers.
---
I'm sorry to hear the Super Bowl still has you in a mood.
---
&gt; Hopefully this was in error because he's constantly in chat engaged with viewers and streaming footage from **retail servers** does ***NOT*** break Twitch ToS. 
---
Well then it's most likely just a mass report spam about something tiny that triggered a ban from either the Twitch system or one of those lazy admins that doesn't check things up before approving the ban. Which means he will get unbanned in a few days or something.
---
It just depends on what your goals are in the end game. Being good at everything gives you a lot of flexibility, but the trade off is that you’re not as “key” to the success of any endeavour.
---
Twitch isn't a government agency. If Blizzard's CEO calls Twitch's CEO and says, "We'd rather you not show this stream", they'll probably pull the stream. Anything Twitch decides to care about is not irrelevant, by definition. They can ban you because the head of HR got into a fight in third grade with someone who shares a name with your second cousin if they want to.
---
But again, how did they get to that level?  Anyone with the free time can get good at a video game.  Not everyone is capable of being a pro football player, no matter how hard they try.  Video games are not hard; acting like these people are amazing because they have so much time to waste playing them really isn't very impressive to me.
---
Possibly PAX East?  Possibly standalone Blizz announcement?
---
I am leaning towards a one off press release rather than some huge event or convention.  I would expect details of a beta (if there will be a public beta) and the launch date by the end of April.
---
Hopefully!
---
You're literally the only one mentioning it.  Guess I touched a nerve in your neckbeard.
---
I’ve read a lot of speculation about adding sharding, right click to report, etc, but nothing official... Have you seen official notice? Please share if so...
---
Not at all surprised there are lots of people out that going out of their way to sabotage classic. I wouldn't be surprised if they report bombed Joanna just because they're that fucking petty.
---
I've worked with computers for over the last decade and also been gaming hardcore since early teens. Never had a hand issue until this year.  Started hurting an hour into work all day, switched to an ergonomic mouse (big circular Microsoft one) at work and use the bigger zowie ec at home.  Naga for MMOs all seem big enough to not cause much issue
---
Yeah, it’s not an affective PvP spec by any means, but it is fun to be able to just randomly delete someone though. They never expect the 1400 noncrit instant cast.
---
The problem with false reporting is that you only need to do it once to catastrophically impact someone’s gameplay experience. 
---
Further, having the ability to pull the trigger at a moments notice creates a different “feel” for the game. I never once reported a player during Vanilla as I’m pretty sure I didn’t even know how to do it. Even if I did you would have to click through some menus, then find the thing, and by that time you have probably reconsidered. One click reports allow for impulsive and ill considered action antithetical with a game that actually forced you to think about what you were doing and why.
---
Sure, I’m not questioning their ability to ban anyone they want, I’m just pointing out that he hasn’t streamed or uploaded any content related to non official Blizzard servers to my knowledge so his ban likely has nothing to do with whether or not he practices routes on a closed private server..?
---
Those refs got you good huh 😂
---
I'd prefer a more hands off approach if Blizzard going to be too lazy or cheap to properly filter reports. Auto report is abused terribly on RP servers by cliques or guilds that want to bully someone. Mark my words, someone is going to lose R14 or something else because of it.
---
Why the personal attack? Really? I'm an idiot?
---
Private servers use 1,12,1 yet claim it's authentic to patch 1.5 AV, which it really isn't even close, then Private Server players start acting like experts of original AV. Do you work at Blizzard? How would you know they don't have backups of 1.5 AV, if anything they'll have the means to rebuild it.
---
Private servers do a shit representation of AV because they are using the nerfed map, if they had the 1.5 map they'd be using that as part of their authentic patch release cycles.
---
If you think that's worth losing your account and hundreds of hours of work, go nuts.
---
My hope would be to be able to tank any dungeon and heal all the raids. There will probably be spots in the raids but I'm worried people would decline me for dungeons as tank and healer for not being "best".
---
Remarkable that you don't get a notice of the terms of your ban. Very strange.
---
Just can't handle being told you suck at the only thing you thought you were good at, can you?
---
In 2k19 "what a stupid transmog xD" in 2006 "this tank is fucking geared man he's in all blues" 
---
castsequence
---
It used to have a cool down then they removed it in late vanilla
---
yeah, I meant Blizzard TOS, should've clarified
---
You might be mixing pyroblast with Soul Fire (basically Pyroblast for locks) which had a cooldown. 
---
No, I have no idea where they got that from? Maybe it was changed just before release or early in to it but that has never been a 'thing' as far as I've played. He always died. Always 100% regardless of how many people you brought. My guild used to turn up for our members during the early days just for fun.
---
Not looking forward to having to wear the Bloodvine set as a caster but those stats man, those stats.
---
I am getting very positive responses from this, so I will certainly continue to make more.
---
it makes your melee range longer, which is better vs casters, also your higher base health from racial and base stamina works well with survi talent, you can go mm/survi as tauren which should be better than troll with the same spec. Your max range is longer too ( as well as the max range you can get hit at ). It only really becomes a disadvantage vs melee classes that jump right on top of you ( because you have to get more distance to start shooting) but thats where your war stomp becomes useful
---
Is there math done on this? From what I see on speed runs there is like 10-15 warriors and one paladin that Salvs them. 
---
I love how you looked like a complete clown and slowly get the right gear. F#%ck Mogging.

P.s. This is TBC style.

Woah this is a totally different conversation now. No not everyone with infinite time could be at the top of the ladder in any game. What a weird thing to claim.

Lack of spell ranks on Warriors, Rogues, and some Druid spells was an excellent point!

Pretty sure I paid for a guide he wrote at some point.

Then how do you know
---
You should try posting this to /r/LiveStreamFail
---
   
---
Lots of twitch users and lots of twitch admins use that sub, and most of the users have a hate boner for twitch and are just looking for a reason to go after them.  
---
Except for none of that's vanilla gear? looks like terrible BC recolors. 
---
But yeah I'm looking forward to the frankenstein builds. 
---
One thing that helped me is to have a big bucket filled with uncooked rice nearby my desk that I dig into with my hand(s) from time to time. There are different kinds of techniques you can do depending on your needs, just lookup rice bucket exercises. I personally do a mix of all kinds. It's pretty cheap and easy to acquire the two things as well.
---
P.S. You might want to put the lid back on when you're done
---
If you are both mages, you can aoe blizzard farm to level much faster than questing and whatnot. Look up some old mage aoe farming for leveling videos. As a side note it’s also AMAZING for getting gold
---
Picture from TBC, obvious Karma whoring post, a dumb mouth edited on the orc's face for no reason and the worst of it all this was originally posted in r/gaming. 
---
.. I think that at one point it's worth taking a hit to your stats to avoid that. O.O
---
What if you don't have hands?
---
Still use it today on my main as well. 
---
Why do you exactly hate mogging with such a passion and why the fuck did you censor the word "fuck"? We aren't in kindergarten anymore.
---
If it's against TOS it's piracy. 
---
This. Aoe farming with mages. 
---
OP gave a shit explanation so I asked for clarification. I don’t give two shits if some circlejerking fanboy downvoted my comment or not but what bothers me is when people add to the conversation or ask questions that others might want to ask as well and it gets downvoted because it doesn’t confirm to the hivemind of the sub/thread. 
---
And you keep giving non-examples to prove your point so I’m done running in circles with you. Have a good day. 
---
Well, he made more money with this guide than you'll probably will earn in your whole life, so there's a reason why
---
Nobody on Twitch acts until a DMCA request is actually made. The fact that MapleStory and Black Desert categories is filled with private servers is proof of this.
---
Feel free to crosspost. I don't care about karma, just want to watch the dude again.

Is k that much quicker to type than 0?
---
If she goes mage:
---
* You can go Priest.  You both have a lot of CC, and it works in different ways so DR shouldn't be an issue.  You've got Mana burn for casters and frostbolt for melee.  You are a healer and a mage, which are great for finding dungeon groups (everyone loves having a healer and mage).
---
* You can go Paladin.  Throw on Righteous Fury so she doesn't have to kite, or just be her buffbot/healbot while she AoE kills everything.  (You can handle the casters while she handles the melee).  Again, in dungeons you have a healer and a mage.  Probably a less capable combo than the Priest, but you roll on different gear.
---
* You can go Warlock.  Like the Paladin, this gives the mage a tank.  Like the priest, you have Drain Mana and lots of fears to synergize with the Priest in PvP.  But now you have 2x clothy DPS and the priest might not want to run with you.
---
* You are missing one option - MAGE!  The best AoE grinding class, and now you have 2!  That's double the polymorph when you pull 3 mobs.  That's double the cone of colds, double the frost novas, double the chance of rooting with your blizzard!  (One of the Classic Youtubers did a test on duo leveling comps, and Mage + Mage was far and above his favorite combo).  And even though it's again 2 clothies, a lot of people are happy to bring 2 mages because double the polymorph.
---
If she goes Warlock:
---
* You can go mage.  Same benefits as above.
---
* You can go Warlock and really lay on the DoTs.
---
* You can go Priest and really synergize your shadow damage, plus you can heal dungeons.
---
* Paladin will work better here than with the mage, because you get more out of your buffs by putting them on the Warlock and the pet, and because you can heal the pet.  I still think this is the weakest combo, but you have the added benefit of not rolling on the same gear.
---
The only thing that really needs to be fixed is queue dodging.  Which could be as simple as just making it so groups always join as a group and adding a deserter debuff.  That along with the systems they have now that prevent mods or syncing up join times to avoid join as a group would nip queue dodging pretty hard.
---
Bold Armor.... mmmmmhmmmmm.......... &lt;3
---
I hate that trinket so much. More annoying than the train set pre wind-up destroyer.
---
Most people dislike transmogging because it takes away from the feeling of fear progression since instead of starting with boring greens as you level through an expansion and progressively getting gear to look cooler, you can just look like a high level raider from a previous expansion with mogging.
---
Has this been mentioned in the more popular threads? Everyone's having a panic attack over there

that's how I played it, because no internet

That's nice, where did you get it?
---
You won’t be able to 2 man leveling dungeons, unless your 10 levels higher. But for questing, you will destroy anything due to the amount of dots, and a void walker tank. You will be able to heal as a shadow priest, and locks are always nice to have for summons and healthstones, all you will need is a tank and some extra dps/heal if you want to dps sometimes.

Hey moron. He made a guide back in the day that he sold for cold hard cash and made ALOT. Now you wanna know why people wanted a guide? Bc some ppl may have spent an extra 50+ hours to get to lvl 60. And some people have jobs that pay well. So you pay two hours salary to make up for 50 hours of time? That’s a fucking no brainer bud. 
---
That just creates more questions. 
---
No you can tank and heal most 5-man dungeons. you can also off-tank in some raids; i’ve even seen a druid main-tanking ZG. You need great gear however. In vanilla i used to farm DM as tank for the ogre king rings. It was EZ PZ.
---
Healing is ok; your main issue is not having a normal ress, that mixed with your HoTs means it will be harder than regular healers. You need to be extra careful to not lose that asshole rogue that can’t be a team player, since one death = waiting for corpse run. Ideally you would have a dps pali/sham/priest in the group for heals.
---
PvP is the hardest part but that’s a huge separate discussion.
---
Druid is much stronger once well-geared. Problem is finding said gear. Tier sets are healer only until AQ.
---
Man, you've put a very apt decription of yourself just above. Thanks for being honest with the populace on how much of a piece of garbage you are. Now if i could get your potential sever and names of use so i could avoid your ass, thats be about the nicest thing you've done in a decade; im sure of it.
---
This is really shit tier trolling you're putting on in this thread, man.
---
/cast Counterspell as first Pyro leaves for blanket silence 
---
That's why everyone is addicted to deviate supreme and noggenfogger elixir.
---
The problem with Voidwalkers is a few-fold:
---
1. The VW uses mana to hold aggro, and like Paladins can run out
---
2. The VW has no true taunt if someone (the healer) gets aggro
---
3. The VW has horrible threat generation on secondary targets, and requires a lot of micromanaging to not kill your healer (which also slows you down because you can't generate threat on the primary target if you're doing that)
---
4. The VW is basically health and armor, doesn't have much avoidance to mitigate healing requirements.
---
Honestly, there are a lot of classes that "can" tank.  And technically in TBC I tanked a dungeon on every class except a priest.  (The Mage tanked Wailing Caverns with a level 70 healer).  Hunters, Warlocks, Shamans, and Paladins all have ways of taking less damage than a clothie while generating extra threat.  But for dungeons there are only two true tank classes:  Warrior and Druid.
---
* It's vague because he was banned out of the blue. The streamer is just as confused as we are. There was no communication from Twitch, hence the lack of explanation.
---
* I pop into the dude's chat like once a week to ask questions once in a while. He holds the world's record for speedrunning a game that I love. That hardly makes me a fanboy. In fact, [this is the first time I've ever mentioned him](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=author%3Asirsaltie+%22joana%22&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).
---
* He gave you several examples of other Twitch channels that provide old content that was not previously hosted on their platform. Stop moving the goalpost.
---
* You're being downvoted because your attitude is extremely toxic and you are spreading misinformation by claiming what he did was against the ToS.

I prefer the first one; [World of Roguecraft Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL--teiBbzQ)   
---
    
---
In case anyone not in the know gets weird feelings about me saying that it's the first one, the Roguecraft videos were made in reverse order - 3, then 2 and finally 1.  
---
Also, the OG himself, Mute, commented on the video I linked, with a list of google drive hosted videos that were made around the same time, with unused footage and such as well as their RTZS recruitment video :)  
---
Anyone who doesn't think right click reporting will be abused only has to read your comment to know it will be.
---
Can’t wait to see the Vanilla haters in trade chat on launch day screaming about how bad the game sucks and how much better retail is... 
---
Because if you're traveling you're not getting XP.  You're also wasting your health and mana regen if you're at full mana.  Kill mobs along the way to improve that.
---
But I disagree with "kill EVERY mob".  Avoid higher level ones, you get less XP and they take longer.  Bypass lower level ones.  Sometimes you just gotta get there and back without taking too much time (i.e. time for work, time for bed) and sometimes everything in your way isn't worth it.
---
That's cool dude no one gives a fuck. Do you not see the irony in bitching about ppl spending time on something as you are wasting time yourself? Lmfao didnt your mom teach you if you have nothing nice to say dont say anything at all?
---
You shouldn't be able to report someone of the opposing faction on a PVP server, not for anything, end of story. Not even for exploiting/safespotting -- either just go somewhere else, or post a video of it and see if the world cares enough to get him banned through viral rage.
---
On the other hand, as a devout non-asshole I have no problems with right-click reporting on a PVE server. They're called carebear servers for a reason. The pservers I've played on have always had plenty of white power, racist, sexist, homophobic garbage flooding every channel. I've had my fill of chat channels flooded with countless sad nerds trying their hands at being edgelords. It's *played out,* and has been for decades. Those people deserved to be banned just for being so damn stale.
---
I remember playing Warcraft II, what did the Gryphon Riders use? Enchanted hammers. 
---
Do I downvote this asshole, because he himself abused right click reporting? Or do I upvote him as a great example of an asshole who abuses right click reporting?
---
I'll be playing a holy paladin in Classic. Can't wait for the clusterfuck of armor I will be wearing.
---
Skip Imp dev aura, put 4 points into toughness and put points into shield spec and Improved concentration instead.
---
Thats basically how they have always handled it.  Some of the really primitive ones we able to be detected, but when they evolved most were detected though GMs monitoring players who farmed and paid attention to how they moved (bots would move left or right and move forward for example, something unusual for human players).   
---
After a while if the toons movements were suspicious they would attempt to communicated with them and take action based off the replies

---
A problem with mogging is that the gear someone wears tells very little about them. If you're in the end of an expansion, you can tell who is new/an alt, who's a pvp-er, who's a pve-er, which raids are they doing. Do they care enough about style to keep extra sets of gear in their bank so they can show off in the hubs with it?
---
It also makes the transition from quest/dungeon gear to raid gear less satisfying. Being able to start looking cool once you started getting raid gear felt good. That part of the game is gone with transmog. I think transmog isn't good anymore.
---
No but it is one less syllable :)
---
But if someone says they once smoked weed in your house, you can kick them out of your house.  The actual law, and your rights to use someone else's private property are two completely different things.
---
Maybe you can see my issue this way:
---
-Private server claims to have Pre-Nerf AV
---
-Private server is using Post-Nerf AV map (doesn't have 1.5 files)
---
-Private server's playerbase doesn't realize this map isn't Pre-Nerf
---
-The playerbase doesn't have a good time, AV ends too quick ect (not fun)
---
-Classic WoW is announced
---
-Many players want Pre-Nerf AV (long games, lots to do)
---
-Private server players say Pre-Nerf sucks (They never played it)
---
-This confuses the entire playerbase
---
-Does blizzard give Pre-Nerf AV, or Post-Nerf AV?
---
-Private server experience in AV should be irrelevant
---
Just to note I have played on Private servers before Classic was released and I'm not saying that Private servers are a waste of time. There's a lot of information to gain by playing Private servers.
---
I'm sorry if I sounded like private servers are trash i'm sure you've spent a lot of time in them, they aren't and i'm glad they exist or else we wouldn't have classic
---
You still have to unlock the cool looking gear in order to mog it in the first place. Don't get me wrong though, I don't want it to Vanilla but some people here seem to be way too hateful towards it and often forget the RP value it potentially gives. I think people who play on RP servers love that feature, since they can clear content while wearing their RP gear without compromising any stats and whatnot. I personally like that feature, since I want to look different than others.
---
In regards to Warlock, I think the majority of folks would take the trinket simply because it's unique and if the game progresses to TBC, then it's got a longer shelf life than the other two items.  Personally, I'm taking the Scythe.  It's one of the most iconic weapons from Vanilla and it has +hit which is fairly rare for Warlocks early on.  Will it last long if you're an active raider, certainly not, but it stands out and gives me that nostalgia trip from my Vanilla days.  Plus, we have no clue if Classic will progress to TBC or not.
---
Just like it has currently killed retail? Hyperbolic clickbait titles man. Get a grip
---
That's so trill

Where is there a portal in Winterspring, other than Hyjal?
---
It's a lot easier to catch goldselling operations when they actually deliver the gold then stop them from farming. Doing it that way actually combats the inflation generated by dozens of mages and hunters farming DM and Mara.
---
Since Dire Maul likely will be out on the start, Melee will be using Satyr bow which is not only a lot easier to farm, but also better for them.
---
The train set was so hilariously overpowered in the annoyance department. Nothing compares.
---
Surprised you think as you do.
---
I have to massage my wrists and forearms with either my knuckles or a hard edge massaging tool. I also occasionally ice my hands and wrists in a bucket of ice water for as long as i can, but not longer than 5 minutes at a time.

These were doctor recommended techniques (as well as the things others have said) to help with my tendonitis and from strain at work, but it helps with gaming pain too.

You mean when you level as Beast Mastery and your pet does most of your damage?
---
You give me hope for this community.  Reasonable ppl do exist. Wow!
---
Alright fair enough. But since Dire Maul will be out, it doesnt change anything. The Dire Maul bow is better for melee and a lot easier to farm.
---
Shift your movement keys over to the right by one key.

WASD becomes ESDF. This way you never have to take your finger off your homerow and more keys are open to binding.
---
Those are crafted wands made by enchanters so I fail to see how it has any relevance to which class gets the most out of wands.
---
No idea. Not that I think it would matter. People don't want to listen to reason or change the way they feel, they're mostly just interested in being really upset. 
---
ya theres so many solutions to it that i see way less incentive for the wow token thing. Having even 1-2 gamemasters per server having 20-30 AI's watching for them then reporting to the gamemaster to make a final decision will cut down now that bots can be more advanced nowadays.
---
joana is a legend. This sucks.
---
&gt; How is that even possible without pserver?
---
Opensource emulators running locally on your PC, the code is legal and it's the base pservers use.
---
That's why you should never invite a dps warrior to your dungeon if you're a warrior tank.
---
They're petty much the worst dps you could have when starting out and they're going to roll against you for everything and also complain that you're rolling on dps gear as a tank.
---
Really I'd just avoid any dps only warrior in general. Warriors need to be able to tank in vanilla. Even if a raid recruits you as a fury warrior they still need you to be able to tank for certain fights. Decent fury warriors will be tanking 5mans and keeping a set of tank gear ready for when needed because they understand they didn't pick a rogue.
---
Yeah, there's definitely some value behind not having every warrior in T2 looking absolutely identical, for sure.
---

Yet you waited no time to come here and whine about it before hearing the facts.
---
&gt;He gave you several examples of other Twitch channels that provide old content that was not previously hosted on their platform. Stop moving the goalpost.
---
And, as previously stated, those are mostly contracted with Twitch. The rest are reruns. They are not **live** and playing pre-recorded content. Then he followed up with, "Well there are others I could tell you but I don't feel like it".
---
&gt;You're being downvoted because your attitude is extremely toxic and you are spreading misinformation by claiming what he did was against the ToS.
---
Yes, being **live** and showing pre-recorded content is not **live**. This is against ToS. It's not hard to understand.
---
Please just stop. Wait for the streamer to actually give facts before whining about his ban. 
---
You want this nonsense in your game? Also retail is dead, they wont even release subscriber numbers nemore
---
This is inevitable. I've seen WoW "bait" on quite literally every single MMORPG launch that I've played and have no doubt we will see some in Classic.
---
ESO/Rift/GW/GW2/etc: "omg this is just a wow clone btw wow was the first mmorpg wow is the best game xd"
---
BDO/TERA/FF14/etc: "this is just Japanese wow lmao will was the first mmorpg btw wow is better where is LFG/LFR??"
---
Yeah 5% pet damage is basically negligible since warlock pets don't do much damage anyway. Stun resist, however, is quite good.
---
Because people like the asshole linked below want to get the last word in and ruin it for everyone else. If ignore was enough to stop a determined asshole from harassing someone, it would be... Well, enough.

Indeed. I can usually tell what kind of gear people are wearing, taking account their class + race and their max HP. It usually is enough for me, so I can identify people regardless of mogging. (Just throwing this comment in before someone says that it's easy to identify people by their gear. Sure it is easier, but not that hard with mogging being a thing either)
---
Pretty sure the reflector is not a spell.
---
Im pretty sure rogue evasion is off. 
---
&gt;They don’t have the money to have a dedicated support staff for tickets/gms for Classic
---
Ummmm
---
&gt;The company’s net revenues for the quarter were a record $1.64 billion

[Source](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-q2-2018-financials-1202893931/). 
---
Now, according to [this article](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ATVI/activision-blizzard/revenue), they're actually down overall, but don't be fooled, they are still a literal billion dollar company. They can afford to put bodies where they need to and regulate the game, they just don't because the shareholders wallets &gt; your experience. 
---
Haha, that's pretty on point. People have a complete lack of trust with blizzard, it's *understandable*, but still illogical and paranoid. I begin to mention asking for a bypass to shift looting and get down voted when it barely affects the game/community. People still stuck on the slippery slope thing too.  
---
But hey, it's at least good we are vocal rather than silent. And they'll do all the bitching and ranting for us.
---
agreed 100% which is why I am seriously considering going orc instead if my nostalgic UD warlock
---
Warlock and paladin, for the free mounts. I wouldn't recommend paladin though, since it's alliance dogs only.
---
It depends on whether you are speed leveling, or just using the guide because it's an efficient leveling route.
---
If you are speed leveling, you will want to grind mobs along the way, because generally, grinding mobs is the fastest way to level.
---
You can also run dungeons and do the associated quests, which avoids some of the grinding sessions but also takes longer.
---
You don't own the assets and you don't have a license from the owner, who spent the money to create the assets, to use it in the way you are. That's piracy. 
---
A warrior in BWL BIS with full wbuffs and full consumes will be around 2200 AP, higher with crusader enchant procs.
---
Around 530 Strength including from buffs, and about 45% crit chance.
---
&gt; WoW Classic is NOT about the endgame. Rushing to 60 will remove so much fun from the game... 
---
Agree - there are so many group quests &amp; neat things you will miss if your sole purpose is to reach 60 as fast as possible.
---
If It'S tOo HaRd ThEn DoN't LeVeL iN rEdRidGe

probably a bunch of too-godders who keeps reporting his account for not playing live wow, thinking the stream is pservers and not old footage.
---
wow are you not having a good day
---
It all starts coming together once you get your Wild Growth Spaulders. The main problem with robes is that cloth shoulder pieces look dumb and most others don't match the robes. Wild Growth Spaulders are BiS until Naxx and make you look like less of a clown.
---
or vindictive.
---
It would be pretty hard to beat vancleef with 5 random level 17s. He’s lvl 25.
---
&gt;You're going to run out of quests at certain points
---
There are usually dungeons / elite group quests that available, they might not be convenient or obvious, but they are there. That was more true in earlier patches where the content was incomplete.
---
someone who doesn't know one of the most famous gamer names in history probably shouldn't be an admin on twitch.
---
I imagine it'll be a pretty thriving one too, since gold is a lot harder to come by and epic mounts are so expensive
---
why would you censor the word fuck in kindergarten anyway?
---
Oh wow, really? What about t1/t2 gear?
---
&gt; how they go about it these days
---
I don't know how they detect bots but on retail they put some mitigation on farming: every time you gather a node there's a chance to spawn a mob that can easily kill a farming bot, unless it's also a sophisticated combat bot.
---
When killed, the mob drops an amount of the same resource you were gathering so it's nice for players too IMO.
---
I don't think they can do the same on classic because it would be quite a change on gameplay but they can use AI to analyze behavioral patterns, AI has improved a lot in these last years.
---
It's the people who work there, they made me censor it :(
---
Uhh. Hate to break it to you, but u/mockingblackfish is actually a millionaire. It's mainly from his grandfather's death -- but either way he already has more money than both you and Joana will make in your life times combined.
---
Assuming is never good to do!
---
I can't justify the time spent, but plenty of people have hobbies they have sunk countless hours into. Especially in the MMO community, which you are clearly a part of (why else are you reading classic WoW subreddits). This person gained quite the following based off of vanilla WoW, and in turn has made actual money to this day by doing so.
---
That's fine if you don't care about this person being banned, to each their own. But you have spent your own time reading this post, then commenting, despite claims of not caring about it.  Maybe you do, just a little bit.
---
2k06 
---
So a. Extra geared warrior is worth minimum 11 warriors with might in AP? 
---
I'm sure they fixed it a long time ago, but in vanilla, when leaving org you take a right instead of a left (left leads to zep). you walk behind some huts and up a hill. iirc, you had to switch to walk mode at a certain part of the hill to traverse it and get on top of orgrimmar. It was pretty common, so iirc, it got fixed. 
---
Nah, there's no way. Joana didn't do anything wrong here. It'll get reversed, it's just unfortunate he has to deal with this mess in the meantime.
---
Yes looking at the big picture its pretty insignificant at 60.
---
It depends on your goals.... If you're just trying to level up as fast as humanly possible then you'll want to kill pretty much everything.
---
That method is pretty boring to me honestly. I'd rather skip the random mobs and level a hair slower.
---
It's awesome. Love it!
---
Depends on what content is in at launch and how you spend your time. I never ran out of quests on my Horde characters in 2005.
---
He's not even an elder millennial.
---
Only good in PvP as it gives way too much +stamina on expense of +healing power and +spell crit. You pretty much only need these two stats on the gear, everything else is just filler. If it does not have enough of these two stats, you dont wear it. 
---
Not a big fan of things like it :p  
---
Nothing compares to the swapblaster though, whoever came up with that idea was a sadistic mothertrucker !
---
Touché, indeed I have not experienced the horde leveling and I can totally understand that grinding is necessary as there simply wasn't enough time for horde content during the end of development :D
---
I understand! What about intellect? 
---
Just would like to say I personally know speedrunners who have logged a number of attempts much larger than 25,000 in a single game :3
---
There are a group of kids going around and reporting all the twitch streams with vanilla or tbc content. Hopefully he is unbanned 
---
I am not an expert , because I never watch streams, but I do sometimes watch shorter youtube clips of people that also stream.  My experience is that the popular ones are in general quite mediocre at the game, their talent is more in being an entertainer, and not a pro gamer.
---
Afaik it's in the Twitch ToS, cause it's in the Blizzard ToS in some form, and Twitch don't want any trouble with Blizzard.
---
*dangers* I mean it sucks because I was following this latest run, but it’s not a “danger”From a business stand point, it’s smart for Twitch to ban all potential liabilities then sort out the details later.  I’m sure he will be back up soon. 
---
The thing is, there is such a shitload of talents and consumables that makes you not need intellect really. You can chug mana potions, drink a flask of distilled wisdom, eat dark runes, get mp5 buffs, mage buff etc.
---
There are no +spell crit or +healing power consumables, therefore in todays pserver vanilla raiding everybody just has no regard for intellect whatsoever and just goes for +spell power/healing power and +spell crit.
---
I could be wrong because I havent watched his stream in a year or so but I would think the runner would prefer his WR to be logged on retail. In a sense that its kind of always been the speedrunner way. A majority of retro console speedrunners choose to purchase original hardware to run on, even though it's more expensive to purchase/maintain and even more complicated to capture footage than on emulators. There are a few cases were emulation is forbidden or contained in a seperate category, this is usually when there is an unfair advantage created by one version of the game. In a sense, a private server is much like an emulator. Just something to think about, FP is the type that would submit a record for each category. Now Im just rambling but on another note, I think Blizzard/Twitch should celebrate someone who has contributed to the game and delivers content truly based around gaming. It seems like its getting more and more rare on twitch to find genuine personalities instead of cookie cutter shit designed to appeal to the masses.
---
Esfand's not joining method because Ret Paladins have no place in any raids, let alone world first guilds.
---
Gotcha. Thank you for the tips!
---
Let’s see it 
---
Wasn’t he also hard as fucking nails?
---
The Druid quest gives a solid piece of healing gear, iirc. The problem was that by the time the quest was available, there was a better option.
---
Ofcourse it does, but is that not besides the point? Who doesn't enjoy getting an upgrade to one of their weapon slots. Also, I'm pretty sure not everyone will level in BM spec seeing that a lot op people have lots of experience with the game and enjoy playing in some different and maybe even some experimental specs that might not be as cookie cutter a leveling spec as BM is.
---
I have no idea if he did anything or not, I don't know enough about the situation to make a judgement.  Just correcting a point of principle.
---
Came here to see this
---
Boomer as in baby boomer? Lmao no. You are a milennial
---
you gotta be kidding me. He deserves none of this. 
---
I'd guess, (yes this is a guess) that maybe Twitch has stipulations in their ToS that has rules against replaying non-live footage after a certain amount of plays. 
---
Yeah, I highly doubt that.
---
No loot trading. No tickets. 
---
There will be console port (controller support mod) for classic  
---
For now, you can add WoW to steam and use steam's remapping tool to emulate keyboard with your controller  
---
Great answer!
---
Trill? Wtf
---
I picked the staff because I thought "I'll always have a shard and mana so this trinket is useless."
---
And then when farming lashers I'm constantly worried about running out of shards b/c I have to sack VW every pull, and I'm tapping my foot while drinking/eating after having to summon a new VW, and overall really wishing I had that trinket.
---
I assume upper class would make sense economically.
---
Thrall?
---
Dunno why you got downvoted for a simple question.
---
https://blizzardwatch.com/2018/11/06/wow-classic-interview-dives-sharding-transmog-wall-jumping-concerns/
---
No sharding... No transmog... I’ll find info on right click report and post here shortly... Bottom line, Classic WoW will be as close as possible to the original, no silly QOL enhancements being lobbied for by retailers that can’t stand the idea of a game that doesn’t cater to their casual and PTW entitled little minds... NO CHANGES!
---
&gt; stream illegal things on twitch
---
The ToS doesn't regulate legality or illegality, it only sets the terms by which you may use/access the service.
---
In other words... breaking a ToS isn't illegal.
---
You're not correcting anything. The point is that he didn't violate any rules for which Blizzard issued the DMCA violation. Someone incorrectly said he did and they reacted to it. Your house and an independent streaming platform are not synonymous.
---
It's a meme, brah.
---
Well, you can kick them out of your house for whatever reason you want, or no reason at all.
---
Them saying they smoked weed once has nothing to do with it.
---
Look up the definition of abusing. Watch the video and not just the title. He has a problem with the abuse of it, the ease of abuse. Using it once isnt abuse.
---
Owned his leveling guide 12 freaking years ago. Dude is a legend. 
---
Right, exactly, that's my point.  Anyone can stop someone else using their private property for any reason they like - whether that's kicking someone out of their house, or telling them they can no longer make use of their web servers.  You are not bound by any burden of proof in order to do so.  It's a totally different situation than what you can and can't arrest people for.
---
That is actually really, really cool

Hardcore PvE Guild, with PvP Events
---
The Philosophy
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, and hopefully realm first, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we only need to recruit people.
---
What we expect of you
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay.
---
(Preliminary) Raid Schedule (GMT+1)
---
Wednesdays 18-23
---
Thursdays 18-23
---
Mondays 18-23
---
During new content release we expect to raid when servers open up
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM’ing me or another from the Leadership. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge!

Found the dickhead
---
"Bill Belichick never played fottball professionally, he probably is a bad coach" 
---
Same idea here.
---
Pretty sure he raided in private servers. Even if not, why does this matter? He's done the research, talked with hard core players from private servers. He gives us information on these things, I dont see whats wrong with that.
---
The pserver and reddit manbabies dont like you saying this.
---
I swear to Elune if a hunter takes my cruel barb. Warriors i can forgive but I always felt like it was truly a rogue weapon. Those can last a long time and warriors get a wep at 30. 
---
And I will continue to fish for those as an alliance. Because that’s where the money is. 
---
Lol this whole sub and classic is a safe space for you manbabies. Mention a change in wow and youre all triggered.
---
&gt; I can totally understand that grinding is necessary as there simply wasn't enough time for horde content during the end of development
---
What? where'd you find this out at
---
I’m playing warrior right now on pserver and I’ve skipped a few of the prot spell upgrades like revenge rank 2 or 3. Can’t remember the others. Think I skipped mocking blow rank 2 also. In total I think I’ve overlooked like 4 spell upgrades. Probably saving me around 10g by lvl 40 
---
the most banned item in raids
---
Not with today’s streamlined stats. 
---
Sounds like this post wasn't for you. You have permission to move along without interacting with it..
---
Pom pyro spec is decent as a horde mage and garbage as an alli mage. 
---
Like with frost spec. It loses a lot of offensive power as a horde mage and defensive power as an alli mage. Great thing about alli v horde is the pally v shaman differences. 
---
Yup, hunter and/or mage for grind. Feral is decent too but you need to  into that sort of thing and the whole life as a druid. Warlock is easy but rarely as fast of a leveler overall.
---
Many level hunters but never take them deep into raiding. Mage players tend to keep it as main more but still great aoe grinder and kiter for money.
---
Many players level a mage, hunter or even feral just to get a fast 60 for money grind and to zone log to stomp gankers against their alts they level after. The leading edge levelers on private servers do this. They rarely face the ganking issues later players face because they leveled before the honor system hits the game and they ensure they can gank you harder than getting ganked. And yes, one must ponder how it is those players who have the big ego when they make the game as pansy to play as possible.
---
Every single opinion or insult I sling as players is because I've done the same. Self-depricating and experience always backs my words.
---
I only see this occurring on the servers that attract the largest percentage of hardcore private servers. If you want to play in this style then find out where the large guilds on large servers are headed and join them. It can be fun, but over 2 years of doing it has burned me out and my life philosophy has changed so it's a consideration for me.
---
If you are new and want a front running leveler, choose a mage, hunter, feral or even warlock (just affliction macro level and chain mobs endlessly ... not at the same time). Hit 60 ASAP. Level your alt before the Honor system hits the game too. This is very important.
---
I don't think you really understand my point, but I don't care enough about this case to argue any more so I will leave it here.
---
The problem with mogging is that you dont feel the progression on your char. In vanilla I loved to inspect people with epics. And when someone had a full tier you had respect for it because you know that he cleared something. You did /drool to a person who had epics. I dreamed that I had epics. 
---
once more since you're dumb AF...
---
NO ONE USED SOR IN TBC UNLESS YOU WERE A SHOCKADIN
---
the 2.1 nerf was specifically aimed at Seal of BLOOD
---
Blizzard nerfing SoR was them saving the trouble of doing it in 2.2 cuz Paladins would have started using cloth spell damage gear instead of Ret gear
---
I also prefer episode 3. As the episodes progress the gear and the attitude changes a bit. I loved the power the 1st video(ep 3) has over the audience as it introduces the world to roguecraft. This video launched a genre. 
---
" No one playing 16 hour days is going to be playing just to annoy streamers"
---
Oh.. my sweet summer child.. 
---
You have a lot to learn about the World, of Warcraft. 
---
hahahahaha I cant wait to see how this plays out actually now that streaming exists in the state it does today. Bet we will get some great clips and stories
---
There’s always PVE servers for those precious little snowflakes that can’t handle the idea of getting ganked by a higher level toon... 
---
Gankers are people who live for the salty tears that inevitably flow from the eyes of those poor, poor souls that are forced to experience the non consensual PvP that you open yourself to by logging in on a PvP server... You don’t have to like it, but you certainly have to deal with it! Else play PVE lol...
---
It tempers my excitement, for sure.
---
Well it's an open admission of "guilt" on blizzards site. Furthermore I'm fairly certain I recall it being mentioned in the WoW Dev Diary.
---
Ultimately they did Alliance Quests first. Horde Quests have been done pretty late in the dev process. That's also why horde has a bunch more really annoying "collect XYZ" than alliance does :)
---
Speak for yourself. I do feel that my character has progressed, whenever I get new gear and I am able to push through tougher content, whether I look different or not. But again, I do not want it in Classic. 
---
So I've heard this and I've also heard that pallys and warlocks have to spend an extra 100g on their skills as they level, thus negating the money they save. Does anyone know if this is true?
---
Most efficient duo when it comes to dungeons and adapting to various situations always includes a Druid. While leveling they make the best tanks and can dps higher than most other classes just wearing greens.
---
It doesn't sound like either of you want to play one however.
---
that 30 year old boomer who doesnt know about zoomers pretending to be 30 year old boomers
---
Looks great!
---
Also explains why Horde is better at PVP, all the players are hostile from doing shitty quests
---
Reminds me of Kharazan.
---
Yeah I can. When they hit certain HP thresholds, I know what kind of gear they are wearing approximately. And if they are a certain spec, I know what stats they are stacking since the stats are streamlined. Although I feel like there are BiS theorycrafts and whatnot in every MMO, even in Classic WoW, but that's another topic.
---
There's also an abundant amount of research proving that Freakonomics bullshit is absolutely stupid. Going after the users has never worked and never will. Risking jail time or losing your account isn't a deterrent. Know why? Because it's pretty obvious it isn't since that would mean gold selling wouldn't exist, and the rate of drug use would be lowest where the punishment is the harshest. It's the other way around. Even on private servers you can't go 5 minutes without a gold spam whisper. Classic is going to be much worse than that. Controlling the market is always the best weapon to remove criminal third party suppliers. Doesn't matter what it is. If you don't do that, that's when you create a black market. Obviously you need to weigh pros against cons (selling heroin over the counter isn't going to be worth it for example), but in the case of letting players sell gold to other people that's BY FAR the less harmful option than having Chinese bots all over the place.
---
However, tokens aren't going to be added so it's a moot point. We'll be stuck with the more intrusive, more harmful kind of gold selling you prefer. 
---
This Tipsout clown is the worst he has no idea about classic or how it works. Proven dickhead. This is the same guy that advocates needing on stuff just to vendor it. What a PoS.
---
I mean its literally impossible it stance dance every fear on Ony and Nefarian. The cooldown for Berserker stance is 30 seconds and they fear every 15 seconds or so.   
---
So you can have aggro swap to your off tank and make sure you guys stagger which fears you immune for. But that dramatically lowers your threat cieling and gimps your melee dps. Not a huge deal, but can really hold you back on Nef especially.  
---
But you are right, fear ward can become a crutch. It's kind of hard for tanks to learn to time the stance dance when they literally never eat a fear because they are fear warded 24/7. 
---
I suppose there’s always first person mode.
---
So dope. Is there a stormwind theme?
---
Mogging not telling you very little is the belief on non-roleplayers.
---
Roleplay commonly uses what a player believes the character would wear in a situation or event depending on context in that setting.
---
For example if you wanted to play a barbaric orc that is bare chested a costume or transmog system allows that - though to state it doesn't work well with the PvP system WoW has which promotes being able to identify a players gear.
---
I would personally be happy to see a faction only costume system. Maybe a toggle that the other faction can turn ON to see the other faction's costume's on rp servers.
---
Though you can do it relatively easily by just having bags of clothes.
---
It’s cool to be one of very few in the raid. You rarely have as much competition for gear.
---
In what world without loot trading does everyone in a pug group roll need on a bop item? Wtf.
---
Clueless zoomers ruining our memes.
---
30 year old boomer is a meme 
---
Haha, you're a funny one.
---
But, that’s bc armor, it’s actually looking a lot like my warrior with his bis pre raid gear.
---
Elemental Mastery for elemental Shaman is off GCD.
---
What is his twitch? 
---
Thanks
---
People are right, play what you want. You will still be fine. But honestly a TON of people are the same, they think dwarf is ugly and human/nelf is pretty. So dwarf priests end up being surprisingly rare and are highly in demand. Our guild has like 7 human priests and 1 dwarf. That is the only dwarf we have actually found who can show up somewhat reliably.  Not having a dwarf priest for Nefarian, Ony, and ZG does make the instance more difficult. People say you won't regret playing Nelf or whatever race you like, but honestly every single human priest in my guild thoroughly regrets their choice of race.  
---
Dwarf priests are very good. Don't let everyone here let you forget that. It is not just a min-max thing but honestly makes a gigantic difference to have 1 or more dwarfs in raid.
---
I really don't see having fear ward in raid to deal with Ony/nefarian's fear as being a min-max thing. It makes a drastic difference in the raid.
---
Berserker Rage is a 30 second CD. Onyxia fears every 15 seconds. So does Nefarian. So does bat boss in ZG.   
---
So no, tanks can not stance dance every fear. Everyone in this thread is really underselling fear ward. It makes a huge difference on a number of encounters to not have fear ward.   
---
Another stupid example of automatic banning systems. 
---
* Utility. You have access to battle res, innervate, faerie fire, crit buff, roots, cc break, etc.
---
* Role potential. Not the best, but you can tank, dps, and heal as a druid, which give you a large group kit.
---
* Minimal loot competition. Unlike priests or warriors who are constantly fighting for gear, you will practically be thrown items for all specs.
---
I'm torn between druid and priest currently.
---
Can't wait to get my [Vanilla Weather back!](https://i.imgur.com/35Lrzv0.jpg)
---
^ this.  They have a reputation for holding the players in disdain.  If they were smart, they'd take steps to address it/engage the community.
---
Very important, especially early on in progression. Unconfirmed for now of course when it comes to actual Classic, but many quests do not hit the game until later patches. This makes fresh launch leveling the least quest assisted at any point in the game.
---
To level without running dry in quests, you must kill far beyond the quest requirements. This is why a high damage potential is one of your greatest leveling assets.
---
Players who want to level as a healer of tank spec apparently enjoy wearing chains and wondering why they level so slowly. Warrior+Priest combo where one is tank spec and the other healer is one of the least efficient leveling strategies possible.
---
Just look into what it means to farm herbs from DM. Make sure your first toon can do that.
---
The good thing is that Classic is set in stone and they can't change stuff. It was made 100% clear that they want a near perfect emulation of 2005 WoW, so I'm positive it will be like that.
---
They know that Classic is pretty much their only hope and it gives them a buffer to try and fix Retail. 
---
Hes just being extra. 
---
totally double negged myself lol
---
It’s not out yet 
---
joana
---
Streamers didn't even exist back then..
---
It was a straight up written text guide...
---
You trying to tell me you played through Vanilla without looking anything up online? Because I don't believe you.
---
One of the first...I don't remember the name (the legendary bow from Kil'Jaeden)..in the world went to a rogue. It was BiS for everyone else too unfortunately.
---
Great mouse. I have one as well. Love it. Cool mousepad too I guess... :)
---
I prefer it like this tbh
---
Thats TBC, in vanilla the overall colors are much less exaggerated, and random items fit together better.
---
Mogging is fine in retail imo. I opens up 7 expansion packs worth of content to keep doing. In classic it makes less sense
---
Good luck getting them over the guild's druids.
---
I will go for the Furblog transformation lol.
---
I love the look of the Bloodvine set! It's nice to have caster gear that can show a tabard properly.
---
As a Warlock, wearing it until Naxx...maybe not so much!
---
I have a screenshot from 2005 when I started playing, of my toon standing in the tomb/ooze area in Wetlands (forgot the name of the subzone) after I finished all the quests in the zone - just onwe of those neat moments in WoW when I had a sense of accomplishment, just looking out at the nice landscape.
---
It isnt really that elitist. Dwarf Priests are surprisingly rare. Think about it, noone wants to be an ugly dwarf. Everyone picks human or Nelf. But you really do NEED at least 1 dwarf priest in your raids, preferably more. You have what maybe like 5 priests total? So basically if you roll dwarf you will have a guaranteed raid spot and if you are non dwarf you will compete for any raid spots that aren't filled with dwarfs. If your guild finds a new dwarf priest, you might not have your raid spot anymore.   
---
Obviously, your attendance and personality play into getting a raid spot. But at the end of the day, you really need those dwarfs and they make a massive difference.  This isn't elitism. This is progressing through content where bosses fear on 15 second cds and you only have one way to deal with it.   Every single dwarf you have is like 2 more dps doing damage during fear or healers healing.
---
I'm at a loss when it comes to guessing how Blizzard will promote this. Currently, they act like this is a super secret project they don't want ANY hype over. Of course there is hype, but going back to appease a lost audience doesn't seem to jive well with their current meta-marketing scheme.
---
Due to current Blizzard and Activision woes, I think we have to wait and see if Blizzard comes out of this mess and embraces Classic as their next big launch, or they just continue to treat Classic players as their red headed step child.
---
kk
---
Oh my guild is perfect too. Mostly 20-30 somethings, mature, well adjusted people. General/Trade/World is where most of this is coming from. Playing on a newly released tbc server for reference. 
---
Do we have access to the Classic API yet?
---
Vanilla and pservers aren't running on 7.3.5.

Who wants to bet that the artist of that picture didn't see a penny out of this?

To effectively teach something, you have to be an expert of the subject matter. Bill Belichick worked his way up from assistant special teams coach, to defensive coordinator, to head coach, back to defensive coordinator, and then became coach again. 
---
He completely wastes his interviews with those hard core players because he is unable to effectively interview them due to having know knowledge of the subject matter. Him thinking that it is worth it for these people to go over every single item on old Nost BiS lists and is not able to have any meaningful discussion with these players makes the entire things a complete waste of time.
---
I don't see him cite any sources during his videos if he is getting all his information from research, so does his just plagiarize other peoples hard work for the sake of content?
---
He did actually raid for the first time last week so he is trying to learn, but that was after more than a year of making guides on a subject matter he is ignorant of. 
---
Worst scenario: ”patch 8.x.x : Classic servers available!”
---
Well, I carried that misinformation for way too long then.
---
How dare you taint this subreddit with Burning crusade pictures
---
When holy pallies crit with a heal when specced 5/5 Illumination it refunds the entire base mana cost of the spell. This makes crit essentially like getting both int and healing power. Worth noting that int also increases your spell hit so it's still really valuable in that regard.
---
The instant I 1st saw the slow word scrolling quests back in the day, I cringed. Had to go. Had to burn in fire fast!
---
Who ever thought that forced, slow reading was a good idea had a very poor thought indeed. Likely it was intended to force the window to be open longer so more people read it instead of closing it. Of course this did not occur but what annoyed me the most is that I read much MUCH faster than it scrolls and it makes me want to pull my hair out ... even if I don't want to read it.
---
It's all good though, we can turn it off.
---
Dude stop calling people sociopathic pieces of shit just because they don’t agree with you.....
---
Fun fact, I got kicked out of my first raiding guild for using this item before an imp pull in Molten Core. The raid leader kept bitching and complaining because we were wiping so I tried to bring levity to the situation and it only pissed him off worse. Guy got trolled by a 10 year old with a goof item.
---
Idk man all I'll say is getting banned is actually a pretty decent deterrent considering me and all my friends make enough money in an hour to buy more than we could farm in 10 hours but we don't because we don't want to lose our accounts. 
---

---
Yes it is faster to kill mobs as you go. If you have mana and, it's not off path. It should be dead. You should be leaving ruin in your wake where ever you go. One of the biggest reasons this is most efficient is that in classic wow. Quest hubs aren't lain out to be convenient. Many times you will be hauling ass across an entire map to finish a quest. The only reason questing is even worth it in classic is because you get the quest exp for free as long as your rolling massacre stays on track.
---
Have you heard about Subnautica below zero? Definitely gonna pick that up when I'm done with exams
---
You should try out the Aether mod for Minecraft then. I was blown away.
---
Notice how replacing the proper word "can" with the word you chose, "will", completely changes the risk-benefit dynamic of people abusing the system for their benefit.
---
I don't think anyone would have an issue with it if such abuse were actually punished. But while the benefit outweighs the risk due to low enforcement you will continue to see it abused. See also, Gloria Borger's report on YouTube copyright infringement claims abuse and video monitization.
---
Yeah. Plus it's also kinda dicey when instances were actually used. Instanced content was a pretty big deal back when, especially I think in Everquest the entire server was blowing eachother up to fight a dragon or whatever.
---
So it's worth considering that maybe all dungeons were going to be non-instanced and in the actual world.
---
Must be a hunter or healer. Can’t do that as a tank. 
---
Stockades the RFC equivalent for Alliance, it has no boss loot and is just good for quests. I think they might have done this to prevent them from being a really easy farm for high levels when they are just waiting in the city and have nothing to do. 
---
No changes are necessary... The game will (and should be) released as close as possible to the original 2004-2006 version... This isn’t WoW Classic+ and most of us don’t want that... It should be as it was at launch, with all the good and bad, as it existed then..
---
Trial accounts as of now in retail can’t send tells to anyone unless they have you(trial account) on their friends list.
---
The real way an mmorpg character is supposed to look. I despise the normalized looking green questing and blue dungeon sets you get in retail. Items have 0 fucking identity while leveling.
---
"does some 1 have a fire pot for me... plz?"   
---
Don't be that guy. Don't. Be. That. Guy.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
Pretty sure it was on GCD in classic, just like kick.
---
I wish you had this on video
---
For me it's the sharding that has me worried. Personally if you are okay with sharding on any level. You kind of don't belong in classic. I don't mean that as an angry neck beard statement it's just the reality. The attitude that the world must be broken into shards because god forbid you might be inconvenienced by the crowd has no place in classic. These people looking for this and, trying to wedge it in. Will quit classic wow by 30. This isn't the game for them. Trying to please them will not only leave them unsatisfied as you will have to do far more then simply shard the server to keep them happy. It will also leave the players you could have pleased unhappy as well.
---
Blizzard has to pick the audience they want. Do they want true classic wow which appeals to hard cores and, casuals alike. Or will they remake the current mistake they have going. Where the only people they try to please are the HC and, HC wanna be players? Hopefully they restore classic properly. 
---
It honestly wasn't so bad until TBC which introduced all the radioactive colors to the game. Case in point, the armor in that picture.
---
I don’t think you should get banned for racism or homophobia. Extreme griefing(circumventing ignore feature, etc.), botting, exploits, things of that nature should be bannable. Using words that hurt people’s feelings should not.
---
I didn't play too much on pservers but I found exactly 1 player who *seems* to be a racist or has a very bad taste of humor. The vast majority are just nice/normal people. I played WoW pretty hardcore from Vanilla to the start of Wraith and I don't think I had more than 5 people on my ignore list after years of gaming and I didn't *ever* have to report anyone. Maybe my experience was skewed because I think I played on RP-PvP for the majority of my WoW time.
---
But I definitely saw people getting temp bans every now and then for absolutely ridiculous stuff like saying something someone apparently didn't like or cursing. Just basic, normal, usually nice people getting reported and banned for diddly squat.
---
I'am a person who is very aware of this problem since a long time in multiplayer video games and I'am usually the guy who tries to de-escalate situations or calm people down. Like when someone playing with me behaves in a way that someone else *might* misinterpret as "toxic" or similar, I will point it out to my friend/teammate so nobody gets their feelings hurt.
---
Communication in multiplayer games have evolved from something that was free, aggressive and funny with alot of banter/trashtalk into something extremely curated, by people who I assume are very sour abusing the report systems. It is weird, because I'am watching my own tongue more in multiplayer games that I do in pretty much any RL situation, except if I'am talking to authorities.
---
He probably received a message but the reasons can be quite vague, something like "streaming content that is against the ToS" doesn't really tell you why you're banned.
---
You can level to 60 without ever running out of quests if you're okay with super suboptimal ones.
---
Doesn't mean the average player will without going out of their way, certainly doesn't mean you should
---
Also tip for new players. This also TOTALLY works on the opposite faction in a BG. 
---
That sucks, but dude made like 3 million back in the day with his guides, so I don't think he's hurting too bad. It'll work out.
---
Weirdly enough, I always went for good ol' Noggenfogger's elixir because I prefered the undead animations you get from being a skelly. I was a tauren warrior main back then...
---
This time I'm 100% rolling Undead. There's just nothing more badass and evil than an undead warrior. A stick warrior!
---
Dead means no one is playing. And ppl are definitely playing. It's more alive than pservers. 
---
Also this isn't a new emergent technology. Most all games in 2k19 have this technology and they all are doing fine. Look at league 
---
As far as I know combat won't break it so you could do it as anything. It's just a pain to cast it every 3 minutes xD.
---
Agree completely. It's a great system for making sure awesome looking gear doesnt go to waste the second a new expansion hits too.
---
Absolutely not
---
Blizz promises stuff constantly that they don’t deliver at BlizzCon. 
---
Well to start, you're not "master of none". Even ignoring unique utilities like Innervate and Rebirth, there are a number of things of which, as a druid, you are the indisputable master.
---
_______________________________________
---
- Health and armor
---
Nobody can rack up as much health and armor as a bear - especially armor, as bear's armor modifier is multiplicative, and applies to all armor from items. That includes trinkets and rings like Thrall's Resolve, which is a decent tank ring for warriors but is 360% effective for a bear (from an armor standpoint). This means druids are the undisputed kings of pure EHP and mitigation. Their weakness as a tank is that they can't become uncritable to bosses, but not all bosses crit and not everything that needs tanking is a boss.
---
- Threat
---
Bear threat is incredible. Again, it's multiplicative (compared to warriors' additive abilities), meaning your threat scales better with damage and gear than anyone else's. In a well-geared raiding guild, the DPS are going to be out-pacing warrior tanks in threat. A bear tank doesn't have that issue, provided equivalent gear. Once threat becomes a limiting factor in fights, bears get the opportunity to really shine. Bears are the #1 tank for "farm content", where DPS threat has outscaled warriors, and druid/healer gear is sufficient to brute-force through inevitable crits.
---
- Powershifting
---
Did you know that cat druids can top the DPS charts? Just pick up a Wolfshead Helm and get your macros together, because a well-geared cat will absolutely tear those meters up, pun intended. It's one of the harder rotations to pull off, but absolutely possible and very viable. I'm talking "beats rogues and warriors" viable.
---
- Healing
---
Obviously, druids are very capable healers. More focused on raid healing than tank healing, but still very potent. A healing role also provides ample opportunity for Rebirths, Innervates, and decurses.
---
- Versatility
---
This may seem like an oxymoron and the definition of "master of none", but do not underestimate a druid's versatility. A druid adds a level of redundancy to every group position that can massively help prevent trouble or wipes. No warrior can stop rotation to throw heals to supplement a struggling or downed healer. No mage is going to be able to tank the rest of the boss encounter after the main tank goes down.
---
Play to these strengths and the druid class will take you far. If you are looking to just perform one role to the best of your ability, unwilling to shift mid-fight into another role as needed, then yes, you will find them to be "masters of none".
---
Not that simple; if no one plays classic, they could justify it by saying people don’t have interest in the old game. They may not view it as disliking their changes.
---
Ironfoe/Mirahs song*
---
Does no one remember how transmog worked when it was first created? You had to have the actual piece of gear on your toon in order to transmog, plus it cost a non-trivial amount of gold. You couldn't possibly get rid of the feeling of progression, because you had to get the piece of gear first before you could use it in a transmog. 
---
So if I like the way Might or Valor looks over Wrath, I don't have to gimp myself to look the way I want my character to look.
---
You do know that interview doesn’t say No sharding right? Only that they are looking into it, which is all they have said on it.
---
"Don't laugh it helps!"
---
Hi, /u/panska
---
And clearly you're not representative for the entire player base since gold selling is still a major business. Harm reduction applies here too imo. 
---
A lot of pre70 dungeon gear was reskins of vanilla armor. They were essentially placeholder like the t2 pre update and the t2.5 sets.
---
This is why I'm not so worried. They said they want to remake classic, so they don't have a choice but to recreate the experience as authentically as possible. Anything else wouldn't be classic, and what would be the point of some weird hybrid? Who would that appeal to? Classic enthusiats won't play it. Retail players won't play it.
---
Towards the end of vanilla, it wasn’t uncommon for pugs to form. Most guilds were not farming it anymore so if you had an alt you had to join pugs. But your alts were great and some of your friends would join you on mains. 
---
Using a faulty system to report someone who is not breaking any rules in order to try to get them banned/punished sure sounds like abusing it to me.
---
Youre awesome for wanting something better out of this game. Fuck the haters.
---
lol fuck off. They stream sniped the time and location of the tourney, then showed up and did everything in their power to ruin it. 
---
Because he said he puts in 70 hours a week developing his guides, including testing out XP per minute for all sorts of routes.
---
Trinkets have 30 second on use cd in 1.12
---
They were watching the stream to see who was dueling then spamming hots on the players or adding buffs that weren't allowed. They put effort into fucking up the duel tourney. 
---
I'd say mage. You make gold porting people and then from 52-60 you just solely farm Dire Maul. You will make a TON of gold farming DM for those levels.
---
Stratholme was cool for having a ton of hidden bosses. There was that Postmaster guy that spawned from opening 3 mailboxes with keys dropped by a courier (who dropped the Magister's Boots and led to some groups to ban mages because they didn't want to run around doing it), the Unforgiven in the section between Scarlet and UD (who came out of nowhere and always suprised people doing a full run for the first time), and the minibosses for training hammersmithing and swordsmithing. It was incredibly well designed from a lore perspective.
---
Why? He deserves recognition, he put in an incredible amount of work and effort over the years and is still doing it to this day. Why hate on the guy? 
---
sexy
---
I got the package one that got vanilla and TBC +free server time
---
that's kinda how blizz always was, back in vanilla wow the hype was the fact that the game was coming and there was a stress test beta period
---
Honestly , If you had to choose between one good human priest and a mediocre dwarf priest, you might still take the dwarf. Especially if he is one of the only dwarfs you have
---
Don't know, releases summer of 2019, only thing I really care about. If they fumble it and it sucks I just won't sub. The game is 14 years old at this point and there isn't much to learn about the game. Yes I get it, things like sharding and stuff but kicking and screaming hasn't worked in the past so there's no use worrying so much about it. If they don't make Classic as Vanilla-like as possible. Make it known on unsub and stop paying for the product.
---
Oh ok. I'm glad I didn't know that.
---
I have two questions:
---
1. What axe is that?
---
2. Why is it pierced?
---
Then they've improved because I remember getting absolutely zilch from them when they banned my account. I was streaming private servers so I knew why I was banned (or at least I think so), but still a notice would be nice. 
---
This argument makes no sense. Fear isnt ever an issue in MC. Horde have tremor totem. Noone is saying every priest needs to be dwarf. But a dwarf will be preferred over human every single time in BWL and Ony.
---
does it just not rain like that anymore?
---
This was bought sometime in 2004, i've also found the boxes for TBC and WOTLK.. i quit after that, do they still do boxes or it's all digital nw?
---
It wold be nice if you could use a same colour set over the whole items
---
Ok, thank you very much. In fact I only found track of this in the Official Guide, but thought was discarded early before actual game release
---
Ok, didn't remember she was untargetable. Probably removed this choice before game launch then (or Official Guide is wrong)
---
Mana potion, dark rune/demonic rune, warlock demonic sacrifice, warrior/bear enrage, any interrupt ability, most defensive cds.
---
We might have to wait for another 2-3 months before getting an update and that update will most likely include the official date aswell. I do hope we get another dev post before that though, I always enjoy reading about the progression of classic.
---
In the case of Angwe. He should be banned he was cheating. All of that being said. If you are of the disposition to whine about pvp because it's unfair or you don't want to right now. You do not belong on a pvp server. Consent and, fairness's are antithetical to war. The entire point of a pvp server is to make the world feel at war.
---
For me two of the best areas in classic are Hillsbrad and, STV. I love the fact lowbies go in and, stream out like refugees. It makes the game way better. I couldn't imagine playing on a pve server and, feeling safe. That being said if pve is what you want go do it and, stay the hell outa mines with your reporting bull shit asses.
---
Everyone one should be disappointed. How long has it been since they’ve spoken about it? They treat classic like the black sheep of the Blizzard IPs, even though the success of classic can determine the longevity of the company given that every other blizzard ip is going down or has gone down the shitter. Jagged treats OSRS and their community with respect, with weekly or monthly twitch QnAs and updates on the game. 
---
1) One thing to add.. That is not what I (and I suspect OP would agree with me) think of, when we say that "world pvp was killed by flying mounts".
---
Yes, there was a lot of world pvp action in contested farming areas like the elemental plateau.
---
BUT.
---
The thing that flying mounts did was fundamentally change the "danger" aspect of world pvp. 
---
Before flying mounts, if you fucked around and bit off more than you could chew.. you might be stuck there. Pick on someone too much, they call their friends, next thing you know youre getting camped by several people, spread out in a pattern to catch you when you try to rez. If they know the lay of the land, they may even go camp the graveyard you will gy rez at. This gives the world a very real and dangerous feel to it and makes having friends matter, makes for epic chase scenes across multiple zones when you finally break away, all that kind of stuff.
---
With a flying mount, all you need is a 1.5 second cast time after you rez and then you hold spacebar. Boom. Out of danger. All the camping doesnt matter. None of your actions have consequences. Hell if you were a druid you could shift into flight form instant-speed  even lol.
---
I suspect this is what he was referring to, because those epic "emergent gameplay" sandbox type encounters are some of my best memories from vanilla, and while leveling in TBC too. They started happening less frequently as more and more people started getting flying mounts :(
---
Getting hit will dispell it.
---
Is there an alliance version? Like storm wind or IF?
---
Hahaha, didn’t catch this response until now but it gave me a good laugh.
---
Aw, that's a bummer then. I wanted to PvP like that xD.
---
Leveling in vanilla and leveling in retail are two completely different things. On retail you blitz from quest objective to quest objective, killing the bare minimum just trying to finish your task. In vanilla, about 50% of your total exp will come from mobs. You need to look at the game entirely differently. Your main method of leveling is not to quest. No that is a bonus. Think of it like this, you were gonna kill those mobs for exp anyway, but now you get some bonus exp for killing them. This is the mindset you need otherwise you will be running from stonetalon to barrens to ashenvale to hillsbrad wasting hours walking without mount and wonder why it's taking forever.
---
Millions of these were sold, so I guess it makes sense we see a million pictures of them on this sub.
---
A warlock and Shadow Priest is an amazing combo. Vampiric embrace from the Spriest will heal you, and shadow weaving will help you do more damage. Add in all the warlock utilities and fears from both of you ill will be amazing.
---
Didn't Method stop being a competitive guild and start focusing on being a social streaming community ever since some drama about girls/girlfriends joining?
---
You could probably shield or possibly even D.I. Windsor to protect him against the damage that would normally cause him to die. 
---
Me, though I'd love to buy a print from them
---
That's one of the best reasons for sure :)
---
For PvP you probably won't be using swords if you can help it...
---
I don't even really care anymore whether they release it or not, or when. The announcement plus this sub got me nostalgic enough for vanilla wow that I went the pserver route months ago. Whatever inaccuracies exist on pservers, my itch is getting scratched. I think they would have been better off not hyping even as much as they did until they were closer to release. They're modernizing and polishing and goldplating, and meanwhile other groups are drinking their milkshake.
---
You will stab faces.
---
I know I'll be able to get a group in raid content, I'm a lot more worried about dungeons with people not wanting to bring me instead of a warrior and not instead of a shamm/pally/priest either
---
This chart varies based on level.  For example in your chart killing a mob 2 levels lower than you gives 25% less experience.. this is not the case in higher levels.  I don't have the numbers but someone posted them a while back.  Once you get into the 40-50s you will definitely be wanting to kill mobs 1-2 levels lower than you cause the reduction in exp is less significant than it is here shown at level 15.
---
How were they placeholder? They never got updated.
---
“I never watched the hyperbolic other videos, but watch my hyperbolic video where you literally can’t play the game.” Other than you can play the game.
---
So, you expect mythic raiding in Classic and mythic+ Scholomance runs?
---
Duude...get a grip.
---
Vanilla and e-sports?
---
LMAO !
---
I imagine a lot of the developers got back from vacation in early-mid January. I'd say it is pretty normal to not hear much at this point. I would expect more news sometimes later this month or early March if I had to guess.
---
I doubt much got done for it throughout December and early January. 
---
It's been over 2 months and not a word out of them. If there is no word by March and a Beta test schedule then we should all be worried.
---
In the end, this just proves Blizzard doesn't give a shit about the gamers, just the $$$$$$ at the end of the road. How hard is it to release a 1 paragraph update and a fucking picture of something we haven't seen yet? They only care about money now.
---
For gold? Be a mage and make portals and food/water.
---
Haven't seen any the past few days i've been reading this sub.. makes sense to share the picture on this sub.
---
I don't see the point after you get a mount. A majority of the time you are passing low level mobs that give no XP. Why would you kill them? I've never killed every mob on the way to any quest and I never have problems with my leveling speed or needed to grind levels on mobs.
---
I don't remember anyone calling arena epics welfare though. Even the BoJ gear cost so many fucking badges it was nuts. It was also almost never an upgrade outside of a few instances. WotLK just rained purples from the sky though. 
---
Art department was probably too busy working on sunwell+wotlk. Keep in mind vanilla-wotlk each added a whopping 24 dungeon+raid instances each. Compared to mop-bfa that's double the amount of environments the art team would need to create.
---
Your only disadvantage to finding a 5-man group is not having a true resurrection spell. This doesn't matter as long as your group 1) doesn't royally suck, or 2) has a DPS shaman, priest, or paladin.
---
Other than that, bear tanks are better at tanking 5-mans than they are raids. Their primary weakness (being critable), is a lot less problematic when you're not facing raid bosses. Especially once the server has progressed a good bit, well-geared DPS are going to prefer a bear tank's threat over a warrior's, even in 5-mans.
---
Let’s not forget class fantasy! Shifting and filling roles is very satisfying. Their strengths really shine when leveling with friends 
---
&gt;official game guide
---
There are tons of inconsistencies and outright false claims in that. This is one of them. His death is scripted.
---
I've never heard that claim. In my experience leveling a Warlock, anecdotally, it *felt* like I had more gold at 60 including just the gold that I collected along the way.
---
Scholo and strat are more difficult then mc and on par with ony imo
---
I'd personally go for 30/0/21. NS is a huge boost defensive and I have seen some fun insta-wrath clips from time to time. Can't answer to the rest though. I am also considering druid for Classic but only time will tell.
---
Why do you say make an alt before honor system? No time after?
---
Magma-fking-dar
---
I may be misremembering, but I'm pretty sure pvp epics were referred to as welfare epics.
---
Don’t be a clicker is the answer
---
Just a side note on threat: if you’re worried about not holding threat in any situation, the mace from Gnomer (3 uses) increases your atk speed for a brief period, so you can rattle off an insane amount of mauls. Possibly the fastest threat generation in the game. The only downside is you have to farm a bunch of them prior to each raid. 
---
im running on 1.12 on a pserver
---
should i have posted elsewhere? doesnt seem to be a generic "pserver" subreddit
---
You could be right. It's not like they were a new concept though (ranked gear). They were also complete trash for PvE because of stat distribution. 
---
Hide helm and put on a tabard. It'll clean up.
---
You just need to have access to a second account
---
There's never been an offline version of retail wow. What are you talking about ?
---
The thing that gets me is that they said they would consider the community input when it comes to things like 10 or 15 man raids etc.  But since they are so tight-lipped it seems like they’re not listening. 
---
They’re awesome in 5 mans, but try to get a priest/pally/sham in the group if you’re the healer. For tanking 5 mans, they’re just as good as a warrior provided some pre-raid BiS gear is equipped. 
---
He is by far the biggest Douche bag streamer
---
US-Destromath here. Was in masquers for a while
---
I'd actually be very interested in reading more about warriors vs druids tanking 5 man. As far as I've read warrior's have better threat in 5's. My plan was to tank dungeons and heal in raids as far as I can but I haven't tried it on any pserver och in vanilla so don't know how viable it actually is.
---
r/wowservers is generally for pservers
---
This sub.... because making a decision based on how it affects gameplay is  "the evil min/max mindset".  This is an RPG lmao
---
This. 100% this. Also useful to escape in these situations. 
---
Didn't stop some of my guildies from trying. 
---
Fair point. It's just that people make it sound like rolling any other Ally race as Priest is a waste of a character, which is silly.
---
Let's not forget about the whole [Aurius](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Aurius_Rivendare) quest, that was a great story inside the instance.
---
Hunter with herbalism is actually bad since you can’t track beasts and herbs at the same time. IMO 
---
FJLOL
---
[omg](https://media.giphy.com/media/6cIsv9kEbkjO8/giphy.gif)
---
It's not a waste of a character. But dwarfs are consistently the preferred race for all content for vanilla. It isn't like the above guy said, you will still get raid spots as a NElf. However, if you are NElf, and a dwarf priest joins your guild, you could lose your raiding spot to him. Fear ward brings alot to the raid. Most guilds will keep you around if you are reliable/social/fun to play with/ skilled. But as soon as you are struggling with progression because your tank doesn't have fear ward, your raid spot may be  in  jeopardy. You try explaining to a guild of 50 people that we can't progress past Nefarian because we have too many nice  Night Elf priests in the guild.
---
ok thanks
---
There are group of farmers in all good farming areas of the game...imagine going there to make some gold, and being reported, just because you are chipping that group profits.
---
Sure, it will be clearly and abuse...the problem is that while there is an automated reporting system that will fuck you up...there isn't NOTHING automatically you can do to report the abusers.
---
You will have to open a ticket and hope that some GM will actually inquiry those guys that reported you.
---
And since the ONLY REASON that loot trade and right-click report exist is to REMOVE THE HUMAN Game Masters...GOOD LUCK finding a GM that will answer your ticket.
---
It will probably get them WEEKS to answer your report...IF THEY WILL ACTUALLY ANSWER IT. You will still be muted, and the farmers won't be touched...because guess what : THERE ARE NO GMs left ! 
---
They have been replaced by automated systems.
---
No way ! That's awsome. My char name was Shady. Human rogue. 
---
I thought it was like sacrilegious to say his name around here. 
---
That was sort of my thought too. Thanks for responding! NS seems like a fun skill to use. 
---
Another moron that never played Vanilla that's trying to tell us how it's going to be....If you played Vanilla then you would know that sometimes it was impossible to report players. It was hard enough to report someone with a normal name and almost impossible if they had special characters in their name. They ONLY way to report someone that just ran out of range or went stealth was to use /who for the zone, if there were a lot of people it wouldn't show everyone.
---
Honestly I have no fucking clue why you are talking about Artifact. What they did is nothing like what Blizzard is doing. What exactly does a game dev fucking over their player base with micro transactions and P2W BS? How exactly is that even remotely similar to adding a right click report feature?
---
&gt;I've never played recent blizzard games so i don't completely know what this report function is like
---
Seriously? You don't even know what the report function is and you are bashing it like you do? I guess this is why you compare to totally different things and act like they are the same.
---
lol. this was me in 2005-2006. 
---
playing on a p. server now and i'm tanking all the low level instances and my brain kinda has taken over and makign me realize i know exactly how to get through wc. clear all the mobs up top when you zone in for the final murlock boss quest, makes escorting the tauren a non-wipe situation.
---
jump down into the river stream and clear everything in both directions. when you clear one direction you are eventually taken back to the stream and able to clear the opposite way. 
---
basically you can only go 2 ways in the instance which lead you back to the original fork, and you gotta clear the 'optional' enemies up top in service of a escort later.
---
as a kid it seemed so complicated but having so many lightbub moments when needing to be the guy who runs and shows everyone the way to go. 
---
I was definitely not THAT hunter in the raid. I just enjoyed going by foot more, also it was a medium-heavy RP guild and it suited me. 
---
Not going to happen. Why?
---
Because the GMs are replaced by automated systems.
---
There won't be anyone that will read a ticket reporting system abusers.
---
i played a warlock in classic
---
you want the fucking trinket
---
soul harvester looks cool for about 4 levels til you replace it.
---
How much silver was it again? Boy that takes me back when I was so young and didn't understand why people did it but it looked "cool" so why not but I recall it draining quite a bit of my money.
---
Yeah no dispelled easily. 
---
I was saying it wasn’t hard.. with all the stats being the exact same at each item level...
---
So you can go back to fishing in AB
---
Why? Because THEY can.
---
Also, you don't have to pay cash for a subscription...the gold pinata in Retail allows you to do it for free.
---
I have 3 accounts in WoW, a full Bnet balance, 10 tokens on each account AND enough gold to support all my accounts for 2 years.
---
Retail players that HATE Classic will absolutely abuse this system, using secondary accounts.
---
Because that worked LIKE A CHARM with Battle for Shitzeroth, right?
---
You could mention the tauren's slightly increased range, though it's kinda obscure information.
---
Makes more sense, my bad. It was never hard for me though during any expansion.
---
At least you didn't call them "bad boys" like half the hoarders do.
---
this comment should be higher. I remember private servers more clearly (cause it is obviously was not that long ago), that vanilla gear was noy nearly as wonky as tbc in this regard.
---
But i guess OP just wanted to farm some karma
---
There is a wowservers subreddit, that might be better.  Or a subreddit for the server you're on.
---
This subreddit is more for discussion of Classic.  Private Server discussions come up a lot as they pertain to Classic (i.e. how Classes work, dungeons work, etc) but things that are specific to private servers generally aren't.
---
Same, I only took one video of vanilla and the artifacting was so bad it was basically unwatchable sadly.
---
ditto minus the prot aspect 
---
Thats why transmog was such a good addition to the game.
---
Its not about calling people retards.
---
Its about abusing the system without anyone even talking.
---
Wanna fuck up the other guild Main Tank in BWL, because your guild was owned in a PvP brawl at the entrance? No problem, just report that Main Tank and you fucked up the raid for an entire guild.
---
There, nobody talked, just PLAYED the game. Yet, the system will fuck up the raid for an entire guild...and that in the first phase. Because the guild that had their main tank reported will report the other guild main tank.
---
Talk about  chain reaction?
---
This right-click crap system will cause an entire game to fail miserabily.
---
I disagree. At launch, it's not a case of "might" be inconvenienced, you WILL be inconvenienced, since one zone is not designed for hundreds of players to quest in at the same time.
---
If they plan on keeping sharding any further than the launch, or applying it for anything else other than the launch, then yes, I agree, that would also have me concerned. 
---
Please explain the "other way around" Nefarian with no fear ward/Tremor Totem.
---
already moved the question over there, thanks!
---
Joana is a legend, but so you are you!
---
It's on the wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
(second to last question)
---
It doesn't have a source, but I clearly remember hearing this around the time of the last Blizzcon. 
---
May I ask why you would not return in this case? It seems to be the most user friendly (outside of just paying for the game once and no sub, which isn't wow's style).
---
Druids are garbage. Master of none. Are you planning to innervate yourself instead of a priest because you're rolling the regrowth healing meter whore spec? You're basically an innervate + buff bot.  No wonder Blizzard made druids so OP because they were so terrible in vanilla.
---
They literally got world first today with \~160k viewers
---
Haha me to I jumped on a pserver couldn't wait
---
* Depends on the quality of your guild raiding and server economics. Best case scenario - 0. 
---
* Depends on the content stage and whether your guild is progressing. It could range from 1 night a week up to three or even four, with each session lasting up to 4 hours. 
---
* Not really if you know what you are doing. You can make 40-60g per hour as a warrior regardless of your spec. 
---
* You don't need flasks if you're not MT. Consumables mean faster and cheaper runs in a long run. 
---
* Quite fast, you can get your stuff within a few days if you're lucky. 
---
* Herb/Alch is nice. BS is probably the hardest profession to level and it does not pay off unless you have raid-tier recipes. Usually there is a single blacksmith in the guild which gets all the recipes funneled, and if you are not going to put effort to become that guy, then it's almost useless.
---
100% this!!! will do the same. there is no reason for me to rush to 60 by skipping anything.
---
100% this!!! will do the same. there is no reason for me to rush to 60 by skipping anything
---
If you do it twice? Yes, at at least one of those times they had different numbers of apples. you are tremendously bad at kindergarten math. 
---
No, because it's not stated there and I don't remember trivial values from 14 years ago. But it's irrelevant, as my claim was never about a certain amount of gold and silver, but relative values. 
---
I'm *pretty* sure that when I first set foot in Outland, I was wearing a combination of the full Feralheart (8-piece) and AQ20 (weapon/cloak/ring "Symbols of Unending Life") sets.  Matched.
---
Sure, that didn't last, but I felt it was important to give a good first impression...
---
(Still have that full Feralheart set in void storage.)
---
They did? Glad to see they're on form then and what I heard was completely wrong, reminds me of the old days
---
Not just A piccolo, but a Piccolo that forces all in range to dance.
---
Which your quote says nothing about in terms of what classic will be like. Was it maybe lowered to be exactly the same as the other classes? Possibly. Your claim that it's more expensive for druids is not in any way proven by that. 
---
Might is going to go onto the tanks, rogues and hunters/pets as well. If you have a situation where you have 39/40 people in raid and you are between a 3rd paladin or 8th warrior dps, you would take the paladin. But if you are only bringing 2 paladins to raid in the first place, you aren't minmaxing right as paladins are helpful even outside of blessings.
---
A "balanced" raid would have around 20 people who could make use of Might. That's 3700 AP overall to the raid.
---
If your raid is tryhard enough to try and minimize healers as much as possible, you stack more melee than casters, meaning closer to 25-27 people who would make use of Might, almost 5000AP overall to the raid.
---
So if you have a hypothetical choice between a Ret (lol) and another DPS war, you would take the Ret.
---
If you are tanking or PvPing no, but if you want to min-max PvE damage you must roll a human for the +Sword Skill as there is nothing comparable to it. If you go any other race you could technically use edgemasters gauntlets and onyxia axes or other weapons (might even be easier to get overall depending on competition) but you will always be 1 slight step behind others especially as you get into higher gear tiers and you can start mixing and matching your gear to hit certain hit/crit caps on different bosses depending on your raid makeup etc.
---
If youre just wanting to have fun, definitely do the race you want - but if you are the type who will use a spreadsheet with formulas to find your theoretical max dps and wants to be cutting edge 1st on the dps meters you will 100% need to be human
---
Warlocks have to buy pet skills that adds up to about 90g (if you buy them all but you don't have to). Not sure about pallys.
---
&gt; Its not about calling people retards.
---
Apparently you haven't been reading the other responses.  A lot of people were legitimately complaining about "SJWs ruining WoW because I can't flame without repercussions."
---
Your stuff about people abusing the system is completely legitimate, and I discussed it in my post to which you're responding.
---
Highfive! Pally bros unite!
---
I remember back when weather effects were added. Was awesome.
---
Took me ages to get this on my hunter
---
I personally think strat was the pinnacle of instance design from this era, BRD was just awesome, but in terms of lay-out and bosses, quests and events I think Strat is the unsung hero.
---
The way it should always have been. 😉
---
I'm sorry, I must have misread your first comment. Thought it said you'd have to get BFA.
---
I'm totally fine with paying a monthly subscription for Classic. But having to buy the latest expansion, would be a no-go for me and to be honest, with all the crazy shit that's been going on with Activision-Blizzard, I wouldn't put it above them.
---
Good news though, a monthly fee I expect, but nothing else.
---
But that's not what we care about, we care about how it looks at the end.
---
There is no other explanation, he probably started late cata.
---
Early cata was not easy epics (maybe debatable to some degree, but compared to Wrath, no), you most certainly did wipe during dungeons, and you also had to talk, at least to set up cc and pulls, as you couldn't aoe everything down like you could in Wrath. 
---
Early cata, to this day, is my favorite version of WoW.
---
2k006
---
Doesn’t your head hurt with those blinkers?
---
Pretty much the only bad thing about early cata. The low lvl zone/quest and dungeon redesign were mostly great, it just needed to be harder. 
---
Where did you get this? It's seriously awesome 
---
Gotcha! Thanks!
---
 
---
* How much time daily did you spend farming for flasks/elixirs/other raid consumables?
---
   * Depends on how you play it. Flasks cost about 50g on my server. I farmed the AH for alot of my gold and leveraged my professions to make most of my money. I also sold herbs and ore. I'd guess if you were specificly farming for 50g it might take a warrior between an hour to two hours to make 50g.
---
* How many nights a week was typical for raiding in vanilla? How long did each raid night go?
---
   * I ran an AQ20 one night a week. We did ZG and ony in one night. And MC when we were first clearing was 2 nights, then down to 1, then down to part of a night then we did BWL the rest of that night and another night. On average 3-4 hours a night.
---
* Was it difficult farming your required mats as a warrior? Or did someone from the guild help you out?
---
   * Guildies always helped me make things I couldn't, and I did the same. I always provided most of my own mats though.
---
* Will flasks/consumables be as necessary this time around, since the fight mechanics are all known?
---
   * That is going to depend on your gear and your guild. We can't really answer that.
---
* How long did it take you to get your pre raid BiS?
---
   * I never got a few of the drops. I went into MC without BIS. It was fine. I did get decent gear but not BIS. Couple of weeks of dungeon farming.
---
* Was it best to go herb/alch as a tank and make your own flasks/elixers? Or Mining/BS for gear while levelling and as a fresh 60?
---
   * Ideally you would be BS(armorsmith) and Engineer. But that requires a mining alt. I was a BS/Miner and it was fine.
---
* Was any/all of this different for Off Tanks?
---
   * I expected my OTs to have flasks. They didn't use as many consumables as me, but they had to farm up extra gear because they had to DPS on some fights and tank on others. I always tanked. I had lots of armor sets but still. OT is generally a little less work but not too much. 
---
If wearing a dress will aid me in my quest to rid the world of evil then by the light I will wear a dress!
---
Oh, agree, that would be stupid, it would make no sense. 
---
Quentin Tarantino disapproves. 
---
ZG and AQ20 were at the time of their release.
---
&gt; I think this says a lot about your mentality. You appear to believe that people need to be controlled: both the people who say or think the "wrong" things and the people who would be influenced by the wrongthink.
---
Most people don't "need to be controlled", only a toxic minority of dickheads.
---
In a totally uncontrolled social space you get something like 8chan - a race to the bottom that quickly drives out anyone who isn't okay with what happens at the bottom. You end up with a space full of racists, pedophiles, Nazis and edgelords.
---
If you don't want that you need rules, which is why subreddits like Askscience or Askhistorians are better than 8chan. They stop the race to the bottom by kicking out people who break the rules.
---
&gt; 
---
I believe that I need to control how other people affect me. If there is a system that enables me to do so (/ignore) then that is all I need. I do not want the deleterious effects of anything beyond that. I do not want to control other people.
---
I'm not okay with what happens to a game, club or forum when you let the worst dickheads run amok.
---
&gt; Trolling events, pranks, and creative chaos comprise some of the funniest WoW videos on youtube. 
---
I don't play a game with the goal of being in a funny youtube video.
---
&gt; I'm...really not sure how to explain the value of chaos in a virtual world. Your question is kind of like asking me to explain the necessity of carbon to life on Earth, in that we can drill down to the science but most people just understand that a vital element is a vital element.
---
As I see it, this is really simple.
---
If people appreciate "chaos", they won't vote to kick you off.
---
If they don't, you were deluding yourself when you decided that people liked what you were doing.
---
&gt; Total war. Some of my favorite gaming memories. Extreme immersion. If you inhibit the ability to create organic fun then you lose the extremes. Might as well play retail if all you want is a rail to ride.
---
False dichotomy, right? It's not either retail on one hand, or thinking it's great that a bunch of experienced players can summon noobs underwater or to the arse end of Silithus just to totally fuck a new player's experience because they can.
---
&gt; It seems that you have a very specific type of person in mind and then you paint a bunch of other people with that color. I do not think that is accurate. The extreme assholes will still get banned. If you're the dude who thinks that everybody who swears or attacks your character or inconveniences you is similar to someone who genuinely deserves a ban (for cheating or targetted+sustained harassment) then we can't hang out because I'd feel like I'm walking on needles.
---
I can't take this kind of pity party seriously because it has never been about banning poor little you for attacking someone on a PvP server, or inconveniencing someone in the course of legitimate play, or swearing.
---
10/10 would bang.
---
I don't think they'll change the system. rated battle grounds simply aren't a solution. Might not be a perfect system but a lot of us want vanilla warts and all.
---
&gt;Apparently through the downvotes on my previous post I hit a nerve with this thread.  Even though this is the "WoW classic" sub, not the "joanna speed running sub"; but moving on...  All I said was stop deifying streamers and to enjoy the ride.
---
People probably just flat out think you're wrong and/or think you're going off-topic, which is what I mentioned in my first comment to you. 
---
&gt; You're right and wrong though.  I can tell people what to do, they can  choose to ignore it, or not listen to it. And that's fine, I don't care  if you don't listen, or want to heed advice from me.  I don't take it  personally in that regard, so why are you getting personal and  vehemently defending this streamer as if they were your flesh and blood? 
---
I'm not even getting defensive. I'm literally giving my objective view on this. Which is that I don't see what you wrote as being any better than the guys telling people having their fun with an all-druid raid, to stack 25 warriors in shaman groups for WF, you're giving advice which everybody knows, but choose to not follow. I don't show up on a speedrunning stream and tell the streamer to maybe slow down and try to play the game at a 'normal pace' to enjoy the game more, because he's sitting and swearing and getting frustrated of not going fast enough, because of not hitting the right skips or simply can't do a specific trick. It's about knowing your audience.
---
Your entire post reeks of some old guy not understanding why someone likes to play the game in a different way, the EXACT same thing you see a huge majority going apeshit about, when the min-maxers telling people not doing so, to do it, otherwise they're idiots. 
---
Here's one example of you dictating and telling people what to do:
---
&gt; I'd go into this further but the TLDR of my comment is this: Stop deifying/idolizing streamers. 
---
You literally compared yourself compared Him/Them to Tom Brady. You can't idolize these people? To some people, someone becoming rich off their hobby which is playing WoW or some other game, is interesting and something you absolutely can idolize. To many people that could/would be a dream job.
---
Here's another one:
---
&gt; especially in a classic wow environment is missing the point of classic  wow's purpose.  It's 100% purely a nostalgic game re-release.  
---
Missing the point? Isn't the point of playing WoW, to have fun and play the game within the set rules? There's loads of thinks which weren't thought of or "the point" when making WoW, which ended up making the game fun to a lot of people. One of them being twinking in certain brackets. The huge majority seems to have been pushing for Classic, to relive and do some of the same shit they did 'back then'. 
---
And another one
---
&gt;Why would  you rush through a nolstagia trip?  Even if you did, congrats.  Now  wait for 4 other people of EQUAL skill/gear to reach your level range  before you can even begin to do dungeons. +39 more people to raid. 
---
Because to some people it's not a nostalgia trip - They've been playing Classic/Vanilla for 5-10 years on private servers. To them, it's not only nostalgia, but flat out thinking it's a better game. To other people it's a nostalgia trip and they enjoy the content at 60 and not doing all SM wings at 38, therefore they mow through the game to get to the end game grind. 
---
I mean all of these above scream of someone completely out of touch or someone not understanding some people enjoy different aspects of games. You just flat out come off as some kind of condescending person with these questions.
---
&gt; Based on your response, you're clearly a fanboy of this streamer.  Let  me put it another way then:  Tom Brady has fans.  He has fans because  he's trained his ENTIRE LIFE, put in LITERALLY blood, sweat, and tears  into becoming a famous NFL quarterback.  I don't like people who  deify/idolize celebrities or athletes any more than I like people who  deify/idolize streamers.  However the difference is that athletes and *some*  celebrities (like actors) put forth a ton of effort and train from a  very young age to achieve their goals. 
---
I rarely watch him, as you can clearly see in my post, where I write that I see him playing old recordings of Vanilla WoW, while people have replied he also play Castlevania and other games sometimes. He just so happens to be a pretty known person in both communities I frequent, which is the WoW/Vanilla community and the Speedrunning community. 
---
&gt;You'll never be able to convince  me otherwise that this "joanna" person is on the same level. I could go  into the reasons why, but that would take this thread from a somewhat  friendly debate into a more hostile argument, so suffice to say we'll  disagree there. 
---
Why would I? I never specified him as being on the same level as someone like Tom Brady. I said that he's pretty famous in the Vanilla and Speedrunning community.
---
&gt; You'd think so.  Even if he was streaming live content a few days ago,  there's no reason to stream content from 2006 unless you're trying to  indoctrinate a few more subs/followers into your cult.  I don't know who  this Johanna person is because guess what...back in 2006 Twitch didn't  exist.  And aside from people who may have played with him on the same  server, noone would care either.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; [I  will say this though, I enjoy how you glossed over my initial statement  about him streaming old content from 2006, and proceeded to strawman  the rest of my position/opinion without ever touching upon that little  tidbit and also proceeded to list off things like ADGQ (whatever that  is) and that he was world famous as valid reasons for him to stream old  content?)](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority) 
---
I didn't feel like I should answer this, which is why I didn't in the first place. But here you go. You literally did that fallacy yourself, by playing him off as if nobody would know him unless they played on the same server as him and because Twitch didn't exist back then. You literally state "noone would care either". Also, your link literally states that just because something falls under this fallacy, it doesn't mean it's wrong. According to just this thread, you can see he is pretty well known and if that's not enough for you, then do basic searches for it, and you'll see that it isn't some guy only his own server knew about. In fact, he never played on a specific server, since he was leveling new characters and playing them when new server(s) opened. This was totally besides my initial point, but you just felt like pointing out that nobody knew about him, according to you, right?
---
I know, right. It also looked like something someone with too much time on their hands would make, not a professionally made commercial. Were the mid-late 2000s really that wild?
---
Evidently, so.
---
Didn't even know these were a thing! I need!
---
No one gives a shit if you doubt it. 
---
I sure bet he means he's testing on retail, ha-ha-ha!
---
There is an on hit enhancement spell damage build that suposedly should do quite good dps. And i think an axe like ancient hakkari manslayer could work with it
---
I don’t remember any catch up mechanics. I started later . And was able to gear up and find a guild beginning their raiding. I would start and play at your own pace. It was a much different game 
---
its possible.
---
It depends on how they handle patch content but DM has many BiS gear pre AQ and to some degree AV rewards were too. AV wasn’t necessarily intended to be catch up but since it came after launch and had some really good pieces it was used that way.
---
Which would be fine if they'll just unban him. Everyone makes mistakes, but refusing to correct them for the wrong reasons is where things get hairy.
---
The teir .5 quests. In addition to ZG/AQ20. Some of the BOE items that come out of the later raids and crafted items. 
---
I think the greatest catch up mechanic is simply being carried by your guild through content they have on farm and them handing you loot they don't need at all. 
---
I started in vanilla pretty late and didn’t have much trouble finding a guild that was progressed already.
---
I also had friends who were joining new guilds that were starting to progress through mc, bwl, etc. 
---
Idk if this will be the case or not though.....that was just my experience 10+ years ago.
---
What is there really to speak about though, given they have said that Classic should be a "museum piece". Minus some details here and there its basicly already knows what we will get as we already had it 14 years ago. 
---
I recon we will see a beta in the coming months though. But unless Blizzard will follow Jagex and also decide to start creating new content i don't see much value in Q&amp;A's and stuff, while for OSRS those are pretty important as they are creating new content with community involvement. 
---
Correction: It wasn't a bad thing at all. 
---
TBC was the worst for this, because everything was fucking purple, glowed, and in general looked like JRPG garbage.
---
I think it could have worked as a storage hub. The bank has the advantage of being accessible from any major city, but being able to buy and upgrade more private storage space only accessible from one location would have been a good gold sink that wouldn't be entirely game breaking. Maybe a stable for mounts/vanity pets, a few chests, some armor racks to showcase that sentimental leveling gear, and some aesthetic changes you could make. That's it. 
---
Simple, but still cool. Nothing that would lock you down and no quests to make sure you visit every day.
---
Another reason why Classic &gt; TBC
---
TBC gear looked absurd, especially when it was mixed with items outside its set.
---
It'd have made more sense than Tauren imho.
---
This doesn't make any sense. They redid almost the entire old world, and there was more than enough xp to level up. xp from gathering nodes was and is a complete non-factor.
---
I like Guild Wars 2's system, that lets you change an items look, but only if you owned both the item with the desired appearance and the item with the desired stats.
---
https://www.deviantart.com/imadreamwalker/art/Orgrimmar-Horde-Territory-77007913
---
FYI
---
TBF Item Themes in vanilla items differed enough and what made everything look worse is that a lot of the gear had really low res textures.
---
Except for rogues, with them you could mix different tiers at least without looking like a hodgepodge of themes in a toon.
---
Dont forget NS roots! It can make a huge difference. But imo I enjoyed the moonkin form. If you stack actual leather caster gear the armor bonus is pretty damn nice. That being said I do believe the NS build is better. Also I dont think the 3 points thorns is worth it. You really dont want to be getting hit enough for thorns to make that big of a difference. As a final note you should try to squeeze in 11 points feral so you can get bear charge. Itll help you both kite melee and interrupt casters. Its pretty big.
---
leveling your DPS character first is the best way to go, otherwise you would probably need to respec a tank/healer class to farm efficiently which can be expensive
---
This was an Alliance guild opposite of my Horde guild &lt;Sadface&gt; on Malygos, the US server. They were a pretty solid guild that I believe started/formed later than some of the already well-established Alliance guilds, but they managed to full clear everything through AQ40 if memory serves, and even make some Naxx progress, before TBC launched.
---
However, they were the unfortunate victims of a ninja looting on Nefarian on their first full-clear of Blackwing Lair. This video tells the tale.
---
&gt;They treat classic like the black sheep of the Blizzard IPs
---
What have they done since Blizzcon that makes you feel that way?
---
They haven't seem to have done anything of material, maybe one BFA Q&amp;A stream?
---
Dungeon Set 2 isn't meant to be catchup gear, its far more effort and the gear caters to a different "end game" goal.
---
Only as much time as you wanted to.
---
It’s wrong that they tell us nothing. I mean why would they do that? We are customers after all...?
---
If they only give a shit about the money, wouldn't they start a marketing campaign by now? 
---
RP servers used to have a lot of people wearing nice looking matching gear in cities, because of that exactly.
---
Anyone remember the twil set? Gray quality armor that looked great be sold for a good amount of gold, even without stats.
---
The idea is if you're not constantly actively gaining XP, you are slowing down the rate at which you level.
---
As long as your route always has relevant level mobs in the way, you are gaining xp faster than say someone who JUST skips to only kill the quest npc/object and then being short in levels to do more quests down the line.
---
Fairly certain this works on the ghosts in SFK as well.
---
What's the rush? No matter what they do, not everyone is going to be happy. Most of us who are excited for Classic are going to give it a shot no matter what they decide. I'm more concerned with picking out the right server and a getting in a good guild.
---
Right? At this point im gonna be bored by classic release. In a satisfying way. I was waiting for classic mostly because pservers are mostly pvp and have a toxic community, but i recently found a good pve one with a more mature community so idgaf anymore.

Don't know if we need to be worried, for WoW Blizzard generally had 3 to 6 month beta durations. Since its slated to release "Summer 2019", which is up to the end of September 2019. Beta could start as late as end of June 2019 and still be within a reasonable timeframe if they target a end of summer release. 
---
I'd like to see a beta rather sooner than later myself also, but i don't think that it needs to be out, or known when its going to be out in march. I hope it will be though.
---
The ability to do tougher and tougher content is where you feel the progression, the armor is just something to show other people you did it.  
---
Besides, considering you have to do the content in the first place to get said armor, it’s still a bit of a moot point in Classic anyways. It ain’t like you’ll be inspecting someone wearing a transmog of Naxx stuff and they’ve never done Naxx before.
---
Postman IIRC was a nod to Carl Malone, basketball player.
---
You don't need to play on a private server to improve a route. Damn you're naive. It can at best make things worse.
---
I prefer https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0xhMxsLxG0oZVV0o
---
Bear form has better utility than Moonkin.
---
I put Strat and the entirety of BRM on the same level. Hell, Scholo as well before it was nerfed.
---
&gt; If people appreciate "chaos", they won't vote to kick you off.
---
&gt; If they don't, you were deluding yourself when you decided that people liked what you were doing.
---
This thread is about auto-bans prompted by a small number of reports. The majority can be perfectly okay with something but the offended few will be deputized to dole out bans if this automated system is implemented. 
---
it's for the animations 
---
For melee classes, the golden is 2-3 levels lower than yourself, as you will be in a god range weapon skill wise and will more likely hit the target.  Likewise, you'll also take less damage and overall kill ~50% faster for say 80% less total XP -- which is a pretty huge improvement. This doesn't even take into the economics of killing far more mobs for less healing resources required (saves you bandages and food which = money) and you'll be able to sell more stuff.
---
Excuse me, I have little to no knowledge of Vanilla. Do you mean that Zul'Gurub and Ahn'Quiraj 20-man were some kind of "catch-up" systems?
---
Even receiving a 24 or 72 hour ban will certainly get people thinking twice before false reporting someone.
---
Starting in 1.12 is already a catch up
---
I think their point is they can have fewer servers, and people won't be (more) affected by a larger population on the servers. 
---
The problem with this is that you either run into queues, or you raise the cap to numbers that the world can't support once the sharding goes down, so you didn't really solve anything. 
---
Good starting point for an idea, though, I guess.
---
There's no catch-up system, but I wouldn't worry about it.
---
I'm not sure what the practical difference is here, it just sounds like a naming difference, which, at most, has a psychological effect.
---
Definitely me.  Noggenfogger for life. 
---
Fair point. But it still acts as catch up if you were late to the game. It was a quick way to obtain higher end gear if you had others helping you. I suppose quicker meaning not a raid so wasn't locked to a once a week chance of something dropping etc. I did tons of 45 min baron runs. We'd take 3 geared people and 1 or 2 who needed the run and smash it out to upgrade their gear. I think its fair to call it catchup given the quality of the items, the fact that it wasn't a raid and that its timing.
---
So, if I get it right by the comments, by the time I would be retaking the game (that is 10-12 months after the release): AQ will be the main raid and, in order to raid it, I could "catch-up" mainly through DM. Am I right?
---
Your specific examples included summoning people off cliffs and ninja looting.
---
What on Earth makes you think the majority are perfectly okay with those things?
---
Not speaking from experience, so excuse any inaccuracies.
---
Yes, ZG and AQ 20 were 20 man raids that required less overall effort to do, and could get you gear that would help on your way to more current content. 
---
Why wouldn't you?
---
I am interested to know all the possible info :)
---
I would argue it absolutely does not, as alternatives such as AQ20 dont have any MASSIVE financial or content gates to prevnt you from just joining and going.
---
The full Dungeon 2 set takes a lot more effort and gold than most classes are willing to spend to get. And even then, there are only like 2 notable exceptions to things that stand out with the D2 items, like the rogue 4 point set and warrior boots. That in itself does not cover enough to make your character good in terms of "catch-up" where as ZG will provide a strong item for every class and every build in every slot.
---
Grom'tors charge probably.
---
You have Humans and Gnomes with same base stats.
---
They haven’t spoken about classic pretty much at all. This is ANOTHER GAME here we are talking about. 
---
DM, ZG and AQ all could be considered, but I don't think that was the intent.
---
DM was added after the first raids were out, and the lore was tired to later story events.  Can't ask players to kill new 5man content that rewards lower loot drops than raids.  The fact that the shoulder enchantment came from an NPC there was only reason to run it if you got new shoulders...
---
ZG and AQ are the closest thing to catch-up systems, and I honestly don't think they were ment to be that.  I think Blizzard really just wanted to see how we liked smaller raids.
---
And a higher chance on blue world drops, which can last for 10+ levels.
---
I'm saying they're treating Classic like any of their other games right now. 
---
They haven't done any PR/marketing since November.
---
“What is there really to speak about though.”
---
Are you serious? There is a lot of questions they need to answer. This is another mmo man. If you want me to list the questions they need to answer I can, but clearly you don’t really know what you’re talking about at all with that baffling statement
---
Another comment in this post is also about ZG. Is that really a good way to catch up? Do you think people -guilds- would accept to run it with a non-geared guy to help him catch up?
---
By June 2020 there may be a new round of servers being released so you could start fresh. 
---
But if you desire to resume your 2019 toon - and you're a decent player with decent attendance - then you should expect to easily find a guild. Catch up largely happens through your participating in their farm raids: AQ20, ZG, MC, BWL, early AQ40. 
---
A year into the server's life I would expect that most characters will not need much from farm and so you'll very easily get geared up to a near-competitive level. 
---
You will probably not fully catch up to the people who have been playing the entire previous year, at least not for a while. But you'll be pretty close. 
---
Other sources of catchup: Dire Maul, PvP gear
---
NS Roots sounds like a life-saver. Do you know if moonfire (either the initial cast or even the prolonged dot effect) breaks the root grasp?
---
Regarding thorns, I read online that it can be pretty good against rogues and other fast swinging melee classes, but your point about not wanting to get hit makes a lot of sense. 
---
Thanks for sharing your build!
---
So would all those three be options for me if I retake the game almost a year after release? Do you think guilds would help me in some extent to run those in order to help me catch up?  
---
Rogue's Riposte is off GCD
---
Same with Both Shaman and Druid Nature's Swiftness.
---
Troll Berserking is also off GCD
---
&gt; In the end, this just proves Blizzard doesn't give a shit about the gamers, just the $$$$$$ at the end of the road. How hard is it to release a 1 paragraph update and a fucking picture of something we haven't seen yet? They only care about money now.
---
Something of a paradoxical post. Your complaint is that they only care about money because they aren't properly marketing the game. 
---
I'd be much more worried about it if they *were* heavily marketing it. In that context I'd expect that they'd modernize some things in an attempt to appeal to the masses. The fact that they're just quietly going about this is the most encouraging thing about it.
---
As much time as you want basicly is the short answer. 
---
But most, if not all of your questions will boil down to how hardcore you want to play. If you want to be in a server first guild the req's will be very different from your average friday night breen run guild. 
---
* Flasks and stuff werent needed in Vanilla. We reached Naxx (and competed for server top 3) without making consumabled mandatory (except when needed like protection potions in some fights), we had ppl that would go all out with consumes, we would have ppl that used the bare minimum. How time you will need will depend on what your guilds demands, and how much of it you want to farm (some ppl never farmed and just AH goblin'd everything).
---
* On my servers it was generally 2-5 nights a week. Ranging from Casual to server first guilds. 
---
* Prot warriors kinda suck to farm, but you can make money selling your services as a tank if your good, or open dungeons, as most prot warriors generally have all key's in my experience. 
---
*Pre-Raid BiS wasn't really a thing in Vanilla, thats really a pserver thing. How much time it will cost to reach in Classic will again depend on how hardcore you will play. It can take a few days if you spam stuff in optimised groups, it also can take weeks if you only do one dungeon a day.  
---
* i was mining / BS on my prot and it was fine, my alt was herb / Alch though. 
---
You cant throw a stone here without hitting one.
---
Cant get through to man babies stuck in the past.
---
Because people will be quitting and starting playing. And there will be big enough population for raiding even for people without "proper" raiding gear.
---
The biggest concern IMO will be people with Naxxramas gear in PvP, but it's hard to say how common they will be and how will Blizzard decide to address that.
---
TBC gear was just scraps from Vanilla's development
---
Yup I consider myself a decent player (very good performance everytime I've raided in any expansion) and attendance would be 100% since I'd have finished university, lol.  
---
The idea was to lvl up to 60 in Summer '19 and then retake the same toon 9 months later, starting the "catch-up" race being already 60. What I would like to know is if the Summer time used to lvl up will be time wasted or I will certainly be able to retake the toon after so much time and raid the endgame content.  
---
Thank you for your elaborate comment!
---
It's meaningless I suppose on pve servers but on pvp servers, when the honor system enters the game a few months after a launch (and I know the Blizzard patch plans are not final by any means with their 4 patch progression plan) players want to start ranking for the rewards and hitting rank 3 for the trinket is very easy to do in open world pvp.
---
Historically this patch was before BGs opened but I believe Classic will have both drop at once, which is likely a good thing to alleviate the open world impact. Typically the patch hits and world pvp increases 10 fold. Players want their level 3 trinket ranks. It will still impact pvp servers in Classic but to what degree I do not know yet. On private servers it changed the face of leveling forever because instead of interests on both sides only being in leveling, they now are leveling AND honor grind ... which means any easy target gets crushed like a bug.
---
On pvp private servers, certain lvl 50+ zones filled with tasty little greens to a 60 get shut completely down for levelers of the weaker faction. Searing Gorge is often completely unplayable for one faction. My experience always had the Horde abusing certain open world zones late game badly over Alliance due to map and FP arrangement mostly (along with some specific low level Alliance zones being constantly abused more average than Horde e.g. Redridge Mountains) . It's why the meme exists about the Horde being the better open world faction. It really is more about how the world was designed.
---
patch 1.10 blues are a fucking joke and if i i had it my way wouldn't be included in the game at all, progressive itemization or othewise.  
---
Yep. There is one within this subreddit and one on the classic wow discord.
---
Quest XP was boosted in a late patch of vanilla, can't remember which. However it was still not even close to what you need. I remember in vanilla that quest turn in would give XP similar to 5 to 15 mob kills, with a handful giving more. Following a guide like Joanas will actually have you completeing far more quests than you otherwise would, and you still need to do a heap of grinding. The alternative is quest until you run out of them or can't do them, then grind levels until you can. Levelling guides just incorporate the grinding into the travelling time of completing quests and getting flight points, which is a large part of why they are so fast.
---
You needn’t worry, in vanilla all of the max level dungeons offer incentives to be re run by other players. Examples of 5 man content: stratholme and scholomance. People run stratholme for reputation with Argent Dawn, righteous orbs (required for crusader enchants, iirc), and scholomance for AD rep, and to use the alchemy lab to make flasks. Other dungeons are also worthwhile for various crafting materials or rare drops. During peak play for your region you should easily be able to find groups. Zul’Gurub is a 20 man raid that you can run pretty easily and with pretty crappy gear, and will be pugged often. Ahn Qiraj 20 man is also pugged often and you can get very nice gear from it. With servers being roughly a year old when you return to the game you’ll easily get carries through molten core and onyxia raids too. They’re entry level and guilds generally master them pretty quickly and people will start generating pugs for those on guild off-nights. 
---
So yes, it’s not quite the personal loot/welfare system that people talk of in modern wow, and catching up will take longer and more runs - but you most certainly can catch up to the curve with some time invested.
---
If you’re talking about catch up mechanics like level boosts, you’re out of luck, friend 🙂
---
Awesome! Can you please link me to the one in this subreddit? I have been looking and I cant find it.
---
TLDR.  Also, it's so amusing to see you paragraph out each little bit of my response because you can't actually formulate any sentient response that isn't broken down.  I did manage to skim through and find your snide comment about "did I just learn about logical fallacies'.  No, actually, I just know about logical fallacies in general and enjoy pointing out when they are being used (or in this case abused).  
---
Technically what you're doing is called strawmanning BTW.  (Where you break down, and misrepresent arguments piecemeal instead of reading the entire thing as a whole and then formulating a "whole" response.
---
Also, name-calling "you seem like some old guy completely out of touch".  Guess what, EVERYONE WHO FUCKING PLAYED THE GAME WHEN IT LAUNCHED IS NOW OLD smart-ass.  It's been 15 years since it released.  Even if you were ONE fucking year old you'd be a teenager by now.  And consider that I'd assume the minimum age to play WoW with a fucking brain developed enough to succeed would be about 12 that means ANYONE who played the game at launch would be MINIMUM of 27 years old.  So go ahead, continue name-calling (ad hominem fallacy BTW...am I pissing you off yet or you gonna keep using fallacies in every single argument you make?) shit-bag.  At this point I don't even care if I'm using ad hominem myself.  You no longer deserve any semblance of decency or modicum of respect with the way you think, act, and type.

Less aggro radius to accidentally aggro more.

Less chance of dying and needing a corpse run.

Good points!
---
This is a game that was out 14 years ago, they need to fill on some details but most of it has been knows for 14 years now. I will watch the movie tomorrow, but seeing the author i don't have high hopes to be fair. Been watching some of his content and generally its a lot of "Whining", while as far as i can tell he himself never played Vanilla at any serious level back in the day. 
---
No I wasn't, ik how Vanilla works xD and I also guessed it would **take A LOT of time to catch up**. But what I wanted to know is whether this will truly be possible, or if I will lvl to 60 in Summer 2019 as I plan, and then in Summer 2020 nobody will accept me and the time used to lvl to 60 will be totally wasted. Do I explain myself?  
---
By Summer 2020 I'll have finished university, time won't be a problem. I wanted to know if I will be able to catch up investing all the necessary time. If so, then I'm happy!
---
You sounds like an uber 1337. I like you. I agree with you with everything. I say that they should all be "willing" to tank, because not everyone ran every dungeon many times and is a raider. Some tanks welcome tips from more experienced players, but I agree that a warrior refusing to tank is like a priest refusing to heal. Play the class!
---
How ?
---
Okay? Right click them off and accept the duel? Doesn't sound like that big of a deal honestly. Sure it's mildly annoying, but it takes one second to remedy and move on.
---
*angry face intensifies* I feel you, bro. This time, you won't DC. You will just roll really badly :)
---
The moonfire damage (dot or direct) will break roots. That being said I don't remember the exact mechanic in regards to how it breaks. Whether its a damage threshold or just a chance per damage instance. I remember it being similar to fear though. I personally have casted 2-3 starfires and not break roots. Ive also had it break just from applying the moonfire. 
---
I feel like you're not taking into account that with todays upcoming version it's not going to be anywhere near what it was at launch. There are going to be addon's that are like DBM that will track when bosses fear, timers, etc that will help warriors proper stance dance, since berserker's rage lasts around what, 8-10 seconds?  
---
You can do them without fear ward, considering everyone will be feared at said point as that was the intention and fear ward is just a crutch to rely on to cheese a mechanic, similar to tremor totem if placed properly and it doesn't have its tick go off slightly before the fear or slightly into the fear.  
---
Fear ward and tremor totem help the encounter mechanics, they do, but if you are one of the people to scream "You must be dwarf or gtfo", then all I can see from that is turning down a player who isn't living up to your standard, which is whatever but still a dick move.
---
Long story short: Do the content how it was intended without cheese mechanics or do it with cheese mechanics, either way it can be down both ways and it really just depends on your raid comp rather than forcing people to play a race they may or may not like.
---
Yes there is catch up content in the two 20 man raids - ZG and AQ20.   
---
In addition, there will likely be plenty of people that started late, are just struggling, are gearing alts, etc, that will still be running MC and Ony every week.   
---
Depending on your class you might not need a lot of MC or Ony gear to be efficient in BWL - and most guilds will likely keep running BWL as there are some really strong drops there.   
---
I don't even know how much of the content Blizzard is planning to have out 9 months into the game.   
---
In short, I don't think it'll be a problem at all. 
---
And they say Horde is merciless and brutal...
---
Even if its only happen a few time, it will be gamebreaking, especially if they report a guild tank on a world boss to make them wipe and take the boss for themselves for example (and even for ranking, it might not bother you because you might not wanna rank but if some people can prevent other to rank like that...)
---
I guess I agree. Props to you if you go undead or troll!
---
Doubtful. Some classes have a few pieces from DM that might be better but for Aq40 you're gonna want BWL gear.
---
If BR is on a 30 seconds cooldown and they fear every 15 seconds, couldn't this easily be avoided by having 2 of the X tanks just rotate taunts after tank1 immunes the first, then tank2 immediately takes it after he comes out of fear? Positional aside, there \*are\* ways to do it without those abilities, it just requires a bit of coordination.
---
He's not a rare spawn he just had multiple spawn points. 
---
Imagine typing out the 0 in 2k19 in current year.
---
Not to mention that serious guilds tend to recruit the player and not their gear. If a guild is needing your class, and you seem like the right fit (attendance, game knowledge, personality, etc) they will happily carry you through some MC, Ony, and even BWL raids (not to mention ZG and later AQ20) to get you up to speed and performing for the main raid group.   
---
People quit the game along the way and need to be replaced. 
---
Damn, you must have so much fake internet karma points saved up for Classic...
---
Magisters Boots were I think the hardest T0 piece to come by. Not because the Postmaster was so hard but because it was such a time investment that as you said nobody wanted to bother.
---
Luckily the Mage T0 set was total garbage and I had way better gear by the time T0.5 got released.
---
I thought the strongest argument for sharding was the idea that realms would become ghost towns once the tourists left prompting blizzard to merge the realms.
---
&gt; Also, it's so amusing to see you paragraph out each little bit of my response because you can't actually formulate any sentient response that isn't broken down.

TLDR: 'I'll continue calling out your fallacies, while I do them myself. I won, haha'
---
At this point it's quite clear you're just backtracking and not really interested in discussing anything more than personal insults. But then again, I'm quite sure you have trouble staying on-topic on forums like these, according to your initial post, in which about the first line was about the actual topic of the thread and the rest was your rant about streamers, Classic WoW and what else which seems to make you angry in your shitty life, apart from people doing fallacies of course. Maybe you should learn from me and quote every single thing you have to reply to, to make sure you stay on-topic instead of just a full on reply of insults like your last one.
---
Yes that works. However it generally means you need 1 more off tank than normally would be tanking adds depending on the fight. And your threat ceiling is cut nearly in half, as the main tank is spending half the time he could be building threat running around in fear.  This means your dps has to hold back significantly.
---
Also, fear ward isn't just for tanks, but dps and healers as well.
---
Doesn’t matter he’s a silver dragon.
---
Interesting. Source?
---
The ToS isn't a legally binding agreement, and Blizzard has no way of enforcing people running local server emulators (well, they don't really have a way of enforcing public server emulators either, but that's a different story).
---
It didn't really need a catch-up system as much.  Let me explain.
---
In Vanilla, you had **obtainable objectives.**  Get attuned for Molten Core.  Get your fire resist gear.  Get your pre-dungeon gear.  These objectives were all achievable, and once you achieved them, the goal was done.   There were some **repeatable objectives**, such as getting your consumables for raids, but again - you had a clear idea how much you needed (and if you took a week off, you didn't use the consumables, so you were net neutral).
---
The game now has **continuous objectives.**  Continue farming content in the hope you get a higher +item level boost.  Continue farming for Azerite, or Artifact Power, because you can always gain more power.  This is designed to keep players engaged, but it fails for two reasons:
---
* If you miss a cycle, you're always behind and can never completely catch up
---
* You never achieve your goal of completing the grind, so you never get the feeling of accomplishment that goes with it.
---
That's why Vanilla doesn't really need a catchup system.  If you start playing in 2020, you'll be behind, yes.  But as you check off items on the to-do list (get to 60, accomplish the pre-raid checklist) those items will be over with and you'll be caught up.  You don't get "more attuned" to Molten Core the way you get more Artifact Power.
---
Then there's gear.  You might get carried through by a guild doing runs for enchanting mats (or to gear up new players to the guild).  If most people are already in better gear, you get a lot of the pickings.  Or maybe you join a guild that's just starting MC and you help pave the way.  You won't step into AQ40 and Naxx right away.  But you will have plenty of opportunities to run raids and improve your gear.
---
I didn't raid in Vanilla, but I raided heavily in TBC and WotLK.  They didn't need catch-up because the community would catch you up, and the game wasn't designed to leave you behind if you take a few weeks off.
---
Which is about as relevant as you saying that you're better than someone else at a video game because your rating is higher despite you not playing better. 
---
For the Warchief! For Thrall! Lok'Tar!
---
Might is also going on rogues, hunt, and tank (and thats a big one if whats gimp the raid dps is threat as its usually is). Also don't forget the paladin individual dps (he could also go nightfall to improve the caster dps or full t1 for big raid healing if needed). On top of that you have an extra aura for a group. He can also switch to heal gear if an encounter need it (for example he could go dps on all mc and switch to heal on ragnaros).
---
I would say an extra paladin in that case would be more than worth it even if he is ret because you don't need more healer.
---
Oh boy I forgot about "wow was the first mmo" bait. You don't get that as much on private servers, it's all over f2p Asian MMO chats though.
---
You're right that we probably will get a shitload of it with classic when that crowd tries it. Can't wait lol.
---
Also expecting lots of "Alienware are the best PCs" bait.
---
Yes, I suspect that is what he meant. The gear in those instances was easier to get and usually on-par/replacement options for bis gear from other dungeons and Molten Core.
---
They also had several crafted sets released alongside them that allowed you to be geared via farming enough gold to simply buy the sets on the auction house. Specifically the Bloodvine set with ZG was a good example. Itemization was poor early on and even blizzard didnt know what they were doing with their own game, so when they released the bloodvine set mages went from having near Zero options for +hit gear to having entire sets of it.
---
I think that they really are not going to be much faster as catch-up.
---
Pre-Raid BiS items are so spread out in endgame content, your only real catch-up is 4 other players chain running stuff with you, and them not needing anything from those places...  And if you have that kind of relationship with players, they can probably get you into entry raids...
---
Well DM only needs 4 other people sure, but you would be trying to do tribute runs and take some pre planning... Not always great for pugs... But still pretty easy with a few friends.
---
ZG is pretty forgiving, so pugs might do it, but succesful pugs, I don't know.  When I pugged it, there was a solid guild backbone to the group.
---
AQ 20 needs even more so...
---
well racism and homophobia are illegal. memes about hilary/trump etc are not.
---
Well he does have a point that the boss design in BRD was lacklustre
---
The dungeon was designed beautifully and so full of content but what did those bosses actually do?
---
Off the top of my head the guy who used to drop the melee trinket has a mechanic but I can't remember, the fire lizard had this stacking buff add stuff going on and the end boss was reasonably interesting with their revives and different loot tables depending on whether you killed Moira.
---
Strath has much better boss design than BRD while being equally amazingly full of content
---
I love this mouse, ergonomics combined with great build quality. It's great for web, productivity, and gaming all in one
---
You’ll be 100% fine! I’ve been playing on a well known private server since in launched nearly a year ago. Only hit 60 in December and have been doing the end game dungeons and molten core/ZG runs with no problem! I play a warrior so I tank 5 mans from time to time but I’ve also been attending those groups as dps and raid as dps, and healers are always in demand too. 
---
You will see a lot of talk about min/maxing etc and how you HAVE to HAVE all of your pre raid gear maxed from 5 mans before setting foot in MC/onyxia. It’s just not true, and groups will take more bodies over having an empty raid spot. That is my experience, anyway!
---
So even if you do call it catching up, there will a bunch of other casuals/slower players/later adopters/alts/recent university grads that are catching up too!
---
&gt; Vanilla and e-sports?
---
&gt; LMAO !
---
That's what i think as well.
---
No way. The train set was noisy. That's an entirely different level of annoyance.
---
Sure, but they were not placeholder, just recolors.
---
Read the other replies to my comment.
---
I thought he called them on Alexensual 
---
Oh so you didn’t watch the video.

Ladies and gentlemen, we got him 
---
Pretty sure people would love armorless mounts !
---
&gt; What I would like to know is if the Summer time used to lvl up will be time wasted or I will certainly be able to retake the toon after so much time and raid the endgame content.
---
You could have a good time playing from behind but if I were in your situation I would start fresh on a 2020 server, assuming that there will be some. My thinking would be that I love the progress. I'd want to try to join a guild organically as the server grows and as I level. To be part of any potential server firsts, guild firsts, early social bonding, the first few content release chunks (blizzard plans to release all the content in four packages) etc. Especially since I'd be planning to play at a 100% attendance level...being in on the ground floor could mean opportunities for leadership positions if desired. 
---
The only reason I'd want to hop right into raiding on my recently removed from cryosleep 60 would be if I only had a limited number of months in 2020 to play and wanted to see as much as possible as quickly as possible. But I think most players will tell you that much of the joy in Vanilla is in the first half...once you get deep into AQ40 and Naxx the vibe changes to a bit more businesslike. 
---
I don't think every priest in a raid needs to be dwarf. But dwarfs will always be more valuable than humans and Nelfs, even (especially) in casual guilds. 
---
I don't think fear ward is a "cheese" mechanic. Horde and alliance were both given a way to deal with fear for a reason. 
---
You can do any encounter without Fear Ward, but the impact it has on the fight is more significant than people seem to think. 
---
Mostly a TBC thing
---
Wait where did this come from 
---
In the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Nineteen
---
hm? not sure what you mean
---
If you have some pre-raid BiS that you get from 5 mans, you'll be able to into MC, ZG and AQ20. Here's the deal though, and what perspective I'm guessing you're asking this question from; no dungeons and raids ever really become obselete *because*  there aren't any catch-up mechanics like in later expansions. Guilds at different levels of progression will always be running different tiers of content. In contrast to what happened in Wrath where a new raid tier was released and anyone running heroic 5 mans was rewarded with gear similar to the previous tier. That system let players catch up, at the expense of killing content from previous patches.
---
He’s a level 21 elite actually. [Proof](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=639) 
---
So not that difficult to beat. From what i can tell you were looking at the level of the cape/some of the other items he drops? 
---
I'm pretty sure Blizzard is going to be actively attempting to shut down pservers once classic releases. They want all those subs for themselves.
---
Since getting 40 people together to raid is a lot, guilds tend to have openings especially for content most people in the guild don't need anymore like MC. Also, the expected level of gear to enter drops somewhat because some people will be overgeared but still in MC. An overgeared DPS might do double what is considered a lot in early progression, so dragging along some mostly dead weight or even having empty slots isn't a big problem.
---
I absolutely get all the points of your comment.  
---
What I was referring to when talking about "catch up" was essencially gear. What I fear is that, 9 months later, I go back to my lvl 60 toon and no guild wants to accept me (even if I can offer very decent performance and 100% assistance) because of gear. The worst scenario I imagined is: all guilds raiding BWL or AQ40 or whatever is up at that time, while I'm needing MC and Onyxia and nobody is willing to run those anymore, so I will never be able to catch up. But as you seem to say, that is extremely unlikely to happen, isn't it?  
---
Thank you sincerely for your elaborate comment.
---
My best guess will be April 1st releaaing some sort of info in regards to a beta ..
---
Darude, Sandstorm
---
ToS is a legally binding agreement. And yes, they can compel you to shut down a private server if they discovered one. Remember Nost?
---
What updates do you want? They are recreating an old game. There is nothing to update. Let them work. 
---
Not for priests :p
---
Your plan seems good, certainly. But do we know for sure there will be fresh servers on 2020 or it's only an assumption?  
---
I mean, if it is a sure thing, then the plan is much better than mine. But if not, I wouldn't like to find myself in 2020 with not even a lvl 60 toon, do you know what I mean? It would be a big risk...
---
Oh man, if only this had ventrilo it would be 10/10
---
It won’t be anything more severe than it is on private servers. Sure there is always competition for the first clear but it is not newsworthy and after a while the top guilds will just compete on speed clears.
---
I'm not going to let you move the goalposts. I wrote what I wrote. I proved it was accurate. You're whining because you can't read. 
---
Common sense. 
---
Again, I think you're looking at a small thing and letting your feelings delude you into thinking it's an epidemic. 
---
I’m Kobayne. human lock 🤜🏼🤛🏼
---
Maybe these two stories will help you out:
---
In Wrath of the Lich King, I leveled my druid from 70-80 by AFKing in Alterac Valley.  This was when they made the stupid decision to let you level in BGs, which absolutely killed the low-level PVP game for me (I used to use those to farm gear for level 20, level 30, etc) and made AV ripe for abuse.  So when I hit level 80, I was in T5 armor.  To put it into perspective, my item level was 128, and the content we were doing dropped 226.  The 5-mans dropped ilvl 200.
---
Anyway, I joined a guild and told them this.  I said "I know you're in T8 and I'm in T5 gear, but we can fix my gear.  I'm a good healer."  They talked to me a bit about healing, and off we went.  Within 2 weeks I was the #2 healer in the guild.  This should tell you that people are willing to take risks on undergeared players, and it should tell you that your interview and your gameplay are more important than your gear.  
---
As to how you get geared - later I joined another guild.  This guild was further ahead of me, and used a DKP system that everyone else had a ton more DKP saved up than I did.  But they didn't want a lot of the gear, so I got a ton of gear and quickly caught up, even without burning much DKP (i.e. earn 100 DKP for a boss kill and spend 50 DKP on the item).
---
People will be running MC and Onyxia.  If most guilds are past it, people will PUG it.  Guilds need enchanting mats, and there's always going to be new players, new guilds, or even guilds that are stuck there that you can use to springboard into higher tier content.
---
If you show that you have the skill, are good for the community of the guild (which can be being nice or being a jerk, depending on the guild), and are willing to do what you need to do in the off nights to be successful on raid night, you'll be fine.
---
My recollection was that the main "catch-up" system was "if you commit, your guild will carry you until you catch up".
---
Heck, I can even remember bringing pre-60 characters into Molten Core to give them a jump-start on Hydraxian rep and gearing.  (Sure, maybe you can't equip that loot yet, so bank it until you ding 60.)
---
I can only imagine what that vent room was like 
---
Going to take a second attempt at a good answer.
---
Yes, they would be good ways to catch-up, but...
---
Let's just use the chain running DM for a week example.  Yes you will catch-up, and a lot of Pre-RaidBiS for all classes comes from DM, but I am sure a lot of your gear will still be random high greens that could drop from any level 60 mob and you will need some luck to fill all you gear slots with 'good blue/Green'.  You would need a group to do this effectively. But...
---
Chain running any 55+ content will help you catch-up, DM is just slightly better loot but also harder mobs  statwise.  So could take longer and if you are not spending gold on matts for a good tribute run, not as much loot as a full BRD or Live&amp;Undead Strathome run.
---
Next, plenty of quest gear is as good or better than gear in LVL 55 dungeons (example would be Sunken Temple class  trinket reward is almost always BiS for every class).  As well as class quests that reward important gear and or skills (paladin and Warlock mount as examples). The Emperor's mace from BRD as another example of something I recall farming well into BWL for lots of guildmates.
---
Just doing DM means missing a lot of other good gear, some stuff that even raiders try to get after BWL.
---
But in either of these cases, you need a group who is helping you or even passing gear to you, as in letting take all the gear since they are 'past' that stuff.
---
Now if you want something you can do solo and rewards catch-up gear, it's PvP.  Yes you get better results with a group, but when you can't find a group you can still farm AV rep. The Blue PvP armor is also good enough to 'skip' 5man dungeons and get into raids.  People might turn up their nose, but stats are pretty much what you need and most raid drops will Infact be upgrades!
---
Last thought. A year into classic, raiders will still be running MC just to farm matts for thunderfury and sulfurous, and DE the unwanted epics for enchanting...  I bet they will be short on players to fill the ranks in their non-progression raids at that point.
---
What the fk do you want? Its gonna be summer 2019. Its literally in several months. Impatient slobs.
---
That is no true and you know it. There is a plenty of major things that we still don't know. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMhWkHsHvE&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMhWkHsHvE&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Depends on the mob and whether it's literally in my path or if it's a bit out of the way. Early on I like to kill a mob and then keep moving until my natural regen has healed me enough to keep killing stuff (saves time and food for when I'm clearing some camp out for a quest).
---
It all comes down to XP, Time to Kill, etc.. Might be better mobs to kill elsewhere so you're better off not stopping to kill "bad" mobs.
---
The only thing left to announce is how the beta will be handled, and a timeframe for when beta will launch. Clearly it's not being launched any time soon.
---
The stories are certainly encouraging. Thank you so much for both your comments, they make me feel more relieved and, above all, motivated!
---
this should be stickied. 
---
It’s not true that they are intending on recreating an old game? I’m not saying there aren’t major things they need to do, but we know what the end result is. The end result is as close to vanilla as they can get it. What update do you want? “Today we added the old jokes that were removed because of racism/be littleing little people.” ? 
---
I’d much rather them say nothing and release a good product. We know what they are doing, or what we want them to do. They just need to do it. 
---
This is not surprising but at the same time disappointing. Remember that Classic WoW doesn't mean Classic Blizzard will come back, shitty PR will remain as we know it.
---
We need to know about deal-breakers, example: Sharding
---
**What are other deal-breakers we need to know about?** 
---
Commin sense.
---
What you are doing here is like punching yourself in the nuts to swat a fly.
---
It is amazing how easy it is to sound like you have an argument when all you have is posting “common sense” followed by a terrible analogy.
---
A lot of people. There, answered it for you.
---
Paladin stats are busted.
---
Actually, the Magister's Boots dropped off the same boss as the piccolo. I got both when I went back at 70 in TBC to complete my Dungeon Set so I could have one set with a coherent design.
---

---
Ogrimmar Postservice
---
They know the community will desire fresh servers and that new players will stream in over the years who will more likely stick around on new servers. I feel pretty confident that they'll provide. I expect a major info dump about future plans this summer prior to Classic release. 
---
Even if they *were* going to release new servers I still think I'd level that first toon to 60 like you've planned. It gives you some options in 2020 to pivot on + modern practice/knowledge. 
---
The first answer was already nice, it's just that I have very little knowledge hahahah  
---
Yup more people in comments have said that about the ranks in non-progression raids. This will be probably be my best chance.  
---
What I wanted to know is if lvling up to 60 this Summer would be a waste of time because nobody would accept me one year later, or if on the other hand it'd be worth it. I assume there are enough options to retake it one year later and catch up more or less properly.  
---
Thank you so much for your comments :)
---
For me its: 
---
\- Sharding
---
\- Cashshop options
---
\- Itemization
---
\- Content progression
---
\- Server population (server info)
---
\- Spellbatching
---
We haven't had any updates yet because they don't want to take away from 8.1/Mythic World First race. We should get news soon, unless they want to keep 8.1.5 in the spotlight.
---
15 min cd.  I wouldn’t call that op but it’s good to know not to report the mage after he stuns me. 
---
There isn’t really much to tell, the game has been done to death. Just wait until it comes out and we will find out if it’s right or not.
---
Lok’tar!
---
its a houston thang
---
It's an insanely powerful item
---
Some people will get dedicated account to report. They only need 5 which mean 75$. Some rankers on a shady private server pay gm more than that to have other ranker banned by "mistake" for a few hours to make their ranking easier.
---
Noticed Undead Warlocks have Underwater Breathing listed as an advantage, but I thought all warlocks get underwater breathing as a Warlock Buff. Small thing, but seeing as this is highlighting small things, might be worth mentioning in the UD warlock tip.
---
More like literally everyone since 1000 “content creators” have made a video on that exact item 
---
A new private server launches every few months. That is due to competition between companies fighting for 'donation' money. That will not be the case on official servers.
---
Would be surprised if a fresh official server was even announced as a possibility prior to summer 2021.
---
Yeah, I wonder how well transmog in classic would go over. 
---
Oh, wait. Black Mageweave would be *everywhere.* &gt;_&gt;
---
It was a stellar analogy. Right on the money. A painting with letters that shook the foundations of the internet with how *true* it is. 
---
Because the medicine is worse than the disease. 
---
Content creator is the dankest meme
---
haha, I definitely wouldn't call it OP, but its definitely something that will get you out of a bad situation in a pinch &amp; almost nobody expects it!
---
Ofcourse
---
Huh, we had a Fortis on Kel'thuzad Horde in vanilla also.
---
Ah the days when people wouldn’t use master loot 
---
Dude is ready to tank Kara though.
---
I remember you guys. I applied to Fortis back in the day. Oh how I dreamed to be a raider back then.
---
Always a guild looking for warm bodies. You will be able to buy crafted gear, you will have less competition for loot since most people will have t1/t2. Naturally playing one of the strong, high demand class/spec combos would be advantageous, being a retirement paladin with a mix of greens/blues and no consumables would make finding a raiding guild very difficult.
---
This is how blizzard operates. Always has. This smells like entitlement to me and easy upvotes since you're ragging on blizzard. 
---
I'd literally not heard about this item until a few weeks ago, have I been living under a rock? ;)
---
What about the Bob Ross livestream though? 
---
Could you clarify the issues with itemization and server population?  I hadn't heard those two.  The rest I have my own opinions on, just hadn't heard the two I mentioned.
---
I pretty much said this in a other thread and got downvoted. Glad to see saner minds are around that understand that it's about the journey.  :)
---
Never thought I will get so many answers! 
---
We are the best community!
---
Thanks alot!
---
Classic will be so amazing!
---
While BC had amazing content, I couldn’t get into the space-crystals everywhere.  Especially, the gear.  
---
It is so good, that every serious pvper has this trinket on its bar over literally everything else, forever, until they use it.
---
Always loved how undead warriors looked in t2 with quel'serrar etc
---
I think the Bob Ross and the Pokémon channels for example, can do this, because they're channels made purely by the people having the rights to each respective series and it's something which either Twitch have pushed to happen or the other way around. Lots of people were watching and painting Bob Ross paintings on Twitch and either Twitch reached out, asked if the people with the rights would make or allow them to make a channel to run all the episodes back to back, because of the sheer demand for it and/or for the memes. I'm pretty sure if something like this wouldn't be okay, the Bob Ross/Pokémon streams would be closed pretty fast, either by the people with the rights to them or Twitch for streaming only pre-recorded content. 
---
TLDR: They're official channels and most likely sponsored and/or asked to do this by Twitch themselves.
---
I think Leroy needs something...
---
This is the build I'm hoping to go for on re-launch for good wPvP capability. I'd love a guide for gearing this build.
---
&gt;The game is 14 years old at this point and there isn't much to learn about the game.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic Just a very small example of the kind of communication some of us want. I'm not expecting to "learn anything about the game," but rather to "learn about their modern implementation of the game.
---
Is there some Reddit rule about linking to your own content? Isn't this spam?
---
You sound like me, before they shut Nost down. It scratches the itch, but the pain of losing all those hours of work in the blink of an eye....enough to make you beg for classic (which, in my case, was announced after Nost was shut down.)
---
I'd like to know if items will be in 1.12 state from the beginning or if they will be updated over time with content patches.
---
Also I'd like to know how many servers per region there will be and what will be population cap on them if so.
---
I didn’t look at anything, I was going off memory. I did VC on a private server in the last month, - he dropped cruel barb, not the cape - I guess my memory is just really shitty.
---
It does not matter in retail since the mongoloid + dungeon system gives on par and better rewards then raiding on hc. So instead everyone looks like they are just spamming dungeons and never touching raiding in retail 
---
Something that hasnt been said yet - All of the classic raids will be raided consistently even 1 year into the server lifetime. For MC and BWL, most gear drops are pretty underwhelming, but there are few that are BiS for a long time and people will want to farm them (Truestrike, Mageblade, dft, tear, nef staff etc.). That gives you enough opportunity to soak unwanted gear and catch up.
---
Vanilla also has raids that are meant to be catch ups like ZG and AQ20. Those ones are quite easily puggable and arent very hard, while providing decent gear.
---
But in some memes of their political leaders are. So....
---
If launch went smoother, (like WAY smoother) and they didn’t remove my planned class just before launch, (chips) it would have killed wow for me and most of my guild.
---
What coulda been man...
---
I think it's crazy that they didn't even have a hype video at Blizzcon - there was nothing there for the media to promote and write about. Not sure if it's malice or incompetence, but Classic WoW may be Blizzard's only significant release in 2019 and they are abjectly failing to create awareness of it.
---
Flasks aren't needed for the vast majority of content. Even non-flask consumables are frequently not necessary, but they'll speed things up and make stuff easier. It depends on the guild as to whether they'll require you to be buffed or not. Still, you can generally assume that flasks are not required.
---
Flask of Titans for tanks (particularly MT) is one main exception to this, but if you're worried about farming them as the MT: don't be. From my experience it's standard for that to be covered by the guild bank.
---
This goes to my theory that most OG vanilla players were drawn by random open world PvP...
---
Bear charge can help you run away and silence. And thick hide adds a lot to Moonkin armor.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxhMEktVMxoZV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxhMEktVMxoZV)
---
I haven't done this yet, but I figure if I tried to get all the +armor rings and trinkets and possibly even an armor weapon, the (68%ish?) damage mitigation against melee could become a real deterrent. Not to mention nature's grasp.
---
Never understood ffa loot at all.
---
Your time is now!
---
Which is really crazy considering its a mid level 30's trinket :D Can't believe it got nerfed in later expansions to not work above level 60!
---
Honestly, getting to 60 in a summer is pretty ambitious, even if you have summer off school/work.  If you can do that, odds are you can be geared enough in less time.
---
Guilds will need players with a pulse one year in, maybe not the top progression guilds, but most guilds will be having trouble filling all their weekly roles at that point.
---
Plus, ZG matts/enchants, ZG rep rewards, then AQ rep rewards (both of them) and the quest/crafting class sets for AQ, there will always be people farming those two, so raids might not try to beat it, but they will be in there getting loot that nobody 'wants'.
---
Any player who is active, willing to farm and gets to 60 should be able to get in raids pretty easy.  That's like a guild leader's trifecta of what they want in a Raider.  And raids are once a week, and you can only be saved to one instance of each, so ACTIVE guild members are often bored while they wait for raid night.  Running 5mans for fun and to help out the noobs is often the only way to pass the time.
---
How can you know anything of escalation when you didn’t play vanilla or raid at all lmfao 
---
I’ve been playing WoW for like 13 years and never heard of it either. 
---
Shhh don’t  blow up my spot 
---
All good, i just assumed because when i first looked up info on him to double check myself the first thing you see is his ilvl25 drops.  
---
kicking and screaming hasn't worked in the past? are you kidding me? Kicking and screaming about the nost shutdown is why we freaking even have classic WoW.
---
Give me a break
---
I might add improved entangling roots to this.
---
There's limited 'catch-up' systems in Classic WoW. ZG and AQ 20 are pretty much as close as it gets, due to being relatively easy when they're out and offer items on par with MC or even better, while also having resetting more often, for more clears.
---
On top of that, even with out ZG and AQ 20, you'll be fine. There's always people leaving, starting up again or being late to the party, which you can team up with. Also, many guilds would rather gear up one good person, than using someone in already good gear, since most are thinking about long term solutions and because content isn't that hard, to the point where it's usually a gear issue. Obviously it'll be harder to get into a decent guild if you're terrible at making applications and speaking good for yourself, when you're wearing shit gear, but it's absolutely possible. A good start would be to get pre-raid BiS from dungeons, enchant it and understand your stat thresholds and what not, that should give guilds a pretty good understanding of your dedication and understanding of your class/spec, while making a decent application. 
---
Guilds know that gear isn't everything, but showing that you're willing to farm pre-raid BiS, enchanting it and what not is a good way to start.
---
This!!!! I like this a lot.
---
Depending on how Blizz release the various patches, there will be catchup *gear*, in the form of blues in LBRS/UBRS etc that have much better stats than what the other blues that were in the game from launch had.
---
Some items were better than MC epics even, and were put in the game as a kind of catchup mechanic ahead of AQ.
---
I think Blizzard probably has some influence on Twitch, but if they are flexing that influence they are being ridiculous. Think if it was any other online service, like Twitter for example.
---
Blizzard: This user is breaking the TOS for our game. Please ban him from Twitter.
---
Twitter: The fuck you say? 
---
If you started playing at the end of Vanilla/didn't play Vanilla at all then you might not have heard of it since it wasn't really used outside of twinking after Vanilla
---
If they think there is money in any kind of world first race for Classic they will however to be frank given how fast pserver guilds nuke every boss it won't be a race so the monetizing potential is extremely low
---
The thing about Classic is that even 1 year after release people will still be running LBRS/UBRS, MC, BWL etc, so you will always have a chance to "catch up".
---
Most level 60 content in Vanilla is relevant until TBC.
---
you aren't supposed to see rogues anyway. 
---
Watching an entire raid break out their sweet moves was distracting. Also the piccolo made noises as well D:
---
Itll be done when its done 
---
No because that would be whack... 
---
And you get to try out different attack combos. Practicing to perfect rotations on mobs that don't matter as much as when doing dungeons for example.
---
this is not about when its done but how its done.
---
regardless of progress of ANY guild there will always be people running Ony and ZG for the buffs they want for the progress runs.  Guilds in Naxx will still do these instances and will often have free spots for others as their ONLY objective is the buff for their main raid.  This is what I think you mean by catch up mechanics.  Once you have gear from Ony ZG MC, and to a point Dire Maul, you are easily geared enough to attempt AQ20 BWL or even AQ40.
---
Might doesn't affect ranged attack power in vanilla, so you wouldn't put it on hunters. Might be different in classic though! We shall see
---
Biggest disappointment of my life was logging in post-expansion and finding the word "fizzle" in the item description.
---
