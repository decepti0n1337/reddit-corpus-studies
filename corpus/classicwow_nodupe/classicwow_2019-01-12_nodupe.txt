The community feeling seems to be the biggest thing the players miss about Vanilla. That and the higher difficulty level turn up the most. Let's hope they nail the Classic servers.

If its not only lvl 60, it doesnt count. rather misleading.
---
accounts created to spam gold offers just to be banned, and created again, lvl1 bank alts and so on. 
---
Also just from the feeling warriors definetely doesnt feel to that degree populated at all. Each 5th person you meet is a warrior? no way dude, thats total bollocks.
---
I feel you man. Not much time left 'til summer.
---
Why is the guy controlling the gate shouting commands at himself ? 
---
Yes, the windfury attack is an extra attack that executes immediately upon proc which is basically an auto attack except with the appropriate Windfury Totem attack power bonus (last rank provides 315 AP, untalented) , whether it's a white hit (auto attack) or a yellow hit (hamstring, heroic strike, whirlwind, etc.).  
---
There are basically only two alternatives to windfury totem, which is Grace of Air (provides a lot of additional agility) and Tranquil Air (provides 20% threat reduction, poor man's salvation).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Usually you arrange specific melee groups, although in aq40+ tiers if you have enough spare shamans to cover all melee groups you can place them in caster groups for Tranquil Air since the threat reduction is valuable for ignite and warlocks since they start doing pretty competitive dps in that tier. What totem to use in the situation of a warrior in a caster group would depend on the threat output of the tank and whether tranquil air is necessary, if not then Windfury is a strict dps increase whereas Tranquil Air is a dps only if your dps is threatcapped.

Yeah dont count on ice barbed spear, well be stuck with lords alexander battle axe/stoneslayer/ princess mace I think.
---
Well you do 6g/h from
---
Level 30-40 grinding beasts. 10/15 g per hour in the 40/50s. Grinding with some questing is my style so yeah im always rich as fuck. 
---
only rogues are overplayed, and you can frequently can see "full on melee" or "already got a rogue". Rogues almost spots always taken first.plus they don't really provide any utility in groups, so not that needed. 
---
warriors occupy 2 spots in groups. casters always needed, hunters are just a pick for casual levelers and gold farming. same as mages. so theese two classes pop is inflated cos ton of ppl ran a gold farming alt, they don't really play.
---
so ya, only rogues. 
---
Thanks. I was asking the question with 5-mans in mind mostly since a lot of tanks like to stack the group in their favor for loot lol.
---
Agreed. Something else about vanilla is that you had to work for everything you had. Epic mounts. Epic gear. Even gold could be hard to come by if you didn’t know how to farm effectively. You earned things rather than doing lfr. Legendaries were legendary. Not everyone had them. I’ll never forget the time I saw a druid in T2 for the first time. I knew this was a raider and they put in time and effort to get that much gear. That’s no longer the case in retail. The leaders of cities asked us to do things because we were adventurers and not gods gift to azeroth. 
---
Could be cool if they were undead lol, like Mograin and Whitemane have been calling the shots from seclusion to hide their corruption.
---
Gotta swap out that title for Scout and you're set!
---
Gate requires two people to operate?
---
Ah, in that situation you would use Windfury since the only real alternative of tranq air is obviously counter intuitive. Besides, tanking with windfury vs not having windfury is like night and day. Once you get a taste for it you will always want to group with a shaman.
---
Personally i want to play a hunter as i love the playstyle at endgame, and really enjoy PVP. Being able to kite melee classes like crazy is a ton of fun. My only concern though is the fact that hunters scale terribly compared to other classes. Their overall DPS after MC/BWL is not that good, and the fact that gear makes little to no difference (at later stages) kind of demotivates me to farm gear in raids. What do you guys think? Alternative classes, pros/cons regarding hunters etc.
---
As an alliance druid hit deadmines once for the quests and pray for smites. If no luck there's a decent green from a quest in redridge. Around 29 hit gnomer for the side boss mace which you can farm quickly from the backdoor. That'll carry you into your 40s. From there you can grab the staff from ulda or buy a mace from the ah that'll carry you to 60. 
---
Hmm, that's a pretty good way to circumvent it in a way, thanks!
---
That's like asking why do we have sex if we aren't trying to reproduce..... It's fun and feels amazing.
---
The recent trends and events that have occurred in the gaming industry, as a passionate gamer(lol), has really encouraged me to look further into the business side of any industry.
---
Looking into things like how they operate, how far in advance they plan, what drives their decision-making, who makes the decisions, who has a say.
---
It's given me a lot more perspective, and that gives me better expectations on what we might get with Classic wow.
---
Haha sorry, you just got me thinking about how much I love good games.
---
He's actually a legionnaire! But I highly doubt I will get that this go around. Too much life unfortunately 
---
Wait how many years??
---
This.  What we need imo, is a retune of all the end game raids.  Ideally, MC as of 1.1.  BWL  as of 1.6 etc.
---
That would be the authentic Vanilla experience.  MC was't always the entry level raid.  It was THE raid at one point.
---
I agree. A lot of peeps in my retail guild are saying things like, "I'm going to try it out, see if I like it, but I dunno if I'll stay into it if everyone else isn't" or "all the pserver folks will steamroll through everything then quit before I'll even be ready to raid", so I think there's definitely the possibility of a fast recession after the initial burst.
---
Personally, I'm going to play to have fun myself, and try not to let what everyone *else* is doing impact my enjoyment of the game, but I'm afraid a lot of people will hop on bandwagons and follow the hive mentality, whatever that may be, positive or negative.
---
Girlfriends are over-rated. Just visit a prostitute as god intended
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
It's gonna be far less after Blizzard pissed off their most loyal fans at BlizzCon 2018.
---
believe it or not, but thats exactly how I feel when playing bfa. So its great that we have a choice between classic and retail :) 
---
I know right, I had some time at work today so I surfed the retail subreddit for a bit, man...some people are just in extreme denial and claim Classic is DOA lol.
---
Damn, it was so rewarding to get your mount or some legendary equipment!
---
Would you say vanilla was an experience targeting more of the "hardcore gamers"? Those gamers who were eager to spend a lot of time on the game looking for a challenge?
---
Because what you say is absolutely true. Blizzard has consciously changed the game towards a one player game.  
---
And there obviously are players who prefer it that way.  
---
Do you think it's fair to say the game has become more "casual"? (not meant as an offense to retail players)
---
I am conflicted in upvoting this as i am planning on rolling a resto shaman and i dont want competition.
---
would appreciate it if you stopped using the exact assets i designed for all my guides most notably the background of your slides..sincerely, kargoz
---
Are these previews of what will be in classic? Gorgeous.
---
I'm a purist, I want the struggle of original WoW in every way. But graphic improvements are more than fine by me. 
---
The absolute number 1 question is whether you are alliance or horde. On alliance, in MOST CASES, 2h weapons are simply an extra item; incentive given to your top players or whatever, since they have almost no use in a PvE setting, therefore not increasing the raid's dps (pre-raid dual wields are basically better than most 2h setups, even stuff like Ashkandi).
---
On horde, however, 2h is an actual competitive and viable alternative to dual wielding, which makes equipping your fury warriors with raid-tier weapons a lot easier since it opens a whole other avenue of weapons. Obsidian Edged Blade, Unstoppable Fore, Bonereaver's Edge, Untamed Blade, Drake Talon Cleaver, Ashkandi, etc. are all legitimate PvE weapons. In these situations any competent loot council (or DKP system) would prio giving it for PvE progress reasons.  
---
(By this logic giving a strong 2h to an alliance hunter would be an actual PvE increase and most hardcore guilds will probably do so, but only if their hunters are good enough to weave in melee hits into their rotations).
---
A lot of the people who will be playing classic don’t play retail, and would never play retail in it current state. I played from vanilla until the end of wrath. I have a feeling there are a couple million people like me. That’s the audience blizzard is looking to get back. 
---
You replied to my comment. I never even mentioned retail and I'm not familiar enough with it to even do such a comparison. I have no idea what you're on about. 
---
I don't think it splits the community so much as it shows that wow is not the game it was. Almost none of the people who are clamoring for classic play modern wow and, find it to be uninteresting. The New wow squad feels the same about classic. It's two different communities fighting over two completely different games. That happen to share the same name.
---
I am trying to reach out to people currently working at Blizzard. Cause I really would love to hear some of their thoughts and what incentive they got to finally realize those classic servers. After years of people screaming for them. But it turns out it's even harder to get to the right people than expected.
---
Also I think it would be so interesting to see what changes they will add to the game. I know the majority of people want absolutely no changes to it. But we are talking about a huge company here. I'm almost certain they will want to incorporate something to get more money out of it. Or at least some kind of profit. 
---
Not trying to take a dump on Blizzard here. It's just business.
---
The old long AV games.
---
TBC servers are a logical next  step if Vanilla does well. I’m not sure it will do quite as well as vanilla back in the day. My gut feeling is we will get 3-5 million players to stick around. I’m sure that would be more than enough to justify TBC servers 
---
Most definitely. #nochanges, keep realm caps authentic! 
---
Those are the players who love BFA... nothing to care about
---
If you don't raid, your best bet is AV xbow and pvp gear. Supplement that with gear from Dire Maul and you have a great start. 
---
How much against raiding are you? Eventually people will be regularly pugging MC and Onyxia. The 50% drop rate from the chest means it is easy to get the MC piece you need and Onyxia doesn't take long at all. You also get to do the most fun/frustrating quest in the game. 
---
I hate raiding, but I would always try to get it if I had the time.
---
That tier set mix up looks super cool
---
Yet it was still at 0 karma when I read it.. upvoted..
---
Pretty unfair to say "40% are playing 5 classes" when 2 of the classes are only avaible to one faction. So it's more like top 4 most played = 60% and button 4(5) = 40%. 
---
Paladin/Shaman should be calculated together in this kind of stat.
---
You definitely have a point there. My choice of words was not great.
---
They are two different communities, who just happen to intertwine with each other because their game shares the same name. And even though they are two separate games there has been so much hate around. Both sides seem to be scared that their version of the game will not be treated appropriately. I've heard many retail players being afraid of resources being taken away from "their" WoW. 
---
The whole debate that has been going on for years now seems to be redundant. It appears to me that both communities will be getting what they want and they might even help each other grow. Classic players might want to check out retail WoW at some point and the other way around. I think this could turn out positively for both sides.
---
Holy fuck so much content in here. So sad they cut azjol nerub, Wotlk would have been the best expac had they done that instead of ToS. At least would have been a contender against tbc
---
Hahaha I don’t like time travel, so naturally I don’t like them!
---
Well you got me thinking, in theory if you have all range dps then a shammy can drop tranquil air totem where it won't hit the tank but still be in range of the other 4 group members so threat-wise it would be better.
---
Holy crap youre actually going through with it. I remember you made it as a joke a month ago in another thread and then I just stimulated the intrigue even further. That's awesome man. Kinda jealous you got a pal to do that with, I'm doing the ole' priest + warrior duo for classic.
---
My alt will be druid tho...
---
Thanks for the info. Do you have similar stats for only lvl 60 characters or know of a resource for that?
---
Exactly!!! Vanilla-Wrath is where it’s at! 
---
Windfury on the tank would beat 20% threat for other members.
---
Probably. Which is why there are a bunch of discussions around server merging. If they increase popcap over 2.5k i'll eat a hat.
---
yes, in theory. most resto shamans take the improved totem radius talent so its range is 30 yards, which is a really big area, and truthfully, a lot of spots in instances are tight corridors or areas where you cannot really get that much range. Besides, the increase in threat generation which windfury provides your tank due to the massive rage boost more than compensates for the 20% threat your ranged would receive, it's also an actual dps increase for the tank.
---
The only discussions about merging are player side. Not on Blizzards side.
---
Hopefully you enjoy medium rare Fedoras.
---
20% consistent threat reduction vs 20% lootbox threat generation hm..
---
I was only 9 years old...
---
So a meme raid for meme specs? I'm totally up for that.
---
Oh shiiiii
---
Best of luck with trying to reach out to people. It'll be difficult, but it's always worth a shot. 
---
You never *really* know if something in life'll work out, until you try it, if you think you have the fortune of an attempt.
---
Okay that was made up in a split second but good on you for reaching out to Mark Kern.
---
Maybe if you decide to tie in some other video game examples, you can reach out to them, or maybe people from other fields such as marketing.
---
Although you're the one that knows exactly what room you have to breath with tying other fields, most i've ever needed written for an essay is 2000 words. 
---
Thanks! I wish I hadn't been hiding the high warlord shield
---
There's also sulthraze and destiny but the swing speeds kinda bad. 
---
The range shouldn't be an issue at all past the first pull or two of an instance. It would be tedious for the shaman to have to run back 20-25 yards to plant the totem so that it isn't hitting the warrior but do-able.
---
The tank might gain some dps for himself, but the three range dps would gain more potential dps between them since they can do potentially 20% more without worrying about pulling. Subtract the threat gain from windfury from the 20% tranquil air (20% - windfury threat gained) and I think there would be a net gain overall, but I don't know the numbers exactly so I can't make a judgement.
---
But vanilla evolved and changed over time, progressing through all of the content with 1.12 classes wouldn't be an accurate recreation. This leads us to the question of "what would be the most accurate representation of the game"? The playerbase has changed too. Should things be changed to compensate for the increased skill and knowledge? Should things just be left alone? Putting up a 100% accurate recreation of a specific patch is not the same experience, should we accept a different experience if it means that the game itself is 100% the same in every little way possible?
---
These are questions that everyone has a different answer to. Everyone wants something different. One change that somebody considers an improvement will be considered "not real vanilla" by someone else.  Some people would consider 1.12 with no adjustments whatsoever to be "not real vanilla".
---
Is facerolling through raids with 1.12 classes, full consumables+world buffs, and a guild that doesn't keyboard turn and actually knows how to properly gear+play their character "vanilla" though?
---
Right.. so my argument is that we will keep server caps the exact same as classic was. Which matches entirely with the only communication we have from blizzard.  
---
YOU think it will change, yet your'e asking me to provide a quote of why it won't.  
---
that's an interesting tactic
---
Pretty much every game ever has outrage 100% of every day. Player numbers are what matter. 
---
The server itself only has data for total characters made.
---
All of the census data that I've been able to find is about 6 months old and for the newer realm, before most people had hit 60.
---
Someone would need to run census scans every few hours for around a week to get some reliable data.
---
Is that a Jersey Shore reference? :3
---
Blizzard has literally said nothing about server caps.
---
Ah, the lawful evil route.
---
It's to fix the "tourist" problem, which is indeed a brand new problem that vanilla did not have.
---
I think anything with dedicated graphics will run it extremely well.
---
I know that when I tried the demo I went from the 60ish fps I got on legion live were running steadily capping at 200 on the Classic demo.
---
Modern architecture + plus much lower graphics = win.
---
I wouldn't worry about what Legion took to run, because all of the textures and spells are going to require much much less. Shadows and water notwithstanding. I will want it to look like classic and that won't require much at all.
---
Or just filter the data on the individual factions, since that is likely more relevant anyway.
---
&gt;Alterac Valley had a handful of changes in the life of vanilla.
---
&gt;Reenforcement counter
---
No. Just no. Stop spreading this misinformation. Vanilla never had a reinforcement counter.
---
I remember playing a night elf hunter. At level 10 I started running to SW. Then tram to IF. Then I ran north. 
---
North and north, up to the eastern plaguelands. Through the portal, into the ghostlands, and into Eversong woods. Then I'd tame me the Dragonhawk and port back to SW. 
---
In vanilla I always ran north from IF to the undead starting area and tamed me a lvl 3 bat. Or as horde I'd go get me an Owl. Just those fun hard to get pets. 
---
The argument against class balance tweaks that I see floated just about every time is how that would ruin raid composition, like instead of 13 mages, you bring 3-4 boomkins and that will fuck up the game because vague excuse.              
---
               
---
The only people I see cheer leading the anti change campaign are the same people who plan to play a warrior or mage. If Paladin Tanks become viable it somehow ruins their ability to tank and rather flesh out a more diverse raid group it instead means Cash Shops and Dungeon finder? I dont know I've had several arguments over it and every time it devolves into changing even the smallest thing like MP5 increase for Boomkins/Paladin tanks must mean flying and LFR being introduced.               
---
              
---
I understand Ion Hazzikostas point of view, no changes = no work / free money, I mean this is the same slimey shit ball defending BFA so the fact anyone on this sub would quote him is super weird. I know he says a lot of things to resonate with the Classic crowd but everything he actually does is in complete polar opposite.
---
It's really great. Haven't met an asshole yet
---
&gt;Exponentially longer.
---
Linearly longer. 
---
No, but I can give u a huge :) 
---
I agree that DM on release is bizarre. For many classes DM gear in several slots is better than anything from Mc. Having Dire Maul in classic at the start is a mistake. Fuck, as a druid who doesn't plan to raid its good for me as I have access to all the gear I need from the start. But I think it's a bad move overall
---
Just a note if you want to look at existing case studies to project where it will take the split versions of the game and community there are examples out there.  See runescape with RS3 and OSRS.  The former filled with tons of outdated content, MTX and player convenience (easier to level, less grindy and P2W).  OSRS being pure nostalgia with modern updates no MTX, player driven decisions and old school grindiness.  RS3 is all but dead and OSRS is thriving.
---
A lot of what I said about RS3 are the same sentiments a top commenter in this thread mentioned.  I won't stretch to say that they are slowly putting a shotgun to the head of main WOW, but the success of OSRS and the state of RS3 have a lot of potential parallels.  Will be fun to write about and fun to see years from now how this all plays out.
---
Wait until half the population make it to level 20-30 and stop when they realized how grindy it was. 
---
Haha just theorycrafting and maybe testing on a pserver a bit.  Instant 60, already acquired most of the gear for the paladin.  Druid would be a breeze.  Very low time investment for now just a thought experiment and fun project.  Classic is a whole nother story =P  
---
&gt; Some people would consider 1.12 with no adjustments whatsoever to be "not real vanilla".
---
Right as someone who mained a Druid Tank all through vanilla I always held out hope I could raid tank, sadly I had to wait till TBC for my day in the sun but at least there was hope that a patch would come along and fix it. Now everyone just wants a static frozen in time patch 1.12 where nothing will get better or worse and the class population balance will be complete shit because of it, yeah congrats, your a OP Warrior, you and literally every fucking body else looking to play the game.
---
&gt; Loot trading is not like vanilla. Sharding is not like vanilla. Dire Maul on day one is not like vanilla. Stepping into Molten Core for the first time with easy-mode "prepped for Burning Crusade" era itemization and increased loot drops is not like vanilla.
---
I see a lot of pointing out issues and no solutions. Are you really going to call it a discussion one can run away from when all you're doing is just pointing out problems? Yes those things are not like vanilla. Does that mean we should abandon all ideas of keeping the remaining parts as close to vanilla as possible?
---
Loot trading is a thing they're gung-ho about adding but can you really blame them? With all that's going on at Activision Blizzard right now, running a fan-service project like this is really risky. They've already got massive cost cutting going on in the company, so why wouldn't the managers push for keeping a Legion-feature that, they think, will cut down on customer support costs?
---
I don't like the idea of neither sharding nor loot trading but I honestly understand why they're pushing for those particular changes, and I really think the actual developers are fighting against such changes, but lost on first-wave-sharding and loot trading.
---
So, add something to this discussion of yours. How do you propose we solve the issues of first-wavers without sharding, cutting down on CS costs without using loot trading, 1.12 talents&amp;tuning for pre-1.12 content, and all these other problems?
---
Also what's up with the fact that you're continuously saying you don't want a "historical recreation" but then your argument is that shit is bad 'cause it's not like vanilla. Why do you consider it a problem that the difficulty isn't vanilla-like if you don't want the project to be a recreation? You also happen to point out that NPCs moving around, guild banks and whatever QoL features are fine by you. But changed difficulty isn't. Do you not see you're already in the trap OP described in one of his replies to you, you're deliberately picking and choosing the changes **you** like. You even specifically state that you don't care about that stuff because it doesn't affect you. We can do that scenario for each different person on this sub and get 20000 different combinations of changes.
---
Well we can't have that can we
---
not really they can use public cloud infrastructure and scale as needed without any capex on hardware
---
No. Anyone should realize that a "vanilla experience" will require Total Recall technology.

While I can see it working and am a fan of vertical addition of content, I do worry with some of the suggestions I'm seeing here. If the raid drops purely sidegrades that are meant to "unlock" certain specs I really fear people wouldn't run them. This for the simple fact that the massive amount of pure-classes probably wouldn't sign up for, and do, these particular raids if they don't have drops considered better than their existing T3-level gear.

It's being rolled out as I type. But not fully implemented. And shockingly most Chinese people don't care.

We're not criminals"

That's what I'm hoping, I want to go pretty bare bones.

That's cool but kinda the exact opposite of that I'm looking for. I'm buying a set up exclusively to run classic wow so I'm looking for a fraction of that power and price. I play overwatch and all other stuff on my PS4.

Yup, looks about right, going from the top it becomes more and more of a disaster.

Pro move imo if she really is the type to prevent you from enjoying a video game. Life is too short to be controlled by others.
---
Vanilla was for everyone. Casuals and hardcore alike. There was something for all of us. I would say retail is more casual in the sense you can log on and do lfr and get epics then log off for the day. The one playerness of it allows you to do whatever you need to do in limited time. This works especially with the cross realm group finder. So you can be extremely casual because there is always someone somewhere doing what you need. No need to make friends with people you will never see again.
---
From what I can remember about classic WoW, you didn't need to raid to get geared for PvP; beyond maybe some 10 man LBRS/UBRS - and thats PUGable.  Watch videos of strong PvPers from back in the day and you'll see that all blues (optimized correctly) can easily take down high-tier raid geared players in various 1vX situations - even the overpowered Rogue.  I remember that I bought an epic PvP sword to raid with; so really, it's all about how you choose to play the game with Classic.  From what I can assume, it's much more of a polished RPG experience overall, and from playing on a private server, I've remembered that it was quite difficult; compared to later expansions.  I assume because I haven't played since WotLK - though I understand the current retail version has lost many of the RPG elements that made Vanilla so great.  Classic really begs for community interaction in its design philosophy, so group up with like-minded people and coordinate your efforts - you will likely really enjoy yourself.  PvP doesn't require strict scheduling like raiding does, so you play on your time; but you are rewarded for the time you put in, and you can set your own hours.  So whether it's late night ganking, playing a few battlegrounds before going about a days work or studies, or running a few AVs to unwind after a long day - the choice of when you play is yours, not your guild master's.  You won't ever have to sit out from PvP like you would a raid - unless you are a deserter.  Over time, your dedication to PvP will pay off with some pretty epic rewards - maybe even Rank 14 if you're up for the commitment.

Have fun, and best of luck with that open world PvP experience!

I have leveled about 5 warriors in vanilla / p servers
---
I have a mix of all those guides you have read. Everything taught me something useful and I to, while not a major casual, think some of it is over the top (looking at you hamstring method)
---
-Anger management is not necessary. It's nice, but its not mandatory. By pooling rage on low mobs, you can carry over rage nicely
---
-Bloodrage + bandaids is a great method to help you hold the rage over until the next  mob. Little effort and minimal downtime.
---
-When a mob reaches 30% or less HP and you are not in danger or dying, do not use rage on abilities. White swing and you pool rage to use on your next target. Use blood rage method above to heal and gain rage / hold rage and heal
---
-Sweeping strikes really does make leveling faster. I only tried it recently. Religiously using it every chance i saw two mobs side by side (STV noteable). It's awesome and really makes leveling faster...following up on that
---
-Only ever fight mobs / level in zones where the mobs are your level or two levels under. Not one over, not two over. Sure you CAN do that...but your damage output is way lower and using SS can get you killed because two mobs with one level on you can accidentally kill you (misses, parries)
---
-After you reach rend level 3, don't buy any more upgrades. I parted with it and put my rage into heroic strikes instead. Noticed a lot more HSes and faster kills. Even with my level 30 whirlwind axe dmg from rend just wasn't worth it
---
-Hamstring method great in theory, annoying as fuck in practice. I used it only a handful of times on elites because I was curious and never heard of it. On regular mobs I just kept running into other mobs and dying. On elites it works wonders. Use it only when necessary ( I used it three times leveling up big w/e his name is for quest, panther in 1k needles and a rare mob)
---
I adapted all those into my build and found leveling a lot easier than before when I just did one mob at a time, and healed to full rinse and repeat.
---
No bow drops from Onyxia, only the sinew. You need the petrified leaf from Majordomo's Cache then start the Hunter Quest, probably the best quest in the game. You combine the staff you get from killing the demons, then you receive the bow.
---
Early opinion but the no changes crowd dies as soon as we get to wotlk and people start praying they do not add features. 
---
I would suggest going late summer or early fall  unless you’re racing for server first lvl 60. If you take your vacation after the initial Zerg rush you’ll be guaranteed to get online without server crashes/queues and I’d argue a week off at lvl 60 vs. Starting fresh would be a better use of the time. 
---
Every time I hear from 1:48 onwards, the nostalgia just **rushes** back and I find myself back in Drek's fortress in AV
---
Sorry, the reinforcement counter was added in a later expansion.
---
But the times are right. When people just rush to the bosses it's over quick. Bad example, but pservers they could even get done a little over 20 minutes if you got lucky. Plenty of YouTube videos even showing it before bwl content was released.
---
I’d suggest taking an actual vacation. There’s no guarantee whatsoever that WoW will be released or that there won’t be server problems or some other nonsense.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited to play too, but WoW will be around when you get back from vacation.
---
Tone it down a bit dude. Its a little to much crazy for me at this point. Relax a little.
---
As a sum of the total what i said is still correct, but /u/camefordankmemes has a suitable suggestion as well.
---
So if you make those changes its no longer vanilla. Is there any way for you to understand that?
---
I want Vanilla.
---
You want wow2. Thats fine, but its not vanilla.
---

"whether it's a white hit (auto attack) or a yellow hit (hamstring, heroic strike, whirlwind, etc.)."
---
All extra attacks procced by Windfury Totem are white attacks, so not sure what you mean by that.
---
And the post beneath is about the poor state of both the company and the retail game, so it's looking good for Classic!
---
yes, his is better. But then it's the result is closer to "60% of players on each faction plays rogue/hunter/mage/warrior out of the 8 classes" which isn't as bad as what u said :D
---
Your faction still needs to be horde.
---
&gt; I see a lot of pointing out issues and no solutions. 
---
&gt;So, add something to this discussion of yours. How do you propose we solve the issues of first-wavers without sharding, cutting down on CS costs without using loot trading, 1.12 talents&amp;tuning for pre-1.12 content, and all these other problems?
---
Ok, sure!
---
**Dire Maul solution**: don't have it available on release. Easy.
---
**Loot trading solution**: remove loot trading. Easy.
---
**Sharding solution**: This is more complicated because dealing with it depends on things Blizzard knows but isn't talking about. It's been proposed that sharding is necessary because over the course of all the expansions since sharding has been in the game, the code evolved to assume that it exists, and as such, it's no longer _capable_ of dealing with large numbers of players in a zone all at the same time. As a programmer...that sounds plausible to me. That is a thing that _might_ have legitimately happened, and if it has, I understand why Blizzard doesn't want to change it, because it could mean a great deal of effort.
---
However, is that is _not_ what's happened, there's a solution for the sharding problem that was proposed on the battle.net forums a while ago that nicely solves (some) of the problems sharding seeks to solve. Sharding exists for two reasons: first, it a makes the gameplay experience "nicer" because you don't end up with 50 players competing for the same mob. For that problem I say...too bad, just deal with it. Let the day one experience be a mess, it's part of the "vanilla experience" in my opinion, and it will naturally sort itself out over time. 
---
The other issue is one of server populations. Most people are expecting a huge influx of tourists on day one who will then rapidly disappear. Sharding allows Blizzard to have "on paper" fewer servers than are required to accommodate all the tourists, but simply stick everybody in an illusion and juggle behind the scenes who sees who. I see why they would want to do that. However, there is an alternative solution that has been floating around on the battle.net forums but that's rarely discussed in this sub: instead of sharding, create instances of servers with the plan to either: (consolidate _or_ rename_ them later as appropriate. For example, on day one let's say there's are 20 different server names. For out example let's look at the one called Blackhand. As new players join, at some point a population cap will be reached. Once it does, we call it Blackhand 1, and spawn Blackhand 2. Repeat as necessary, so you end up with however many "instances" of the server. Now, eventually the tourists will leave and populations will drop off. So let's say that Blackhand 1 ends up with not enough player, Blackhand 2 ends up with enough players, and Blackahdn 3 ends up with not enough players. So Blackhand 1 and 3 players are consolidated and the server becomes simply "Blackhand" while what was Blackhand 2 gets a new name entirely and becomes Whitehand for example. This solves most, not all...but most of the problems relating to shifting populations, no sharding required.
---
**Stepping into Molten Core for the first time with easy-mode "prepped for Burning Crusade" era itemization and increased loot drops**: There are two obvious solution here: progressive itemization and retuning. This is a legitimate conversation that can be had. Progressive itemization a few people are talking about...but personally I suspect it's an uphill battle because it potentially means a lot of misery for Blizzard, having to go through through thousands of items and then continually adjust them multiple times. Yes, "the data exists" and so maybe they could save a lot of time by for example simply using patch 1.x item data on day one, then patch 1,x+y data when they release the next raid tier, etc. That's a _valid_ solution, but it probably has some very strange consequences. For example, certain class specs became more or less viable over the course of vanilla. Progressive itemization might mean that your class spec that was viable for one raid tier might cease to be viable for the next. Or...you might have classes that because of lack of gear aren't viable _until_ a change a made, so people could end up stuck playing classes that are in bad places until itemization changes happen.
---
The other solution is much simpler: retune content, buff bosses, etc. Retuning happened all the time during vanilla, and so long as they're doing it to make the game _harder_ rather than easier, I would be ok with it. But it's an unpopular solution among the 'no changes' crowd.
---
&gt;Also what's up with the fact that you're continuously saying you don't want a "historical recreation" but then your argument is that shit is bad 'cause it's not like vanilla. Why do you consider it a problem that the difficulty isn't vanilla-like if you don't want the project to be a recreation?
---
These aren't contradictory. Again...this is one of those things that's been discussed many times, and I find it a little annoying that people act like they don't understand this.
---
Not everybody wants to play Classic for the same reason.
---
This is fact. Accept it. For some people, they want to "relive the experience" that they had ~15 years ago. They enjoyed the game as it was back then, they didn't like the particular changes that were made, and they want the old game back. For other people, it annoys them that the "game keeps changing" and so the thing they do feels like it's constantly changing on them. Emotionally and psychologically these are very different motivations.
---
For example, consider something like when they added a second mailbox outside of Stormwind south bank. To somebody who care about the "vanilla experience" something like this is utterly unimportant. The number and placement of mailboxes is not what made vanilla what it was. But to somebody who "doesn't want the world to change" they go one day and see one mailbox, they go the next day they see one mailbox...they play for two years and every day there's one mailbox, and then one day they show up and now there are two mailboxes. "That's not how it was." This bothers them. Even if you can get them to agree that it's convenient or whatever to have two mailboxes and that it makes it harder for people to do mailbox griefing, _that's not the point_. The point is, for these people, that "that's how it was" and they want the sameness.
---
Again, these are very _very_ different motivations.
---
Take something like item or boss retuning. To somebody who wants to relive the _experience_ they had of playing vanilla 15 years ago...dose it really matter if the dagger of foo that drops from the boss of whomever...does it really matter if it has +3 vs +4 agility? No, probably not. I can't even tell you what the stats were on the dagger of foo, and if it's a little bit different I wouldn't know or care. And if making it a little bit different more accurately recreate the _experience_ we had of playing the game, I'm ok with that.
---
But the 'no change' philosophy seems to be that it's crucially important that the _number_ be the same, even if that means that the _experience_ is different. As described above, patch 1.12 itemization is going to result in drastically different _experience_, because the game is going to be a whole lot easier from day one. But these people don't care about that, because the "experience" isn't what's important to them. It's the "sameness" of the world _itself_ that they care about.
---
Here's an analogy I've given many times: think back on riding the swings in elementary school. You were a certain size and the swings were a certain height. If you go back to those swings as an adult, the experience of riding on them is going to be very different, because you're taller now. If you want to recreate the _experience_ you had of riding those swigs as a kid, you have to make them _bigger_ so that their relative height and yours are the same as they were back then. If you exactly and precisely copy the swings exactly as they were when you were a kid and then ride them as a 6 foot tall adult, your feet are going to drag on the sand, your'e not going to fit right, and it's going to be extremely different, even though the swings _themselves_ are "the same."
---
This is the problem that I personally have with the "no changes" philosophy. It's trying to copy the swings rather than copy the _swinging_.
---
&gt; Do you not see you're already in the trap OP described in one of his replies to you, you're deliberately picking and choosing the changes you like.
---
No. That's either not honest, or you don't understand. If you want to talk about this we can talk about it, please be _honest_ about it and have a real conversation. Like I said, Classic is not going to be vanilla. That's not me saying this...it's Blizzard saying that. They've made it very clear. _Deal with it_. It's reasonable to want to make adjustments to this hybrid thing they're making to make it more like how vanilla was.
---
For a little more money he could grab an RX 570, which are super cheap now, and run everything on high.  Plenty of time to save up too. 
---
I initially ran Vanilla on a single core laptop with integrated graphics, even raided a bit with it.  If a 2004 laptop could pull it off, just about anything could run it on low now. 
---
They should give priority to people with accounts created in 2004, and have not had active subscription since 2007-2008. ( quit during tbc ).
---
I'm not bias or anything, that just happens to be me.
---
From my experience on pservers (which may obviously differ from Classic), all 3 classes are rolled pretty heavily, but mages are the ones with the least issue finding a dungeon/raid spot. They have lots of utility and damage. Hunters have little raid spots but they’re not as popular as rogue/mage at 60. Rogue is the class I saw being over represented. My guild was having issues with attendance with every class after clearing Naxx a few times except rogues. We had weeks where we’d be missing key healer or tank spots but still have to sit rogues because over 10 showed up. 
---
If you're in Naxx gear and fully world buffed, you can probably clear Onyxia, Lucifron, Magmadar, Gehennas, Shazzrah, most of ZG and AQ20.
---
Either lvl a mage/hunter alt to farm gold or do duo DM:East with a healer for gold.
---
not all 2hs should go to hunters though, as they don't benefit from strength stat stick 2hs, so they are free game for pvpers
---
Every asshole that play war/rogue/mage that don't want to risk to not be top of the dps meter, and/or that are proud to play their classes, to the point everyone who doesn't do so is worthless to them.
---
Exactly, there is absolutely nothing wrong with improved graphics. It doesn't change any actual gameplay experience, and if you can toggle it then there should be absolutely no problem. 
---
nah it technically does give rage out of combat, albeit weirdly, because they don't get added together to be -3, instead they both just go on by themselves so you will see your out of combat rage go up every now and then
---
If you guess too early with your vacation, it might not be out yet. If you go a bit safer and pick late summer, atleast you might have a week free with the game, even if it’s not for release
---
The pvp sets/gear were on par with bwl gear, some a little better.
---
 Many players didn't get past that in retail, and I doubt many will again (no matter what they think). So you can still wreck shop in pvp on a good majority of the population.
---
The bc 'solution' was more segregation than anything else. It hurt pvpers trying to get into pve, and it hurt pvers trying to get into pvp later on. 
---
i know
---
I turned it off and now I can't access BFA.
---
How to fix?
---
But we live in a society now of people who want instant gratification and won't commit to it taking months to get enough gold to buy riding, or months to grind to the level for a mount. 
---
"I want Vanilla" isn't a very concrete statement given that each patch of Vanilla had vastly different balance. That's the issue.
---
When you know the release 
---
Well done sir, I read all of that. LOL
---
I'm pretty much the opposite. I LOVED that I never had to touch a raid or deal with any sort of raiding guild bullshit in order to be competitive in PvP. 
---
Wrath probably did it best, raid bosses dropped tokens that could be redeemed for PvP gear if you chose. So you can maintain both sets at the same time. Vanilla's system was by far the worst in my opinion, being forced to PvE in order to PvP. 
---
I have a feeling we might crash the server on launch day
---
Minus the gpu, the power is pretty much on par with the previous list. 
---
That's purely subjective. Not everyone likes the intense grind that was Vanilla. It had the worst pvp/honor system which was created purely for /played and benefited people who played more vs people who were skilled.  Raiding was ok, but the mechanics were incredibly simple, and bosses were more often than not overtuned. Vanilla was super fun for me, but TBC was in my OPINION a better game. Bosses were properly tuned and had better mechanics, Blizzard began their focus on PVP with arenas, and TBC overal kept the feel of the community that was most prevalent in Vanilla. 
---
Vanilla was great, it was the beginning of a fantastic community, but aside from leveling, exploration, and community, it's an average game for players who are skilled. I'll be playing it daily with my guildmates onl because its the closest thinkg we'll probably ever get to TBC, but to say Vanilla is a better game is purely subjective. Note my entire paragraph lol 
---
So I should run an Arms build from the get-go?
---
&gt; all the pserver folks will steamroll through everything then quit before I'll even be ready to raid
---
If Blizzard was smart, they lock out raiding for the first 4 months.  Then release a raid every 2 or 3 months on a schedule.  pserver folks will spend their time building alts while everyone else catches up.
---
You aren't getting that weapon for a loooong time unless you're the hunter class lead for your guild. If you're the 5th most reliable hunter in the guild then you'll get the 5th one that drops for the guild, which could take a year of farming BWL. 
---
You’re not wrong 
---
I prefer the AV that lasted for days.  If you want fast action, play AB or WSG.
---
it's a bit different as an aussy because the servers will actually have more than 100 online a day, so probably most oce pserver players will swap over
---
that's not how it works, it's still 5% threat because you are comparing % threat increase to threat not % threat increase to damage, so with your threat of 1000, 5% dmg boost you now have 1050 threat, so a 5% threat increase.
---
Yeah real bad uldaman weapons are way better if you understand hamstring kite
---
My guild had a silent bid DKP system (outside of MT loot).  If you bid the most and your class could use it, then you got it.  DKP was absolute.  However, the custom was never to bid too much on loot that was better for someone else.  
---
For example, there was a dagger in the MC was an upgraded weapon for both rogues and hunters(stats for hunters, minor upgrade only).  Typically hunters would bid double the minimum bid and rogues would bid much higher so they could get the item first.  Eventually, we were down to one rogue in the raid that didn't have it and he bid the min on it (20 DPK) and I bid my normal 40DKP I did every time it dropped and I won the item as a hunter.  The guy was upset, but he was trying to get a major upgrade without spending a lot.  Raid leader told him to bid more next time and that was the end of it.  Next raid it dropped he bid 100dpk and got it.
---
Warriors, rogues, mages are all very popular, but you also need a lot of them for raids since they are the best dps classes. So if you are worried about getting a raid spot it doesn't matter too much. A few hunters are mandatory in a raid, but other dps classes will usually get preference outside of that. 
---
For five mans warrior tanks get groups super easily. And mages are the best dps for that kind of content due to good cc and aoe. Hunters do good damage, has cc and can kite, so not too bad. Rogues do good damage, but bring nothing special to the table, so the worst choice out of these four for five mans. 
---
Still, all of these classes can do a good job in all content, which is probably also why they are popular. Playing an uncommon spec like ret pala, shadow priest, balance druid, will be much worse for finding groups simply because they are worse than other classes. 
---
Basically, don't look too much at which is most popular, also consider what the demand for each class is. 
---
This is not an issue, since everything is in the cloud, they can easily scale up and then roll back down later, the tech is very good.
---
I think there will be a big initial wave, will die down, and then slowly over a few years, it will slowly become massive, way bigger than modern wow, and mr brack will have to eat his hat. 
---
There is a reason the same thing happened to os runescape, the fundamentals of the game were super addicting, not in the short term, but the long term, same with classic wow. It might take a while to find a group to kill that elite mob, but it makes the reward meaningful.
---
Hey that second picture is my phone background 
---
Well looking at the patch notes, the devs revised what “vanilla” was at least 11 times. I don’t think your argument holds water.
---
Nah, even on private servers I still use the default UI. No reason other than i've just not bothered to mess with addons since the Cata days. Retail has my HP and combo points below my character, and I think I might move the frame for the enemy below my character.
---
Honestly, its not exactly a huge strain to move my eyes. Same with writing code, doing homework, etc. Lots of room, many windows, such information.
---
Fake Gamers, what a perfect name for a retail guild /s
---
The best route, as in the route that best serves me but can still be called a route.
---
A friend of mine didn't finish leveling until 4 months before TBC launched which basically killed the raiding scene for that time period. I crafted him a Flawless Arcanite Rifle
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=16007
---
And he went to town PvP wise both in BGs and in the world.  He had a blast.
---
Sapper charges are nice when you need burst AoE like on Visicidus, otherwise not important in PvE.
---
Patch 1.5
---
We've always allowed discussion of Nostalrius. It is a very specific exception due to its direct involvement with Classic WoW and the fact that it's defunct.
---
May as well just shard the entire game. In fact just cancel classic and keep everyone on BFA at that point. 
---
Shadow priests were the class I least wanted to fight as a hunter.  Warlocks I did better against since I basically kited them at all times.  A good frost mage could be a real challenge.
---
&gt;I've seen very few rogues, which leads me to believe they're not nearly as popular as the others.
---
Rogues are not popular on pservers because most people are rushing to raid.  They will be very popular in classic where a good chunk of people will just be there to have fun.
---
It's just flipping the coin, it forces pvers to do a butt load of pvp, just so they can play.
---
Either way it reminds me of the south park quote, "so now what?" "Now we can play the game!"
---
I may do some things the same, or similar. But for the most part, I'll be looking to create new experiences and memories with one of my favourite games.
---
I'll be firing up my old 2005 emachines with 2gb RAM just to keep shit authentic.
---
thousands of hours in league here, can confirm
---
&gt;Can someone who's never played still start the game?
---
Yes. But unless you are on the current expansion it's kind of a mess and not very fun. Luckily I think you get a level boost if you buy the expansion, which will bring you to level 110 (120 is max). 
---
&gt;Or should I have done it 10 years ago and now am simply too late?
---
Nah. It was a more relevant game 10 years ago though. Now it's pretty ancient, and if you are used to modern games it might not be very fun. 
---
&gt;Is classic wow a real thing? Or is there only one, modern version of it currently live?
---
There is one current version live. Which includes all expansions and patches from the past 14 years. But a lot of newer expansions and patches either modifies or overwrites older content. So "WoW Classic" will be released maybe this summer, and will be the first version of the game, without any expansions. That version of the game is almost completely gone from the live game, has been overwritten and such in subsequent expansions. Which is why a lot of people are very enthusiastic about playing WoW Classic, they think the newer expansions has "ruined the game". 
---
&gt;Is there (and should there be) a difference which WoW (classic or modern) a noob should start playing?
---
If you are willing to wait half a year. And if you are looking to experience a classic from computer game history, at the time one of the most popular games ever, then you should play WoW classic. It is a 2004 game though, got to be aware of that. 
---
If you just want to play a cool MMO right now, then try current WoW, it's been updated a lot over the years and while still fairly old fashioned, it holds up reasonably well. 
---
And if you start playing modern WoW right now, then you can just jump over and try classic when that is released. 
---
There are a lot of complaints about the current version of WoW both in that community (head over to /r/wow), and in here (which is full of people playing older versions on private servers and such). But as a new player that stuff doesn't affect you too much, since it mostly comes down to people liking previous systems in the game better than what we have now, which you don't even know about. 
---
Also if you are into lore, you won't really get what's happening in the live version. It's all so tangled up in itself that even veteran players don't always get it. And there's no real possibility of playing through all of the story of earlier expansions any more. Which is also partly why I would recommend using the level boost for your first character. 
---
Absolutely. Overall people seem to care too much about the stuff that doesn't really matter. If the core values and gameplay of vanilla is preserved, I don't see a big deal in tuning out some numbers. 
---
People are hung up about things like "who will dominate dps meters in raids" because of debuff limits and titanic leggins, that it won't be exactly like in 2004, forgetting that it it won't be like that anyways
---
I'd love anywhere in the 1.5 -1.7 area. The overhaul in 1.8 was the worst.
---
Old School Runescape would like a word with you
---
I think there are many factors that made Classic such a loved game.  I think the 3 biggest from a game play/mechanics aspect are:
---
1. The leveling, gearing, crafting, dungeon, pvp, exploring, process was not merely a grind, or a means to an end. It was something in and of itself, and it was fun and rewarding. 
---
2. Social/Community - having such a vast world with so much to do and explore fostered a desire to interact with others, either to get help, to offer help, or just to share in the experience via guilds, and 5-mans, or even teaming up with another for questing. 
---
3. Challenge - The game was more challenging back then, which made the rewards that much more rewarding. Some quests were hard, some required that you get help. Dungeons were challenging. 
---
The other thing to note about the popularity of WoW Classic, is that most of us were new to MMOs, I was. And it was a very different experience in gaming. 
---
I'm exited to play Classic again for a while, I also fear that the excitement will wear off quit as I've done it so much way back then and it won't have the same magic for me 14 years later. 
---
I think it is good that it is coming back, especially coincident with the apparent death of BofA, as if nothing else it will cause people (designers, developers, managers) to really consider what made classic such a great game, and so loved by gamers. 
---
But it is sad that we have to go backward, asking Blizzard to rehash a 14 year old game, so that we can have a game we want to play. When instead, they could have continued to improve on WoW, holding with integrity to the principles that made that earliest version of it so great. And having it evolve at the hands of the developers, and designers, etc. that made the game from the beginning because they wanted a game they themselves would love to play. Instead the game has devolved at the hands of the marketing and sales departments. 
---
most items that reflect damage are things youll get as level cap. (engineer shield, rag trinket,boe cloak of flames, nagel ring) also theres a food item called dragonbreath chili. theres also some mail gauntlets that reflect damage from mara and shield spike enchant.
---
The worse part is it actually *homogenizes* the game even further. Some people in particular like that it's going to be static, because they know they can pick an OP class and it won't change. Don't get me wrong I'm not one for nerfing, but some classes moreso just need a helping hand. Most hybrid DPS &amp; prot pally just need better Mana Regen, that's it. Make it something to add to the last talent in a dps tree to make it worth it. Scrap final ret tree talent into something else completely. Scrap redoubt and give some way for druids/pallys to hit uncrushable. Don't make the shaman defense talents such shit.   
---
  
---
I feel you man, personally wanna roll feral druid hybrid but the amount of effort to make it work is daunting. 
---
I’m going alliance this time around. Max graphics. Can’t wait to play as much as I want/can. 
---
Looking forward to getting to MC and leveling and everything else! 
---
Well it depends on the changes.
---
I was an undead mage in UC. It was a quick walk lol.
---
Lol this is a perfect representation
---
I hope we can hide shoulders in classic.  I know it wasn’t an option in vanilla, but I don’t care 
---
Yuck 
---
No it’s not lol
---
I am very much in the camp of the first 2 xpacs and vanilla being the best, but to say MoP, Legion and even Cata didn’t have some fantastic parts that made them worth playing is just wrong IMO
---
Armory to check out your character im ok with. Check curren5 skills, armor, etc.
---
Anything that actually lets you customize, buy, or change absolutely not.
---
A friend and I were in a party together and Houndmaster Loksey bugged out and kept repeating "Release the hounds!" Over and over for about 10 minutes. 
---
We reference this a lot to this day, as well as interrogator vishas and his voice lines. "Tell me, tell me everything!" "Naughty secrets!" "I will rip the secrets from your flesh!" It was just so creepy and funny
---
Alts. 
---
I do hope more vanilla feel content comes though. No big boost to gear like bc had. But something.
---
In a recent census of people planning on playing classic this summer the breakdown is:
---
Warrior - 18.8 %
---
Rogue - 13.8 %
---
Mage - 13.3 %
---
Priest - 12.7 %
---
Warlock - 10 %

Hunter - 9.1 %
---
Pally, Druid, Shaman - below 7.1 %
---
What content are you interested in most, raiding, PVP, etc.? It is interesting to note that the census also said most preferred content is:
---
Raiding - 27.2 % - which was the top.
---
PVP Battlegrounds - something like 6 % - but it was so low that it did not have an actually number just a slice of a pie chart. 
---
I won't list the rest but this is part of why warrior, rogue, mage, priest are so popular, because they are the best Raid classes. If you plan on doing mostly PVP you can't go wrong with Shaman, lock, or really any of the rest. 
---
I’m going to play a paladin. Granted they’re dope at healing, but it would be cool to tank or dps raids, and if I could I probably would. But I don’t want them to change the game to make that possible to the extent some people want it. 
---
To make boomkins/ret/prot viable (not even optimal) you will have to make many changes to solve many classes, when the truth is not every spec is meant to have a guaranteed spot in a min/max guild. Prot tanks were never meant to be the main raid tanks and that’s ok, I don’t understand why peoole can’t see it that way. 
---
that isn't really an issue to anyone who isn't trying to be disingenuous 
---
I really want to play it but my general disgust with AvtiveBlizz might mean I don't even bother.
---
Just by not giving a shit about the endgame for a little while. Since 2007, every launch experience is 1 week (or 1 day by today’s standards)  of leveling and then centering your existence around the endgame. 
---
I’m excited to have a long haul I can sink my teeth into. 
---
Sure, but Blizzard already made some changes by transfering classic onto the modern engine, and things like realm pop were technological limitations, similar to that of the debuff cap. Except pop has less of an impact on the direct gameplay.
---
I just think Nostalrius showcased how good high pop realms can work on Vanilla, yes they had a dynamic respawn system to make it more playable but the pros were way higher than the cons, and its one of the reasons why the server was so incredibily popular.
---
Like an actual faction war and spontaneous raid PvP groups to contest objectives/zones, you probably can't do that on a realm with a pop of 2k, where there will be one - three raiding guilds per server.
---
no idea, if they're staying as close to classic as possible, it should.
---
Advise?
---
Plan out how to allocate 1,500 hours to these toons. Getting these to 60 as a full time job will take 40 weeks.
---
You're easily looking at a year and a half + to get 8 characters to 60. I'm guessing your PVE plans don't ever include current raid content?
---
Not trying to hate, but if you want to play the Alliance toons during anything current, you won't be able to play the rest. If you want to play them all, you won't be able to have any capable of pulling their weight during current content.
---
What are your goals with these 8 characters? This isn't retail, this broad scope just isn't a thing.
---
If you check the statistics of any pserver they’re pretty over populated even there 
---
My buddy is saying he is gonna break up with his GF when classic comes out and no life it lmao
---
&gt;I’m a firm believer that your common interests don’t have much to do with the success of your relationship.  Sure, you need some common ground and things that you enjoy doing together, but the real defining aspect from the perspective of longevity is how you handle the things you don’t understand or enjoy about the person you are with.
---
Very late to the party, but as someone also in a long term relationship, this couldn't be more spot on. Divorce rate wouldnt be so pathetically high if media would stop pretending you can build a life long partnership off the honeymoon phase, and a few common interests. 
---
This was a really quick draw up that I thought of tonight while I was at work and put on a spreadsheet tonight. I wasn't planning on doing all of these at once. Also, since PVP isn't coming right away, that won't be until later.  
---
Also, why can't you raid on Alliance? And I won't be playing all these characters at the same time but rather playing them one at a time or having one solo and one for grouping.   
---
Also, I started playing late BC/Early WoTLK so I've never played Vanilla. Also, my goal with these 8 characters? Does their need to be one? I just want to play and grind and have a game to put time into.
---
I assumed he was just narrowing down what he wanted to play still.
---
Yeah, sorry mate, your going to have to pick 1, not 8.  
---
when people say 4-8 days to level to 60, thats in /played, and its speed leveling.  
---
The reality is 12+ days /played, which will take months, and thats just to get to 60, 5-mans, pvp and raids come after that.  
---
pick 1 character, start thinking about an alt once your main is like 50+.
---
I played 50+ hours a week during all of vanilla and after 2 years I had 3 60's. and one of them never raided.  
---
8 is not going to happen.
---
Okay thanks for the advice! I wasn't planning on playing them all to 60 but rather try out the classes and see which ones I like and then seeing if I like PVE over PVP. These were all just ideas, I probably should've specified that.
---
Going through the dark portal for the first time loading and seeing a pitlord assaulting the portal and then demons beyond that... it was a glorious moment.  WoD tried to recreate that but demons &gt; orcs
---
Dwarf hunter you can make engineering and then you can make your own guns. Also you can learn the goblin jumper cables so you can feign death during a wipe and use the cables to try to res the healer.
---
A few empty servers means nothing, they can simply merge servers and I do not mean cross-realm shit I mean merge that shit like they should have done multiple expansions ago and avoid the cross-realm zone sharding BS.
---
I would agree with this, but Cata wasn't good. If we could skip cata i'd be all for it... But that doesn't make sense from a logic standpoint. Wotlk is where most want it to stop, as that's also where the population stops on unofficial servers. I'm a firm believer that there are 2 generations of WoW, Vanilla -&gt; Wotlk being the classic era, and Cata-&gt; Bfa being the more modernized era. The game starting having drastic changes even in wrath, however it was somewhere towards the middle/end of the expansion when LFG was added and WoW 2.0 was born. LFR in Cata killed any hope that WoW could return to the classic era.
---
Ohh that's a really good idea! I forgot about the Jumper Cables with engineering. 
---
I had just had knee surgery and had several months of down-time, and not working, when I starting playing Vanilla. 
---
Wish I could recreate that for the Classic launch.  But probably won't be quitting my job. :)
---
Good riddance, more time for gold-shire RP now.
---
As someone that played both a Resto Shaman and Warrior (that mostly tanked) in Vanilla, I can tell you that if there is a Shaman in a 5-man and they are not dropping Windfury Totem for the Warrior tank, they are doing it wrong.
---
That's the safe sex club.
---
I think what they were referring to is the Windfury can proc off of auto attacks as well as ability attacks.
---
That's not how virtual servers work. They all pull from the same pile of resources, a server only uses as much as it needs. They could have hundreds of completely dead servers and it wouldn't cost them a thing.
---
*"he has Kings!"* 
---
/gate opens
---
I never played a pally but I love them. Don't care what spec you're playing as long as you bring your buffs.
---
Why would more people play rogues if they aren't needed?
---
/clap
---
jesus what a mouthful ^^ I'll read it when I get off work and I have a blunt nearby
---
Looks like I’ll be switching things up a lot. I’ll either go Troll/Dwarf  Hunter instead of going with my old Undead Mage. 
---
Now I’m married and work as a consultant that need to travel globally. My idea is to pick the class that can play solo and level as fast as possible. I’ll probably won’t get a chance to raid much anyway so I’ll pick whatever will make the leveling experience as enjoyable as possible. 
---
TBC ruined the game lmaoo you're all confused
---
But at start t1 fell behind green SPD items so what a point in this?
---
Running this so many times on my ud rogue. I made friends who I reminded buddies with all the way until wrath. Good times. When people actually chatted in groups haha 
---
very good
---
I really like your analogy. It's a very good one, and kind of cuts to the heart of the issue that might arise from #nochanges.
---
Nah man just want one clear. Heh.
---
&gt; Only ever fight mobs / level in zones where the mobs are your level or two levels under. Not one over, not two over. Sure you CAN do that...but your damage output is way lower and using SS can get you killed because two mobs with one level on you can accidentally kill you (misses, parries)
---
That's the biggest tip I can give to any new Vanilla player playing a Warrior or Rogue. Even if it involves hopping around to other zones, or even grinding in your current zone to finish out your level, always stay higher level than your quest mobs. 
---
...but the shoulders are the best part of the game
---
Same. It was already on for me, which means it's been on for like 10 years. I've never gotten so much as an email. 
---
I plan on pulling heists in order to fund time travel research. Hopefully I can gather enough funds for a breakthrough so that I can go back in time to play OG Vanilla. Then I will finally be able to relive THE classic experience.
---
What's your issue with the mines? I feel it's a decent alternative for undergeared characters that want to do something to help the team out.
---
Plans right now are to go with the same class. I'm a Horde in spirit but we all know that's where the kiddies are going and plus they have the PvP advantages. It's a dirty job but someone's gotta to do it.
---
For allies!
---
Disenchant my friend
---
Esfand big diehard paladin player, wants no changes...he raids as ret dps also..part of the reason why I personlly am playing warrior is because i want to tank yes but I'm fine with it because thats how vanilla was.
---
Include a column for the last time you played each character so you can efficiently track who is ready to have their rested experience used (10 days = full rested)  
---
I believe there is a conditional format in excel to highlight if that date = ten days ago.  
---
Ele is strong both early and late.
---
 Before anyone has gear you do enough dmg to kill people very quickly, and when you have Naxx gear you completely disintegrate kids. It's that mid point of clearing BWL and just starting aq20/40 that they're a little weaker.
---
If he wants to play 8 characters, he damn well can. There was a person who chronicled their time during vanilla who had leveled every class to 60 and he tried to make a guide out of it.  
---
If leveling characters is what he likes to do, he's welcome to it. In fact if he's on my server I'll help him with instance runs if he needs it.  
---
What a great idea! Thank you thank you! 
---
Unless there is a better way of keeping track of this stuff (since Altoholic won't exist) I was going to keep this up and updated while playing.
---
I played on a private server for a bit and I saw mostly rogues and mages, some warlocks and priests and hunters. A fair bit of paladins and druids and very few warriors. 
---
I have a very detailed spreadsheet containing all of my planning so far. Tographer in the comments does too and I'm positive his is far far more detailed than mine.  
---
There are a lot of us out there who are meticulously planning for Classic, and if you like doing it, I encourage you to continue on with it. Planning is what makes vanilla fun. What could you possibly plan out in retail? That's why vanilla is so unique. I'm practically playing the game and it's not out yet.  
---
The part I love is the investment you have in your character. It can be over a week in actual playing game to hit max level. You are a weak nobody, in a dangerous world, struggling to get just a little bit more powerful. 
---
Because you’re weak, getting that next level up to get one talent point and a few new spells is a big deal. You’re a little less helpless now. 
---
Because you’re weak you need to learn your class mechanics and get good at playing it. 
---
Because you’re weak you need to plan your attacks carefully, and not take on encounters you can’t handle. Sure you can take that one guy, but you’d better make sure you interrupt his heal, and fight him far enough away from his allies or you’re toast. 
---
Because you’re weak you need help from the people around you. Your best efforts on your own won’t cut it. A lot of the content (quests, dungeons, etc) you just can’t to by yourself. This brings people together and makes friends and communities.
---
Because you’re weak gear upgrades mean everything. 5 more stamina on your boots is a godsend, and might make the difference in your next tough fight. Gear is scarce, so you seek it out methodically, planning out your big upgrades. Chances are you know the names of the items you’re after, and the items you have. Rare is rare, epic really is epic, and then one day you see a guy with an orange weapon and your friends at school don’t believe you. 
---
Money is scarce, so you have to save it, spend time acquiring it, and spend it wisely. You need that mount, and you need better gear, you need money you don’t have to get better. 
---
Eventually you end up as a strong somebody, and with the help of 39 people who have gone through the same struggle, you can go do something heroic.
---
It takes so much effort and cooperation to be something, and that makes the experience so valuable. 
---
RELEASE THE HOUNDS!
---
Good times XD
---
Have you followed the launch of Netherwing? What the hell is going on over there? Why has TBC emulation always lagged so far behind the other games?
---
&gt;I personally like the idea of bringing new continents with a plan or need to return to them in future updates 
---
Yea, that was one of my biggest things with TBC and, to an extent Wrath (but I only played that for 3 months, give or take).  I felt like Azeroth took a backseat to the new stuff and, to be frank, I missed it. Why not develop some of the under utilized zones or fill in the gaps between the existing ones (or make something of the areas you couldn't hover over/access in game)?
---
&gt;You can tell they planned to do that in the first place, scrapped content for later use. 
---
Honestly, and even Jon Staats says this, they bit off a bit more than they could chew, not so much in the sense of they took too much on and couldn't handle it but, imo, they started too many things they couldn't finish and for some quests, zones, story archs, etc, there left a lot to be desired there. Don't get me wrong, I understand that a massive game like WoW is bound to have a bunch of hands in the pot and you're bound to start things that look good on paper but once you start introducing the content you experience it and are like, "well...we tried", but, I felt like there were so many great opportunities (in vanilla especially) that got dropped for later expansions that turned into trash or a shadow of its former self that I'd rather they take their time and really polish and finish their original intent rather than throw their hands and say, "we'll leave it for an expansion". 
---
&gt;The Dragon Shrine tower thing in Wrath could easily be utilized later.
---
That thing made no sense to me TBH, I don't remember this from WCIII or any other lore, it's like you just sort of get there and you're like, "oh cool something new", but at the same time, it's one of those things I felt that was added in for the sake of having new content (which is what most of Outland felt like in TBC, if I'm being honest). 
---
&gt; Anub'Arak could have been a lesser or behind the scenes bad guy to appear later.
---
Well, I didn't raid in Wrath, but Azjol-Nerub was a VERY memorable in WCIII, and to experience that in WoW would've been really incredible, but, what I experienced of that in Wrath as a non-raider left a lot to be desired. Most likely, that's my own fault, I'm sure there was a lot of content in there that, as a WCIII player and lover of Warcraft lore, I could've appreciated but I suppose at this point I'll never know :(
---
&gt; Zul'drak
---
I'll be honest with you, a lot of the troll instances didn't make too much sense to me lore wise. The trolls have a history of getting destroyed by ever civilization they encounter (humans, night/high elves, etc.) until they meet the Orcs in WCII (correct me if I"m wrong here) yet they're capable of summoning these powerful deities that jeopardize the foundation of the world....ok.
---
&gt;I like your idea of Outlands being last. It's really difficult to go there &amp; have a reason to go back... With the prescense of Old Gods &amp; Titans being beneath the surface, you can go back to old continents to face new threats. I feel like there'd never be "new" threats in Outland
---
I mean, considering Outlands is a busted, barren world....you can only do so much there. It makes so much more sense to focus on Azeroth, of which, we've only seen a fraction of in every WC game which means they (Blizzard) as a lot of room to add things on as needed and push in some new lore/areas that don't step on the existing ones, and I like the idea of going back and forth while not removing anything from previous expansions which is something that bothered me w/ Cata and beyond, why in gods name would you make parts of the original game completely inaccessible to new players?! That's why I added that part about the CoT having "old" Outlands accessible after the gate closes, so you can still go there and experience the content that other players did. 
---
Finally, when Vanilla first started, Sargeras was THE big bad, and the Titans were THE most powerful beings in existence. I've read up on the current lore w/ the Void lords and I just roll my eyes, not to mention the fact that it chipped away at one of the things that made the Old Gods so creepy, the fact that we had no idea where they came from or what their purpose was!
---
I remember that but it thought it was patched out after like a month
---
I got to 60 before it was patched. 
---
What will be the max resolution for WoW classic and what will be a video card to play it at max settings?
---
Uh sure, divinate me.
---
He gave you a good suggestion - start by planning how to allocate 1500 hours to these toons.
---
* Time off work for uninterrupted time
---
* I've been comprising a music playlist of songs that I closely associate with those old memories. I plan to listen to it on my first leveling run and really soak in the nostalgia. Though I've been debating whether this is wise or not...perhaps it's best to let Cat Stevens and Jim Croce be tied to my awesome 2005 experience in Un'Goro instead of overwriting it. 
---
* I'll get some of the same foods and drinks in limited quantities. 
---
We should start s hashtag #transmogforclassic! Or some shit. I donno I’m not your boss. I’m gonna do this though...
---
First off, you really shouldnt be dedicating a vacation to this.
---
That said, I'd suggest just taking it as late as possible. At worst the game is out for a few weeks and you'll have vacation time to catch up. Your time ingame will be more efficiently spent the further from launch you are, if that makes sense, so I wouldn't even see it as a negative.
---
I think a lot of people can agree that the art department isn't where modern wow is lacking.
---
Stealth/assassin class. People love that shit 
---
I'm starting hormone replacement therapy so I can relive using WoW as an escape from the emotional throes of puberty again
---
(Just kidding... this puberty isn't nearly as traumatic as the first one lol)
---
But I do plan on playing an undead mage like I did back in the day, with engineering and mining. I want to try to remember all the highlights from my first time levelling, I know I spent a long time in Hillsbrad and the Hinterlands... I probably won't go straight arcane while levelling this time though.
---
Ah yes, I too enjoy facetious cynical humor. Here is your upvote.
---
BFA has resource managment, no flying in Zuldazar, Kultiras, Timeless Isles and Argus. It also forces you to go all over places to chase the HoA grind which is worse than any Vanilla grind. And tedious is literally Azerite.
---
Also Qued content doesn’t exists for anything with the word Mythic or rated in it. 
---
It’s really just people trolling. And people scared of change. Hell I was sitting on the PTR with about 20 zandalari druids just chatting about WoW pretty much everyone agreed that they like the new races, classes, spells .etc but they want the old design back. Old Talents, Old Rpg mechanics. 
---
Also the only two non Zandos there were a Warlock and DK demanding their abilities back.
---
And it wasn’t like they were all private server people or people coming back for classic, they were there to test how OP the new races are and how they work with bubbles, karma, BoP .etc Incase their guilds started asking for Zandalar.
---
Facts! Everything you said is why Blizzard went downhill LOL
---
You had 4gb ram? Daaaaaamn!
---
Chyeah bruh, got 2gb expansion for xmas.
---
the subreddit should come to a consensus as to what server to play on
---
depends on your skill
---
I honestly don’t think I will play either. Fuck blizzard and activision. They should have done this years ago anyway..
---
Literally been playing for 10 years, still rerolling on vanilla/tbc cause i can't decide. Kinda been contemplating Priest if its not super high pop % or hunter if its not super high pop %..
---
Other than that i wanna maintank raids and get thunderfury... but i dont got no time to maintank.
---
stealth in world pvp is a massive advantage.
---
Pretty much nothing. I'm just excited to play a game I like, not trying to relive anything. 
---
&gt; it seems like they want to see classic fail because it represents things they hate.
---
No, they want it to fail because they're scared to death of exactly what the OP's post is talking about. They are afraid that Classic will be so successful that it will force Blizzard to invest less into retail.
---
I hate alliance. And trolls. Help me.
---
Good video
---
pre 1.7 AV map with the east and west sides in please, no avalanche blocking these areas, idk why you failed to point this out in your list.
---
its not a private server
---
Sum 41, Celldweller, and System of a Down or you're doing it wrong
---
&gt; And trolls  
---
I regret to inform you they're on both factions.  
---
Wow... a voice of reason in the sea of chaos. This is quite pleasant 
---
This is a 5 year~ plan , good , lots of content. no need for changes or tbc
---
I think I know what I’m going with, but divinate my ass!
---
1500 is 2 years
---
It’s not a bad idea to level in pairs of 2 if you want to save time, and know you’ll level an alt sometime anyways. You can take a break from a character for a two days and come back with a level or so of rested XP. 
---
I’m planning on going Pally/mage, and I’ll get one to 30 first, then get the other up to 30, from that point on just swap toons every couple days. 
---
But I’d agree, unless you either have no job or life, or if this is a 3 year plan, it will be hard to balance so many at once. If you end up having 2 favorites I’d try this method! Saves a lot of time, and you can keep your 2 toons near each other so you can share loot you find.
---
Yeah my goal wasn't to get all of these to 60 but to have options and plans set in place in case I do want new toons.
---
The head &amp; shoulders are definitely TBC heroic off-pieces. Grats on Glad tho!
---
My advice as a vanilla player / current pserver player...
---
Listen to this guy. 
---
It feels very warcraft 3-y as opposed to the rest of the WoW soundtrack which feels more like it's own style. That being said, this song is still very good &amp; feels nostalgic. 
---
Take your vacation after release anyways.  Always starts off as a shitstorm and I’m sure Classic won’t be different.  
---
Also, 1-25 is really not bad as you ding quickly for that gratification and it’s pretty much seamless leveling as you aren’t in super contested areas.  From there it starts to change.  
---
Take the time off from like 35-60 when you start to level in a constant contested area and perpetual dedication leveling will be a benefit.  
---
If you have a job and need to use vacation you’re already behind the curve anyways.  The no lifers will dominate.  
---
Shadow Priests.
---
Itemization is rough on you late and all those offset pieces are going to be going to DPS classes (Mage and Warlock). You can be a bigdick shadowbro for a while, and then it's your choice whether you transition to healing or roll an alt to optimize down the line. 
---
I will say that I feel like the general consensus of rolling a Horde Warlock to avoid WotF is misinformation and that Alliance Warlocks are actually at an advantage. I say this to emphasize my opinion on Priests: Roll Horde. Trust me.
---
Ironically that one being a long post talking about how much they've fucked up the modern game.
---
Might want to consider TL as a proff for your gnome pve lock. It gives you acces in stage one to Robe of the void / WN. And in stage 2 acces to BV(set bonus) that will last you well into naxx until you have tier 3 to replace it.
---
I don't think its that bizarre at all, on EU DM was added 3-4 weeks after launch and it was never a problem or an issue. For US DM on launch might feel a bit "off", for us in EU its basicly how Vanilla always has been. 
---
He means Rogues don’t actively have to do anything like craft water/food for everyone or hand out healthstones. You just show up and raid as a Rogue.
---
I glossed over it with the "many NPCs and mobs being removed"
---
Another redditor posted the changes by patch in the comments, if people don't know they can read that.
---
And I agree with you I'd love to stick with pre 1.8. Many of the old bugs would be fixed just being on the new engine and 1.12 database.
---
I mean WoW kinda ruined lore, because it made lore fit gameplay. Vanilla was still good IMO though mostly because there was not a lot of WORLDWIDE problems and a lot of new lore. 
---
But then came TBC and fucked shit up. 
---
alcohol go hand in hand with grinding
---
Not really just make the last talent point in boomkin, prot spec double your MP5. They dont suck because of spell damage, they just run oom to fast. Thats just a stupid invisiable number modifier they need to tweak.
---
Flying mounts ruined world pvp, but that's as far as any hate can go. 
---
I'm a gnome warrior IRL. What should I choose?  
---
First advice: Engineering on ALL PvP characters! It will make PvP life better and more fun :) 
---
All Hail the Scarab Lord!
---
I misspoke, sorry. I meant a guild on a PvP server. Most guilds I know of want to play on PvP servers, even if their main focus is PvE.
---
No, more like   
---
1 what Blizzard thinks its going to be  
---
2 The reality come summer 2019  
---
3 the classic community smokin more of the usual  
---
Vinny would be proud #ketoguidoyeaaaaah
---
Might as well use dianetics 
---
Haha, are you me? I’m looking at a shadow priest or warlock to farm and play solo over maining a tank all through vanilla. 
---
**Original:**  
---
Mage, horde, casual by force (bad PC/internet), collected pets, only did MC/ZG  
---
**New:**  
---
Warrior, alliance, hardcore ($3000 PC and best internet my city provides), will not collect pets, will be primarily focused on entering and getting through Naxx  
---
Horde/Alliance stereotypes have never been true.  
---
It is. The economy is a big part (often overlooked by the players) of each server. Blizzard themselves claim that server population caps are BECAUSE of the economy, that is, allowing X # of players on the server will collapse the economy. The economy is carefully balanced with gold sinks  (mainly epic mounts but also includes high level materials) and if the balance is tilted (to much or to little gold coming in), the entire server suffers. 
---
Basically, if players are farming gold, especially if they sell it for real world money, then gold becomes less valuable and the prices rise. This mostly effects new players who don't have the money to pay for the basics but it is ultimately damaging to everyone. So, yes, just a few dedicated players can eventually disrupt the economy and, because expansions won't be releasing anytime soon (or maybe never), there are no additional gold sinks that blizzard can add.
---
Regardless, unless blizzard adds new gold sinks, the economy will inevitably become ruined. It's just a matter of time. This happens with ALL older games that are static and I hope that blizzard thinks up a solution eventually. Bottomline: report gold farmers and NEVER buy gold for real money and the economy can last a bit longer before ultimately collapsing. 
---
Shadow priests are a lot of fun. Very good in pvp while leveling, and if you're competent you can literally heal all dungeons up until BRD in that spec as well. 
---
As far as locks, i cant imagine managing threat in raid without salv from pallies. Playing a game where you gear up to get more powerful, only to have to constantly hold back is lame as fuck. And that was an issue for me even with salv.
---
It's a .5 second cast, 1 minute cooldown. It does not give you an immunity buff or anything whatso ever. Maybe with spell batching or something you would have seen something that effect. It is a reactive spell. But as alliance a pally can also give you blessing of freedom.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?spell=20589
---
Yes. Both of them don't help you with frost nova, freeze effects or slow effects of either mage or hunter. Sure, they are strong, but if 2 out of 8 classes against which you will play will beat you almost everytime unless you are a PvP God, or have a palybud (which is unavailable for Horde), then why even be Horde? The answer is FAP and LAP potions and, since I am a noob regarding these things, I just asked this question to learn whether just these 2 potions are enough to justify being an orc instead of an alliance race with the available duo of war + pala.
---
At least they know it is an unfinished game. 
---
I wonder what leveling a DK thru vanilla would be like...
---
Realms with also be divided by region in classic so you'll get less 'Mafia' action.
---
It can be said that given time the prices of everything will continually increase since there are no added gold sinks once maxed, besides leveling alts.
---
Sounds fun, divinate me :)
---
Yeah there's PvP gear, but it won't be in classic initially because they plan on doing artificial patch progression, but even if they weren't it'd still be a terrible idea just because the PvP gear was so powerful it'd allow you to bypass early raids. PvP gear later will end up getting buffed putting it at the power of I believe roughly T2, but that's the max you'll get from PvP alone, if you want the absolute best gear possible you'll end up having to get T3 from Naxx. 
---
I can relate not really giving too many shits about PvE, but honestly raiding with people you like in your downtime is pretty damn fun. I used to just find pugs who were desperate and weren't gonna give me shit about having a PvP spec, some didn't even give a shit enough to look at my gear lol, sometimes I'd just lie to people and get into the raid to show I may not be "meta" but I'm not retarded. Usually only find hardcore raiding guilds who are trying to get world firsts that care about that kinda crap. Hitting pugs actually led to me getting into a casual raiding guild which fit perfect for me because I could spend the vast majority of my time farming players and I'd go raid with them when they did. We didn't progress very fast, but we had some damn good times in vent which led to some great friendships. Remember MMORPG's are a diverse genre with many different playstyles and personalities, there's a guild out there for everyone.
---
it really does not matter (much).
---
after the initial novelty wears off people will play the BG with goal to maximize the outcome.
---
at one point AV will be played almost only for the rewards.  
---
at this point it turns to shit either way, no matter which version.  
---
the only difference it really makes in the long run is how long you have to wait for a loss or win. 
---
Warlock dots, fears, and sending your pet in.
---
Getting chain feared is rage inducing
---
In wpvp you can dot up everyone and their mom and hang back causing mass confusion while burning someone down or stopping assault classes from getting away.
---
Might I recommend: Orc Warlock.
---
Since you seem to like a class that requires physical strength in the hands of a race who has absolutely none, I have found the exact opposite: a race with all the physical strength in the world but with a class that uses none of it.
---
as was said already, yes it does.
---
for the followup. in a 5man the - 20% threat totem will outweight the threat gain from windfury.  
---
(correct me if I misremember) additionally rage gain only gives threat if thre are combat log messages (gains X rage...) .  
---
rage pots, unbridled wrath, t1 proc, bloodrage etc. 
---
the threat gain from wf is pure dmg and more rage to spend. 
---
It's gonna be damn near impossible for your vacation days to land on launch day or close to it...unless your vacation is like a month long. Too risky if you ask me, I'd sooner set my vacation time for when I know for sure classic will be out, may not be able to hit it very hard for the first little bit it's out, but least you know for sure your vacation time won't be wasted. The closest guess anyone can make to launch day is the middle of summer.
---
I'm playing on a pserver right now trying to learn the quests and the lack of knowing anything about alliance side quests is murdering my time :(
---
Publish guide, will buy.
---
You clearly have no respect for the strength of the mighty Firestone
---
 
---
I still hope we get the old flavours of Mountain Dew back!
---
Thanks, must be due to the nature of this sub, but they pretty much helped me decide that classic would definitely be the way to go. I'll be waiting until classic releases and jump right in!
---
Yeah, I feel exactly the same way about each and every point there.  After Classic, it was completely moronic.  That's why I absolutely and utterly hated the premise of BfA and some parts of other expansions, like the Argent Tournament of Wrath although the setting was cool.
---
However, that's not why I'm not playing BfA, and if I kept playing WoW, I would always still be willing to give it a shot.  I mean, I utterly hated the Pandaren and thus Mists of Pandaria at the very first reveal, but I ended up loving every little bit of Mists, so that was a big teaching lesson to me.
---
Every time I hear it I imagine a pack of Worgen charging at my party since it's the SFK music too :)
---
That said, I do hope sharding is limited and at a bare minimum and removed entirely from the game after launch.
---
It is optimal because even if he doesn't tank anything and just come as a healer he bring bos. Having him put a tank set on to make some pull easier or because you need one more tank for boss with lot of adds is just the cherry on top.
---
Yeah having a feral tank/dps is optimal but so is having a paladin aoe tank/heal imho
---
Indeed i forgot about the defense nerf, but yeah as you stated def cap isn't necessary for aoe tanking adds, most will try to get some plate with sp on it for aoe threat (t2 is perfect for that). 
---
Def cap is only needed for a paladin if he want to try to tank boss. (It certainly is possible to tank a lot of boss with the right gear on but only for fun on farm content).
---
As for exemple, any pack or boss fight with a heavy amount of adds is easier with a paladin tank. Sure tech packs can be kited but its just much easier and faster to have a paladin keep them all on him while the dps put heavy aoe on them without worrying about having to kite them.
---
The addon situation and the requiring a new macro system (I'm guessing due to newer engine) will really impact advanced vanilla players. Some classes like hunters and druids simply cannot function at the level expected from the player until they can recreate the same function with the API.
---
I've resolved this issue by deciding to play a shaman. Tons of buttons yes, but nearly no macro requirements (minus minor ones which I am sure I can pick up quickly from the new API).
---
Is sunder ever used for leveling? More white damage = more rage?
---
I like to use instsnt abilities like sunder and hamstring to fish for extra dodge/over power proc rather than "missing" out on an auto attack. I dont even like the heroic strike mechanic because it sacrafices a white hit rage generation for a bit of extra damage. Doesnt feel rewarding.
---
Imagine if rogue's SS also negated the next energy tick. Would not feel good.
---
Pretty sure that Devilsaur mafia is only a private server thing because you can't control the zone without colluding with the other faction which is, I think, against TOS.
---
dont forget the lotus mafia
---
There are some videos on YT testing the graphics in the Classic WoW demo compared to private server graphics and as far as i can remember Classic WoW even ran a bit smoother. Pretty much any half decent set up should be able to run classic wow on 1080p with 60 fps.
---
Ahh, the old "It's single player but you still need to be online because fuck you" games.
---
go ahead.
---
rogue before BGs.
---
everything in world PvP is in your favor.  
---
you almost never have to fight the fights you may not win. 
---
I wanna play priest. All 5 races I like as options. Help. 
---
I'll play Alliance this time. Because Alliance is easy mode.
---
Dividing the the world with a new continent and a shared capitol city for Horde and Alliance were also bad choices IMO. 
---
&gt; people will just go back for nostalgia then leave" 
---
This is very true for those who are trying to relive the past, not everyone wants classic for nostalgic purposes. 
---
&gt; People enjoy it being "hard". Sure the nostalgia is hyping it up as well  but from a gameplay and RPG standpoint it's just a more immersive game 
---
ehhh, I like hard games a lot and classic comes with its own set of challenges, but at its core WoW isn't a difficult game, but I digress. For me it's about gameplay as well, but my desire in difference from retail is mainly to do with what I consider better PvP balance and more customization. Both of which are the main reasons I play games and modern WoW has lost both of those ironically removing customization for better balancing only to somehow continually make the balance worse.
---
&gt; QOL doesn't always = better. 
---
It doesn't equal worse either, QOL gets demonized far too often, the problem is too much QOL. 
---
&gt; Too many games are braindead these days which is exactly why games such as WoW Classic are returning in full force. 
---
Yeah sorry to tell you, but they're not "returning in full force", there's enough people still interested in older games, but it'll always be a small niche of players. Classic will be successful, but not to the extent of modern games. The game industry may be in a pile of shit here in not too long however mainly due to people opening their eyes to shady business practices, namely companies making games for share holders instead of their playerbase which means focus goes in making games as profitable as possible instead of quality. Another massive issue is devs sticking their dicks into social politics instead of just making games, they're trying to make them a political statement. Then there's just the overall lack of innovative design in which we're seeing events similar to the first game market crash repeat, things are getting stale and over saturated. Old games coming back isn't going to do anything to fix the stale or over saturation problem because it's just rehashing the same old designs we've grown bored of, but when the quality of your games goes down for the reasons above it's natural that people would seek out older better quality games out of sheer desperation, but better quality doesn't fix the underlining problem of the games still being old rehashed shit we've played to death already and that's why everyone's not just scurrying back to these older titles. 
---
Considering Dire Maul was there from so very early on in WoW, it's not a big deal to me.  Even the dungeon itemization buffs were there immediately after, so they're still not that big of a deal to me.  I don't think WoW's population swelled until a few months after launch, which is when these patches would have already occurred or at the very least, they would have certainly happened by the time these new players started raiding.
---
But to everything else you said: Yep, more or less exactly what I've been saying.  Classic WoW in 2019 can't be World of Warcraft in 2005/2006.
---
Waitlists do you have a Gladiator title? Have you actually been gladiator the first TBC arena season or are they giving that out like candy too in retail? Haven’t touched retail for 8 years 
---
I like this new meme😄😄😄👏
---
&gt; No new content developed by the current wow team please.
---
What would be the downside of adding a tier 3.5 raid? Not like you'd be forced to raid it if you don't want to.
---
We've had some threads about music association with Vanilla and I was surprised by the variety of bands people listened to. The genres tended to be rock/punk or offshoots but there were fewer 'canon' bands than I expected. 
---
System of a Down definitely got some mentions.
---
So many didn't understand this joke. Shame on them!
---
You're not forced to use transmogs or LFR either.
---
I was invited to every beta since WoD. I don't do much PVP and was never a cutting edge raider but I really like min/maxing my character and when I got invited, I leveled up and did endgame content in every beta. I also reported every bug and glitch I encountered and explained in detail what was wrong.
---
So yeah I think you get re-invited when you actually test the game instead of treating the beta as early access.
---
Not to mention 100% of the player base was now only in 6 zones for the rest of time while all 39 previous zones were now dead. It ruined the feel of a cohesive world.

Could it be argued that the quality of BfA isn't the best because some of the resources at blizzard are working to get classic up and running?

---
I started with Everquest, then went to DAoC and Swg for a short while until wow came up. I picked up wow on release day when i saw a sign at the store and got lucky, they had one copy left.
---
I was thinking about what class to play, what to do at lvl 60 when classic releases, then it hit me. I only played to lvl 56 with my shaman, then i quit because i did not want to spend hours raiding. Despite this, wow has made a huge impact on me, wow is the first mmo where i really enjoyed the travel with friends i met online. I spent 25 days on my shaman, got alchemy and clothing to 250, dropped alchemy and went up to 230 engineering. Maxed out fishing and almost maxed out cooking. I traveled the outer skirts of the islands with water walking for hours each session, i climbed mountains and did almost everything but leveling. I did Maraudon 30 times just to get Gizlock buckler because i loved the look and the spinning. I had every blue item from there when i got it.
---
To this day i still enjoy exploring the vanilla world, meeting strangers everywhere and helping out when i can. I rarely talk to people but i like to have them around. I cant wait to get back to the AH from a long questing adventure and selling stuff in hope to strike a good deal. For me wow isnt about the endgame, its about the journey.

Would it be possible to have an addon instantly remove the tranq air buff whenever it's applied? Same as how addons auto remove sanc when you're tanking.

---
Everything fits perfectly then! Alliance, EU, PvE Guild on a PvP server!   
---
But most of all I really hope we do everything on ourselves without any guides.   
---
Any discord or something for this guild? 
---
That should be different people. Classic doesn't need graphic designers, story tellers or engineers for new mechanics. They just need a bunch of programmers and database experts to port it on the new client.
---
And they hate it for all the wrong reasons, since Classic being successful means current WoW will also be a lot more successful due to the shared payment. I think they're just angry because they never played Vanilla and legitimately think it's all nostalgia. 
---
Exactly this. Once classic is running they don't need any 'devs'. A bunch of techies for database maintenance and network infrastructure, which is probably outsourced anyway.
---
All the extra income from classic can be used to make current WoW great again.
---
I'm right there with you. I think the demographic for vanilla is going to be a slower crowd than retail.
---
It would be good if they carried on with updating Classic while keeping the things that made Classic a success in mind. So, release other expansions, sure, but rework them so that they don't damage the game. Think of another way to implement flying (if at all), remove LFG, remove cross-realm (yes, I know that's Vanilla), etc. The great thing is that they will have two different games for two very different fanbases, so there's no reason to worry about alienating one or the other. I could easily see myself switching to current WoW from time to time, if only to see what's happening - you're already paying for it, so why not? 
---
I don't get that. I already played in shitty Graphics and FPS back in 2004. 
---
I know the time is never coming back, I'm old as fuck now and I won't get any younger not even if I immerse myself into Classic and think its 2005 again.

You can still get them! They just don't have any wow promos. Usually in 12 packs of cans.

This comment needs more upvotes XD

2 days won't get you over a level of rested. So just be ware if you only play another toon for 2 days it won't be as much as you think. 
---
It's 5% (1 bubble) per 8 hours in an inn or rested state while offline. Afaik the max you can earn is a level and a half which will take 10 days to accumulate. 
---
Source: http://vanilla-wow.wikia.com/wiki/Rest
---
Not having a go or telling you how to play. Just saying if you plan on doing it that way then take this into account to take full advantage of rested. 
---
I am going to make the exact same character I made when I first got the game on release - a male Night Elf warrior. I don't really feel any nostalgia for bad graphics though. If I could play with the newer models I would absolutely do it. Only the water is too out of place for me. In general, I don't get the #nochanges attitude when modding games is one of the best things about playing on a PC. Who the hell would want to go back to unmodded Morrowind when you can make it so much better? I would love if it if later down the line we could get some stuff like ray tracing in the game.
---
It's still a money issue. All them EC2 ressources have a cost...
---
Can't swap armor in combat, only weapons. 
---
time zones make that difference too.  with a p server its international so one mafia group can go to sleep whilst the other is waking up to take over
---
Indeed. There's a bit too much of a focus in the Classic community of reliving an idealized period. I'd much rather get the game I liked back then, but improved upon in a way that focuses on what made the original so good in the first place.  
---
Beast Master hunter is incredibly powerful when everyone has shit gear. 
---
Late summer almost certainly, my guess is August. 
---
I dont think so. What's the excuse for other expansions since WotLK then?
---
Dude, its a extra intercept but wirh 30sec stun. Its so good that its silly.
---
You can only change non weapons out of combat and its a 30sec cooldown after you equip and 30min cd after you use it so it require planning to use optimal.
---
You can run around with it on so if in a 1vX situation you can take one out of the equation. There are opportunities to get out of combat while fighting to switch back.
---
So in what patch did they bufd moonkins ans givd paladins a taunt etc?
---
They can use any feature rhey want within vanilla patches but people are asking for changes from outside vanilla. Just look on the post I reply to on top.
---
&gt; changing even the smallest thing like MP5 increase for Boomkins/Paladin
---
You know, I think the things that make Vanilla WoW superior to almost any other RPG in the history of gaming are things that players don't realize.  In fact, in many cases, they're things that players complained about historically.
---
For example, one of the big things that players wanted streamlined out of the game (and that have been streamlined out) is the odd spread of pre-BiS gear among the 5-man dungeons.  Because pre-Bis gear can be found at dungeons as low as Maraudon, it incentives experienced players to go to dungeons that they otherwise wouldn't.  Especially when those pieces have low drop-rates or are on out-of-the-way bosses.  If players had no incentive to visit dungeons once they'd played through once (for the quest xp or quest rewards), you'd hit a point where once the game became established, new players would not be able to find groups to go through these dungeons, depriving them of the interesting content that dungeons provide, not through their own choice, but simply through a lack of availability.  After the streamlining of ilvls and gearing, this was a problem.  Blizzard addressed this problem with daily dungeons and daily heroics, incentivizing established players to revisit dungeons that they couldn't get better gear out of in order to get badges.  And that system was workable in regard to keeping players in dungeons so that new subscribers could experience that content, but it lead to the feeling of dungeons as a chore, not an exciting journey.  While Skinner Box mechanisms are effective, they're not rewarding in the same way as good content that stands on its own.
---
Another good example was the time investment of the game.  Many gamers want that 'quick hit' style of game play, where they log on for 15 minutes, achieve a task, and then log off.  But of course, that's not immersive and in the long term, it leads to greater burn-out.  Attuning for raids was a time-consuming process.  Crafting legendaries and even many epics took a lot of time investment, but the sense of reward gained from a digital reward has a directly proportional relationship with the effort that went into achieving it.  If everyone got a full T3 set when they created a character, nothing in the game would feel rewarding (at least in PvE).  Of course, there needs to be a sensible balance between investment and reward; if it took years to get a single upgrade, people would give up because it's too difficult.  Vanilla WoW struck an excellent balance in terms of investment and reward, although personally, I wish there were more crafted pieces on par with raid gear, especially ones where the patterns could be attained without raiding, allowing non-raiders to have a competitive path to PvE gear.  A good example would be a 0.5% drop BoP pattern on a 5-man end boss for a piece of gear equivalent to MC or BWL level gear with steep requirements, hundreds of rugged leather, dragonscales, essences or whatever to make the task of actually crafting a piece on par with the time commitment of raiding.  But, that minor gripe aside, the original WoW team did a good job of balancing investment and reward.
---
Finally, the class design was wonderful.  I played a resto shaman in Vanilla, but I didn't really appreciate how the wonky stat distribution and talent and resource management created such a flexible game.  I gained a much greater appreciation playing a prot warrior on a private server.  There is no "best" set for warriors.  Some content, Broodlord or Nefarion for example, is best done with very tanky gear.  Some content is best done with very aggressive gear for better threat generation.  Onyxia, for example, hits like a wet kitten, and with her threat-reduction knock-back, it's important for tanks to stack hit/crit/str instead of armor/hp/avoidance.  Some bosses, high avoidance is fine, but for most, mitigation is better than avoidance because of the smoother pattern of damage that doesn't put as much stress on the healers.  And the differing hit cap mechanics between same level mobs and boss level mobs means that ideal gear for raiding is not ideal gear for 5-mans.  Most players never really tried to get ideal gear for 5-mans because it could be done just fine with raiding gear, but having that sort of room for "tinkerer" types to play around with is great.  It doesn't impact the majority of players, but satisfies an itch that some players have.
---
All in all, the game was just incredibly well-built.
---
They rent hardware in Sweden afaik. Regardless you will need hardware, rented or not.
---
Cata was really good until they introduced LFR and the atrocious raid called Dragon Soul
---
And where's the cloud infrastructure hosted? On a plate?
---
Yes and they can use any of those patch changes in vanilla but people are asking for changes from outside of that. The guy I reply to is basically asking for TBC talents in Vanilla. Thats absurd.
---
Pick one character and kill Kelthuzad with it.
---
I'm going to try to play a holy pally which is what I leveled in vanilla. But I honestly think I'll end up switching it up because while I loved healing back then I hate it now haha. I've mained an arms warrior for like 10 years and I'll probably just want to play warrior but I'm just not used to taking :(
---
Why should they fear it? It just means more subscriptions so more profit. And in the end, profit is all Blizzard cares about.
---
Pointless post. 
---
&gt; Play the same faction, race or class?
---
Yes
---
&gt; Toggle the graphics?
---
&gt; Play at 4:3 resolution?
---
&gt; Move back into your parents' house?
---
Never moved out buddy
---
I remember the first time I ever went to SM. I was a level 44 human pally and I was a complete noob who walked along the path right next to undercity. There was 5 level 60s chilling right outside the city. Now when I started playing all my friends played alliance so honestly I never even looked at the horde characters. While leveing i had seen most of the different factions in contested areas but mostly undead and orc. So that day I /waved to each of those level 60s hoping that I didn't die that day. They all ignored me but the Tauren who /waved back and I was like holy shit that guy looks so badass. Now I still main alliance to this day but after that I went and made a Tauren character too because I thought they looked so damn cool lol. 😂

Can we use reddit sub numbers to estimate? 50k in this sub and 1mil in the wow sub. Dunno if it means anything. I know several people that don't use reddit but that are planning to come back for Vanilla. People that haven't played since WotLK, me included.
---
Rogues already have a tough time with warriors but orc ones just completely scare them off in bgs, so rarely getting jumped by rogues is a hidden perk of orc warrior
---
Really sorry... I just can't seem to put my thoughts into the proper words. Our guild will be on a PvE server.
---
What I meant by "PvP guild" is a PvE focused guild on a PvP server. On Discord almost all guild recruitment at the moment is for guilds on PvP servers.
---
Just check the ClassicWoW discord (https://discord.gg/classicwow), the very first guild advertisement is for a guild you might like (Pertento). Check it out!
---
Agreed.
---
Agreed even more. I really liked BC though, but you're right, a lot of QoL came in and diminished much of what made WoW great.
---
Agreeing even more here. Perhaps it was just the Flying mounts that did it.
---
I can't remember when LFD came in, was that in cata?
---
in group pvp or 1 vs X, a 10 sec stun is better than ~7% of your stats.
---
Rod of the sleepwalker I think it's called.
---
Also "Leech Pants" in BFD are probably BIS for that level.
---
Again I'm not saying BC solution was good, BC was terrible and created a bigger problem. I'm just referring that the issue in classic was there.
---
And it will be again.
---
And due to the mechanics of pvp hierarchy having a gear better than most is not enough. As I said if you want to remain competitive you had to raid.
---
Remember dude, everyone who he agrees with is a hero and everyone who he disagrees with is a shill or a fan boy, it’s the internet. People like these don’t have personalities.
---
end of WotLK
---
I will take my 3 original characters and level them again. My female troll warrior, my female undead priest and my male undead warlock. I will get the full blue spell damage set for my warlock again. I will tank on my warrior who only ever tanked tbc raids and wotlk raids but eventually lost my raiding spot as tank in wotlk cause dks and paladins were better. Quit at cata btw. Awful expansion. I will live in av on priest as shadow priest. And my warlock will spend a very long time at level 49 cause that was my favourite warlock pvp bracket.
---
I honestly believe, you are overthinking dungeons.
---
The tank charges if he can, thunderclaps, demoshouts and tab-sunders all mobs. The first one will be the most likely to get pulled off the tank but he taunts once and even if the mob still runs off after taunt and another sunder, hes at 10% when he reaches the clothis and dies within seconds. 
---
Having the tank contribute considerable DPS with a slow 1hander + wf + 8% hit and some tank + plate DPS gear is something you dont want to pass up on. 
---
Warrrior DPS just gets better and better.
---
Not to mention the proof of how bad the decision they've made to retail and that there has been a massive amount of bad decisions. 
---
I genuinely hope that Classic takes over and we get to see expansions to Classic and let retail die out, there is no saving it IMO as everyone has 300+ mounts, gold out the ass and mogs for days.
---
#CannotWait
---
I just want to add a small point amongst all these great comments that I agree with.
---
Regarding nostalgia: For me, I never got to experience vanilla as I joined near the end of wotlk. This was the same for a couple of my friends. We had all heard how great it was though. So when we found out about private servers, we decided to give it a go and see what all the fuss was about... and all of us were surprised by ho
---
That's great, thanks for showing us a new source of possibly funny memes. 
---
But the bubbles are why I have to IV wine instead of beer 
---
The bubbles help my heart keep jumping when it starts wearing down.
---
great post. we desperately need to bring back gatekeeping.
---
people who hate gaming are becoming the majority.
---
this goes for most nerd hobbies. "inclusiveness" is a death knell for nerd stuff.
---
Vanilla WoW for me was getting stoned, then drinking grape kool-aid.
---
hallway instances are pretty shit too.
---
"Mafia" can only exist on PVP servers, correct?
---
Getting Glad now is much harder than it was in TBC lol 
---
&gt; Is it a good idea to revive a game from 14 years ago?
---
I remember playing countless games from 10+ or even 15+ years ago, which are always remembered with good words. If someone mentions, for example, HoMM 3 or TES 3: Morrowind or Bladur's Gate 2 or any other good old game in some discussion, everyone will remember something good about it, some may even decide to replay it. No one has ever said "this is some old crap, you won't like to replay it ever again" about any masterpiece of old.
---
Vanilla wow seems to be an exception and a very weird one to me. Idk why every single other game which was well received 15 years ago, keeps being well received today, while mentioning Classic always brings some "this is old and broken game, no one would ever play it in 2019" crap.
---
tl;dr: 
---
Is there any reason for playing a 14 year old game to NOT be a good idea?
---
If this game was a masterpiece back then, it did not become any worse (unless they incldue permanent sharding ofc)
---
Mountain Dew didn't exist where I am from back in the day. I always thought it was some super hype soda that goes beyond all tastes there is. Videos, early memes, you name it, you saw it everywhere, even playing in the EU.
---
They have been around here now for 5 years or so, and I tasted my first Mountain Dew around 2 years ago.
---
Tastes boring as hell and I certainly put my expectations way too high.
---
Doritos are cool though.
---

/s
---
I am interested :)
---
I guess they are smart enough, since they are a ”greedy, money-loving company” according to some, not to add features that killed their other game. 
---
&gt; Will it change the gaming industry again?
---
No. It is a niche project for not so large playerbase. 
---
A player who was considered "a casual" 15 years ago is close to "gaming nerd" today. While who is considered "a casual" today by game publishers would have been "an impatient and stupid player" 15 years ago. I mean, most game devs today are doing everything so that a player does not have to read anything or try to figure something out by himself. Gaming industry is about "click and have instant fun".
---
Also there is a big trend for RNG in every aspect of games and paying to unlock premium content, which is also not likely to change as long as people are fine with paying for that shit.
---
Not to mention that the GMs are usually "in on it", in order to create a massive demand for devilsaur sets/flasks by controlling both supplies. Therefore buying gold is incentivized. 
---
Methods of gold farming that are far too powerful are another example. Dire Maul Tribute being a very popular one among chinamen and is competitive with the amount of gold per individual that is made by the devilsaur mafia.  
---
Of course good luck trying to tell this to a private server player. They'll cry for days at the thought of not having their DMT option since they are still salty about it being nerfed on private servers.  
---
you misunderstood me. im talking specifically about the original glad title of the first season that he has on the screenshot. wouldnt have been surprised if blizz started giving those out for free.
---
I still really enjoy the 'both sides rush enemy base and aim to win in 15 mins' av so I'll be happy either way tbqh!
---
Rogue and mage are never not good. Hunter is amazing early on especially if they can get their hands on rhok or ash before everyone else starts to really outgear them.
---
&gt; Why do you love the game? Why do you hate it?
---
You will find that different people will sometimes give the same answers for this two questions.
---
Slow-paced levelling. Long preparation for raids. No cross-realm or account shared anything. No LFG in any form. No content updates in the future. Lack of QoL in general.
---
These are some of the reasons why i love Classic. And it is exactly why most of retail playerbase may hate it.
---
I already know my true path br00thr, but please divinate my l00ps.
---
because why the fuck would there be cross faction AH in Classic? That's stupid.
---
&gt; How much of the hype is pure nostalgia?
---
Not much. Private servers have proven that the game is very much playable and desired by loyal fans.
---
Those who blame "nostalgia" are just trying to judge everyone else by their own experience. I can imagine it like this: 
---
a new player who has not played vanilla before heard somewhere about how great the game was before. He believes that and begins to create his owns fantasies of what a "great game" is. Later, he digs deeper and finds some info about vanilla. He notices the lack of modern QoL etc and judging by his own taste and experience, he thinks that others also just don't know about that, like he did not know before he started digging deeper. For some reason he can not understand that quality of life does not equal to quality of game for everyone. And tries to reveal some "truth" about how vanilla was "not hard or fun, just long and boring'. Such threads mostly look pathetic tbh.
---
That's the only part I recognize
---
troll. no other race can even hope to approach the fuckery trolls can cause with their racial spells. berserking ain't half bad either for mana burning.
---
Priest and paladin cos of all that light 
---
Beware if you drop combat and equip it may have a little cooldown before you can use it. Some items have this mechanic some don't
---
I already know what i will play but would be fun to hear your divination.
---
I think it will be a massive drop in player count, and then when "retail or current wow" has a content drought they will come back to classic slowly but surely to check it out, and probably a lot of them will stay.
---
I’m in a similar situation. I’m betting on September. It would be cruel to release the game during the best part of summer. At least let us get some sun in before wow takes over &gt;.&lt;. 
---
If I’m forced to submit my vacation I’m going with a late September date. I would rather take it late and actually be able to play wow during my vacation than miss it completely.  The first few weeks will be a bit of a shit show anyway.  
---
Yeah this is a big difference with p servers. There's no offtime so to say. There's always a constant 10k+ People online.
---
Doesn't matter to me. AV is the worst BG by far imo since it's ridiculously imbalanced in favor of the alliance. I get my rep and then I never come back. Unpopular opinion I guess, but I never enjoyed the Zerg vs Zerg playstyle.
---
That title is given out now for the top 0.5% of players each season. It has been that way since Wrath? I am confused as to what you mean. 
---
Talent trees were remade multiple times in vanilla to make weaker specs more viable. Given that this was the trend, it obviously would have eventually happened for all of these specs. Would anyone want this in the first two years (the max vanilla lifespan)? No, but not looking into it later is a useless purist attitude. 
---
Then why the hell would we want it.  I don’t want to drink it without the pictures. 
---
Kidding of course. I don’t want to drink it anyway.  
---
(and your post was much more helpful. Mine was probably only funny to myself. )
---
Alsong as people dont just ride south/north past each other and it becomes a "who capped first". Thats just honor grinding without soul. 
---
If you want R14, go play warsong/AB
---
No, the rank 1 title you are thinking of still exists. Just like BC if you were rank 1 during season 2 you'd get the title Merciless gladiator, but if you were under rank 1 the next highest rank was just gladiator, and you would get that title for the whole of the season after you got it, then if you didn't get gladiator again the title would go away.  I got glad around 2600- 2640 in 3s this first season of BFA.  The reason season one is unique is just because there was no adjective associated with gladiator, so rank 1s from the first season I guess would have this same title, but they would get it all the time. I just have it until next season is over, unless I get it again of course

Lets just say that it will be bigger than the Launch in 2004.....WAY BIGGER.
---
I am off work for 8 weeks this july-august.  I am going to completely fucking smother myself in wow classic for those 8 weeks.  Can wait.  Its gonna be like being 20 all over again.
---
Mom! Bafroom!
---
I am just going to play the same Race and Class I did at Launch in 2004.
---
Ahh, the old Sleep Apnea Shake!
---
Old Textures or GTFO.
---
The G600 is a lot easier to find your way around, the way the buttons are laid out makes it easy to distinguish.
---
Proper patch progression including talents would be farcical. It's pretty clear you never played in Vanilla. 
---
Similarly, Classic WoW will involve being stoned but drinking lots of tea. Caffeine man, getting old. 😑

Hi, /u/Lowgarr

Will be playing horde for the first time ever in order to relive the mystery and adventure of it all.

How did you even buy games in the past? When you see a great new game coming out do you think "that's a hundred hours of entertanment! and even more if i replay it again! wait a second, but what next?! the game will just end? should i even buy it?"? 
---
I don't think so, beacuse by that logic you wouldn't have bought a single game. I mean, not game guarantees you infinite new content. Why is it suddenly such a horrible issue with classic?
---
ah i see. yeah long time ago must have forgotton about how it worked exactly. thankx for clarification!
---
No problem
---
Hellllllurrrrrrrr
---
Lol nah your right. I only ever bought them for the code to fill up my bot in wotlk. ....and now I realise how absurdly hooked I got by that promotion....God damn 17 yr old me, you idiot.
---
I love trolls but I always forget about using berserking whereas will of the forsaken seem clear. Plus I'm not 100% sold on them wearing cloth sets which look very human inspired. Love them outside that though. 
---
Use your powers on me! I want to be a healer.
---
If it ends up being like this, I guess I'll just look for ways to profit even harder. Half raids will probably become the norm exactly as you say. I hope they do and create a massive divide in power between casual and hardcore, just so this whole concept can back fire.  
---
Well you just kinda learn the items from their icons when you see them a lot, just like you would with vanilla items. There's only one item in the top image that I couldn't tell you the source of and 3-4 that I probably couldn't name off by heart. 
---
Likely an unpopular opinion here but I don't think Vanilla was that great. Obviously I really enjoy the unique and challenging leveling experience and I've done it multiple times over the years, both on retail back in the days and on private servers because I always get hyped for a new release. I also like the social aspect of helping each other through hard quests and dungeons, bonding with fellows and building that friendlist over time, the most important aspect that LFG took away from the community.
---
But on the other hand I think Vanilla is also a very unpolished game. The class balance and overall build diversity are mediocre, the skill ceiling is not the best, gizmos and clever use of items are fun but the abundance of consumables is super dumb in my opinion. Raids' difficulty, while it was something new 14 years ago, is really not up to players' standard these days and years of improved theorycraft turned most bosses into a 30 seconds DPS rush with barely enough time for one mechanic. I've been a hardcore raider all my life and I'm not looking forward to MC and BWL because it's just not interesting.
---
Of course I'll still play Classic. In fact I can't wait for Classic to come out even if I've been playing on private servers on and off since I quit retail WoW (mid Cata), and do it all over again. The main reason is that I'm very excited to play with all my friends again and make new ones and have great fun in 5-man dungeons and premade BGs. But I also want to support Classic in hope that its succes will lead to actual Legacy servers eventually leading up to TBC and WotLK eras, which are *for me* the true golden age of WoW for their vastly superior gameplay and end-game content, heroic dungeons and raids.
---
I hope that Classic WoW will be a huge succes and that its aura will impact the gaming industry but I'm not very confident about that if I'm honest. After witnessing the death of WildStar, which was the closest modern MMORPG to core vanilla aspects (very challenging content, attunements, 40-man raids, guild dependant) and the incredible amount of players moaning in capital cities about the game's difficulty because they couldn't even complete a dungeon in PUG, I'm afraid the MMORPG demographic has changed for good and that vanilla - *and any old school 'hardcore' gaming experience* - will stay a niche while most companies will strive for producing the next Fortnite for extreme casual players with a shit ton of microtransactions. Shareholders and marketing executives are holding Blizzard by the balls and I'm afraid it's never going to be good again.
---
Faction imbalance isn't quite as bad in classic, you'll find PvE horde dominant realms with a little searching.
---
Not everyone that plays is going to go balls deep into raiding. If he averaged 4hrs a day of /played and was even mildly efficient he could have the first set done in \~5-6 months. 
---
There seems to be a lot of assumptions around here that ppl only want to play vanilla to be cutting edge raiders....lol.
---
I'm sure once realms are announced there will be plenty of polls beforehand to get a scope of where people will play.
---
And that's when guilds will really start advertising.
---
Maby rogue. Or lock. Or warrior. Or idk
---
If you know the item's name you can search for it on WoWWiki and, in every instance I've ever seen, the stats will be correct for patch 1.12.1 vanilla. [For example](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Templar_Boots).
---
Let's just say that the big pserver I play on id only a little Alliance-sided, a margin of maybe 7% iirc. You'll be okay. 
---
&gt;I think
---
&gt;objectively better
---
thats subjective dawg thats why you think it
---
&gt;Fire magi no longer have mana
---
this isnt 100% true, towards the end of legion there were some cases in long fights with fire mages running out of mana, especially if they had aoe. 
---
How long is a piece of string?
---
I guess it depends on how long it takes you to drop the 2 windseeker bindings along with how big your bank balance is. 
---
LOLOLOLOL 
---
...but classic is going to be included in live, so you'll have to resub to live
---
I'm gonna set a portable DVD player beside my screen so I can watch futurama/family guy seasons 1 - 4 over and over again while grinding in arathi basin
---
&gt; P.S. seasonal servers in Classic are pure cancer. Just as anything close to mythic+. Bringing "rush it, go go faster" mentality is the last thing we need.
---
what if one season takes 10 years?
---
it's not really about season, it's about the patch on which new realms start
---
This is a well made troll post
---
lol I actually got kind of mad at first. Nice work, op 
---
It is highly unlikely you will be the first person to 60. Many people plan to play for 20 hour days and sleep only 4 hours a night after release.
---
In 5 months.. 
---
Step 1. Be in a raiding guild
---
Step 2. Become a pillar in thay raiding guild. Main tank or off tank. Be reliable. Never miss a raid. Make sure your guild trusts you. The number one consideration for Thunderfury is: will you quit or leave the guild in the next 2-3 years? If the answer to that is no then it deserves to go to someone more fit. Thunderfury is a guild item. It's for the betterment of everyone. Make sure your reputation on the server is squeaky clean
---
Ontop of that, make. Sure you're known in the server. Nobody is going to give Thunderfury to a nobody. Talk in voice chat, be active, help alts, focus 100% on the guild. 
---
Step 3. Get full best in slots. Thunderfury goes to the highest geared tank 9 times of 10. Take every opportunity to gear yourself that you can get. Come to raids flaked each time and have consumables. Craft a gnomish engineering shield to become known as the guilds best aoe tank. 
---
Step 4. Discuss in advance the priority for binding drops. Perhaps strongly advise your guild to use loot council.
---
Step 5. Never ever ever miss a molten core run. A player with one binding not attending and the other piece dropping would be the biggest shit show imaginable. It would also hurt your argument of why you should get it. Once. You obtain the weapon you should never miss any raids.
---
-Raided for 3 years on Feenix/Chronos as OT of a hardcore guild
---
Just checked, they are ten storms actually 
---
"Because we aren't good enough to come up with better DRM and anti-cheat solutions."
---
Good luck finding a guild as a gnome in classic.
---
Gnome warrior is completely outclassed by human warriors due to the lack of sword specialization. Gnome warriors also cant even reach most of the bosses so your hit chance will be much lower. I doubt any serious raiding guild will take gnomes.
---
for priests, berserking isn't even the draw, hex of weakness and shadowguard is. the former fucks any fast hitting physical dps (rogues, druids) and healers, the latter tends make attackers go "splat".
---
compare and contrast to devouring plague, which... gets dispelled and makes you go oom.
---
Especially as a warrior 
---
Clearly not, since the water should be on the other side.
---
&gt; I got the Razer Naga MMO mouse specifically for WoW back in the day, came with the numkeys all mapped.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Found the buttons were too close and not easy to tell by feel what you were clicking, so ended up using it as a regular mouse :(
---
Logitech G600 is really the big-hand-friendly mouse. As a frost giant, G600 was the only one normal size. The rest, all mice designed for humans, are "mini type" for me.
---
wait, it was released in November 2004, wasn't it?
---
Or wait, not in north Korea...
---
Hm.
---
&gt;Game is ez cause I have watched videos and read guides
---
&gt;I'll be the first to 60, I'll casually make a guild and get Thunderfury, breeze through BWL, AQ40 and Naxx, then I'll get Rank 14
---
I think you have it planned out too precisely, you underestimate vanilla and you set the bar absurdly high. 
---
Do you have any experience in vanilla raiding? Do you have any experience as a guild master? What vanilla experience do you have outside of guides and videos? 
---
This artwork was probably created way before the dam was modeled, so that's healthy to consider.
---
Ah ok, about when I left actually. Then I came back to give Cata a chance and left there after a short while and been gone since.
---
How does gearscore punish good players? Surely they would be the ones benefiting from it the most?
---
Ah so your pulling out for a bit 💪
---
&gt; I believe that community driven innovations will be the way to go “post Naxx” so that people can constantly stay engaged socially and never have to alter the game.
---
&gt; These things would have to develop naturally and who knows if it would even be possible.
---
players alone won't make a new raid, or boss, unless we get some modkit.
---
But I agree, it would be fun to do all the new things, like many sorts of twinking, stratholme speedruns, etc.
---
But it will lost its vanilla spirit, because it won't be as rewarding as vanilla content. You won't get a post-naxx gear upgrade...
---
Thank you for the heads up! I never quite got into runescape. I will look into it, there definitely seem to be parallels.

Having a comparison might be really interesting.

You can clearly see it's a piece of land leading to a bigger one who's on the open sea.

Right. I had to inspect it really close to see. For some reason that spiraling piece of land looked like a bridge/dam. Just didn't seem natural but it is connected to land.

Thank you for the helpful inputs.

Yeah, I will keep trying. Hearing an opinion of the former vanilla team leader is already a great thing though.
---
All on use items have a 30 second cooldown when first equipped before they're usable. 
---
Here's the problem though, regardless of which stance you take on the whole changes vs no changes debate we all have little things in our minds that we know we wouldn't mind seeing implemented and we know that we would enjoy them because to us it would make the game better. But what makes our opinions/ideas any different or special to other players and who gets to decide what does and doesn't get implemented? 
---
For example, you want to see an attempt at class balance, I want to see slightly increased realm caps to make up for the eventual drop off in players after a few months, little timmy wants the respec costs halfed, some other player wants all of the DM money making methods nerfed, someone else wants to see all professions made viable for all classes, another player wants additional graveyards in all zones to avoid long death runs and some other nub wants to make it so that flight masters aren't attackable. 
---
Individually all of those little changes would have very little impact on the game unless we get stuck in the old carousel of buffing/nerfing every class in the attempt to try and achieve what is pretty much un achievable and that is 100% class balance. However if we start listening to every little harmless idea that someone comes up with then the game will quickly change from what we originally petitioned for and that was an accurate reconstruction of a game that we all loved. If you can't accept that then you should fuck off and stop trying to hijack our cause and ruin something that we've been crying out for for so long. 
---
&gt; Dragon Isles, or classic Emerald Dream
---
especially Emerald Dream, as a continuation of the Nightmare Dragons questline.
---
That Nightmare Dragons quest, the quest-starting item I only get by accident because I just decided to help with the boss, was not geared or anything or didn't know what it drops, was just bored...
---
and never managed to get my hands on it again, on another character. When I first got it, it felt so common... but from that point, I loved the Emerald Dream and Druid lore even more. 
---
but at first, I thought the item was nothing special
---
and, after a year or two... the entire quest felt so... so special and so rare... like one Christmas in entire year, this felt like one quest in entire life... and was as epic too.
---
There is only an appropriate answer:
---
\[1.General\]\[Analjokesmaster\]: Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
---
Is there a way to make the writing of the according color?
---
Could possibly be Thandol Span as well
---
&gt; No increased level cap, no raids on the absolute highest end (at least not exclusively). Expand things in the middle of the game.
---
I mean, high-end raids too, but not with the post-TBC tier and gearscore system.
---
also, be careful with content overwhelm - when there are 10 possibilities of where to progress, it's not that good either.
---
this gave me a nice laugh

My memory may be hazy/rose-tinted but I seem to recall the servers that i played during Vanilla were quite balanced, maybe at very worse 60-40 (I'm talking early vanilla). Regardless I don't forsee any issues with you finding guilds and people to raid with
---
Error 37
---
Jokes aside some guilds won't get tfury for like a year from sheer bad luck alone.
---
Been struggling with this hardcore - please use your divination skills to help me!
---
How many keybinds will I need? 
---
This doesn’t explain the other expansions post TBC, though.
---
Thank you for your detailed comment!
---
I agree with you. I, myself, was new to MMOs too and it was a magical place.  
---
The fear of the excitement wearing off sooner than we'd hope for is something I keep asking myself. Maybe 14 years were enough to be living the experience with a fresh start. Maybe it was not enough time and people will lose interest quickly.  
---
I think that used to be one reason for Blizzard not to remake the game. The risk of fading excitement was too big for them to make the commitment.
---
It definitely seems like marketing is ruling the development of WoW nowadays. Not just at Blizzard, it has become a very common thing for big companies. Rather than making a great game with passionate development it just needs to maximize profit by whichever means.

I levelled an enh shammy on a certain pserver and thoroughly enjoyed it, but I never had a chance to play ele. Everyone always talks about how strong enh is in wpvp and I feel like ele is its forgotten brother.
---
Is ele as strong in small scale wpvp and bgs? Can anyone share their experiences with the spec? I'm considering levelling one on Classic
---
Yep it hurts to log on and have no desire to do anything 
---
Yeah MoP was the peak of WoW.

Not much, but you'll need two mouses.

---
I see how that might be confusing. The guidelines don't require us to write stubbornly about game art. It just has to be about the game industry.
---
We do get a broad knowledge about game development and there might be useful information in this specific case of classic WoW. I might learn useful things that will help me later down the road. That's how the professors approved of my topic.
---
Love it 
---
It will take months before server populations normalize, but I agree that there will probably be a few PvE servers with a favorable Horde presence.  Just be willing to either restart on such a server, or transfer your character there.
---
When I first started in vanilla, I played on a server some RL friends were on - it was PvP.  After getting ganked a few times I regretted being on a PvP server.  However, after a short period of time I began to enjoy my PvP server more.  I eventually rolled on a PvE server on the dominant faction and it just wasn't the same.  I'll roll on a PvP server in classic - I feel like the community is more lively.
---
You might find it interesting that the US top 20 (on some kills in WOTLK) hardcore raiding guild I joined in TBC came from a PVE server (moonrunner) to PvP (dragonmaw) so they could have an easier time at recruiting hardcore players.
---
Chain heals on the AV bridge outside the alliance turtle is pretty fun.
---
Retail irl 
---
Before your sub ends it might be a good idea to AH/vendor everything then buy WoW tokens on the AH for Classic.
---
I am going to give a simple answer from someone that has played since mid way through classic. Wait for classic to come out, if you don't like it, move to retail. Classic is the starting point of wow and it is not too far away so it makes most sense to start at the start.... Also without getting in to a big argument, retail is objectively not in a good spot right now. Not a good time to start playing on retail.
---
For class I got Otter which is known for its playfulness, so you are drawn to a class that will be the most fun for you to play. The cards seem to be pointing to a lot of fun different classes but the one that strikes me the most is hunter.
---
For race I got Dog which is known for its friendship, which is leading me to believe you should play the race your friend(s) will want to play as. Since I don't know what race your friends will want to play as I drew another card which is Horse. With Horse what comes to mind are fields because I picture the horses running around large fields. The only starting area that that reminds me of is the Tauren starting area so I believe that is suggesting Tauren Hunter.
---
As for pet if you are curious I picked Wild Boar, which I believe is a type of hunter pet so maybe try your luck with a wild boar pet.
---
I hope I was on the money.
---
It looks more like a harbor IMO, could it be Menethil?
---
A commonly overlooked item are the crystals from the eastern un'goro pylon.  Not a piece of gear but a good damage reflect consumable.
---
Vanilla Ele sham is one of the strongest classes. The burst is absolutely insane, the tools you have to impact a game are insane. Lowest cast times for offensive abilities that hit just as hard as any other spell. 11% crit chance on lightning bolts and chain Lightning’s just from talent points alone. Wind fury totem is the absolute biggest game changer and can make Warriors one shot ppl in pvp. Purge is just so good to destroy druids and mages. Curing poisons is huge and can fuck rogues when ur orc. Mail armor and a shield giving you a chance to take some hits when melee is on you. Healing ability. I mean the class has so many tools in its kit that if you really utilize all of them and play multiple roles based on the situation you can literally turn into god mode with the right gear. Get that hand of Edward the odd to really have some fun. 
---
A good hunter will demolish anything.
---
My guild in vanilla never completed a thunderfury. We had like 8 of one binding, and none of the other.
---
yes there is
---
Please roll on the server I will play on, my gnome bank manager always wants to marry somebody in game but she is quite picky, she only waNTS A GNOME WITH EITHER THUNDERFURY OR RANK 14. 
---
Don't worry about "unpopular opinions". This is actually great to read, thank you for sharing.
---
I do agree with some of the points you've made. It really is an unpolished game. And I think that was totally okay 14 years ago. I'd say compared to its competition back then it was still advanced in what it was.  
---
Also the game won't provide anything new. We could say vanilla WoW was a "finished" game. All the dungeons and raids were cleared. We can find exact guides on how to beat the game perfectly. So the game was explored, somewhat, fully. 
---
I see weaknesses too. And that makes it even more interesting how much the players are craving vanilla WoW.  
---
They, or we, know about flaws. We know the game is kind of outdated, yet people are dying to play it again.  
---
I think that's exactly what makes this case so very interesting.
---
If classic WoW turns out to be really successful I could see other developers consider what the strengths of the game were back then and possibly try to incorporate certain aspects to modern games again.
---
How can people roll alliance and miss out on this? It's not classic without Barrens chat
---
I was Horde in 2005, but for that reason I concentrated mainly on Alliance in the private server scene, so I think I will return to Horde again, since that's actually the bigger unknown to me right now. 
---
Tauren Warrior or orc Shaman with an undead caster alt.
---
Ah man, sorry. It was close. I'm playing gnome warrior.  
---
However Tauren is my favorite race of hunter so there's that, and boar my favorite pet. Shame I hate hunter though
---
I wouldn’t overthink it, this was probably drawn without the games zone layouts in mind. Just the fantasy setting of azeroth
---
I think there’s definitely a problem with the effort put in, but the design choices they’ve made trying to pander to everyone without really knowing what made the old wow special combined with that is what did it in.
---
None at all.
---
Classic should be good enough of a game on its own, without trying desperately to relive something that's never coming back. 
---
I am SO excited for classic! I've started talking about it IRL and am working on recruiting friends to join in this time around.  It's going to be much bigger than they even know. 
---
I think BfA is doing enough harm to BfA without classic’s help. They always said the WoW killer would be WoW
---
Damn, this is a GOOD one !
---
Make it 30 million...because that is the REAL number of people who played WoW from 2005 to 2010.
---
And by Wotlk you mean end of Vanilla.
---
&gt; Those are literally modern solutions to old problems.
---
Not really. Thousands of players logging into every server and starting their characters at once is not a really "old" problem, since back then there was a steady influx of players instead of millions hyped for months (even years). 
---
No thanks. I rather see it all again when it’s released. I’m creating a whole new bnet account for it. 
---
My summer vacation is always 6 weeks.   hurray for jobs in education! (total vacation a year is 12 weeks, but I do have to work a few extra hours each week to get this benefit. 
---
Private servers have definitely proven that vanilla's fanbase is very loyal.
---
The great thing is that it's not only the people who have played it back in the day. Like yourself, there are also many people who have heard about the game and gave it a try.
---
You're right, hearing about the game without playing it could easily create fantasies that might not come true once people look deeper into it. That might spark negativity towards the game. 
---
Nostalrius had already proven that a big part of their player count was not just veterans but new-ish players who found their love for classic on private servers. So I expect even more people the give vanilla a try when it launches and end up liking it a lot.
---
I'd like to add an opinion. I do think nostalgia plays a part in it for many player, **but** that doesn't need to be a bad thing though. Nostalgia can be something beautiful in my opinion. Having positive memories of the game is not a bad thing and doesn't have to result in them losing interest in it when they get to play it again. 
---
But I agree, not everyone is driven by nostalgia. 
---
For class I picked Weasel which is known for its stealth. This made me think of rogue right off the bat but then I remembered druids can stealth to. My intuition is actually leaning more towards Druid on this one.
---
As for Race I picked Eagle which I picture soaring over an empty sky. This makes me think of the Tauren city of Thunder Bluff high in the sky.
---
So Tauren Druid. I figured now you are wondering what spec you should play as so I drew one more card and it was Moose. From Moose I am picturing him charging in which makes me think of bear form. I am sure then you will mostly be leveling in cat form but I think the cards are telling you to not be afraid of bear form too.
---
I hope that helps.
---
Allaince has Westfall chat, although nothing compared to the Real Barrens chat 
---
Just be prepared to do disappointed with the cables. They fail so much. And sometimes destroy themselves.
---
&gt; At this point Ion and Brack have to prove to me they don't want Classic to fail and aren't just using it as a trojan horse to get people to try modern WoW on the same client.
---
What a ridiculous conspiracy theory. Of course they don't want Classic to fail. Classic being successful is literally what will get them the most subscriptions in the end, which means the highest possible profit. 
---
Why should people who are not interested in retail WoW in the first place stay for retail if they're disappointed by Classic? They won't, they will just leave and unsubscribe and Blizzard loses their money. 
---
This trojan horse theory doesn't make any sense at all. 
---
A player who does the preparation to learn the raids, knows their class, and is capable of completing the raid may be passed on at face value.
---
Sure it has a good indicator of the players raw damage potential, but that means nothing when they don’t know their class.
---
We had a DK in our guild who was pretty decked out and could simply not get their DPS where other DKs should have been. (They ended up getting cut from our ICC runs after countless time and resources of training were spent on discussing this with them.)
---
Similar to that, I feel that a reporting system may work a good chunk of the time, I have a feeling some good (nice/non-aggressing) players may be flamed by another one of these systems.
---
That’s all I’m saying.  I may be fundamentally wrong and I don’t claim to know if my points are the absolute truth.  All I know is these systems have the potential to sap the fun and learning from the game for some players.
---
OSRS is still going strong after all these years with over 100k concurrent players at all times. If Runescape can manage it then Classic WoW will easily be able to maintain a massive user-base. There's no doubt in my mind that Classic will exceed expectations and be a true revival for Blizzard.
---
No 32 bit client
---
True, but maybe the raw content isn’t what’s necessary at the end of the day.  I’d be curious to see where the community and the game goes.
---
All I know is that we will see what happens when it’s been a couple of years and I’m very interested to be apart of it.
---
A player thats more capable should theoretically on average have better gear though? Sure there'll be outliers where someone might be good but just not put in time but especially in earlier versions of the game getting good gear was at least slightly more involved than it is in live so it was a better indicator of someone's skill. gearscore can't indicate how either player actually plays but it makes logical sense that someone with a higher score would have at least a higher chance of knowing what the fuck is happening
---
Probably right.  So if blizzard can tap 15% of that group they’d have about 4.5 million subs. That’d be a huge success by any measure. 
---
Do me do me do me
---
I doubt it'll spawn many "Classic-style" mmo's, some perhaps, but not many.         
---
That type of game is a niche in gaming nowadays, most people prefer the less time-consuming or easier mmo's over hardcore ones(See Wildstar).        
---
Classic is going to be successful, but a big part of the success is going to be because it's Wow, THE mmo worldwide.        
---
There are some classic-ish mmo's coming out soon though, Pantheon and Ashes of Creation are two that look promising.
---
Rolling a Paladin, like I did on Nov 23, 2004. Gonna go Dwarf instead of Human, and stick with alch/herb instead of waffling among every profession like I did 14 years ago. But I want to take my time levelling, do the epic cross-continental quests, and enjoy the ride. I may try to raid at 60 but I'm going to focus on playing with friends, doing 5-mans and such.
---
It’s awesome.  Wish I bought one long ago.  I was worried would take a while to get used to the additional buttons,  but after 2 playing sessions it felt wrong to go back to a regular mouse.
---
I love the haptic feedback as well.  There are different programmable “buzzes” and you can set them up off of in game queues like low health.  I set my push to talk button to buzz as  well so just in case I fat finger that button, no unwanted output.
---
I plan on going to school and dropping out again
---
Haven't played live in about 6 years I don't think. Level 80/85s sitting there, 3 level 29 twinks from classic lol
---
So much time, so much fun
---
I agree, not arguing for it. We're talking about linking between capital cities, not factions.
---
No need to be a dick.
---
&gt;Private servers have proven that the game is very much playable and desired by loyal fans.
---
Take that with a grain of salt. Pirate servers wouldn't be nearly as popular if they required a subscription (which will be the case for the real WoW Classic). It's not even close.
---
Of course the popularity of pirate servers shows there definitely is some interest, but "interested in playing it" is not quite the same as "interested in playing it so much that I'd pay 15 bucks a month." 
---
Pirate servers have always been around even for the current expansion, especially in the TBC/WOTLK era and were very popular back then despite the same expansion being available as retail at the same time. 
---
You just need to do a legendary weapon quest chain (approximately 4h long which is a long time) which will award you your ~~artifact weapon~~ thunderfury
---
I love Shaman!
---
As Blowingupfast mentioned I their post the kit is insane. Filled with almost too much utility it is often hard to figure out what you should be doing to be the most optimal. However that is why I enjoy them so thoroughly as your play style dictates what you should be doing more than rock paper scissors "algorithms" some other classes seem to be plagued by. 
---
Haven't had much time to play Vanilla in the past year, got one to 38 on LB before ND launch now I'm on a 28. Decided I'd go with a hybrid ish spec. Got my first point in Flurry and moved to Elemental. 
---
Can solo almost any mob due to Earthbind Kiting and has super efficient grinding with only Earthbind, Mana Tide, and Lightning Shield. Each hit you get with a slow 2h beats most mobs singular hit (while kiting you should effectively Joust to trade 1:1) and with that Joust Lightning Shield will proc every hit you recieve effectively gaining damage per each hit. Also in between lightning shield casts you get to the 5s in combat mana regeneration if only for a second or two but this really boosts your efficiency. 
---
Just go get more surgery ! 
---
Classic style mmo’s have popped up in the past and failed miserably. Wildstar was supposed to be a hardcore return to the  classic/burning crusade era of wow and it flopped so hard it literally never made more money than what they spent on developing it. 
---
For race I picked Hawk which made me think of the nighthawk right off the bat. So I am think Night Elf.
---
For class I picked Wild Boar which is one of the most ferocious of warrior spirits. Nothing can stop you path, so it seems the cards are telling you you should go for it with a Night Elf Warrior. :) Get that Thunderfury no matter how long it takes!
---
Is the water totem quest the longest of the totem quests?
---
Do you really not see this is a joke?
---
&gt; Nostalrius had already proven that a big part of their player count was not just veterans but new-ish players who found their love for classic on private servers. So I expect even more people the give vanilla a try when it launches and end up liking it a lot.
---
Yes, that's also what i expect. Imo, A LOT more players will play official Classic than the number that we have seen on pservers, for the simple reason of pservers being illegal.
---
Something i want to add - there is also an opinion that people play on pservers because it's free and they don't want to spend money on retail. I know that this opinion is especially widespread in my country (even though our sub fee is about 10$ instead of 15$). Understandable, given the average salary in my country, but it still looks like extremely weak point to me for two reasons:
---
1) playing classic for free instead of playing BfA for sub fee sounds like getting a free microwave when you don't want to spend money on a refridgerator. Retail and classic are very different, you can't really substitue one with another.
---
2) Simply personal exprience. In all my time spent on pservers i have met one single person who told me he was playing here because it's free and he wouldn't pay for official vanilla. Everyone else were ready to pay a sub for authentic classic from blizz.
---
That's why you get a girl that plays wow
---
Im absolutely amazed a lot of people dont see this is a troll post. How do they manage in life?
---
Me too please !
---
I leveled two shamans to 60 back in the day. I've been playing hunter to 52 in a private server and while it was fun, I think I'm going back to shaman once classic hits. I still can't decide whether I'll play shaman or warrior though. I'm playing a prot pally in retail right now and I really enjoy tanking but reading about how great shaman was just fills me with nostalgia that makes me want to do it all again.
---
 You have to consider cost to remake classic is 1/10the the cost and dev time for a complete mmorpg
---
Cost to develop any other genre of game is less than s new mmorpg. 
---
Cash shop and sales opportunities are always going to be lower when there is ANY form of in game character/item progression and why mmorpg’s are not made as often these days. 
---
The genre as a whole has shrunk compared to five years ago. The potential income has also shrunk yet cost of developing has actually gone up. The risk reward Ratio for a company is higher and in the current economic environment business prefers low risk investors 
---
I agree with that.  I am speaking to the outliers in my point.  If we disregard them, then my point falls flat.  I’ve been on both sides of the gearscore game pre-guild and it frankly sucked to be scrambling for a chance when all it was is:
---
“Need to beat X raid.  Need Y Gearscore to finish it quickly and have achievement.”
---
Finding a group not doing that was rare at best.  Only by finding a guild did I get through content.
---
Moral of the story, I’m speaking to outlier pug-players who were likely in the minority of being competent or even just looking to experience raid content and build into a better player.
---
(In the grand scheme, GS benefitted guilds trying to weed out scrubs but may have also resulted in would-be-raiders never building the experience to raid in a catch-22 scenario.)
---
Have you heard of AWS, Azure, or Google? 
---
I level slower than I think I do haha. So a few bars turns into a level really easily.
---
For race I got Black Panther. I am glad you said you hate alliance because I would have though Night Elf right off the bat, but there is probably another race that is even darker and that is Undead.
---
For class I got Hawk, which makes me think hawkeye but unfortunately undead can't play hunters. What is another class that can shoot from afar? Perhaps mage or warlock, although maybe you would want to delve into warlock that fits with that darkness and unknown from Black Panther.
---
Not at all, PvErs can PvP if they want to PvP. Not flipping the coin at all. 
---
Come on you coldbloody fuckers. Give him at least some upvotes for this well made meme post. 
---
&gt; There are different programmable “buzzes” and you can set them up off of in game queues like low health
---
wait, it works with WOW now?
---
and... how many side buttons does it have? can't really see on the picture, and doesn't say anywhere on the official site
---
It will take you 4
---
Did someone say Thunderfury?
---
And that is not going to be dedicated hardware Blizzard is going to be paying for?
---
That wouldn’t solve the issues. MP5 might be useful for boomkins but that would turn them into self healing perpetual killing machines in PVP. You can’t just “double” a value and expect no horrible ramifications. 
---
As far as prot, they need MP5, a taunt, consistent high threat, proper armor that doesn’t exist. Again, in both instances, you change too much of the game to satisfy people who want to play healer classes and not heal in raids. It’s not perfect, TBC got it pretty close to perfect. But that’s TBC, let it stand out from Vanilla as it’s own version, and enjoy what it has to offer when it’s here to offer it.
---
troll priest for shadow pvp. their racial spells are fucking ridiculous.
---
Do me OP, please do me OP.
---
but you too have that feeling, that the items don't look "vanilla" at all, on those new models?
---
It's too small and blurry to see in the actual picture.
---
No not really. I cannot stand the new models. The only decent one is maybe gnome, but it's ruined by the animations. 
---
after a couple of years, you ask?
---
Server populations will drop to minimum, most likely all servers will merge/CRZ into 1 or 2.... because there will be not enough interested globally to just FCM.
---
The remaining playerbase will be mostly new/returning players that want to try it out, find out that the server is dead, and leave after a few months.
---
Honestly, it will not be really dead. There will be just like huge gaps between the players - some will be trying to find a group for Naxxramas, some will be not geared enough and trying to find a group for MC, but none will succeed, because of not enough people in the bracket.
---
though, I'm more concerned about other games that launched their own classic, what will happen to them in summer 2019...
---
When deciding on professions you should remember that Engineering is almost mandatory, so you might have to change your profession column to fit that. Especially as a hunter you will need some Engineering items to help you against people trying to abuse your deadzone.
---
Also, while I understand you don't want 8 characters you honestly won't have time to keep more than 1 or 2 up to date with gear. I'd probably pick one that is know to be great at farming (for example mage or hunter) so you can get "easy" gold. The other could benefit from being a healer since you will be able to find a guild easier and they might be more inclined to help you gear your other character if you regularly help them as a healer.
---
I could tell this was bait after the first paragraph. U got a long ways 2 go scrubby
---
I thought they completely removed it.
---
I could be wrong, I mostly play healers.
---
I just wanna farm kills for 6 hours straight on my ele shaman by spamming CL and Lightning from range...
---
But Wildstar failed and they shut down servers so clearly gamers don't want that style of game.
---
Get that other knee fucked. We need this to be legit. Don't jinx it!
---
You will get downvoted I think, but you speak the truth. Initial hype will be strong, but majority of people don't have the time/patience to play Classic, nor the Nostalgia associated with it... I think the majority won't get past level 30, lots won't get past level 10 before they stop playing.
---
Nah they didn't really remove it from anyone, rather just make it mostly inconsequential for those specs. 
---
Classic is not a gift. If nostalrius did not prove there was money to be made they wouldn't have done it. That's all there is to it. This is not a passion project by activision.
---
For race I got kindergarten tantrum. Meaning you’ll roll a gnome on a PvE server. For class I got scrublord, meaning either hunter or cleric
---
Offtime hours, significantly smaller server population, sheer less volume of gold in circulation, and regional based servers means mafias will likely not be a huge problem.
---
I also foresee most players in classic being "far more casual" compared to the elitist min-maxers that exist in pservers.
---
Yeah you're gonna see a lot of that at launch
---
&gt;Yeah by far.  Takes a few hours to complete.
---
Almost got a heart attack thinking classic is only coming to mobile due to the title
---
For race, I got corpsecamp victim. Meaning u shud prob roll night elf for wispform. For class, I got the wounded hyena, meaning ur gonna want to roll a warrior to get kites around
---
None, I've already done that 14 years ago.
---
Going back because its a genuinely fun game, and my group has a second chance to play the best iteration of WoW.
---
and "Disconnected from server"
---
Not "You have been disconnected from the server", or "BLZ66666666" or anything like that.
---
For ur class I got the card “chain wiping in the deadmines”, which mean u prob gonna want to roll a melee huntard. For race I got “sasuke”, so female ne more than likely
---
That's what he meant.
---
Maybe is just a random landmass that was lost on concept art 
---
&gt; Factor in that they're (mages) supposedly an extremely fast leveling/gold earning class with AOE farming
---
You should factor in that on several pservers there are dynamic respawns which allows for AoE leveling / farming to be much more efficient. Especially their leveling speed will decrease quite a bit compared to servers that use dynamic respawns.

For race I got the “squatting dog” card. Which makes me think that u shud roll gnome because they’re the only ones small enough for a dog to shit on.
---
For class I got the “laughing stock” card. Which makes me think u shud roll a warlock to get owned by wotf 
---
0.5 second cast time. Honestly, couldn't you just google it? "Escape artist vanilla" brought up several databases for vanilla with direct link to the racial.
---
If we see this with sharding then that just speaks for itself how pathetic their cloud servers are...
---
Is a hotdog a sandwich?
---
For class, Igot the “faceroll King” card which makes me think u shud try playing a water spec mage.
---
For race I got the “otaku hustle” cArd which means that I shud roll female human
---
Trolling the troll eh? I had planned to put more time into it, but I just started my shift and wanted something to entertain me for a bit so I went ahead and posted it.
---
I got the “Death” card which means for whatever reason u won’t be installing the gam
---
Whats the most bad ass nelf male class in Vanilla?
---
What style of game that was? I tried Wildstar because i heard that it "has the spirit of Classic wow" and was made by the same people.
---
What i saw in the very first zone? An arrow, pointing where i should run. Quests which i pick up automatically without reading anything. Map makers showing me the way. Automatically completing quests right where i did them. Didn't like that at all.
---
How did Blizzard even locate the team to send a C&amp;D letter? Was it simply by going through the payment/info you gave to whatever company hosted your servers?
---
6 months to 1 year or longer for thunderfury
---
tons of mats + rare drops needed
---
I got the “annoying younger sibling card”. Which means that u shud roll huntard. For class I also got the “annoying younger sibling card” which means u shud roll ne 
---
Are you going to be involved in classic at all? Either on the Dev team or just playing?
---
100% of the playerbase? So there were no players between level 1-58? Did you forget where Karazhan was located, what about the Caverns of Time dungeons/raid or the fact that Outland had no AH? A lack of cohesive world feeling in TBC you say, yet going to Outland was no less cohesive than travelling between the two continents on Azeroth, objectively speaking they were different instances with a loading screen just the same.
---
You're trying to make a point by omitting the facts.

https://classicdb.ch/?talent#by0Ms0bZbhtZEMrz0uk 
---
Lvl 1 Nova for stealth reveal. Blackout for swp&amp;shadowguard. Silence + VE for slight heal. Beserk + Mana burn. Lots of variety, I plan not dying when duo lvling my warrior bud because PVP and slow you down. You can rock this build into 60dungeons I'm sure. I can heal the warrior and deal damage at same time. Probably won't need to respec til after MC
---
Was there any plans to revive Nostalrius after the whole 'E l y s i u m' debacle, which Viper and Daemon sorely regretted? We all wanted it to come back, and a lot of us still miss it to this day. It'd be great to hear what you were all thinking during this time.
---
Im on dragonmaw, what guild? 
---
I see good shitpost, I upvote good shitpost 
---
Right, each weapon skill is 0.1% hit and 0.1% crit, but at &gt;10 different from the mobs defense there is an added penalty to hit.
---
There are great bows in game, so soulstring off 4H for example is likely to be hot given KT is stingy.
---
Ashjre'thul will still be king for most people though.
---
I sense a lot of corruption in ur soul. The card I drew was the “worthless peasant” card. U cud roll cleric, but prob just want to uninstall
---
Yeh u gave it away by being a scrublord. Gnome rouge.
---
Hi, /u/lopjae
---
100%. People will downvote and argue but it definitely is stealing development time. Keep in mind the classic team is literally the same team that's working on retail. I'm sure they're doing their best to manage time between the two efficiently but you're kidding yourself if you think it's not a factor.
---
I was looking into the new M+ affix reaping and I started seeing tons of parallels between retail and classic. Things like mytharax casts cthun eye beam, reaping is essentially nefarians skeleton mechanic. The new raid on the PTR has a ranged dps tank just like twin emps. The extreme rarity of anchor weed on launch mirroring black lotus. I think the devs have vanilla on the brain from closely working on it and are taking inspiration.
---
if they have sharding they kill classic before it even begins. NO SHARDING!
---
What did you think of Blizzard's Classic presentation at Blizzcon? If it were up to you, would you take different decisions than some of the ones Blizzard have taken?
---
Also, thanks for the great time we all had on your server.
---
The dungeons and raids were really hard 
---
U got the “scrubransaurus beta” card. Meaning u won’t make it past lvl 22. Don’t matter what race or class u roll
---
The off-hand works while shapeshifted??
---
Yeh ur healing intent is strong I can tell.
---
The card I drew was the “hydrogen peroxide” card it’s not bad. ThT means u get 2 roll a warlock and need to put talents into improved health funnel to heal better
---
Were you offered any sort of role in the development of Classic Servers, are you open to a role if offered?
---
U shud roll me huntard. NEXT!
---
First I'd like to say thank you for the experience. Amongst all the private servers out there, Nostalrius was the most stable, blizz-like without any donation nonsense or preferential treament. 
---
1. What was the team's view on toxicity and griefing and where the line is drawn? Things such as twinking, smack-talk, corpsecamping or general harrassment in-game, or the monopoly of Devilsaur Leather/Black Lotus.
---
And a few personal questions: 
---
2. How much did you play on Nostalrius and did you ever consider (or have done) abusing admin powers? 
---
3. What particularly do you dislike on the current state of WoW, and what expansion/patch do you believe was the peak?
---
4. In a hypothetical situation, if you could add things to vanilla, what would they be? For example; adding instances, raids, profession recipes, practical items such as gear, novelty items such as mounts/pets or finishing class quest lines and dead ends (such as the Ravenholdt reputation)?
---
Bad
---
I get a strong psychic feeling thatu want 2 dps. My telekinesis also picking up I conflicted between ranged and melee...... hmm this is tuff....
---
The card I drew was the “beaten corpse” cArd. Meaning that u want 2 roll moonkin
---
They did first argus in legion too, and i think even g'huun? 
---
Sure. Ew disgusting. I’m getting a vile aura from u. Probably a cleric so might As well not even install. Not even gonna do a reading 4 a cleric
---
Which part of the summer do you think Classic will be released?
---
If you had to rate Soupa's memeing, what score would you give it? And why is it negative 75?
---
Of coarse. The card that I am getting for you is the “friend zoned nice guy” cRd. U probably want 2 roll resto durid prob be female
---
I have played resto/ele for about 13 years at the highest level at least in terms of pvp, and a pretty decent level of pve. Ele is very fun. My favorite spec if the famous 30/0/21 natures swiftness ele spec and its extremely versatile. It can be used for some of the best solo world pvp possbile and also can heal raids just fine. It's really fun as tauren especially, comboing totems with war stomp into chain lightning. Natures swiftness chain lightning after a casted lightning bolt in to a frost or earth shock often results in about 3.5k damage in 1 second. It's a blast. That being said, this is all extremely gear dependent. 
---
Do you know of any details regarding classic that haven't been publicly announced yet? 
---
when meeting with blizzard, what was the most interesting discussion that happened?
---
When I went to shuffle the deck, I got strong senses of desperation. The card I chose was “filthy peasant” card. That means ur gonna be undead rogue
---
I kind of wish they had gone all out with the racials and made each race play very differently from the others. Tauren are big and Gnomes are tiny. They're about as far apart as two races can be. But the way you play as, with, or against a Gnome isn't much different from how you play as, with, or against a Tauren. I wish that wasn't the case but I know it wouldn't work in a game as structured as WoW.
---
No, not u
---
Is there even a remote possibility in your mind that the revival of classic wow will lead to an alternative development track for the game (e.g., horizontal progression, new raids, re-doing expansions with classic tenants in mind)?
---
-75? That's generous. 
---
Sharding is fine the issue is the playerbase literally doesn't trust the modern developers. Rather have no sharding and insane server que/lag/mob competition than have some monkeys stick their hand in the cooking pot messing with a tried and true formula to success

I would never not play on ED on live and will definitely go hard on whatever RP-PvP server comes out 
---
FINALLY!  
---
Does a straw have one or two holes?
---
Do you think a lot of people will join the RPpvp server on classic?
---
It’s puzzling isn’t it?
---
Feels like the same audience that has an adversarial relationship with Blizzard 90% of the time, and questions every minor change they’re making, also expects Blizz to magically step up and create wholly new content for Classic. And somehow not fuck it up.
---
It would be great if those people would do the math and pick a lane. Either Blizz is horrible, and we don’t trust them to make new content. Or they’re awesome, and we do.
---
Better off going mage, you’ll wish you were when your fighting against tier 2 players.
---
What are you major concerns about wow classic? What do you think can make or break the experience for most players?
---
Also, Do you think sharding is a huge mistake, or is it something that will be needed in the starting zones? 
---
Na. Way too late r u even serious? At lvl 4 I was already mt in shadow fang keep on my sham. I gotta head over as lvl 1. Don’t waste ur time in Elwin 
---
Huntard. That’s the class suites best for you.
---
Man if my guild leader was the offtank and took tfury from our Mt I would gquit on the spot lol nice troll
---
Most definitely.  Hopefully not streamers though 
---
That's how most of these people treat anyone with the slightest deviation to their opinion.  2017 you were a Nazi, 2018 an incel, 2019 something else will be the trump card label to end a conversation with the labeler "on top".  All it shows is their lack of creativity and inability to follow through with a point.  Pathetic.
---
Can you give me the source code?
---
Im slightly confused about what this section of the paper has to do on your thesis. While overall player feelings may be important they are not whats going to drive the market trends in a post wow era.  If we look to the number of AAA MMOs post wow it was staggering compared to what was out before. Especially looking to see the total number of players in the market. Looking at the type of MMOs is also important.
---
I would say something to pay extra attention to was the difference between the development of the post WoW mmos and what actually happened in the first years of WoW. By this i would pay attention to BGs and PvP and how most post wow games have tried to make there games have all these things from the start as opposed to what wow did which was NOT start with those items. 
---
WoW built itself a titan which many companies tried to copy whole sale and failed for the most part. Only one WoW clone actually still exists in any real state as much as it could be called a wow Clone and thats FFXIV
---
If i was writing this as a thesis on Game Design and Art, i would look to the Pre-WoW era of MMO design The WoW era of Design And the Upcoming Era. I would bet that wows overall influence in the market was smaller than people think however its impact on MMOs at the time was huge, though i would guess its quite muted in the modern and future mmos as people look to things that arent wow to draw there influences from.
---
Opinions on loot trading and possible sharding on classic?
---
Who you calling slow, guy?
---
I thought discussion about private servers wasn’t allowed in this subreddit. MODS!!!!!!!
---
This reply alone makes me want to roll one
---
Has the Blizzard team been asking you any questions as they develop Classic? What kind of advice/information have you given them (that you can share)?
---
What kind of impression do you get with regards to how they responded or how they asked?
---
How do you think these will translate into gameplay elements in Classic? (with regards to each point you remember)
---
Also I love you.
---
U got a long way 2 go. Maybe try a battleground 4 practice
---
Why was Nostalrius taken down but plenty of private servers are still able to exist? Why don't they get taken down do you think?
---
Yeh another generation of lives 2 ruin
---
For class I got Horse which is known for their speed, which makes me think if Hunter because they are one of the fastest classes.
---
For race I actually got butterfly. The only race I can think of with the image of butterfly is night elf so I hope that suits you.
---
Night Elf Hunter
---
What's is your opinion on the current fears of this community regarding the development of classic wow and the current situation of Activision Blizzard? 
---
rogue
---
You know why vanilla succeeded in bringing in such a wide audience? You could literally go to your local library and install vanilla on the shitty 10 year old computers and be able to play. Wildstar and modern wow have harsh system reqs. If you want to raid mythic 20 man in wow or 40 man in wildstar you need a pretty beefy gaming pc. There are spell effects and target indicators that pop up all over your screen that you need to react to in realtime and having low fps or lag makes this nearly impossible. In vanilla if you got 10 fps in a 40 man it wasn't the end of the world. There are stories of guys who would raid with their camera pointed at the floor because fps lag and guess what those guys got by fine spamming one button rotation. There wasn't a ton going on so if you had a lag spike now and then or when adds spawned it wasn't the end of the world. This goes a really long way. Even if I wanted to deal with all the BS that comes with playing retail I couldn't. I'm sure millions of others are in the exact same boat.
---
When wow classic releases are you going to start working on private servers in preparation for the mass exodus when bobby kotick forces in game cash shops.
---
You are assuming the player base of retail Wow and classic are the same population. In reality they are mostly  separate groups with some overlap. They are trying to appeal to the group of 15-20 million people who had subs from vanilla up to the end of Wrath. A large majority of those players don’t play retail. So the number of current retail players who play and quit is irrelevant. The classic wow community wont be made up of mostly retail players. 
---
As far as I'm aware, the main disadvantage is that they only really get good by the time you get the AQ40 set.
---
Horde
---
The point would be the effect the rocket helm has? a 30 second CC is much more valuable than 2%hit 2%crit (assuming lionheart), also you can swap it while it's on CD.
---
Possibly but I wouldn't bank on it.
---
I'm in my 20's with a 12 year old sibling. He is a "Gamer" by the standards of today. By that I mean he loves phone games, following minecraft/roblox youtubers, and in general disdains investment games such as MMORPG's, and RTS.
---
I'm almost certain his friends and their friends are similar, so I wouldn't bank on it, but there will be a few that is certain.
---
What impact do you think Classic WoW release will have on private servers?
---
I'm not surprised, I'm sure there are a few of the original core raiders still going.  I joined in TBC right after they came over from Moonrunner.  At that time the Alliance guild Vulgar was the top guild - by far.  I think they beat us to kill Illidan, but we cleared sunwell first.  When WOTLK hit we got all the server firsts at least through the end of Ulduar - which is when I quit raiding.   I've had an alt in the guild ever since, they often let me into their PUGs in cata.  Good people - good times.  
---
Oh shit completely misread that
---
Totally misread him. Ignore what I said
---
I would up vote if it was a well made troll post but this was trash.. 2/10 and that’s cause I’m feeling generous on a weekend.
---
I'd have to have friends to be the friend zoned nice guy, I'm the no lifer solo friendless loser guy. Therefor I must roll a undead rogue
---
That would raise the question of why does your guild bring 5 hunters to raids. Also note that not being primarily focused on PvE doesn't mean that you won't be reliable.
---
You're right that it's a time commitment, but the good thing about raiding BWL is that it's the last raid where you don't have to spend a ridiculous amount of time preparing outside of the time when you're actually raiding.
---
For race I got Opossum which likes to play dead, so what better race than Undead.
---
For class I got Swan which elicits beauty. What is more beautiful than the spells of a mage?
---
So undead mage.
---
There are a ton of factors that go into whether your account gets a beta invite. They look at things like PC specs to test how the game runs on low end and high end systems. Things like how long you've been subscribed how often you play what kind of activities you do in game etc.
---
It might also be Menethil Bay and the Harbour.
---
If you can voice your honest opinions here: As classic fans, are you concerned about the official classic launch not going smoothly or the servers not feeling authentic?
---
Why is this team relevant? 
---
What have you guys been up to since the end of Nostalrius ?
---
Gaming is now trendy, and kids follow the trend.  In 2005 WoW was cool.  Everyone was playing it.  WoW was THE game.  That will not be the case this time around.  It will be the curious contrarians, the private server bitters angry about missing Vanilla, and the fogeys coming back to try to recapture the glory days but most likely looking for their redemption arc because they were scrubs before.  Classic will be cool, but in an era of remakes it won't make more than a light morning ripple.
---
How do these guys compare to other healers? I want to heal in classic and they're on my radar. 
---
I am a bit concerned about wearing cloth and looking like a thriftstore priest. Is that am issue in your experienc 
---
What professions do you think are most appropriate? 
---
Inorite, what a fucking casual.
---
Good post.
---
Took me a second to figure out if troll or full of themselves kid
---
I hate you.
---
Tell me server and character name and I will corpsecamp u
---
Then don't be a dick, mate.  
---
I just said "clearly not", I didn't swear nor called OP names.  
---
There's nothing in my post that can be attributed to being a dick.
---
This may sound like a copout but I pulled up Grouse for class and Salmon for Race and Grouse is the sacred spiral and Salmon return to its source. This makes me think you are meant to play the class and race you played originally. What was your first main in WoW?
---
Well ignoring all your plan and all that in an attempt to answer the title;  
---
In theory you could have a hardcore enough guild who kills Garr and Baron in the very first week, or after the very first reset. Assuming MC is available from the start. With RNGesus on your side you could in theory get both bindings the first week. You'll still need Elementium though, which you cannot get until BWL, which would probably be 3-4 months later at best guess.
---
Wait, are you perchance referring to [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Rogue. Being able to pick fights and when to engage is key for world pvp.
---
Wait for them to pull some mobs, get a little hp down maybe use some of their CDs on the npc, then strike. 
---
For example, wait for a mage to pull, use nova, and blink.  Now open on then and get some honor 
---
If there was one thing about your project that you could change, what would it be?
---
It'll feel like I'm 10 all over agin
---
Yeah. Everything all included, you'll probably get thunderfury really quick. Good job dude! Perfect plan
---
Vanilla WoW was considered a very casual-friendly game at its release, but nowadays it would be considered too hardcore and grindy to get much traction outside of its established fan base.
---
For your race I picked Beaver which makes me think of Human because they built the mighry city of Stormwind. I was thinking it could also mean Ironforge so I pulled another card which was Horse which seals the deal for Human I think since they use the Horse mount.
---
Good luck!
---
I think you meant to say two *meese*
---
Obviously you will. L6 or 7 is pushing it but you'll be fine.
---
1. What do you wish to see once vanilla ends on the classic servers?
---
2. Twitch.TV will be a huge factor for the popularity of Classic WoW, that can't be denied, however: do you think there should be a solution to remove the power of streamsnipers somewhat? Or some other way to make sure the streamer experience would be better?
---
Since you're doing your thesis about art and animation;
---
Over the years of private servers I've been through a lot of mediocre and downright bad ones that offer little to no scripting during quests, NPC interactions and routes that do not care if the player interacts with them or not.
---
I feel those things make the world seem more whole and alive.
---
Most of these are passed by but when you happen to stop and look into them they offer either simple repeated interactions or neat tidbits of lore.
---
What I love about Vanilla are the quests that send you all over world trying to make sure you see everything.
---
Sure they might not be the most efficient thing to do, but I still feel like they're worth doing if you're just passing by and running into members of the other faction.
---
To elaborate on Vanilla was for everyone.
---
The hardcore got to walk around in Orgrimmar in epics and listen to the "oohs" and "aahs".  The casual would never reach that mark - AND THAT WAS OK.  This is a key difference that people don't focus on enough, casuals were fine without epics.  They had as much fun as they needed to leveling, questing, doing dungeons and pvp'ing.  In fact it gave them something to covet and look forward to.  I remember my first time seeing someone playing EQ, they were in a tree city of elves casting a spell with amazing particle effects.  I quit Diablo immediately and started playing EQ because i wanted what that person had.  In the modern game if a person can't raid and have epics then they aren't getting their money's worth (in their mind).
---
Part of this was a consequence of the time period in gaming.  People just didn't think they DESERVED epics as a casual.  I don't think we can walk this part back.  Too many games have developed over the years that have allowed casuals to experience end game content in some way (including retail WoW of course).
---
It is all about expectations, like most things in life.
---
Blizzard went after Nostalrius, and they have gone after many other servers. The big one still up are in countries where they can ignore Blizzard's legal challenges.  
---
Google their name and read what they said.  Sure they can answer your question, but they already did literally on their website (Why was Nostalrius taken down?).   Go read that.
---
I doubt it, because there are way bigger games on multiple platforms nowadays. 
---
Fortnite has 200m players, is free on more platforms, its going to be hard to take spotlight.
---
The way black lotus worked during actual vanilla is very different from how pservers do them. Back in the day the respawn was so long there wasn't enough spawning to support every guild using flasks. Pservers modified the spawn to match the increased population. Depending on how blizz decides to go about it, we could see even more expensive flasks. Talking 100g or more per black lotus.
---
Hunter. Viper sting enemies, get killed, win anyway.
---
You started playing at the wrong time this is why you have these feelings. Majority of the things introduced after Vanilla were poor no community feel. Vanilla was a true MMORPG feel one we all hope to experience again. There is so much to do in the game bring back fun you talk about raids and Battleground I remember the nights of let’s go raid storm wind or taking other city’s just for the fun. Lots of things to do gold has to be made for raiding the game in a nutshell is heaven to the true hardcore wow community.
---
Oh yeah well I’m playing 20 hours a day. Fucking normie 
---
Oh god yes please. I want my private single-player wow sandbox so bad. 
---
How hard can it be to make a repack?
---
that's akin to the well-known PvP tri-spec build, also known as "the swiss army knife of pissing people off", taken to it's logical extreme when playing troll, and something I'm also planning on playing, since classic shadow priest toolkit is a bit too limited for my taste. [the original looks something like this, though you can move points around.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGs0bZbhtZVMGdcp)
---
for leveling, well... I wouldn't actually recommend it, you'd be much better off with the good old 5/0/x build and respecing at 40 to shadowform. even when duo leveling, you don't actually need a healer spec, VE and bandages should be enough, with maybe the very occasional renew/greater heal.
---
Why is the man operating the gate controls yelling at someone else to open and close the gate?
---
Would you be willing to give advice (completely privately) to other people running private servers? It seems you guys solved the problems of having very large populations on one server. Would you ever (maybe anonymously) pass that on to benefit players?
---
While I don't care too much about it being exactly the way it originally was. I don't think trying to change it is a good idea at all. Even if I trusted Blizzard to do it well, if they start changing things the playerbase will be both mad and want their own favourite changes. 
---
Like I would like the group tool from retail added, where you list your group instead of spamming trade chat. So you can see each group currently forming and what they are missing and so on, and apply to whatever you want. But I know other people would be amazingly angry at such an addition, so I really don't want Blizzard to add it at the same time as I sort of want it myself. If they add that for me, then they are probably going to add some other person thing that I don't like, maybe quest markers on the minimap for example. 
---
So no changes it is, for sure. 
---
Except one change... a bigger quest log. Because I think if anyone is strongly against that they are just an idiot. 
---
For your race I pulled Raccoon which makes me think of Horde since a lot of people hold a negative connotation towards raccoons. As for which Horde I chose a second card which was armadillo which makes me think desert which makes me think Orc or Troll. For the third card I chose Skunk which makes me think Troll because just as the spray of a skunk keeps people back the tusks of the troll do the same.
---
For class I drew Grouse which is making me think of magic since they do the sacred dance. Magic would lead to mage, priest, or shaman, but something is drawing me more towards shaman. So I am going to say you should play a Troll Shaman.
---
Well screw you too.
---
Because large, heavy gates require more than one person to open. He's yelling at the guy at the second lever to operate with him.
---
Worst case server transfers will be possible. I know it’s classic because in classic half my guild left the other half for another server. Yup that’s when I learned online friends aren’t really your friends.
---
Well the players who like retail will try it then quit. However there is a huge group of players who stoped playing after wrath, It’s easily 10 million players. That’s who blizzard is after. They are not trying to pull people from retail, they are trying to recapture that group. They don’t need the current retail population to switch.,They need the players who quit to come back. 
---
lol ive been playing on and off since 2010 and still havent seen the right binding drop. the left one has been lonely in my bag since like 2012
---
For class I got butterfly which is known for its transformation, which makes me think of Druid.
---
For race I got Salmon which makes me think of the waters of the moonwells so I will say Night Elf Druid. I wasnt entirely certain so I drew another card which was bat which makes me think of the night of night elf.
---
So Night Elf Druid.
---
Na he’s fine if he goes right at lvl 1. Also needs to make sure to switch his hearth to telsrassil asap 
---
The ZG turned MC guild I first joined raided MC for a loooooong time and only ever saw 1 binding. 
---
I havent actually tried to program it to in game stuff yet, I’ll give it a test and let you know on that.  It has 6 buttons on the side, and 3 on the top.  The ones on the top are awesome, since they require a little bit more force to push (so no accidental presses) and they are positioned in a way I can just kinda rotate my finger a little and press them even during a left/right click. 
---
What was the process like reverse-engineering stats for NPCs, quests, etc? Did you ever make any massive guesses that players never seemed to realize was a guess?
---
I absolutely cannot wait to boot up the game for the first time, and be greeted by the Vanilla login screen with the vanilla login theme roaring into my ears... I bet I'll just sit there in awe for a couple of minutes, just to take in the experience properly!
---
After MC became soloable with a max level character, I began clearing it weekly (sometimes on multiple raid lockouts per week).  I went more than a year never seeing the eye of sulfuron drop.  It also took probably 8 months to get my first set of bindings.  Farming those items took so long that having enough arcanite/ingots was never a problem since I accumulated such an abundance over the time it took to get the drops.  I have 3 TF's and 3 hands of ragnaros (on different characters obviously).  I've got a couple of characters (My rogue being one) that I ran MC for a year and never got the second binding.  
---
Excited to be here and answer questions! Answers will start rolling out shortly!
---
You'll be running it very close... my honest advice: Go at level 1, do the quests until level six using only your starting spells, hearth back to elwynn, train your spells, and make the trek again. Making the run twice will be painful, but every bit of rep you lose is a lot more time in the long run. 
---
For class I chose Elk which is known for its strength and stamina so that makes me think you should play a tank. Which I am guessing is Warrior.
---
For race I chose Turtle. That makes me think Pandaren but you cant choose Pandaren unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it). Turtle is also known as the Earth Mother which makes me think of Tauren because I believe they worship the Earth Mother too.
---
So Tauren Tank, most likely Warrior but maybe Druid if you prefer bear form.
---
What are the 3 biggest issues the Blizzard team should take care of before launch? I'm talking the ones you received the most complaints and grief about.
---
What are you guys doing for a living irl? If you earned your money with Nostalrius before, what are you doing now? Has anyone of you had an offer in the industry after Nostalrius? 
---
I remember lots of "racial tension" on Nost, particularly Europeans vs Xaio's. Do you expect this to return in full force if Chinese Classic servers aren't released at US/EU launch?
---
Does Blizzard understand these sorts of challenges which were unique to the private server community?
---
Thanks for all your work and levelheadedness over the years.
---
Yeh sounds cool but can u add an option so I can play with rl friends 2
---
You need exalted with Darnassus to get the mount. It will not be possible to just do few quests and the buy it. If you really want it you are going to need about 500 stacks of Runecloth to go from friendly to exalted. [Here is the absolute xp per mob chart](https://i.imgur.com/y5z2aFg.jpg), so you can kill level 1 mobs as level 4 and still gain exp.
---
For class I chose Horse which makes me think of speed and one of the fastest classes is Hunter so hunter.
---
For race I chose racoon which makes me think of their nocturnalness which makes me think of Night Elf.
---
So night elf hunter. For pet I chose Owl which goes without saying. Night Elf Hunter with Owl pet. I hope that resonates with you.
---
ITT: Poorly disguised trolling
---
People here are sensitive.
---
I was not offered any role in development of Classic servers and I'm not aware of anyone from Nostalrius being offered a role. I considered applying for a role on the team but after talking through some of the preliminary questions with a Blizz recruiter that I reached out to on LinkedIn, I decided against applying. I have a pretty good life where I'm at right now and it would be a complete and utter upheaval of my life to pick up and move to Irvine to work on Classic - even if I ended up being accepted which is no guarantee.
---
Clearly not implies talking down to someone but whatever.  You win bro.
---
So you’d rather have thousands of people in a server que unable to play, and then thousands of people in the server also unable to play due to massive latency. It’s fucked both ways, and in my opinion, the option that lets people play the game they paid for is obviously going to be the better option until the tourists leave or they can iron out latency. 
---
For race I chose Lynx which makes me think of the cat mounts of Night Elves.
---
For class I chose Otter, but that made me think of alchemy since the pelts of otters were used to make medicine bags. So that is interesting, maybe herbalism and alchemy.
---
I chose another class card and got Crow which is known for its shadow, so that makes me think Priest, potentially Shadow priest.
---
So Night Elf Priest with the potential to heal or the potential to go Shadow.
---
I thought the panels were excellent and helped put to bed some of the fears I had in terms of their commitment and desire to replicate the game as best as possible. I have some concerns about the timeline as published and there are still outstanding questions that remain such as itemization that I feel are very important to recreating the vanilla world as best as possible.
---
I trust Ion to lead the process well. He has a huge love for Vanilla WoW and wants it to succeed in a big way.
---
Would you agree that, if sharding is used in Classic WoW, it will have a detrimental effect on community and the kill the feeling of immersion  - just as it has in live retail WoW?  
---
The main reason I quit WoW is that no one cares I exist now - and , likewise, I could care less about anyone else.  We are all basically NPCs to each other in this game now.   
---
I don’t want to play with anonymous ghosts that randomly appear/disappear around me.  I just want my old old game back where everyone knows everyone else and shares one world together - that was the authentic experience of Vanilla.  In fact, I would rather wait in queue to login - and be with everyone - than to login immediately and find myself with only a few dozen  people in my own sharded, isolated existence. 
---
Guessing Blizzard release dates is a fool's errand but I'm hoping for July/August!
---
Thanks for your response. :)
---
No, because one month of WoW will cost as much as a game that the kids are playing today. We had no choice back then, now they do.
---
idk what y'all talking about but i think i heard [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
So it's confirmed now boys
---
I was planning on that, but most likely I'll never continue working on this, because as I said in the video, I couldn't really publish this, even as a non-commerical fangame, due to copyright issues :\\
---
I'm not currently working on the Dev team and there are no plans for me to be working on the Dev team. I will be playing the crap out of it though! 
---
Will never happen.  But you should try Project 1999
---
For class I picked Black Panther so something from the shadows which makes me think Rogue.
---
For race I chose Opossum which makes me think Undead since they play dead.
---
So Undead Rogue.
---
The people who quit after Wrath didn't necessarily quit because they dislike the game but because their responsibilities in life took precedence. I'd say that the vast majority of my friends (who are now in their late twenties to early 40s) from back in the Vanilla-WOTLK days still love WoW but don't play it because they simply can't.
---
Most of my old WoW friends stopped because they had kids or moved out of their parents places, or went from part-time work to full time work. It's a massive stretch to think that the players who used to play are somehow going to come back, most people quit back then because WoW had run its course in that part of their lives.
---
Peoples children and jobs don't suddenly disappear because Classic WoW releases, and even if a desire to play it exists that doesn't mean these people will find the time to play it long term.
---
A difficult question to answer really because I don't know the ins and outs of the other server's administrations. For Nostalrius, both Viper and Daemon are living in France, which is a place with stricter copyright laws and a place where Blizzard holds a HQ's so they have a stronger claim to their copyrights. Ultimately, they were put in a much higher place of legal jeopardy that the majority of other server's administrations that I""m aware of. 
---
Secondly, Nostalrius always was intended to be a place for people to play classic wow because we believe that it was a piece of gaming history that deserved preservation and players should have the option to play today. When we shutdown, we turned our. attention back to Blizzard to push for that preservation and opportunity.
---
Lastly, other servers seem to exist for the purposes of using Blizzard's IP for personal profit. We did not. There is a bigger incentive for those servers to stay online.
---
I've played original Vanilla WoW, retail WoW (spotty since MoP though) and p-servers.  Subscription fee was never an issue with me.  No one I ever encountered on p-servers indicated that they were there because of cost issues.  In fact, everyone I discussed it with would happily pay a sub fee to Blizzard for Classic WoW.
---
I've met and spoke with A LOT of people about this over the years.  I firmly believe that for the large majority cost is not a factor at all.  I'm sure there are some who can't afford a sub fee.  I'm sure there are gold farmers that might be dissuaded by a sub fee.  They're in the minority though.
---
I've heard the sub fee argument, but based on my experiences I think it is overblown.
---
How vulnerable in terms of exploiting/cheating are certain Vanilla WoW features like spell batching, Warden and the API itself?
---
The initial C&amp;D's were issues through the server host but, without getting into too much detail, I had a Private Investigator knock at my front door at home at 9:30pm and serve me a C&amp;D.
---
Hi guys! Let's imagine you are all hired by Blizzard to make Classic, what do you do? Exactly the same as Nostalrius, or you would change things? Also why trolls are da best?
---
For class I chose Dragonfly which immediately made me think of Shaman due to the colorfulness and mystique of that class and the colorfulness of Dragonfly.
---
For race I chose Porcupine which makes me think of their quills that keep enemies away, which makes me think Troll since they keep people away with their tusks.
---
I just meant the resilience stat. I'm all for multiple ways of getting gear and making them able to compete.
---
And I should have been more clear, I am just talking about TBC. You couldn't use either set outside of what it was meant for, and I hated that. It was a double gear grind. 
---
Thanks for taking the time to do an AMA! It's always cool to see the inner workings of projects like this!
---
There are a lot of posts on this sub from people who expect/think/hope that classic will be far bigger than blizzard expects it to be. Was Nost like that for yall? Did yall guess thousand or 2 players and get far more or did yall anticipate the huge crowd that showed up?
---
Blizzard has stated their intention to add sharding and loot trading to classic, both for (IMO) understandable reasons. How many players where on for nosts launch? Do you think sharding would have made the experience better?
---
For loot trading, I anticipate yalls experience would be very different from Blizzards. With Blizzard, they have "everyone" who plays WoW, the enfranchised poopsocker to the super casual hour a weeker. They would undoubtedly have received tons of GM requests from the less hardcore crowd who didn't understand entirely how the loot systems of WoW worked, while the enfranchised players "got" what it was and used it accordingly, which is who would have mostly played Nost (though I'm sure there were plenty of casuals too). Did yall get a lot of GM requests for loot trading? Did the team ever discuss anything about possible solutions, or did you just go with the "tough luck" stance? 
---
Following up on the last "question"; what was the greatest ninja looting on the server? was it some sick epic recipe? Someone nab a binding shard?
---
Did yall ever start to think about "post Vanilla" content? Did the team have an opinion on whether to go to "Vanilla TBC" or "TBC but with changes to keep it close to vanilla" or "Lets make up new sick content"?
---
What was your favorite piece of music from the Vanilla OST? Did the team have a song that pumped everyone up?
---
Thanks for your time, and hope to see you in Classic!
---
No. We released our information due to our understanding at the time that Blizzard had abandoned the idea of developing classic because they refused to speak about it during that year's Blizzcon. We had been hoping to hear that some progress was made and when nothing was said, we felt that releasing that information would at least give the community a place to play in the meantime. After launch, it became clear to us that we were mistaken and V&amp;D attempted to stuff things back in the box but ultimately that wasn't possible. 
---
Beautiful
---
Reppin' the old faction/race/class again, and I'll probably even break out the chips and Mountain Dew and relive my ~~glory days~~ childhood snacks. 
---
This is the type of hard hitting journalism /r/classicwow is known for. My answer would be no.
---
Can we get a link to all the previous Classy Friday threads when we get these? It will be very useful for newcomers to keep track.
---
Personally I'd love to see Lotus go back to BoP.
---
My favorite exchange was when we were discussing Onyxia and our development of the raid. Ion asked us how we scripted her Deep Breath mechanic in phase 2. We described our coding and then I asked if that's how it worked and they all laughed and said no. I followed that up with "Well are you going to tell us how it worked then?" and they laughed again and said no. Ion then said the first thing he did when he got hired was look up how Deep Breath worked.
---
I don't have any idea of schedules for alpha/beta or how they'll do itemization. I did have a short email chain with Ion after Blizzcon where we chatted about a couple different things and I have some idea of how they think when they make design decisions for Classic but out of respect for him, I'll keep the content of those conversations private for now.
---
I pulled spider for race which makes me think of the creepiness of the Undead starting area.
---
For class I chose Salmon which makes me think of water which mages can conjure.
---
So Undead Mage which I know is not one you listed but maybe it is what you are meant to play.
---
It is possible to get exalted with Darnassus by level 40 (or so), people have done it before. It just takes doing every quest possible at the appropriate level, not just "a few".
---
Anyone have a link or post describing PVP basics against each classes? I've spent a 1-35 as enh and never really felt that I could hold my own. I either get outranged (hunters, mages, spriest) or eaten by a class I'm unable to kite (gnome warriors. Always gnomes warriors). Tried both 2h and rolling with a shield.
---
Also looking on advice for ele as I've rcently respecced to give that a shot.  I seem to do well against casters (thank you grounding and tremor totem) but again I keep getting eaten by gnome warriors. Don't know how to deal with people I can't lock down.
---
The answer to 2 is stream delay, or roll PvE.
---
True, however there is an other subset of the group who quit because of game design changes.   I’m not saying they will get a majority of those players back, but if they can get 20-30% back, I think that is realistic, that would amount to 2-3 million players. 
---
Well, I have had a lot more time for my real life job and my family. I'm married, have had an additional kid since Nostalrius shut down. Bought a house, got a promotion, turned 30. Basically, life moves on. 
---
I may have killed KT at some point though ;)
---
I think it's a possibility and I think it could be interesting eventually but I just want the clean Vanilla MC-&gt;Naxx experience for a good long while.
---
For class I chose Grouse which makes me think magic. For race I chose Black Panther which makes me think of the darkness of the Night Elves. So that leads me to think Druid Night Elf.
---
Is it possible for Blizzard to give us a true Vanilla experience working back from 7.3.5 or are there going to be modern remnants in Classic?
---
I hope that development continues onto TBC. 
---
Streams are important for advertising and marketing but they're not a special class of people. If they want to avoid being streamsniped, there will be PvE server options available to them. If they choose to pick PvP and then get streamsniped, they will have to look inwardly to how they deal with those things. The game's GM staff can't be expected to have one set of rules for 99% of players and then another set of rules for streamers.
---
If we're honest, private servers will always exist. They existed as early as 2006. Some people will justify playing on them by saying they can't afford the subscription, or Blizzard is bad and they can't justify giving them money, or Classic disappoints them in some way so they play private servers instead. And then there are those people who want to play TBC or WotLK or Cata or whatever. They have no option to play that version of WoW either.
---
I do wish that private servers would cease operation now that Classic is announced though.
---
Gnome rogue is the most savage thing in wow. Too much even for me.
---
I do have some design concerns. The main one I have is itemization, in terms of what items will be available at what time and what their stats are at certain points in the game. If 1.10 dungeon items (such as Diana's Pearl or the turban from Drakkisath) are available at the outset, power levels of players will go up by a lot. MC/BWL are pretty easy as it is and making it easier is a concern for me. 
---
Sharding is something that I believe is a necessary evil for launch and the starting zones. Packing thousands of players into small locations is not something that these clients and servers are built to handle and sharding will help alleviate these issues. That said, sharding is antithetical to Vanilla WoW and if it extends past the starter zones/launch then I think it's a HUGE deal.
---
Apparently so [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28uB4ym6TCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28uB4ym6TCM).
---
We made a number of mistakes in terms of itemization and items being released that I wished we could have fixed and/or rolled back. We also just didn't have the manpower necessary to keep up with our intended timeline. As a player you expect all the work is being put toward fixing bugs or developing new content when the reality is that you spend most of your time finding and dealing with exploits and cheaters, gold sellers, and server issues. 
---
For class I chose Elk which makes me think of strength and stamina which leads me to Tank/Warrior. For race I chose Salmon which makes me think of fishing which makes me think of the Tauren fishing villages of Mulgore.
---
So Tauren Warrior.
---
I'd like, especially if you can't clear raids, but with a world progression where you find that an adventurer's guild have slain Ragnaros and stuff like that, in which you are not the main character, but you live in the same world and you are subject of the consequences of those events 
---
"That name is already taken"
---
For class I chose Grouse which makes me think of the magic of mages. For race I chose Frog which makes me think of murlocs and thr murlocs make me think of the human starting area of Elwynn Forest, so Human Mage.
---
Holy shit dude that's what I plan an maining.
---
I'm blown away, good job
---
To be fair, the Mountain Dew in Europe is completely different than the Dew here in America. I have had both and its night and day difference. Not that I drink a lot of Mt Dew anymore. 
---
That's based off of private servers using the TBC rep values, it most likely won't be possible in classic wow.
---
You nailed it
---
For me, I work in sales. My company works in office technology including copiers/VOIP/managed IT. I did that before working on Nostalrius and continued after. Shameless plug, if you live in DC and want to buy a copier, hit me up! :D
---
I live near Bethesda Game Studio's HQ and Zenimax's studios where they work on ESO. I have a good friend from High School that has been the QA lead for Fallout Shelter and I reached out to him after Nostalrius's shutdown about some of the opportunities that existed within the company. The openings they had were technical in nature and I didn't have the qualifications for what they had open at the time when I was considering applying. Since then I've settled deeper into my role at my company.
---
Cool idea man :D
---
Fun 
---
Im leaving my girlfriend and our 2 kids, quitting my job, and moving back into my dads old box room. 
---
Vanilla raids weren't hard because of game it's because playerbase sucked. Raids in vanilla are never going to be hard. Get over it.
---
For race I chose Moose and their antlers make me think of the horns of Tauren. For class I chose Hawk which makes me think of sharp eye of the Hunter. For pet I chose Alligator so your pet should be Crocolisk. I hope that helps!
---
Things definitely got better in BC and Wrath. There were tweaks but the core gameplay didn’t completely change in the first 2 expansions.  
---
The same with sarcasm, sometimes I really wonder what kind of person you are if you can't detect sarcasm. 
---
I've been thinking about this and I think it comes down to issues of availability.  If I want to play Mario 3 I can pop in the cartridge and play. I can reinstall Diablo 2 and play any time I want.  WoW you can't just play the old game.  I have my WoW discs but I can't just install and go to town, it's locked away and I can't get to it. That changes the nature of things in ways I can't explain.
---
Also unlike other games WoW is still an active game. The expansions have turned it into a different game but at the same time it's still WoW.  There aren't many games that are 14 years old that get new content.  That changes how people view it too.
---
They haven't initiated any contact with me or anyone on the team as far as I'm aware. Nostalrius was a fun project but Blizzard has so much more experience in terms of MMO development and management. My general advice would be get Classic as close to the original Vanilla experience as possible. I may have voiced a specific design concern to Ion directly though...
---
I really like Ion a lot. In my conversations with him, he's always thoughtful and articulate and explains his position well. I know there is backlash against him now because of BFA stuff but I've always enjoyed my interactions with him. My impression is that they want to make Classic as close to Vanilla WoW as possible, quirks and all.
---
Love you too. &lt;3
---
Awesome questions, I will try to answer them without getting too deep into game design jargon.
---
1-  Although we never encouraged toxicity or griefing within the world, we only interfered in extreme circumstances such as when the /ignore feature was being circumvented. As for griefing, that was part of the vanilla experience... Even I have been camped by a level 60 undead rogue for multiple hours in redridge. Smack talk and corpse camping are part of the experience, and we did not want to take that away from returning players or newer ones. 
---
2-  I had multiple level 60 characters on pvp and pve realms, although most of my time was spent from a staff account trying to make the server better. As for abuse, we had several layers of security and checks to deter any form of staff account abuse. We had a zero tolerance policy for corruption or abuse of power. Only Admins &amp; GMs had power on the live servers and GM powers were heavily restricted. There were a couple of GMs with limited power who tested it, but were quickly banned and removed from staff. 
---
3- Nano will answer (I currently do not hate the live game and see so much room for improvement)
---
4-  I am a big believer that a game is never finished, there are always things to add or tweak. Vanilla in particular could have been a much better experience for some players with the addition of more quests or a couple more instances; however, I would have liked to see unfinished zones completed with more story behind it. 
---
5- Nano will answer
---
Raised in a guild that cleared all of Naxx, our core of 30ish was together since the beginning and we didn’t have issues with people leaving with bindings. We only ever got a single Thunderfury, and we were half way done with Naxx when we got it. 
---
Nah, there will be horde-side servers of every type. There might be a very slight overall Alliance sway because it's known that they're the best in PvE going in, but PvE is easy anyway and most Vanilla players  aren't going to roll one faction specifically for very minor PvE gains. You'll be fine bud.
---
Even if you roll on a 30/70 horde/ally server you'll be fine.
---
3. Each person's peak will be different but for me, vanilla is the peak. In terms of BFA today, the biggest issue I have is itemization and specifically warforging/titanforging. What I loved about early expansions is that there were always specific items that you would be going after and you knew the names of. Choker of the Fire Lord, Dark Edge of Insanity, etc. I couldn't tell you a single item name in BFA today.
---
5. My main concern is regarding itemization and when certain items will be made available in the timeline and what stats they'll have on it at that time.
---
Troll. 
---
Wayback archive and I were BFF's. I have no idea how much time I spent trolling through wayback archive and through 240p videos from 2005. Basically, we didn't change anything unless we could prove it should be that way. 
---
A good example would be herbs in Dire Maul East. We had massive inflation issues with the cost of herbs and consumables and players started exploring more. Some evidence exists that DME should have a black lotus spawn but we couldn't confirm where they were supposed to be, how often they spawned, or if it was a TBC addition because the comments were near 2.0 release and during TBC beta phase.
---
OP: “I have a hope” “I would love”

Every one on this sub:

oh no man, you haven’t considered _______.

No way man because __________.

Do you even know ___________.
---
Love how everyone commenting here has done market research and knows this won’t happen.
---
I’m with you OP
---
There is no mage trainer in Teldrassil, so that's not really gonna help much D:  
---
    
---
I would rather skip it, level normally until 20+ at least and just farm a little extra runecloth or gold to make up for it.
---
For race I chose Antelope which makes me think of Barrens. I chose another card which was Ant which makes me think of the smallest horde race which is Undead.
---
For class I chose Dolphin which are known for their Intelligence and also Water which makes me think of Mage.
---
So Undead Mage. I hope that helps!
---
A perfect 7 out of 10
---
Sweet!
---
There is no forgiveness only pain 
---
Sweet! Yours was pretty easy and came to me right away.
---
I'm not. I think the biggest issue for private server veterans is separating their experience on private servers from the original game or classic. We know it won't be the exact same but Blizzard has access to the original content and database. They have the capability of recreating Vanilla WoW to a much larger degree than we ever did or would. 
---
In Vanilla - only Blizzard knows exactly how that worked. I got 1 binding on my first Garr kill and then killed Geddon 40+ times before the second was in my hands. There are people I know that farmed it even twice as long and no drop. its basically RNG and I wish you all the best.
---
I could indeed Google it. 
---
Nice. Gnome Warrior is fun too. I mostly picked up something fun, so I was trying to think of what I had the most fun in in classic Wow. But I think Gnomes are kind of silly and goofy which makes sense with the otter card that came up too.
---
Na he has 2 do it the real way. No scrubs permitted
---
Huntard is perfect 4 u
---
That's true, but that doesn't mean that this strategy isn't worth doing if you want the mount. Training is the more expensive part of buying a mount, so there's no reason you couldn't get your own racial mount at 40 and then buy the Darnassus mount for another less than 10 gold later. Assuming that doing literally every darnassus quest at the appropriate level doesn't put a human character at exalted before 60, that still puts you WAY under "500 stacks of runecloth" away from your mount.

Did someone say Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?!
---
I think a healthy skepticism is good but in general I think the online gaming community as a whole is pretty toxic and tends to self-immolate. The hate towards Blizzard now may have some roots in truth and honest feedback but my perception is that it's turned into this all consuming hate monster that is ultimately hurtful and counter productive. 
---
In terms of fears for classic wow, we've only gotten a small taste of the work they've done. I'm of the opinion we take a wait and see approach and voice constructive feedback the next time we get our hands on content.
---
Totems totems totems!

https://youtu.be/q5mD1n4v2JA
---
Current WoW is single player...
---
My understanding is that there are repacks online you can find...
---
Discuss the repercussions of playing an MMO in hindsight.  Or how Classic while being the same game will be something new because MMOs, like music, are fused in time and the communities around it.  Classic could be patch for patch, but it will be a drastically different experience from Vanilla.  
---
Rogue-buster. Got it.
---
Legit troll post but what is funnier is that a lot of poor souls really think they will get legendaries, scarab lord, let alone clear naxx when classic launches lol
---
I've voiced my opinion on sharding in another question but the short answer for that would be I think it's a necessary evil and want it to be limited to starter zones at launch at most.
---
For loot trading, I understand why they would want this to implement this because I don't think they can staff enough GM's to deal with loot issues individually. I think it has a lot of side effects though that concern me a lot.
---
A week to 60.  A week to r14.  Top kek troll post.

Thanks for the level-headed answer man. Love you and rest of the team, had a blast back in the nost days &lt;3
---
Value is a huge part for me. In vanilla things had value witch actualy makes you care and invest, and then enjoy the game much more. 
---
Social value (You as an indevidual actualy had an impact on the world, and others. And it matters what you do and how you behave.)
---
Item value (Because of the time invested, the rareity and a actual identity of items. Because of no transmog, rare items had stronger visual value, when everyone is running around with transmoged epic gear and with the previous stated reasons aswell, no one rly sticks out, when your in a city players are just a huge soup of colors and shapes.)
---
"Time and Difficulty value" (The value of relieing on eachother, the value in upgrades becouse of a world that is actualy punsihing, the impact of mounts etc.)
---
Economy value ( A much stronger value of gold, resources, crafting, items etc.)
---
When things take longer, or are considered dificault the value of things are actualy recognised. So if you then reach a goal, or achiev something its much more fulfilling.
---
If things takes a short amount of time, and are less difficult to achiev and is recognised as such then the value is extremely low. And if the gameplay is lacking, watered down, repetitiv, and alot of the social aspect is rooted out etc whats the point?. 
---
The way the game is designed today is not only less fun and fulfilling imo, but it has backed itself in a corner. It relies on systems, minigames in a repetitive manner, and is constntly in need of new content to keep people intrested and engaged. And everything needs to be controlled and balanced, witch just leads to less fun creativity. The game will never truly be balanced anyways, and wow imo should never be catered towards esports in that way. There are already games that does and will always do this much better like Leauge of Legends, CS etc. What i really want is a truly worthy MMORPG lable back. I really hope Classic WoW will be extremely succesfull and shape the future of games, and the understanding of what made vanilla WoW so good.
---
Lol sorry this got really ranty.
---
Barrens chat was my life.
---
That’s why I’ll be horde 
---
It will be interesting no matter what happens.  I’m eager to see how it all plays out.  Good and bad.
---
Hello guys - I would like to say thank you for all the ahrd work you did on Nost and really, the only question I have is what can I do to show my support and love for what you did for the community? give money to a charity, dedicate something in your name, let me know - have a wonderful #YearOfClassicWoW
---
This is the motivation for the post.  I'm sick of seeing people talk about their plans after they're decked out in full T3.  Dude you won't get full T1, might not even get full epic.  After months of raiding, you'll have a mishmash of random gear from different raids, MAYBE a BiS or TWO.  
---
They said they'll only be using sharding for launch. The start areas will feel packed. You aren't gonna be alone
---
I don't know /u/trashlordx2 - some people still care about us.
---
What other games have you played that scratched that same itch that Vanilla did? Wildstar? Dwarf Fortress? Solitaire?
---
Did you or the team hate any vanilla mechanic and really want to change it but couldn't because it wasn't "True" to the experience?
---
I'm of the opinion that, if Classic succeeds, it could have a big impact on the design of future games (and I sorely hope that its not just every company re releasing old versions of their shitty games). Do you think so?
---
What is your favorite raid of WoWs? Doesn't have to be from Vanilla, and if it is, whats your favorite non-vanilla raid?
---
Follow-up: How did Nost manage to have literally 15K+ players online at a time on a single server? Assuming you made modifications to game/code in some way, couldn't something similar be done to allow that kind of pop onto Classic servers (albeit, Classic runs on 7.3.5 and not 1.12.1). Just asking from a technical standpoint, not from a "would it be fun to play on a crowded server" standpoint.
---
Two holes because a cylinder has two end points. The fact that the straw is hollow inside is irrelevant.
---
Rogue. Pick your fights and more room for error. Hunter seems like the obvious choice but it's an easy class to be lazy/bad with.
---
Honestly Vanilla PvP is pretty simple to pick up and play. All three of those classes are still effective even if you aren't that familiar with it. Doesn't take a genius to figure out how stunlocking as a rogue works, how to press your macro button as a 3 minute mage, or how to sit in the back and fire away at people wearing cloth as a hunter.
---
That's one of the things that makes Vanilla PvP so fun. There's a low barrier to entry for it.
---
-75 on your scale is like a 2.14 on mine. So I'll go with 2.16.
---
Quests is easy.
---
- Character_Level &lt;= Quest_Level +  5 : Quest_XP = (100 %)
---
- Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  6 : Quest_XP = ( 80 %)
---
- Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  7 : Quest_XP = ( 60 %)
---
- Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  8 : Quest_XP = ( 40 %)
---
- Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  9 : Quest_XP = ( 20 %)
---
- Character_Level &gt;= Quest_Level + 10 : Quest_XP = ( 10 %)
---
If quest level is 6 levels below your character, it's gray. Simple example: Digging Through The Ooze in Wetlands quest that everyone hates. Available at 19, and because its quest level is 24, it doesn't turn gray until 30 - so full XP between 19 and 29, that's a WIDE range.
---
Mob gray value is different, It's based on a value called "Zero Difference'
---
- ZD =  5, when Char Level =  1 -  7
---
- ZD =  6, when Char Level =  8 -  9
---
- ZD =  7, when Char Level = 10 - 11
---
- ZD =  8, when Char Level = 12 - 15
---
- ZD =  9, when Char Level = 16 - 19 
---
- ZD = 11, when Char Level = 20 - 29
---
- ZD = 12, when Char Level = 30 - 39
---
- ZD = 13, when Char Level = 40 - 44
---
- ZD = 14, when Char Level = 45 - 49
---
- ZD = 15, when Char Level = 50 - 54
---
- ZD = 16, when Char Level = 55 - 59
---
With ZD being "how many levels below you is the mob gray" So looking at the first line, the first grey you'll see is a level 1 when you hit 6.
---
I think I put too much explanation to say "**going to Teldrassil when you're 4 is fine**" If you run to NE starting zone, every mob will give XP (though lower), and even the earliest starting quest will give full XP until level 7.
---
I plan on playing a human and rushing to Teldrassil at level 5 (hit menethil harbor at level 5 in about 52 minutes - zone into Darnassus at an hour)
---
You'll be fine at 4.
---
Priest, obviously.
---
You'll have to ask Ion. @watcherdev on Twitter
---
My hunter should have it in a few weeks.
---
I always find this quote very interesting. We know from the interviews with Kevin Jordan that the terrible balance of Vanilla was never something they intended, and was something they were aware of and trying to fix. We know from busshock incident (which was in 2006) that they had to shift a lot of their development resources to TBC and put OG WoW on the backburner. Because they didn't want to have to balance the new classes against the old, they decided to wait until they could release them all when they were ready at the same time (which they did in the prepatch released in Decemeber), a full month before TBC. 
---
So we actually know the judgments of the developers of the time - namely; the balance is bad, we want to fix it, and we're going to fix the problems with the classes all at the same time in the pre-patch. 
---
Yet this statement is taken to be strongly saying "we're not going to make any changes." But that of course IS substituting in modern judgment to solve those problems. If he actually wanted to respect the judgment of the developers 12 years ago, he WOULD probably have to make balance changes, and use the prepatch, not 1.12 as the base. 
---
So I find it rhetorically pretty interesting - in order for it to actual prove the point that Ion seemingly meant to make, one has to retcon what the developers actually wanted.
---
As they explained at the Blizzcon Panel, working backwards from 7.3.5 lets them see their work in real time. It's certainly possible modern remnants make their way into classic but if the demo response is any indication, our community will do our best to hold them accountable to those remnants.
---
Rogue gives you the luxury of picking your fights with whoever you want, not to mention that you beat almost every class 1v1 anyway and aren't too gear dependent like some other classes. And when you eventually pick the wrong guy you can just kidney shot sprint away and stealth off to safety. 
---
What guild did You play for ?
---
Lol have you tried Island Expeditions?  They are so fun and should keep you subbed until classic!  /s
---
As many of those people with bindings should try and run their own MC pugs at that point
---
I don't know if we ever actually hit 15k concurrent but a lot of your answers to technical questions can be found in our post mortem: http://bfrontz.net/Nostalrius_post_mortem.pdf
---
Clearly you dont play orc 
---
Reminds me of nihilum (I believe?). As far as I remember they didn't even have a single warglsive set when swp came out even though they had the world first bt kill. 
---
I did one and got scurvy 
---
It should. And the armor is nice for bear in any case.
---
Since the beginning I wouldn't say that we had a # of people goal, I would say our goal was to deliver and authentic vanilla experience to players who had not been there and players who were there. When a huge crowd did show up, it was scary at first but everyone quickly overcame that and became a stronger team because of it.   
---
Nost launch was not enjoyable to many people, myself included. Servers were stressed and over worked, in game was barely playable, and another multitude of problems. The idea of sharding at launch is something that takes away from the core premise of the game but for the stability of being able to actually play the game. Its a hard tradeoff and a much harder decision to make.

Loot trading was one of the very few policies that Nostalrius differed from Blizzard. Back in Vanilla if you requested to trade an item from a GM, they would do so. On Nostalrius due to the concern of GM &amp; player abuse we chose to not offer that feature. There were also other concerns regarding our policy but I won't go into them. Now with that said, we did get a lot of requests to loot trade. I cannot remember the exact statistic, but loot trading tickets were roughly 1/4th of the tickets we received from max level characters. We had several internal discussions on how to allow loot trading from our view, but none seemed reasonable enough to warrant the amount of extra work it would make for the GM team, thus our "tough luck" policy.   
---
The greatest ninja looting on the server is a rough one, I would say there were several big ones, but probably the biggest was when a "pug" got assist and used a macro to kick all of the raid members right as a boss was killed. We quickly patched this from happening again. Here's a video of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD2clwk8eyA  
---
We did want to progress into TBC; however, that was a overwhelmingly large task that would have taken time. We never had any thought of delivering our own take on the game, we were all very much believers in delivering an authentic blizzard experience.   
---
Gnomeregon music was my favorite, it fit very well.

They went from having morally grey areas to being cartoonishly evil.

Hold on, let me get my paypal account.... Just kidding.
---
Appreciate all the kind words and heart behind your question. My answer would be to simply enjoy Classic WoW! It's the culmination of our work and petition to Blizzard and ultimately a fulfillment of my desire to work on Nostalrius to begin with.
---
Is that true with warriors? I would think the extra weapon skill would be better. That's assuming axes of course.
---
&gt; You need exalted with Darnassus to get the mount. It will not be possible to just do few quests and the buy it
---
?
---
But by following OP's plan, you can get exalted at level 38-42
---
Tyrael and Ithlien have been working on this answer for like 30 minutes... It's coming soon!
---
I never played a shaman in Classic.
---
What are people’s thoughts on race selection.
---
My end game goals would be a mix of casual PvP and pugging raids in world chat.
---
I fully agree, I hate how many games nowadays give streamers special treatment and ban people for killing them. The issue can be solved by simply delaying the stream.
---
rogue for sure. the most faceroll class in vanilla by quite a margin. you are safe in stealth, you open, you do you combo, you out. thats all you need to do. and its very effective.
---
mage and hunter are first of all  ranged, which makes things more complicated. positioning, juggle cc, cast times and so on. its much more complicated.
---
though pom pyro mage is a honorable mention aswell.
---
WoW is always my home whether it's Nostalrius or retail. I also play Civ VI, played a lot of PUBG, Hearthstone. 
---
The one vanilla system I think is just bad game design is the pvp ranking system. It's just not healthy in-game or IRL.
---
My favorite raid is Naxxramas, vanilla.
---
I was just reading casually enjoying the story, Then It got to Google chrome I stopped like a deer in the headlights
---
Is there any world where I answer this and people then don't assume that guild got favorable treatment?
---
I answered this in another question, but I will summarize. Blizzard has said they may use sharding strictly for the launch of the servers to provide a better starting experience.
---
Nost launch was not enjoyable to many people, myself included. Servers were stressed and over worked, in game was barely playable, and another multitude of problems. The idea of sharding at launch is something that takes away from the core premise of the game but for the stability of being able to actually play the game. Its a hard trade off and a much harder decision to make.  
---
Ye its bullsht it took me 6 years for my first thunderfury and 4 runs for my second one..
---
This is actually fascinating. So most likely nobody outside of Blizzard actually knows how the mechanic works?
---
I imagine there are a ton of other things that are pure guesswork that we won't find out until classic launches, everything from mechanics to spawn rates to NPC stats. Do any major ones come to mind?
---
I think that if you managed to have so many players online without sharding, it shouldn't be a problem for Blizzard.
---
Some ppl just want to see The World burn :D
---
Anyway thanks for your Amazing Work 
---
The biggest hidden thing that we dealt with is armor/resistance values for bosses. The WoW atlas has some values for these things for regular world mobs but the information on what armor or resistance values specific bosses should have is a complete mystery. The only piece of solid information I found was a screenshot of a hunter using Beast Lore on Maexxna: http://www.kurai.com/wow/naxx/maexxna.jpg
---
There is no way of knowing if 3731 is just the armor for Maexxna or the armor value for all bosses.
---
Just instinctively there is no geographic area with this type of land mass that appears to be either a span between two continents with oceans on either side or a peninsula surrounded by an ocean.
---
We could narrow it down by looking at the sun's position. We don't know if it's setting or rising but it's east or west either way. Even with that information in mind I can't think of any place where it is even remotely similar with what also looks like a harbor of some sort.
---
It was probably created with no real zone in mind. Still my favorite loading screen though. 
---
which race and class are you guys going to play when classic finally releases?
---
How will the patch-bunches and 1.12 itemization implicate the longevity of the game?
---
Every expansion made the world smaller. In classic you had two full continents. BC was just outland, Wrath was just Northrend, and so on. Classic was a huge world and with only ground travel the world was much bigger
---
I would love a classic styled wow 2 or additional content done right in classic. It’s like, just give up and try again.
---
I need a 6 hour version
---
Politely I don’t think so. OSRS did this a while back. It was quite successful
---
May I join your eventual guild in the new classic wow server? =)
---
Also, thank you for opening up a door to lose many MORE hours in the barrens.
---
If the content is easy and you have to wait 6 months before the next content bundle, I think it hurts a lot. There were 12 patches in Vanilla, I would prefer at least more than 4.
---
FYI and IIRC, according to John Staats, Onyxia's Deep Breath is essentially random (as random as a RNG can be).
---
u/NanoNostalrius
---
I'll be a Gnome Warlock. If you're an UD rogue, I already hate you.
---
Lol
---
Troll shaman it is I guess😂
---
See you in classic.  I look forward to my wind fury totem from you. 
---
When I still played WoW, I went back and did MC like, three times and got both parts. Same with Ashes of Al'ar, must've been two or three runs. I'm *really* not a farmer, and have no interest in actually having these things (I declined the Invincible mount because they weren't account wide at that point and I was on an alt helping for the first Heroic kill); just bored and drunk and decided to go fist my way through some old instances at level 90 or so because why not.
---
Wow that's amazing that you guys managed to do so much with so little info. Amazing detective work all around too btw.
---
Naxx will be cleared in a couple days tops. Dreamstate got server first on Anathema after like 48 hours iirc.  
---
None of the raids will last more than a couple of days :p
---
Not so much market research, but just looking at any sort of mmo-news over the last couple of years can tell you what state the mmo-genre is in right now.        
---
It's far from as popular as it was in the past, hardcore ones even less.      
---
And that's with more accessibility to computers/internet in general and gaming being more common for people.          
---
I'd personally love a game similar to classic but not in the warcraft universe to be successful, it's just highly unlikely.
---
Yes. Go all in 31 to Mortal strike then you can go cruelty and then go from there where you want. 
---
Personally ill max out axe, then 2 handed spec, and 5/5 tact mastery since I will be tanking and I use intercept a lot
---
Vanilla. Not private server. MC pugs weren't really an overly successful venture on most servers back then
---
That's what I'm about
---
That's kind of my point though. A lot of the retail players are certainly not going to play very much classic, they'll still have access to it from their retail sub. So I imagine a huge amount of the current retail sub base will still play it and then drop it, which will contribute to a potential large drop in active players.
---
Do you have a source for the 15-20 million people who had subs from start of wow to wrath? [Looks like](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/1241945255815773287.png) 8.5 million at bc launch, 11.5 million at wrath launch, 12 million at cata launch, but I couldn't find any info on total unique players or how much churn/turnover there was per year.
---
Admittedly though, I hadn't realize how fucking tiny the current retail base is, 1.7 million not including china.
---
So I guess the question is how many of the old vanilla-wrath players are going to want 15 bucks to give classic another spin. If it's large enough, you're right that it'll dwarf the big group of ~1 mil retail players who start and quit
---
That’s an amazing story :) I’m coming to like Ion more and more as I learn about him... he’s stern but passionate.
---
can you describe, in your experience, the greatest under-the-hood differences between private servers and the true vanilla WoW? in other words, specifically which gameplay elements/mechanics are only guesses/approximations of the true Blizzard experience?
---
There was never 15-20 million concurrent subs. I don’t remember the  source but years ago I read something about the total unique player population from  vanilla to wrath was somewhere north of 20 million. 
---
I’d say if they could get 25-30% back that’d be a huge success. 
---
Being able to get the drop on an unsuspecting opponent is a huge advantage in PVP. 
---
Thoughts on how to tackle balancing as the game progresses? For example, when Naxx rolls around, should Blizzard be doing balance hotfixes etc that they didn't think of or didn't get round to doing back in the day? It seems weird to think that if they KNOW an issue is going to pop up, it being just a matter of time, they can't fix it because their predecessors didn't fix it. There were probably plenty of minor broken things right before TBC was launched, for example! 
---
What race/class combo will you be rolling come summer? ;)
---
Or you can run your normal Shadow spec and just choose not to enter Shadowform when you think you want to play a hybrid role?
---
That's the joke, didnt actually prevent him from playing... I think
---
you'll sit there when servers crash
---
Is there anything in the classic game more imposing than a tauren warrior?
---
Love it. Any pointers on how you exported the assets?
---
Do quests lock you out when you outlevel them? I thought the little ! no longer appeared but you can still grab them. Or do they just no longer award rep if they're grey?
---
Hi! Thanks for the feedback!
---
If I remember correctly, I used **WoW Model Viewer** to export characters and their animations, and I used **WoW Model Exporter** for objects, textures, music, etc. I hope I could help :)
---
You just learn when to change forms. 
---
Took me a while to get that this is a joke :)
---
Thanks for the response Nano, lots of love for the entire Nost team. Would you be worried if they have little to no beta testing? 
---
Do you think that Classic release will allow much more datamine which will allow much better (closer to vanilla) private servers in the future?
---
What’s your opinion on Blizzard not immediately releasing battlegrounds? As a pretty active private server player at the beginning of vanilla servers, the first few weeks battlegrounds are what really shows what the pre-twink battleground system was like. 
---
Also in relation to this question, do you agree / disagree / indifferent in the opinion that releasing battlegrounds a few months down the road might actually ruin the low level battleground scene for the casual player? Every twink will already be fully geared and equipped with their most OP gear 3 months down the road(I think that’s the release date) and it will definitely reduce the joy and experience that many low level or casual players can get from experiencing them before the rush of twinks. 
---
Isn't that ironic?  And then there are guilds who got a set pretty quick - while the world first guild doesn't even have one.  Some people rag on SWP as a rushed raid that Blizzard threw together to buy them more time for WOTLK.  But the sunwell was probably my favorite raid.  It was awesome knowing that only 1 or 2 other guilds on the server had even downed just the first boss.  Malecgos was guild breaker, brutallus was a supreme DPS and healing race - lots of us changed professions for brutallus to LW just so we could use the haste drums for a bit of a buff.    The  next boss, Eredar twins I think took us 5 weeks of constant progression raiding to down, that was extremely brutal.  I remember spending 8 hours a night in there wipe after wipe after wipe with little or no progress.    Then Muru...  then KJ...man that whole place just wrecked.  No other guild on my server got past M'uru, and it was an awesome feeling downing Kil'Jaeden knowing that nobody on the server had even SEEN him.  
---
Oh I knew about WoW Model Viewer but hadn't heard of WoW Model Exporter for objects!
---
Like you I will probably be constantly fighting the urge to work on something that won't be publishable but is so close to home
---
I had to scratch my head already at 'pee-paw.'
---
I've thought about trying smite priest this time around for PvP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDqaQZKT5wA
---
If you're going to go shadow, you need to go full shadow and get shadowform. Otherwise, it's not as effective as either a disc/holy priest or a smite priest. 
---
1: You said that sharding at launch is a necessary evil, but I remember that Nost and other p-servers since then used dynamic respawns to solve the same problem. Do you think that's a better alternative to sharding?
---
2: Do you think you should be allowed to go to areas that are supposed to be inaccessible such as Hyjal in Classic?
---
You had me going until the two monitors part. Well Done
---
Well the issue with large private servers (over 5k concurrent) is that they pretty much require extremely fast dynamic respawns to be playable. This has a profound effect on 1-60 leveling speed and the servers economy as a whole. It’s much better to cap the populations and open up more servers (or just have queues) than to implement such respawn systems or sharding.
---
&gt;  Westfall chat,
---
gas station store brand barrens chat.
---
I knew that I am not alone :D
---
Silvermoon is Full
---
Position in queue: 550
---
Estimated time: 35 min
---
How do you think blizzard will attempt to tackle issues such as the infamous "devilsaur mafia"?
---
Blizzard has a lot more options to solve problems than we did. We were limited by money and the logistics of splitting people across servers. We had to do dynamic respawns.
---
Sharding is a solution that they have already developed and know works. If it's limited to the launch/starter zones, it's a good solution from a development prospective because they don't have to spend the development type working on a dynamic respawn system to account for thousands of players in the same place. There are also side effects to the dynamic respawn system like not being able to leave a cave without training mobs or economic inflation/deflation that are also not "blizzlike".
---
It'd be nice to go to inaccessible places but I don't have a strong opinion on that.
---
I started to rage before I knew it was a troll.  Had to take a deep breath afterwards and allow the troll to wash over my body.
---
it is decided
---
BG's didn't exist at launch of vanilla. I have no issues with BG's not existing at the launch of classic.
---
I think they'll attempt to curb cross-faction collusion.
---
I mean no disrespect, but you having it “planned out” to get thunderfury, I wish you the best of luck. Classic doesn’t work that way. 
---
I like Ion and respect that he is willing to talk about things other devs avoid.  It's not always up to him but he still owns things.
---
Agreed I think your teams work and Ian's work as a spy for the classic community has paid off!
---
The problem was less so tech are more so quality of life.
---
Either you needed to wait 30 minutes for a chance to kill a mob, or increase the respawn rate, neither of which are authentic.
---
I  am so going to gank you.
---
We were on the twin emps in AW40 when the other binding dropped. This was when AW40 was relevant pushing content. 
---
so true
---
Not if sharding works out for them. Otherwise, what's even the point.
---
I agree on that, but I don't trust blizzard to do it that way.
---
Do you think Blizzard should make changes to the game like realm sizes for example or should they try to keep it 100% authentic? 
---
It truly is RNG yeah.. I was farming MC for a greenie transmog from trashmobs and did bosses because why not and got both Thunderfury bindings and Hand of raggy before that cunt of a greenie.
---
9-10months of farming.
---
The whole point is, I want to be able to protect us while leveling. PVP can slow things down so much. I'm sacrificing alot by going shadowform + darkness for 25% damage. Now that is a lot of damage, however we don't plan outleveling each other. If we get caught in PVP I can heal on the fly and dungeons will be that much easier. We will easily make dungeon groups as a warrior and priest and we also plan on pulling 2-5 mobs at a time if we can (swp, Nova, clap, whirlwind. I personally just don't want to go the standard shadow build as always and want to able to dominate PVP from slowing us down. Also would not have to respec for a good long time.  
---
I guess I could go full shadowform and VE + swp all targets we pull, which I'll be doing anyways. It'd just be fun not to have to respec forever heheh.
---
Can confirm, on retail I’m over 50 runs and have not seen either binding
---
A tauren warrior on an unarmored arctic wolf riding into battle wielding high warlord's pigsticker!
---
but druids can tank in vanilla?
---
I think there's a sizable portion of the playerbase that has a lot of raiding experience. Or, even a current pserver guild they plan on rolling with.
---
No, they don't lock you out. IIRC, there's an option on your minimap that you can enable to see them,  "Show low level quests" or something. I don't know about the rep.
---
Me next. I'm stuck between paladin or druid, and can't decide between dwarf/human, or Tauren/NE either...
---
But here’s the deal though, they only stopped patching vanilla because BC was released. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say we could have seen more patches. I agree that putting BC stuff shouldn’t happen. However, quite a few specs were in a pretty sorry state at the end of vanilla, and to simply say, “Too bad, cry more.” is elitism at its worst. To ignore this is just going to cause classic servers to stagnate as many private servers do. BC did fix some of this, but as I said, we really shouldn’t start bringing stuff in from other expansions, but something does need to be done.
---
I know this is fake, but you can’t actually have your quest log open on a separate monitor can you?
---
Any MMO with a player based economy will have baron who can control certain markets. These baron’s game is playing the economy, it is their game inside a game. 
---
I'm currently debating between Warrior and Shaman to main in Classic and debating which Shaman spec to focus on. This comment alone makes me want to go Elemental instead of Enh. How is Ele while levelling? Can you do both Resto and Ele reliably enough at endgame?
---
well, not far off.  
---
I would love to play lock again, but I lack the time to properly gear it this time arround.
---
maybe I should listen to your divination :-) 
---
What people actually do: grind mobs whilst questing.
---
Mind-blown.meme
---
The fact you won't need to wait days for a GM to swap loot about is one, especially at low levels (which is a bigger part of the game unlike on live).
---
Loot funneling/ninjaing for gold/friends or whatever will suck though. 
---
*Weoow*
---
because no one yet knows how it will look like exactly.  
---
you can implement so that abusing it is almost impossible.
---
if done right the pros outweight the cons.  
---
well thats my reason anyways
---
Change Realm
---
the "bait button"...
---
Frick, now I feel like an idiot.
---
why stop at brd? shadowpriests can heal pretty much all 5 and 10mans
---
Sorry but your project will be taken down really fast if you want to use Blizzard assetts. Also when you are working on Warcraft themed games for a year, why don't we see any gameplay, just imported assets into a Unity scene?
---
For class I pulled crow which legend has it can shapeshift which makes me think Druid. For race I got Otter which is known for its sleek grace which makes me think female Night Elf.
---
So female Night Elf Druid is likely what will fit you.
---
Other comparison would be nice. Like which option makes you richer? Which gives you the most bags? ...
---
because a bluepost told them it's a good thing
---
Yeah I think Case 1 is the clear choice here.
---
What sort of altitude do you think gryphons can fly? I would guess 1k-2k just to avoid cold temperatures. If that is suppose to be a continent, they’d have to be really high. Probably just artistic license. 
---
I have a sulfuras and an extra eye on my dk. A warlock buddy would clear Mc with me in wrath every week for the rep.  I also have a binding but in years of clearing Mc I have never seen the binding from geddon. 
---
On a long enough timeline inflation will happen on servers. Consumables used in raids and in competitive pvp will eventually be the only way to remove gold from the macro economy
---
Back when Kael'Thas hadn't been nerfed our guild was the only one on the server to complete the BT attunement so Black Temple general chat was essentially guild chat. That was a new one for me.
---
Thank you! 
---
Kazzak is such a cluster fuck on populated servers. Have everyone in your guild make 1-2 level 1 characters and run them to his spawn point. Easy way to wipe enemy raids. 
---
I'm in the same boat you are, I'll play both Warrior and Shaman just not sure which one I'll main.
---
I wouldn't worry about it, duo levelers for one aren't exactly prime targets, and even if you're going at it by your lonesome, priests make for some annoying marks to take out in wPvP. 
---
PS is an instant fear that can often send melee chars into groups of mobs, and even if you manage to burst a priest down, SW:P can easily do you over... and when you get back to your corpse, the priest will already be there. watching. waiting. (I have many fond memories of corpse-camping people until they logged out or sent their higher level friends.)
---
I took about 8-9 years to complete mine. Two of these years were clearing mc almost weekly as a tank . After that it was sporadic solo runs admittedly fairly far apart.
---
Maybe it is too late but try me, I'm going to play horde.
---
Go prot. The survivability is really really nice, much less stressfull when leveling. And its not much slower, people understimate it, shield slam is really strong because its damage doesnt need high weapon damage, which you wont have when leveling. And also pve server. Have fun!
---
What debacle?
---
Yeah maybe try it out and see. I pulled some more cards in case that may help and I got Lizard for race which makes me think Troll since they have that green/blue skin like a lizard. For class I chose Spider which makes me think weaving, which makes me think tailor.
---
Does this resonate with you at all? So Troll weaver something that goes back to your source. Also you mentioned lacking time and I am also getting the message to don't worry and just go at your own pace.
---
with 21/0/30, you're giving up shadowform and ain't getting shit in return.
---
[this is what you want, the points can be moved around somewhat.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGs0bZbhtZVMGdcp) all the utility you can get and then some, and it's more-or-less shadow focused.
---
Do you have to raid? No 
---
Is it easier to get strong gear from raiding than pvp rewards? Yes
---
Thank you so much for all your hard work! I truly believe one of the main reasons we are actually getting classic from blizzard is because of your project.
---
My questions are in regards to the devilsaur mafia. How difficult was it to try and stop cross faction collusion with the mafia? With devilsaurs being so vital to the early game progression/economy are there any additional steps you wish you would have taken to balance it better? And lastly do you think blizzard will be able to do stop cross faction collusion for devilsaurs? 
---
If you're still doing this, I'd love to do it!
---
I shall spend my evenings dancing naked on the mailbox! Thanks!
---
Yeah, I guess I just want the utility most for healing past lvl 30+ dungeons. I just assume its going to be madness past launch with everything being crowded. Mindflay doesn't get amazing until 45~ish anyways. I may just decide to respec then
---
Divinate this poor soul.
---
RNG is a very cruel mistress. Good luck.
---
Good luck getting to 60 in a week as a warrior, even with your leveling plan of 16 hours a day. A single week would put you a little over 4.5 days played. If you haven’t played classic since the days of playing with your grandpa you are in for a rude awakening come release day. I wish you all the best and truly hope you can complete your plan, but from my perspective it is not realistic at all.
---
Poor attempt at trolling. At least make the effort to not sound like a retard who is obviously trolling . Consistency is key.
---
Usually you go enh till 40 and then you can respec elem (though enh is still better, but it's doable.) At end game there's a really strong elem resto spec that allows to do most things. 
---
No one gives a shit about loot at low levels.
---
Go kill raptors in barrens for a few levels, you will get like 5g in an hour
---
And I just want to spam fireballs and AOE spells from range, until I get bored every 10  minutes and run in to suicide combustion + blastwave for 6 hours. 
---
&gt; which is, I think, against TOS.
---
This is one of those things that are repeated because people repeat it from someone who misunderstood what the TOS said.
---
What the TOS said was, you weren't allowed to circumvent the in game meassures taken to prevent cross-faction communication.
---
I stopped reading at “I’m confident vanilla raiding will be easier than retail.”  I almost fell out of my chair laughing. 
---
I cant tell if this post is a troll or not... ?
---
Because they are convinced that Blizzard is going to put in all these checks and balances around it so it isn't broke. But Blizzard made it clear they want it so GMs don't have to deal with loot which means it is going to be an open trade for X time regardless of need or greed because any other option literally undermines the reason they want it.
---
Well they already failed at vanilla because they added all these shitty game changes.
---
Yeah true I guess.
---
1. There's a problem of sample size here.
---
2. Questing has a much higher variability in time because it requires a lot more player knowledge.
---
3. The world record 1-60 was done through questing *while grinding mobs in the process of traveling between quest areas*. This seems to be the best option.
---
Got me after the post says "  I'll probably be the first person to 60 since I have 2 monitors "
---
[I'm just gonna leave this here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX1dPTAQ5_U)
---
but, on a more serious note: definitely rogue, since, as others have mentioned, you can pick your fights. mages, while powerful, are made out of wet paper and a mistake can easily cost you your life, and while hunters are somewhat drier paper, they have this wonderful thing called deadzone, which tends to lead to a world of shit.
---
Personal short story. Main tank managed to get Thunderfury before we cleared MC (I think), but never got a single one for the next like year and a half.
---
peon &gt; all pop music
---
I know what am I gonna roll, but please do your thing, it sounds fun.
---
Hoping that this is something that will be punished on Classic
---
For race I pulled Armadillo which makes me think of Durotar and Orgrimmar. So I believe that means you should play Orc.
---
For class I pulled Raven which are familiars for magic users so I am feeling some sort of magic user. I am also getting that you want to do well in a group, you want to please others but you want to do something that pleases yourself.
---
This might sound weird but I feel like you are meant to play an orc elemental shaman. I know elemental shamans aren't the go to spec for Vanilla but I have a feeling this will work for you as long as you make it your own. You can still help your group in your own way with totems and

Np! I am glad to have helped!

It has not been confirmed nor spoken about as far as I know, but I would be very surprised if it's not the current wow client and an option you select much like you would for the PTR.

That's only my educated guess though based on the fact that WC3 has a launcher option already *and* the fact that the demo was a butchered legion client.

what swap loot? you arent suppose to swap loot in vanilla, jesus christ.

I played on ps for 4 years, and never had once a situation you need it in any ways. nvm on low lvls, lol. who the hell are all these ppl saying it impoves their gaming experience. omg.

Also where you info does come from, that gms swap loot around as ppl demand???

even if there were some single cases of that, do you understand the difference between routinely trading bop gear back and forth like several items per dungeon run. and gming in some rare cases for one item?
---
yea bro "thats exactly the same thing. it doesnt really change anything". ahaha
---
the fact that it took so long is a good thing, so it makes it way less likely to be used in abused form and makes gms to check it and do manually. Similary as courts take a long time.
---
As I said in the video, these projects are abandoned, due to the issues you mentioned. I was only working on them for a week or two, 2 years ago. During that time I was working on the map, and when I started working on the gameplay, I decided that I shouldn't continue working on these projects.
---
I have a huge urge to work on them, because it's fun as hell, but I couldn't monetize or even publish them, so career-wise it would be mostly a waste of time.
---
But thanks for caring :D
---
One day I hope AI gets advanced enough that I can play vanilla WoW "singleplayer" on a server populated by me and 2499 AIs who perfectly simulate the atmosphere and attitude of the 2005 playerbase.
---
I miss Everquest 
---
Why? 
---
That gnome mage at the end of the video looked kinda like my 60 mage from way back in original vanilla, and he even did the same kind of emote that I do. That's when I squinted to read the name/guild and realized: I AM THAT MAGE. Pudges from Bloodmoon Rising. I had to do a double take because the pixels are so god awful. Man, what are the odds you come across a random video on reddit from 12+ years ago and it happens to be on your exact server taken at the exact right moment. Also, shoutout to anyone from Bloodmoon or Knight's Pride. I'll never forget you guys.
---
I’m more referring to same faction griefing because there is no way to stop that. If the level 1’s are on your faction there is no counter play.
---
For class I got antelope which made me think of leather since people used to use antelope hide for warmth in the cold. I pulled another card and got porcupine which made me think of quills, which makes me think hunter with its sharp arrows.
---
For race I got Horse which makes me think humans since they ride a horse, but humans cannot be hunters in classic. So I am thinking it means alliance and maybe one day you will get a horse mount. The next card is bat which makes me think Night Elf since bats are nocturnal.
---
So all in all night elf hunter possibly with horse mount possibly a skinner/leatherworker. For pet I got wolf which probably means wolf pet.
---
Hope that helps!
---
retail wow bros i guessing, any sane person would be against it. literal npcs.
---
Cool video! Makes me a bit sad tho thinkin' that official blizz servers might not be able to handle this kinda coolness from what I've heard of retail.
---
Sounds like my guild. Killed M'uru right before the nerf and KJ right before the Wrath pre-patch (and further nerfs), I believe. Kept farming BT the whole time, didn't have so much as a single glaive. 
---
Coming from a priest main, how satisfying is chain heal? I love priest in and out but I love buffing people. Not crazy about totems, but I love feeling needed for raids and raids could use up to 8 shamans.   
---
Can anyone sell me on shamans? (You have yo beat mind control)
---
A week to 60 is definitely doable if you're sweaty enough. 
---
Yeah, or really cheap. My kids and their friends play many indie games or mobile games. These guys have phones. (Sorry)
---
Retail wow players which are used to this system in retail wow. so they want the same qol, cos thats how they used to play. then they rationalize it in some way. it works in retail, wouldnt be bad in vanilla either.
---
I think that is wishful thinking, but I was of the opinion for a while now, that they should finish retail, and start over. And have a different plan from the very beginning on how they are going to add new expansions to the world, because the current system has been crumbling for a while now.
---
I'm sure most people here take loads of drugs. Caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes... All drugs my man, alcohol is arguably one of the most harmful drugs out there. I don't see the need to discrimination between legal and illegal substances. 
---
if you don't know yet how it gonna be, you shouldnt be defending that. cos you don't know what you even defeding.
---
you are promoting some phantom. this is ridiculous.
---
"maybe it will be impossible to abuse", so i'll defend it. dur 
---
Bro not everything must have a logic... Just chill
---
Losing stats is part of the calculation.  I did it frequently on mage, or as a healer as the stat loss was pretty low for the benefit of a long CC.  
---
There was a mod that would queue up gear to switch and it would happen as soon as you dropped combat, so you could rocket helm queue up the switch and if you dropped combat randomally it would give you back your stat helm.  
---
 You may already realize but plate get a non-engr rocket helm replacement that at least has some minor stats and plate level armor on it:  [Horned Viking Helmet](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9394/horned-viking-helmet)  
---
I was thinking Night Elf/Dwarf Hunter! Thanks so much!
---
For class I got Coyote. Coyote totem is really cool. They are the trickster animal. I am sensing Coyote is actually signifying Engineer since they have a lot of tricks up their sleeve. I pulled another card for race and got Lynx which makes me think stealth which makes me think Rogue.
---
For race I pulled Buffalo which makes me think Tauren, but how can a Tauren be a rogue? I thought of this then realized a gnome rogue can actually look like a tauren with the Orb of Deception. I feel like this is part of your trickster spirit.
---
So you should play a gnome rogue that is an engineer and carries the orb of deception. :)
---
You can make a monkey put in your talents or just not use talents at all. 
---
And it is still going to be viable in PVP because pretty much everything works in PVP up to some extent and you can kill people with your basic class toolkit.
---
Thanks for the pointers.
---
It's fucking insane what a perfect microcosm this situation is...
---
I CAN'T be the only one seeing this shit, right?
---
Retail Player here.. I certainly do not want this. It could very well be people that have never ever played vanilla wow and don't understand the concept so they just think why the hell not. Or people that remember it from 14 years ago and are not keen on going back to it. 
---
Ok. Let's see if I can change your mind.
---
For race I got Opossum which means Undead to me. They play dead.
---
For class I pulled Elk which symbolizes stamina and strength. Which to me means Warrior.
---
So Undead Warrior.
---
Yeah I was thinking either Night Elf or Dwarf but then I pulled the bat card and that clinched Night Elf.
---
Paladin, with bubble hearth you’ll never lose.
---
Ok, what will I be playing?
---
Yep, there are tons of quests with absolutely miserable drop rates if you want to get your grinding and questing fixes on simultaneously. The troll bone necklaces in Stranglethorn comes to mind.
---
But I have two monitors!  I'll have [www.askjeeves.com](https://www.askjeeves.com) up on one of them so I can search for any part of a quest I'm having trouble with.
---
I always run into shamans even in the 30s that don't have their water totems yet, and I always shame them.
---
Hit me chief. I’m 99% sure I know what I’m rolling, but just so you know, I’m definitely going ally.
---
Wasn't this the loading screen for if your character was in a location the game didnt expect? 
---
Classic Dark Age of Camelot server launched today. Classic WoW was heavily influenced by DAOC. The World PvP in DAOC is unmatched. Less grindy than Classic WoW. More World PvP. 3 Factions instead of 2.
---
Phoenix Dark Age of Camelot better than it has ever been. Over 3,000 players online right now.
---
[https://playphoenix.online](https://playphoenix.online/)
---
But do the POSSIBLE pros outweigh the POSSIBLE cons? That's the real question.
---
If this happens and doesn't set a precedent, (Although, I don't see how it couldn't.) so it only effected this one situation. I'd measure the possible pros at about +1 and the possible cons at about -7. I'd roll the dice on that if I had a gambling problem, otherwise no.
---
Thank you very much! I think I'm actually going to play that haha
---
I'm pretty much not satisfied with anything that is different than old Vanilla WoW.  Blizzard has ruined everything they've touched in the last 5 years and this is their one chance to produce a saving grace.  Vanilla WoW worked, and it worked much better than WoW ever will again under Blizzard's design philosophy.  Loot trading, sharding...all of it.  The old game was good despite its flaws and I don't want to go down the path of Blizzard changing anything.  I'll subscribe to play old WoW, and the only thing that can stop me from doing this is Blizzard muddying it up.  It won't be lack of sharding or loot trading or anything else that ruins the experience for me
---
Yeah that's what I've been reading as well. I'm going to look into it for sure, Resto/Elemental would be a blast and allow to do a lot of end game content.
---
I’m all about the swag of the game. Only thing that matters does my character look good.
---
For class I got bat which symbolizes rebirth which makes me think of Shaman but you want to play Alliance. Okay. Bats could also stand for confronting the darkness so that makes me think of Paladin since they confront evil.
---
For race I pulled Elk which symbolizes strength and stamina. That makes me think of Dwarf being the strongest of the Alliance races.
---
So Dwarf Paladin. 
---
3. Whenever I start doing this, I can't stop killing mobs =p
---
Lets say youre running UBRS. 10 people, of which 4 are your guild members and rl friends. Dal Rend's mainhand drops. You roll on it, so do 2 rogues another warrior and even a huntard. Your mates decide to help you out and roll on it too. Your chances of getting it went from 1 in 5 to 1 in 2. Surprise, your guild mate wins it and trades it to you.
---
A different example. Youre doing Strat UD as a rogue. Finally you get to the Baron. The cape drops and youre extatic. Then you see that the warrior also needs on it and wins it. He then whispers you: "Pay me 50 gold and Ill hand it over." 
---
I was half-hoping for that picture :D 
---
but yeah, entirely agreed, all those people are communists! 
---
Because it's way down on the list of what can actually ruin Vanilla WoW. **If you do it in a guild people will find out, kick you from the guild and talk to other guild leaders who blacklist you.** I don't think you know how thorough people are with loot. Players can basically make sure it works. Content being too easy and it being abused in pugs is the big issue and that is more of a problem of too many nerfs to original content past 1.12 talents which is already a huge nerf.
---
If people aren't focusing on (and the Nost guy mentioned almost all of these because as someone who ran a private server they know this is what really matters)
---
1. Release structure
---
2. Itemization
---
3. AV
---
They are simply mininformed and or have no idea what they are talking about because they were little kids who didn't raid in Vanilla WoW like Asmongold. That is not putting him down. He never experienced it and has to rely on others for information. If the game is greatly accelerated with release structure. It's ruined. 4 content patches is not enough. Itemization will speed up that 4 content patches. AV being the modern version harms the game a lot because AV was a great olive branch to two very different communities and got PVE players into PvP and PVP players into PVE. It was brilliant game design and should not be touched from it's original intention to fit TBC where BG's don't reallty matter are just a useless minigame to be thrown away once you get blue pvp gear.
---
Phasing is something Blizzard 100 percent stated wouldn't be in the game past launch. If they break that, they are liars and have engaged in false advertising and fraud. Again, that problem will take care of itself.
---
I think the classic demo required its own client based on 7.something I cant recall exactly. But there was some weirdness where I had to install the retail client just partially in order to be able to get the demo to let me log in past the errors.
---
So there's definitely some kind of symbiotic shit going on or something. I suspect it will have its own client but if you have retail installed the download required to get the classic "client" will be pretty small.
---
Probably depends heavily on spec.
---
People recommend troll for caster shamans since berserking can help with cast speed and get a much needed lightning bolt or heal off. The big benefit for the haste increase only really activates if you're low on HP so I wouldn't expect this to be as much use for say a healer in a raid (where hopefully you're not getting hit much) but sounds like a big plus for elemental.
---
Tauren, with extra HP and AOE stun sounds like a better PVP choice to me than the troll, for a caster. War stomp comes in handy so much questing as elemental too and it has a shorter cooldown compared to the troll racial. War stomp won't factor into raiding obviously but that extra stamina might be of use.
---
A lot of people swear by Orc for PVP by stun resistance. I'd say an orc would make a natural enhancement shammy for PVE what with Blood Fury and increased axe skill. Troll might be fun for this too. It would be interesting to see Berserking and Flurry combining and turning the tide on a precarious situation.

I require your assistance!!
---
Dumbass
---
Hi, /u/APileofbabies
---
scrub, you should use brave as a browser. 
---
it has a "time saved" counter because it blocks all the "come play now, my lord" ads 
---
Honestly, that is scary
---
i personally don't understand what we are paying the subscription of 15bucks a month if not for admins to handle this shit.
---
its just activision being greedy as always. they introduce a shit and abusable system so they can cut costs over anything else.
---
Thing is "equality" is bullshit in this case. You'll always be combining both methods therefore it doesn't matter which one is "better" as combining the two of them is the best course of action you can take.
---
If you'd really want to do a comparison you do this test all the way to 60 - I'm fairly certain grinding will fall behind quite a bit if you're ONLY doing it.
---
How does Resto stack up to other healers in vanilla?
---
Hmm...what came up was Raven and Grouse which makes me think Tauren Priest but you cant play as that in Vanilla. Maybe that is your BFA class/race?
---
I will do another but this time for Classic. I pulled Lizard and Horse. Lizard is the medicine for dreamers, and dreaming in WoW is tied to the Druids and the Emerald Dream. Horse makes me think of Power which makea me think of Tauren again.
---
So Tauren Druid but I have a feeling you secretly want to be a Troll Druid. Maybe classic is not for you :/.
---
I did it! 
---
nice bait
---
All your blabbering on for literally no content whatsoever. GMs swapped loot in the original Vanilla when the person who got the loot made the ticket, I don't know or care what they do on Private Servers you've played.
---
I don't disagree with what you're saying, I was listing facts as to benefits of the 2h trade window, and then said after that it'd make it worse.
---
Vanilla enthusiasts who always go on about levelling being a core part of the game do. YMMV. 
---
Or pages in STV, zeverha hooves, plainatrider beaks and raptor heads in Barrens too! 
---
Interesting process you have! I’m thinking I’m rolling dwarf hunter. Paladins weren’t to appealing me in vanilla the first time around. 
---
I'd actually say elemental is a better leveling spec until 40, but possibly beyond that.  Enhancement is easier, but if you know how to make the most out of the 5 second rule, elemental will be faster.
---
Ghost wolf. Hugely useful sub 40 and probably a ways after that if you're as bad at earning gold as I am. Especially with the reduced cast time talent and doubly so if you are an herbalist.
---
Reincarnation. There are lots of long graveyard walks in vanilla, and your dungeon group will love you.
---
Having like 25 totems ranging from useless but fun (sentry totem!) to vital. You get to really thing creatively before starting encounters. If you like buffinghere you go. It's a fun feeling when you figure out a good combination of each element for a  certain encounter. "OK these mobs flee on low health so I'll use an Earthbind totem, a Searing totem to help with DPS a little, a Mana Spring totem since we'll be fighting in this same position for a minute, and a Grounding totem because I know some of these mobs cast a really dangerous spell as soon as they aggro." A little different than buffing people with Fortitude as they wait for the zeppelin (don't get me wrong, this is great too). You will also learn pain when you lay down your carefully selected totems, drink to top off your mana, and watch the tank charge the boss and fight at the other end of the room.
---
More gear options. You won't be fighting with most other casters when leather or mail drops.
---
Warlocks can cast water breathing too but walking on water is absolutely baller.
---
Chain heal looks and feels great but chain lightning has one of the coolest visual and sound effects in the game, in my opinion. It's just great. Mages will hate you as your electricity bounces from mob to mob, breaking polymorph and obliterating that rat who was scrounging nearby. That doesn't matter. What matters is, you looked really cool. I'm only slightly joking here.
---
Astrall Recall. An additional hearth on a 15 minute timer. Super useful with how long the regular hearth CD is. Something came up and you have to log for the day and want that sweet sweet rested experience? I love it.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Considering it's based on the retail sub I imagine it'll be on the launcher too, like everything else. 
---
1. Quit your job. 
---
2. You still may not attain your goals.
---
3. You will not attain them.
---
4. Apply to jobs.
---
They still would be paying for AWS or a similar product right? And what about time and money it took for people to set up these servers?
---
Nope. And it's absolutely hilarious.
---
I raided for two years. Cleared abom wing in Naxx. I never saw one binding drop. Not one.
---
This is so stupid, and yet I love it.
---
I have read a private server code. It is rather simple and straightforward, but I don't think it is designed to be easily modifyable, especially for a huge company with lots of people. Retail game server has probably layers upon layers of abstractions and sandboxed scripting, that multiplyes required resources several times
---
As an alliance player I don't know much about how shamans do, but I assume ele sucks in PvE?
---
Because I doubt it'll be a big issue like the sub makes it out to be. After all I've heard about vanilla friendliness and server reputation it seems like a straw man.
---
But the more I interact with this sub, the less faith I have in the classic playerbase.
---
no
---
Not the kobald mines. The land mines.
---
Is this a troll? If so it's pretty good.
---
So you would say that a hole in a wall actually consists of two holes? If you assume that the wall is not infinitesimally thin, the hole could be modelled by a cylinder, leading to the hole actually consisting of two holes according to your explanation.
---
I’m pretty sure they have already said there will be no shop/tokens in classic. I’m having trouble understanding the second part of your question though. It sounds like you are talking about people trading gold from live servers to classic servers which is my first time hearing about anything like that.  
---
Not Nostalrius but briefly worked with few of them on a separate server..
---
Mob HP, damage / damage type, spells along with mob resistances are a good start.
---
Raid scripts are also guesstimates, often missing some key spells or using wrong spells (inherently weaker ones) making the raids easier. 
---
On this separate project we tried to tackle this with a collection of old google videos / youtube videos which were a ton of work to find, and then try to decipher anything from a 240p or lower video filled with a typical 2005 player UI filled with ton of useless information..
---
NPC gossip dialogues are also hugely missing on Classic emulators, so when you go to talk to a npc who doesnt have a quest or anything of worth for you (but in retail had some lore gossip) simply say "greetings traveler".
---
People have been swapping money/items between different games since the dawn of time.
---
I don't want loot trading, but I also don't think it will somehow ruin the game.
---
I just leveled an undead rogue... but wont play that for classic launch 
---
Nelf warriors yuck, perhaps human 
---
What should I play.
---
As long as I can roll on the essence of pure flame, sign me up.
---
What do you mean "there will be gold swapping between games"?  You will not be able to send gold from a retail character to a classic character.  If I understand it correctly, classic realms will be completely segregated from retail.  
---
Most people reading this are vehemently opposed to tokens being used on classic servers at all.  I personally think that it's a more important issue than loot trading.  If tokens (or gold from tokens) are able to be used in classic I will possibly not play it.    
---
I was pretty outspoken in late Vanilla and early TBC against many of the QOL changes and people were similarly naive then. Bottom line is that too many of us are naive, corporate-worshipping fools. The collective simply don't deserve nice things. 
---
Gaming was better when the audience was intelligent, demanding, and niche. Developers were free to trust their audience's ability to work things out. 
---
It's certainly not realistic with THAT attitude.....
---
I did it!
---
therefore
---
hurrah for ring!
---
[https://i.imgur.com/3vzEvHp.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3vzEvHp.jpg)
---
(( just done the no bonfire run ))
---
&gt;  Although ninjaing for friends was still possible in group loot situations since you'd just get a gm to swap it still.
---
Are you sure about this? I'd never heard about this being a method of ninjaing until people started defending loot trading. At this point it feels like a convenient justification.  
---
I’m pretty good now because I have google chrome on my phone 
---
LOL
---
That video is gold, 10/10
---
All of them.
---
I hope the dont fuck it up. And i dont want to fucking see sharding or loot trading BS.
---
Hi, /u/poppywoofs
---
Shoutout to Moco
---
Me plz
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMKCDvFSzIA
---
This one's so much better.
---
Person A has 100,000 gold on retail, person B has 300 gold on classic. They meet, and agree to trade: person B gives person A 300 gold on a classic server, while person A gives person B 100,000 gold on a retail server. 
---
No one thinks there will be an official service for transferring gold, but it will happen. We can assume there will be a retail to classic gold ratio (say, 500 gold on retail for 1 gold on classic) and, because you can buy gold in retail with real money, that means you can indirectly buy classic gold.
---
Ah, the sweet pain.
---
MoCo indeed! 
---
Long ago when the servers opened I started a horde druid. I played him for years and did most things in the game. Some time in TBC I switched to ally for a new experience and have been ally ever since then. 
---
This time I will start as an ally and who knows I might switch after a few years for a different perspective.
---
hey dude #nochanges btw
---
Thanks for the clarification.  Yeah, that will be a problem for sure - I just hope it's not common.  The only way I see to guard against it is for blizzard to roll-back the ability to mail gold to your characters on other servers.  If they did that, it would only make it less likely that the 2 people doing a deal on classic have a characters on the same corresponding retail server.  
---
As far as the exchange rate from retail to classic, I think it would be more like 100/1.  
---
I believe you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
---
First, you need people playing *both* games to be interested in that kind of trade.
---
Second, people will find out soon enough that it's much easier to grind gold on retail to pay your sub with a token than it is to grind classic for it, even if you don't like retail.
---
Sure trades will exist, they always have, but they won't have an impact, since none of that adds gold to economy.
---
Hey! What about the [one I made?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j13w0X3smqI) :)
---
It's 100% RNG.
---
I think it's worth pointing out that it's not just buying gold that will effect this. Different classes in classic have easier or harder times farming gold, but in retail there are thousands of different ways each class can farm and be extremely effective in. It also goes both ways - for instance, I think we'll see disproportionately effective runs in classic (hunter trib solo runs, assuming they work) being used to generate gold for the purpose of exchange far fast than any retail farm.
---
For what it's worth, it's random. 
---
In raids, I'd argue it's the single worst spec hands down. Solo, small group, and 5 man though elemental is amazing. In 5 man I could hold my own against better geared mages on 3-pulls thanks to chain lightning, nova totem, and stacks of water from said mages. Groups love your buffs, you bring insane utility. But raiding....worst spec ever.
---
Our guild began farming MC in mid-2005 and for every week until TBC. We never completed TF.
---
That's because the bindings drop in Molten Core
---
Niche is another great word!
---
Pretty sure that option did not exist in Vanilla WoW.
---
Because you can't simultaneously believe:
---
* There's no way to eliminate ninjaing completely - reputations, blacklisting, and community will defend us against it.
---
* Loot trading will allow for more ninjaing, and thus ruin the game.
---
How can you tunnel-vision the second point and forget your beliefs from the first point? And also forget about the fact that loot trading actually eliminates certain forms of ninjaing?
---
And, shouldn't we be talking about bigger issues like content difficulty due to 1.12 talents and itemization?
---
And, if blizzard turns out to be wrong and loot trading is toxic as hell, what part of that decision isn't reversible? Disable loot trading and banish everyone to days/weeks long GM queues.
---
Oh dang! I was so sure too. Sorry bout that!
---
this  made me laugh way more than usual. ragnar the orphan slayer is a dwarven cleric in my d&amp;d group.
---
Flying mounts, smaller raids, arenas, horde paladins, ally shamans, easier leveling. Probably more but those are the major ones
---
Chain heal gets me hard.
---
Problem is other than that, healing on a shaman is not really as satisfying as healing on a priest who can do it all healing wise. Speccing into healing Way helps since it adds a little mini game of downranking to keep the buff up, but other than that when healing I'd generally rather be playing a priest. Shaman fun comes more from leveraging all your support, finding just the right combination of totems for every group and encounter, and using your support skills like downranked frostshock to stop runners and downranked earth shock on casters.
---
Also, you have ghost wolf.
---
**Enhance**. 
---
Positives 
---
\- You dumptser everyone on the way to 60. When you get a Corspemaker around 30 it's actually just laughable.
---
\- You level at a steady pace and are not dependent on food or water and can make use of earthbind kiting like a warrior can with hamstring.
---
\- Can heal 5 mans to aquire the gear on way to 60 and to get initial PvP gear/raid gear
---
\- Can do well in rank 14 gear, so if you are doing that crazy grind, you can have some fun. It's not perfect stats but you really don't need them on enhance. You need armor/health to survive other melee as they progress in gear and a big weapon.
---
\- Easy playstyle that is a good starter spec or a fun alt for people that like to level a lot of classes or who just want a class they can easily learn and have fun on. Once AV is out you can get that Hammer and have fun for quite awhile with easy to get Diremaul gear (lot of strong hunter stat mail there) or the Blue PvP set.
---
Negatives
---
\- To raid as one you better know someone or be the Guildmaster. Just like Ret paladins. For some that are outgoing this is easy to achieve. For others not so much.
---
**Resto**. You drop totems and spam a button in raids. More fun in 5 mans than raids due to how powerful chain heal is in large groups **The worst pure healing spec in PvP.** Simply play Elemental while pvp'ing. I would never play Resto unless I was also respeccing Elemental for PVP. Elemental is the payoff imo. If I was only healing priest is just much more fulfilling and allows you to outplay other healers. Druid can be fun to. Holy Paladin is boring in raids but is so dependent on certain stats you will beat out bad ones. Holy paladin is also stupidly strong in PvP.
---
**Elemental**. Warning. You Have to raid and heal to make this spec work. If you aren't interested in that look elsewhere for a class. 
---
\- As dependent as a Mage on water, but can't make water. Make a mage friend.  
---
\- PVP gear and BG rep rewards is probably the worst in the game for any class/spec. Balance druid might be close. You have zero reason to rank on Ele Shaman other than casually for potions/banner.  So if you like BG's for "fun"? This is not a problem. If you want to feel like you are progressing a character or want to rank PvP? Probably a bad choice.
---
\- You are going to heal in raids. You are going to heal to get raid hear.  You are not remotely viable as DPS until later AQ and the spec is still bad. Any ideas that you will be brought to Naxx as DPS is delusion. You can dps 5 mans, but it's as stupid a decision as not tanking 5 mans on a warrior and you are just wasting time.

\- Probably has more buttons than any spec. Elemental spec mage with blastwave might be close. Is played best as a offhealer, dropping windfury in between high burst. If you don't want to heal at all you should probably be playing a mage who has a higher quality of life and is simply better as just dps due to having CC. The skill cap is high on both classes and they are both fun, just different.
---
\- Pretty awful at farming gold and the PVE raid spec is not good at PVP at all. It's the worst spec in PvP of any hybrid probably. For this reason a gold farming character alt is nice. People got around this problem by having two accounts on private servers with a mage. The mage also made water, which solved the other problem. This is not really viable for most people on Classic.
---
Positives. Still here? Good. The weak have been culled. The PvP spec. Mana is the biggest weakness of the class and you spec accordingly. Elem Mastery is better in premades. N Swiftness for solo. Both are good, but Elem Mastery works much better with a Tauren.

Now we need to see what all the hard work does. Tauren is obviously the master race for elemental. Yes it is another button on a class full of buttons. It's worth it. Pay attention to the Fire Nova totem, tauren stomp, Chain Lightning (Ele Mastery here if you have it), Shock combos. Pay attention to cleansing viper sting as soon as it lands (again mana is biggest enemy). Pay attention to NSwiftness trickswith ghostwolf to escape, poison cleanings totem vs rogues, fake casting with hearthstone), grenade combos.

A tauren warrior riding through Stormwind is actually what convinced me to reroll horde.  
---
I was a level 25 or so paladin and he was riding towards me. I thought he was going to kill me and I started running. He was being attacked by guards and dying quickly so I went full coward and attacked after he had 3 guards on him.  
---
After he died, I logged out on the spot and made a tauren shaman (eventually rerolled undead mage to 60). I never returned to Alliance until half way through TBC.  
---
A couple raids in the vanilla world is a drop in the bucket
---
dem low poly trees 
---
No.  
---
Thanks 😊
---
That's fine. Add loot trading. I'll just abuse it to all hell.  
---
It wont. People don't want games that require time and attention. They want arcade games like Call of Duty and Fortnite.  
---
Our time is over. We can only be thankful that Blizzard and private servers provide us old gamers this opportunity as a safe haven.  
---
Based on the demo, it will be an "expansion" on top of the current client. So you will download retail client and additional patches to make it classic.
---
What about a female night elf warrior? I was reading some of the lore and it says that night elves are a matriarchal and most warriors are female.
---
I miss insta cast ghost wolf in bc/Wotlk. Sucks to need to spec into it. I like the variety of heals from priest, mind control, racials and variety in talent points. Feel so contrained on a shaman. I utterly respect anyone who can play them and love them in my group but prefer priest or druid.
---
I can't wait to see how surprised people are going to be to find out that the private server reputation values we're all used to having are actually wrong.  
---
BFA is human mage/paladin. 
---
However... in classic-beginning of BFA my main has bee druid! I will stick with what you have decided. Druid for life, Tauren for new experiences
---
If private servers are any measure of accuracy, I've done level 1-10 on a mage in Teldrassil with level 1 spells. I didn't try the suicide cave, I went back to Ironforge at that point, but I know 1-10 is fairly easy.  
---
The answer to #2 is fuck streamers. 
---
WTF Y DOWNVOTE
---
WoW classic and WoW retail are on the same subscription, though. It's much easier and more intuitive than with any other set of games.
---
This is one of the fun things about healing in AV. Get nice and close to the raid and just start spamming heals and as soon as bodies start dropping... HK HK HK HK HK HK HK HK.
---
Might not be getting as much honour as the next person but it adds up quickly.
---
While rogues are indeed quite easy to be good/ok with mastering one is incredibly difficult
---
just leaving [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM1bSJm6GTE&amp;t=784s) here
---
It is a separate client. We know this from the demo. Even though we were limited to two zones, we still had the "full" client.
---
Wow your narration and video quality is great!! I subscribed lol 
---
That’s so depressing but at the same time I understand what you’re saying. Sucks. 
---
Go for it. I'm going horde and I'm stuck between three classes.
---
Maybe the cards know more. :) 
---
Now that I have money IRL, I'm looking forward to buying gold, and gear from top guilds so I can PWN your ass in pvp Athene-style.
---
Because it will most likely only affect Greed rolls which means it doesn't matter.
---
Also, Classic is supposed to be 100% about community and your reputation, so being a Mage and needing on a melee weapon to help your friend will earn you nothing but ignores. Again, it won't affect Need rolls so this doesn't matter. 
---
&gt;  If the core values and gameplay of vanilla is preserved 
---
This. Even people who are strong proponents of Classic cant seem to identify why they are so drawn to the game. Blizzard didnt create the perfect game with Vanilla, they followed core game philosophies that made the game desirable. Those same game philosophies could be applied to any modern MMO with even more success. The individual numbers and values are SO much less important than the big picture. 
---
No changes (unless graphical!)
---
Why?
---
You had me untill the 2 monitor and first to 60 thing lol
---
I don't know when they implemented it, but last time I played retail Ghost Wolf was usable when dead, which is amazing and makes so much sense. Also, being usable indoors. 
---
Thanks a bunch! Glad you enjoyed
---
Nope. I would say maybe 90% of players never hit 60 the first time around. They certainly won't now. 
---
Oh God I hadn't even thought about them holding gear for ransom like that. I hate to think that would happen in the classic wow community, but there are assholes everywhere, I guess.
---
Exchange rates will probably be measured in wow tokens  X classic gold = 1 token (the gold equivalent to buy a token) it indirectly makes classic pay to win, but how widespread this problem will be is unknown. But myself and I'm sure many others are sitting on gold cap on retail servers.
---
Their infrastructure has been set up for years at this point. It wouldn't exactly be fair to attribute any of that cost to Classic since it wasn't even planned back then.
---
It's one of the reasons why they're backporting Classic from a Legion client, so they can run it off of their modern infrastructure and save gazillions on upkeep. The only thing costing anything for them is the development, everything else is essentially free.
---
Classic is a remake of the original "vanilla" version of WoW.
---
It's being built on the Legion client, so it will have some improved graphic settings.    
---
But it will still use the original models.
---
You won't need to buy it, you'll just need an active subscription.
---
classic only players fuel this kind of trading. I don't know how widespread it will actually be. Myself and many others are sitting on gold cap. And other people may see an opportunity to pay $20 for a token for someone in exchange for classic gold. Which has the potential to give them an advantage over someone else. 
---
Well compared to mythic raiding in retail it is easier, it’s just more time consuming due to attunements and such.
---
That argument from Blizzard is invalid.  Other areas/events after the starting zones can also be packed with players (e.g., AQ).  If sharding is needed in one area/event to make the game playable, then by definition, it will be needed in ALL areas/events with load similar to starting zones.   Don’t be fooled. 
---
Why would they not be? 
---
The vast majority of groups for these instances run with masterloot and have items reserved these days.
---
I don't think there will be many people willing to exchange classic gold for retail gold tbh. Doesn't look like a big problem
---
Lol, next boss after Brut was Felmyst, but that's a testament to how much easier Felmyst was that you forgot he existed.  We had a bloodlust rotation for the healer group for Twins, otherwise they couldn't keep up with the raid damage, and that was doing it in the "easy" order.  And Mu'ru, that sumbich, wiped on him more than anything else in the game ever.
---
For mages maybe.  For others they did.
---
It is not an expansion, it is the original game. It is THE World of Warcraft. Yes, they removed it and made a new one, but now it's coming back.
---
No, you don't have to buy it separately. And the subsription fee is shared with modern verison (you can play both at the same time with one sub).
---
Yes, they updated graphics, but did not and will not add new character models.
---
I mean it’s not great, but it’s as simple as this. If someone needs it, ask them to equip it, that should make it untradeable. If they refuse you know who to avoid and you can alert others on the server. Classic isn’t like retail, your server community actually matters, just like your reputation.
---
It might have a small impact while levelling.    
---
Most likely in places like SM.
---
Then again a bit when doing LVL 60 5/10 mans while getting you preBIS.    
---
Assuming groups don't use ML and reserves. (Which is the current norm)
---
Once you're passed that first few weeks of PvE content and you've moved onto raiding it'll help when your guild's ML fucks up, miss clicks, and gives a tier piece to the wrong class.
---
In the wow diary, it says this picture was thrown together last-minute to serve as a poster and loading screen. The artist went with something easily made but evocative. It's probably not intended to represent a particular part of Azeroth exactly.
---
And people will blacklist you for doing it, enjoy being in a guild people will avoid like the plague, if you can find a guild that will take you
---
I know my main: Dwarf Pally herb/alch.  
---
But my alt? No idea. Leaning toward undead lock.
---
&gt; Because it will most likely only affect Greed rolls which means it doesn't matter.
---
You are disillusioned, if you think it will only be for greed. Greed is only a super small percent of the loot issues. Most loot issues for GMs were ML "misclicks" or unwanted needed items (misclick or intentional). And since Blizzard has openly stated they want it to not have GMs deal with loot tickets it makes 0 sense for it to only apply to greed items. 
---
What elephant?  
---
Now that's just part of the job that private investigators do. Like serving subpoenas.
---
To me it looks like nothing in wow at all.
---
Looks like some kind of tropical/desert island in the middle of the ocean.
---
Blame the system, it's rational behavior that can be eliminated by not having loot trading.  
---
I'll tell you how.  You can happily miss out on anything if it means not having to find Rexxar 18 times in order to get Ony attuned.
---
If they did a Wow2 it would be an extension of the current retail game.  
---
We on this forum think old wow is better then new wow, but really,   
---
Is beer better then wine? To me it is, but not everyone, they are different products for different markets. the word "better" needs to be more specific.  
---
For example, new wow is "better" at making $ because that demographic is more accustomed to micro-transactions.
---
They are throwing us a bone, getting us back paying the sub,   
---
The next project would absolutely be aimed at the demographic they are loosing, not the one they just got back.
---
What did Kern say?
---
People would just play Arms or Fury for tanking like they did originally till shield slam got buffed.
---
I'm 100% against loot trading.  But to be honest, in your second scenario here If the warrior didn't whisper me, I'd whisper him "I'll give you 25g and an arcanite bar for that cloak." 
---
Easiest decission for me, Horde for life, i played horde since i started back in vanilla and never looked back :D 
---
T1 sucks for most classes anyways. Decent for PvP though. And of course the RP looks. Even on private servers when I equip full T2 as a warlock and walk on my dreadsteed through Elwynn Forest people stop and watch in amazement. 
---
Too bad the set is garbage. 
---
Same here..I did dabble in the Alliance just to experience the other side of the game later on though. But after I checked that off the list, I'll never go back
---
True, but i just find the human model more sexy with the tier sets and weapons :))
---
I fail to see a problem with this. AQ40 opening was a gongshow and I'd rather not experience it firsthand like that. 
---
I started with “This mother fucker” And ended with “Oh this mother fucker”
---
I think it is a problem and something which none seems to care about. Mostly because people can not grasp the concept.
---
Having the option to spend real life money for classic gold will change the gameplay for many. Myself included. And not for the better.
---
wow thanks man I didn't know that...
---
Actually I think the large majority of Classic enthusiasts feel this way.  The people attacking retail players are just a small percentage of rabble rousers - JUST like the small percentage of rabble rousing retail players that rip on Vanilla.
---
Depends on what kind of guild you're in.  Competitive guilds usually end up doing split MC and Ony runs.  It's just "how much time do you want to invest?"  You can do 20-25 man MCs, as long as you've farmed up the consumables and you're not carrying any idiots.  I agree with you in general that people probably aren't going to get as much done as they think, but I also agree with @Surrender01 that this subreddit has a much higher ratio of serious vanilla and pserver players who understand what work goes into their goals.  Certainly moreso than the offical forums or the target market as a whole.
---
It’s really no different to finding a gold farming exploit in classic and abusing it.
---
That's fine. The convenience of loot trading is that it's worse than ninja looting because abusing it can go completely unnoticed.  
---
I'm just playing the role of the people who will abuse loot trading. Loot trading doesn't seem so bad until you wonder why the competition for gear never decreases. And god you could swear that warrior had Draconian Deflector already but you can't quite be sure... 
---
What kind of mutant would trade classic gold for retail gold?
---
If Blizzard wants to increase loot related tickets, implementing loot sharing for needed items is the best way.
---
But anyways, why group with ninjas? This is Classic, a game we all agree is all about community and reputation! Maybe you are one of the ducks and have no friends to play with? 
---
Np. PM me anytime you need advice or info.  
---
I have google chrome on my phone so.
---
Anyone who even tries it will instantly get scammed.
---
Yeah sure bro give me your classic gold and I promise I will log over to retail, totally won’t put you on ignore and keep everything you have.
---
I think a lot of people (well some at least) are hoping Classic will be so popular that they will come out with NEW expansions.  Instead of TBC a totally different expansion more in line with the Vanilla experience.  It would be like a whole new game basically.  
---
I would play that or I would play Vanilla - WotLK, either one.
---
Are you just gonna pretend d2jsp never existed?
---
Need rolling in itself should make it untradeable
---
Not exactly the wow related, but somewhat similar and absolutely HILARIOUS. 
---
Just had to share it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upzM4I9TLtM
---
Almost everyone who wants Classic also wouldn't mind it progressing to TBC eventually.  Personally I see Classic as a foot in the door to get progression servers for TBC and WotLK.  Or a whole new series of expansions after Classic that are new and more in keeping with a Classic game experience.
---
Wow, yeah I have basically no recollection of Felmyst progression.  I do remember the fight, but nothing that hung us up.  I played an ele shaman, and after a few weeks on twins progression I all but quit dps and just shocked my assigned twin to interrupt her, since the interrupts were 100% crucial.  M'uru was a thrilling fight when you first get to Entropius  and all hell is breaking loose.  
---
Imagine actually believing this.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
Because nobody has been able to explain to me how it has any downside at all, if it is limited to trading BoP items won with a **greed** roll. And the most recent implementation of loot trading (before they made it totally redundant) was, as I understand it, limited to trading BoP items won with a **greed** roll. So that is the obvious version to implement.
---
If you plan to play with the tryhards but have no vanilla raiding experience, it's not a good idea to guild lead. You are better off letting someone else do that. Also, no serrious player would ever let Thunderfury go to an off tank before the Main Tank. If you dont plan to main tank, you might be waiting a long time for Thunderfury. It seems like your desire to guild lead is mostly an attempt to siphon gear to yourself. Gear should be dispersed in a way that has the most positive impact on the guild. This is why high end guilds in Vanilla &amp; TBC generally use Loot council AT LEAST for Legendaries and controversial items.
