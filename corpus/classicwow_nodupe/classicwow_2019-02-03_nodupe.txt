See point 2, shadow priests are one of the easiest to beat as a hunter. I would scatter, run away and apply viper sting and kite out of range, 1 more viper than mana is gone then I would melt them.

---
Moonkin dance takes that honor.
---
1. Call Pet -&gt; Revive Pet.  I don't remember if it was this way on live or not.
---
2. The higher the loyalty, the less you need to feed it.  Instead of every 2 minutes it becomes every hour (give or take).
---
3. Use Growl.  Use Bite instead of Claw.  Around level x8 or x9 (i.e. 48 or 49) it might start to get hard for your pet until it hits x0 (i.e. 50) and gets a new rank of Growl.
---
That free teleport to moonglade is awesome! It puts you in kalimdor a short flight from darnassus. With a heart stone set to IF and teleport moonglade my druid can get anywhere in the game relatively quickly.
---
There are always ammo costs, thorium doesn't magically appear in your bags! Also, when you grind, you are using jagged arrows, they are far more cost effective.  
---

---
If you roll on a PvP server, Hunter comes out far ahead since you can grind fast while being safe af.
---
Reasons not to play Warlock (Pve):
---
1. If you're alliance, gnome is the best race.
---
2. You have to farm a lot of Soul Shards before a raid.
---
3. It's very easy to pull agro and you'll have to keep your eyes glued to the threat meter (and get called you by your raid leader).
---
4. You really only cast 1 damaging spell (Shadow Bolt). I personally don't mind this but I know some dislike it.
---
Honestly I really couldn't come up with 12 but then again I don't PvP. 
---
You don't have a ton of gear competition as a lot of your best in slot items are Shadow Wrath greens/blues (+ shadow damage).
---
You get cheaper mounts
---
You do big dick dps and are able to top damage meters of a plethora of raid bosses.
---
You provide utility in the form of summons, soulstones, healthstones, and curse of elements (for them filthy mages).
---
Honestly warlock is probably one of the strongest classes in Vanilla.
---
I want a mouse pad of that
---
At least try the Ret Paladin. Yeah you won't be able to raid and be taken seriously, but I think a raid will take you if they are deperate for players. Or you can stick to PvP. If so go Mining/Engineering for grenade stuns. 
---
And here again is a bunch of people whining about qol changes yet they have already accepted qol changes. The hypocrisy on this sub is fucking huge.

Hey, and by the way, I forgot to mention, I’m glad your back! I always enjoy your videos. Regardless of loot trading, I’m curious how high or low the staffing for GMs will be. There’s arguably more content in Vanilla to go wrong, than any other iteration of WoW, and it’s on an entirely new system. There’s always the beta to fix those, but the fact that many problems can remain unfixed is a beating a dead horse in BFA isn’t it?
---
Oh thanks a lot! :) I've been doing some videos on the lore and music of Warcraft recently, if you fancied checking them out! As for the GMs, I suspect that we won't be getting nearly as many as we might need... 
---
Look up GET OUT OF MY FOREST on youtube, theres a level 5 shaman wrecking just like that guy
---
Yeah I definitely will. WoWs got some sweet music in it. The epic music of Ironforge or SW, the gentle melody of Elwynn, the wildness of SFK. 
---
I absolutely love the extreme use of weird time signatures too, like 7/4 or 5/4, I don’t think I’ve seen a single video game utilize them as often or as well.
---
ICC was an amazing raid, but imo so are many of modern wow's raids. Raids have never really been the problem in wow (with some exceptions like ToC maybe), it's the reward systems built around them.
---
I didn't play alliance in vanilla, what's the correct level range?
---
It is hard to make money with enchanting compared to Alchemy and one of you is going to want leatherworking to make gear for you.  More specifically, at 60 you can clean up by farming Devilsaurs and making the gloves/ pants which sell for a ton.
---
I'm so glad you picked up on those time signatures too! I completely agree that wow makes amazing use of them! 
---
I agree with you. It's sad rly.
---
Think I'm gonna level a rogue now. 
---
I think you'll find that people who don't play games generally don't become game developers.
---
Now, the business people who actually pull the strings behind most major game studios these days are a completely different story.
---
This game is literally suppose to be a war against factions, if you read the lore you’d understand why.
---
The horde need to settle on Azeroth because their world is doomed, if they don’t find suitable farm land their children will die and they will perish.
---
The alliance are fighting to protect their lands, or they will perish.
---
If you came across the opposite faction member and you are a commander “high level” would you hesitate and spare a foot soldier “low level”? No you would give him 1 swift blow. And if the gods keep reviving him? Guess what, he dies again and again and again. This is war Nancy....war.
---
Who needs consumables when you're a warlock? I'm kidding i'll bring water because I dont want healers to hate me.
---
Exactly
---
I want to buy a classic/vanilla wow map poster for my computer room anyone know where to find a good quality one?
---
Hunter
---
1. Easiest/Fastest leveler (maybe #2 in speed to a mage, but far easier)
---
2. Best at finding quest NPCs
---
3. Feign Death avoids repair bills
---
4. If you get the jump on a Warrior or Rogue, they're pretty much done for.
---
5. Nice balance of DoTs and Cleaves for multi-target fights.
---
6. Nice amount of utility in terms of Stings (able to drain mana or reduce melee stats).
---
7. Best at kiting a single enemy due to the large amount of instant spells with 35-41 yard max range, and Aspect of the Cheetah.
---
8. You can get a few different abilities with specific pet families.  Turtles get a shield CD, birds get a Demo Shout (that stacks with the real version), wolves get an AoE melee damage boost, Wind Serpents can attack from range, Scorpids give an extra poison (which makes it harder to dispel your stings), and boars get charge + immobilize.
---
9. Most in-depth class building with the interaction between hunter and pet.  (Good if you like the RP and extra content, bad if you don't want to do the work).  I'm talking about going out and learning new pet abilities, as well as the pet training points you have to balance.
---
10. You're required for raids because of tranq shot.
---
11. Nobody else is fighting you for your primary weapon.
---
12. Your pet can peel mobs off of you when you're running away.
---
Isn't it sad that everyone takes it for granted that Activision Blizzard won't spend the money needed to hire enough CS employees? It's not even up for discussion, it's a forgone conclusion that they won't.
---
That being said, there are still other solutions. A simple "no loot trading" option is very workable. Just be careful distributing loot, and if you make a mistake, it's on you.
---
Other options include everyone in the group voting on whether or not a piece of loot can be traded (so it can't be done secretly), and other such systems, but personally I am extremely skeptical of any of these since it will take development to implement, and I highly doubt Activision Blizzard will pay for the development needed to implement any new features.
---
The only reason we have loot trading as it is to begin with is because it's an existing system which has already been developed.
---
I was an armorsmith in Vanilla. It was pretty useless, I wish I picked engineering.
---
Druid.
---
There are addons that, once the loot window is open, will automatically loot everything. With some you can even create filters, organize your bags by item type, delete things by item type, sell things by item type, etc.
---
I'm not familiar with Legion or retail so I don't know what's possible with the new API.
---
I know polymorph lasts the full duration on the server I'm on.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Could be a server bug.
---
Level 16/17-22, granted i saw plenty of people run until almost 30, I was always done running by level 20. Sorry always bothered me when people on private servers tried to make it a level 18 minimum dungeon when it most certainly is not.  
---
??????????????????????
---
What the hell is going on here? What's wrong with loving Cata? It was absolutely revolutionary, added new content to the old zones, updated old and outdated graphics... it was my favorite expansion.
---
Why the hell do you think you can remove my post? There are clearly people that think Vanilla can't stand on its own and needs WotLK or other expansions to survive. I don't think they should stop there. I want to play my favorite expansion again.
---
Gnome warrior, gnome to break snares and slows, alliance for paladin freedoms. Warrior is plenty mobile with charge and intercept, and hamstrings to slow their enemies.
---
I wouldn't be a fan of a PVP season in Classic, but I had another idea regarding seasons: seasonal servers. I play Path of Exile, which is a diablo-like ARPG, and the thing that draws people back over and over are seasons (called leagues). What if we had standard classic servers as core, and Blizz would release these seasonal servers where people could do new characters and try to reach goals as fast as possible. I haven't given any thought how long a classic wow season would last, what's the end goal (or is it personal for everyone) and whatnot. People have been thinking what happens when classic "ends", whether they add new classic content for move forward to TBC, but I think many people would enjoy some sort of seasonal stuff.
---
For those non-mage plebs.
---
I used to hang outside Org on my dwarf rogue, watch pvp enabled horde duel and then backstab the loser, pop vanish and run. It would be so quick some people wouldn't even know what happened, others would spam aoe trying to find me.
---
It wasn't skillful or clever, but dammit it was fun
---
So I didn't is all the time in Vanilla.
---
I imagine one day this had to happen. John spends all day at work at a job he hates. He's just dreaming of getting home and eacaping to WoW.  When he gets home his wife starts nagging him about shit he said he would do. His kids are acting like assholes. He says he will only be on for a little bit. He logs in to Southshore ready to get some XP. I kill him. Over and over, relentlessly. He literally can not play the game. His wife comes into the computer room. "You said just a little bit, you need to get off your stupid game-" and he just clocks her.
---
That's why Vanilla was magical.
---
With hunters you can never know.
---
So your saying
---
&gt;your PC on idle (not sleep) already uses up to 75% of it's total power draw
---
is:
---
&gt;It's one of the basics when it comes to conventional setups.
---
Idle means no foreground/background activity at all, how can a computer use "up to" 75% of it's total power draw while being idle?
---
Maybe you mean light load? Browser, music, legacy wow 1.12.1... Even in this case, what you say may be true for old machines with CPUs like 6502 at 980KHz or similar from that era, those would draw power at a constant rate at all times.
---
Recent CPUs rated at \~95W only draw 7-15W while idling, the GPU capabilities at a bare minimum or even halted (when the display(s) turns off, the GPU stops rendering the desktop), and the MoBo maybe a bit more than the CPU? You can't expect a system on idle or light load to require "up to" 75% of it's total power draw, it just doesn't make any sense.
---
I would say "up to" 75% power draw is high load. What would be the difference between light, medium and high load then?
---
The Classic client is built upon the 7.x client, though.
---
This is legit the only reason I'm playing vanilla.

1. lold
---
not really if I look at DPS charts from MC / BWL content
---
At the top of my head I'm thinking warrior. I could be totally overseeing something, but can't really think of anything that you'd consider a chore as a warrior.
---
Top tier dps. Not the best dps in the raid.
---
Fast OH for crits and rage baby lets go!
---
We're spending most our lives living in an Amish Paradise
---
Just to clarify the pet call/revive.
---
In classic when your pet dies it stays where it dies, just like a pc corpse.   You must be fairly close to the pet to revive it just like someone trying to rez a player corpse.
---
That's the reason sometimes you need to use the pet call command. It will port your dead pet close to you so you can rez it.
---
I see someone got to STV on a PVP server and quit like an Alliance dog.
---
Warrior, paladin, hunter, shaman, rogue, druid, mage, warlock, priest
---
&gt; Mana classes arent good for me, 
---
Warrior, ~~paladin, hunter, shaman~~, rogue, ~~druid, mage, warlock, priest~~  
---
&gt; i just cant manage them but warrior is too immobile and stricted for me.  
---
~~Warrior, paladin, hunter, shaman~~, rogue, ~~druid, mage, warlock, priest~~  
---
&gt; I kinda like rogue but its sooo mainstream.  
---
~~Warrior, paladin, hunter, shaman, rogue, druid, mage, warlock, priest~~  
---
&gt; I kinda like paladin as well. 
---
~~Warrior,~~ paladin, ~~hunter, shaman, rogue, druid, mage, warlock, priest~~  
---
&gt; But afaik paladins dont have a dps class and i dont like healing or tanking.  
---
According to my 100% infallible and proven method of finding a class for anyone based on criteria, you're screwed. Have fun in Classic!
---
the guy now has a map linked for each video in the description
---
Yeah man, that's the main reason I'm considering tailoring. Can always drop it down the track, but I'm not really a min-maxer so might just hold onto it.
---
You can play a pirvate server to get your classic craving taken care of like me until official launches
---
well if I look at recent logs from K3 Vanguard, we have a mage at nr 14, and then the other mages nr 20, 21 and 25. so outclassed by almost all rogues, hunters and warriors, including the tank.
---
how is that top tier? and that's even with ZG released. in AQ40/Naxx maybe, but so far what i've seen from mages/locks in early raids, pretty low dps.
---
When will it be released ?
---
Samesies. I don’t even care that I’m going to do the exact same character down to the hair style when Classic gets released. Still having a good time. 
---
TIL: Mages are bad dps.
---
When does the classic release?
---
Unless you're a tauren flying to Thunder Bluff. In which case you can go make a pizza from scratch and be eating it just as you arrive in TB.  
---
Well, the one thing I would suggest is going human for the diplomacy buff 10% faster rep grind doesn't seem like much but if your going for THAT many reps its going to add up.
---
It's far more risky imo
---
Mainhand is preferably slower, offhand speed doesnt matter.
---
However since whirlwind and overpower account for a small percentage of your dmg, it's usually better to have a fast weapon with better stats/higher dps than a slower wep with lower stats.
---
I have also wondered between the two classes, but warlock seems to be the pick for me. It has more interesting playstyle, better looking armor sets and is godly in PvP unlike hunter afaik.
---
i think it also only applies on greed rolls, not need rolls
---
Hi, /u/rackflowseidon
---
Hahaha oh man... I remember being in RFD/RFK/ST or something and having all party members die and evasion tanking to get the last like 5% of a boss. Rogues can tank!
---
I'm not happy about it either. but saying "mages are top dps in all raid tiers" is simply not correct and will give people who don't know which class to take a false impression aboutwhat they're choosing.
---
btw they aren't bad, just not as itemized in the early game. also afaik the fire specc in aq40 &amp; naxx is a huge boost as well, on top of all the +hit% gear
---
I was being sarcastic. They by definition are still top tier dps. But really it is debatable. The op told me to post my pros of my class. And I believe mages are top tier dps for all raid tiers. If they are not top tier dps, why do raids bring so many?
---
[removed]
---
Mass effect 1-3? The Dragon Age series? Any of the Fallout games? 
---
Pretty sure it was about 20 yards. I did a fair amount of ganking in low levels and never had problems escaping from 60s unless I was in a stupidly close quarters area or there were 5+ of them corpse camping me so I had no safe spawn area
---
If you're talking live then the only way it lasts 60 seconds is on an npc 
---
Why is this? Wasn’t escape artist always just for snares or did it get out of stuns too in vanilla? I played gnomes a bit back then but my memory is it was always just snares
---
Id like to see that too. But the reality is that most guilds will focus on min maxing for raid clear times. The talent and gear imbalances were bad, and the unconventional specs wont be that sought after. There will be guilds that are more lax about the hardcore element and will accept non optimal raid compositions though, we just have to find them.
---
Many guilds and PuGs will not care or be cool with filling slots with meme specs. The game is more than doable with them too. 
---
I have tried, but I've never enjoyed these videos. They're just not for me. Songs, scenes, stories. Never liked it.  
---
With that said, I want them to return too. They're a throwback to a simpler time.  
---
What you mean mana classes? In terms of healing or killing? Some classes like Warlock, Druid and Priest use mana in important situation but almost never drink while soloing. 
---
If you wanna heal, I do suggest Priest. If you just wanna dps go Hunter or Warlock. If you wanna be real snowflake go druid. 
---
I disagree. You’ve experienced a big part of the game but you definitely didn’t experience it ‘thoroughly’. To me and a lot of others the game really starts at 60, before that, gear, balance, the economy, and skill barely matter at all. Yeah it takes a long time but the leveling process is just the intro to the game for me. 
---
Spriest is one of the best 1v1 classes in the game. 1v2 isn't too bad either. Spriest does well in wpvp, especially since they dont have downtime while leveling with talents.
---
I think it's a case of Classic with loot trading and WoW Tokens or no Classic at all. They're not going to change their infrastructure or hire more people for what's essentially a goodwill project. 
---
I mean, it's a nice thought. Having a branching alternate universe expansion that kept the rpg elements, unforgiving gameplay and item progression. It wouldn't kill lore. The lore already established different timelines. But could current blizzard do it successfully? Nah, probably not. I'm down for 2 years of classic wow either way. I'd be down for 2 yrs of tbc after. Beyond that is too long to concern myself with personally. 
---
This summer.
---
Hunter will do better early game, but warlock scales way better with gear (PvE). In PvP, both are great. 
---
I played warlock in vanilla and intend to play it again in Classic. One word: Deathcoil.
---
It doesn’t really matter, it’s pretty balanced. Hunter/Druid/lock are probably the 3 least powerful lvl 60 classes, but they’re also the 3 best at levelling so people will definitely be playing them.
---
what does "top tier dps" mean to you?
---
Lock least powerful 60? In what way / world lol
---
I think youd like shaman as long as you are either ok with raiding as resto or just sticking to pvp. Unfortunately the vanilla classes were balanced like ass but shaman is fun as hell and barely feels like a mana using class.
---
I never cared for playing Druid’s too much, but the class diversity is great. I love hybrids and druids are one of the best types.
---
Boomkins done right are incredibly OP. Plus they’re relatively easy to gear up. You can tank dungeons and grind out that dps gear easily enough. On e you’re a badass boomkin everyone wants one.
---
20 stacks of food will kill your bag space!

---
Mage:
---
1) Many mages in raids, lots of competition for tier sets pieces
---
2) PvE - Frostbolt, repeat
---
3) PvP - Glass cannon without the cannon until you are geared
---
4) Leveling - Kill, drink, kill, drink
---
5) ...If you aren't camped by hunters and rogues while trying to quest or grind that is
---
6) "INT PLZ"
---
7) "PORT PLZ"
---
8) "FOOD PLZ"
---
9) "WATER PLZ"
---
10) Being yelled at that you aren't keeping your target polymorphed when some idiot put a dot on it
---
11) Arcane isn't really a spec, just an amplifier for fire or frost
---
12) Can't be an Orc (GOD RACE, ORCS FTW!)
---
Hunter is less fuss than warlock but not no fuss. Its easier to gear a hunter, and giving pet food is less annoying than soul shard farming, summoning, etc.
---
No changes
---
any tiny change will have a ingame effect that is not just QOL
---
well things that alter ingame mechanics
---
things like ui changes shouldn't matter.
---
It’s good in zg/aq gear but in greens/blues/tier1 (which is what a lot of people will only ever get) it’s probably the weakest class in pve and pvp.
---
I choose Vanilla for 2 reasons:
---
1) TBC introduced flying mounts which really changed the feel of the world for the worse IMO
---
2) TBC had a lot of daily quest stuff which I find very boring.
---
TBC had a lot of really great things, but I think those two reasons outweigh any good it brought.
---
Agreed from a lore perspective. But gameplay wise? That’s kind of like a modern day infantry soldier fighting against an Ancient Roman soldier. Theres no way the Roman is going to win. And killing someone like that (especially without gaining honor) shouldn’t make anyone feel special. But again, I have no problem with being ganked and I’d be a liar if I said I don’t do it too haha.
---
The only thing throwing me off of hunter is from what ive heard they dont get many raid spots and they tend to be one of the most popular classes.
---
I get ya. I love em tho because of how diverse and adaptable they are. I still remember 30 min long 1v1 wPvP with other druids during vanilla nd tbc. Any other class if I couldnt kill I could hide from it. Hunters were the toughest to get away from though.
---
Weak in raids with that gear for sure. Weak in pvp? Definitely not. I would argue warlock is one of the least dependent classes for pvp - at least for world. SL isn't an amazing BG spec, but they at least have an incredibly viable world farm / pvp spec in soul link. Requires next to no gear, and in pvp blues they will be 1v1ing players in full t1 and even many classes in t2. 
---
1.12
---
I would do this but i know it would burn me out and the idea of losing my character is not a fun one
---
though maybe i should reconsider trying it but just casually
---
Beat em, many times over at this point.
---
Well I'd be glad to join if the raid times do end up fitting with my schedule. Are you going to have some sort of poll or discussion in your Discord channel about it? If so, may I be invited?
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I was worried about the same thing, but honestly, what else are you doing right now? May as well level as practice. Remember the good quests, where shit is at etc. I get bored of leveling (around 41 right now on my enh shammy) and log off. Only to find that there's literally nothing better to play, and then log back in and keep going. 
---
What’s the best private server out right now? Asking for a friend..
---
I’ve played everything but Naxx and AQ40 on a private server for the past couple years and I still disagree. The problem with the modern game is that the real game starts at max. That’s what I love about Classic, is that the entire game is the game. 
---
That’s not to say that doing fun UBRS/ZG runs, or more stressful raids like BWL aren’t part of the game, or even a big chunk. 
---
I’d also argue that dungeons absolutely take skill, or at least fundamental understandings of your class/role and a heap of situational awareness. Most of the time, I find a run of SFK to be much more demanding than Molten Core, or even a 60 5 man like Dire Maul. 
---
It’s the fact that there’s more to do still that makes it a good game. Not doing all of it in a matter of 2 years doesn’t discount any bodies opinions on this forum, is what I’m trying to convey. 
---
Ty man
---
I dont remember that being the way it worked... but I’ve heard enough people say it worked that way to half convince me it’s true :/
---
And that doesn’t seem like it would be an issue... but then, doesn’t that not solve the problem it’s trying to fix? Like, dude needs something accidentally and can still trade it? If it’s a greed, then most wouldn’t even care if they traded it to the person who wanted it anyways.
---
Yeah, it’s simply a copy paste from the modern game, which have 100% different play styles and virtues. I can handle the game not being 1:1 Vanilla, sharding sucks but whatever if it’s not permanent, but the one thing that can potentially ruin the game for its entirety is loot trading.

My main issue with expansions is how they throw away previous content. When there is Outland, why should you be in Azeroth? All previous expansion late game content is outdated the day each new expansion drops. I propose lateral expansion with Naxx as the power level cap:
---
-Level 60 cap forever
---
-Flying should never be added
---
-Two continents to maintain a concentration of players
---
-Naxx gear will remain the gear cap. No new items will be better than Naxx gear.
---
-Addition of new zones/raids/dungeons to existing continents. Exact implementation does not matter but here are some suggestions:
---
--Karazhan - Raid as difficult or more difficult than Naxx. Drops Naxx level gear. 
---
--Grim Batol - Raid on the level of AQ40
---
--Uldum - Late game zone
---
--Mount Hyjal - Late game zone
---
-Updates adding leveling zones and dungeons to supplement the current leveling experience. The leveling efficiency and loot of these zones should be the same as existing ones.
---
-Arenas added
---
Balance wise, BC was my favorite. Some elements of BC should be added:
---
-Hybrids viable in more than one role but still not better than specialized classes. Paladins and druids as tanks, shamans as dps, etc.
---
-Addition of some BC abilities in the talent tree. Shadowstep comes to mind.
---
Im going with warlock myself. I feel like its the best class to play while still being able to talk to my wife during raids/dungeons....hunters have to watch shot timers and pets more.
---
Im a woman too but wife's happiness is still &gt; than wow. 👅
---
Holy shit im jealous as fuck. Nice job.
---
I mean, thats not entirely true either. 70s were ALWAYS around helping lower level friends, or running to Kara, CoT, ZA... yes, 70s were disproportionately in Outland doing Outland things, but they were still around. Maybe its just anecdotal, but me and my friends spent time running around Azeroth and having more fun there than Outland half the time
---
Hunters gear up fast and are strong until they drop off midway through BWL.  I had no trouble keeping my raid spot into Naxx and the rotation is far more interesting.
---
Warlocks are also fun as hell (I raided as one in BC through Sunwell), but are a pain in the ass to gear up until BWL/ZG releases.  Here is the BIS list for the first phase of Classic, most of it is not from raiding- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XufUpGSKHrmlDq3VCQMBDap7gjNk47MS-XILyj3bVaA/edit#gid=118447046

---
Depends their reasoning and how many people have also said no. 
---
Yeah, I'm going to have to balance WoW and spending time with the wife too.
---
A lot of the things that killed WoW for me started in TBC, daily quests, generic dungeon rewards (tokens), daily lockouts on dungeons (acceptable for raids, not for dungeons), flying mounts, homogenization of classes/buffs and balancing around Arena.  
---

In their TBC state, some of these were somewhat acceptable to a small degree and at least some small thought went into them. Not a million dailies, Heroic Dungeons were actually Heroic (early on before overgearing and nerfs), flying mounts were slower than regular 100% mounts until you had an extreme amount of Gold, encouraging you to still use the regular mount for short/direct trips but it it still felt bad and they just made it worse from then on.  
---
Arena I'm torn on because it was great fun but I felt like it was another thing designed you keep people logging in to do a specific activity like dailys with the way points worked weekly and then seasonally.
---
&gt; Any of the Fallout games *that weren't made by Bethesda.*
---
A friend back in the day also taught me that you can farm shards days im advance and store them in your bank....so you dont really need to spend time farming them, just save the ones from normal dungeons/ grinding.
---
&gt; you can really roll through certain enemies, especially if they are low armour.
---

Warrior is the absolute masterclass of Vanilla WoW. In end game gear, warrior is best in PvP, best tank in PvE, best dps in PvE, in demand, fun to play...
---
their only downside is that they're hard to level (which can be mitigated if you know what you're doing) and they're expensive to upkeep.
---
But on pservers, far more people play and understand the power of warriors and aren't afraid of leveling them.
---
I wonder how it will be in Classic, though.
---
Not as crystal clear as you might think. A faster off hand uses up your flurry charges faster and flurry uptime is crucial to rage generation. The slower the offhand, the easier it is to keep flurry up. You will do the same amount of BT and WW in a given time (on CD pending you aren't rage starved), but a slower OH will change the ratio of white hits:BT/WW in x seconds giving you a higher chance to crit and proc flurry within the 3 swings that you already have flurry up.
---
Example: 
---
If you have a 2.6sp MH and a 1.3sp OH you will strike 3 times every 2.0 seconds (30% faster than 2.6 due to flurry), so you have to crit once every 2.0 seconds to have a 100% flurry uptime.
---
If you have a 2.6sp MH and a 2.6sp offhand you will strike 3 times every 4.0 seconds (30% faster than 5.2 due to flurry), so you ave to crit once every 4.0 seconds to have a 100% flurry uptime.
---
That is a huge difference considering the BT and WW cooldowns never change. You can get 0.33 BT in per 3 swings with the 1.3sp OH and 0.66 BT in per 3 swings with the 2.6sp OH. The more yellow strikes per 3 white strikes, the better chance you will crit to keep flurry up.
---
In retail it was capped to 10 seconds. Playing on a private server won't always be consistent 
---
Shut up and make me water like a good little vending machine.
---
r/battlestations
---
I played both during Vanilla retail and play on a pserver.
---
Judging by the incredible ignorance regularly displayed the by members of this sub and the general infatuation with flying mount expansions like WotLK, it's safe to say that the majority of people on this sub haven't played Vanilla.
---
Why do you have a better chance of getting a crit with a yellow than a white attack? Isn't crit chance the same, and unaffected by glancing blows?
---
Makes me wonder what each class aesthetic would be for a gaming room.
---
On the current largest private server, there is a dedicated guild of people who camp noobs in redridge on 8 hour shifts, pretty much every day. It has made redridge pretty much unplayable for Alliance while leveling, they camp your corpse and have somebody camping the spirit healer so you literally cannot escape if you're dumb enough to actually go there. 
---
Yeah every so often some 60s come in and wipe them for a while, but it doesn't make a difference in the long run. People should expect this to happen to a similar degree in Classic. 
---
Except speed doesn't matter for HS damage - it's a flat additive damage move, and on next attack instead of "instant" (aka extra weapon swing) like WW.
---
If anything, a faster weapon is better for HS, because you can get more HS in a certain period of time, but that only matters when you have so much rage for it to make a big difference. Which, while leveling, is not significant enough to make you choose a faster weapon just for HS
---
Lmao
---
Faster off hand may be better, but your logic is way off
---
Even sub with good dagger ambush spec and imp sap. People underestimate subs solo play but it’s among the best.
---
Pretty sure the meta will influence class choices a lot for people that care to do a little bit of research before Classic is out. Unless a Classic beta reveals that something is really off on private servers making the available raiding data irrelevant, but I doubt it.
---
Now it's hard to say if people actually picking their class based on the meta will be a majority or if most retail tourists will just pick blindly like we did back in 2004, eventually leading to some class diversity but also making the players disadvantaged by the poor vanilla's class balance more likely to quit early because there's no future patch to look forward to for some improvement, everything is set in stone.
---
I expect most people rolling hybrids will be very disappointed to realize that Druids, Shamans and Paladins are nothing like their retail versions where they can pick from different builds and roles. I played a Druid in vanilla so I know exactly what to expect from level 1 to Naxxramas and I'm sure as hell not falling for that trap again. If I'm going to invest a lot of time in WoW again, I'm 100% going to pick meta to make it worth my time.
---
Starbucks lets anyone join their internet connection now.
---
Live to win!
---
This logic is incorrect because your ratio of swings per flurry charges are the same regardless of weapon speeds - 3:1. You may crit more often with faster weapons, but you have an equally smaller window to get a crit to keep flurry up.
---
You wrote exactly what I was thinking
---
Save account name on login screen!
---
Sounds like at some point it was changed to greed rolls only? I didn’t play enough past Cata to know for sure, but back then it definitely worked for need rolls.
---
Especially for most pre-Naxx content on 1.12 talents. There will be a lot more room for inefficiency than there was during real vanilla. Meaning if a guild has the choice between a meme spec character and waiting 30 minutes for a real spec to get online, it is probably faster to go with the meme. 
---
You didn’t even like Fallout 3? Fallout 4 I can understand, since it was pretty disappointing. I thought Fallout 3 was fantastic though! Granted, I never played 1 &amp; 2. New Vegas was pretty solid but ultimately I enjoyed 3 the most probably.
---
Problem is that in PoE, it takes about 12 hours for an experienced player to hit endgame during a new season. Seasons in WoW would need to be 2 years long. 
---
Farming god? As a warrior? 
---
I would hate to see what the priest one would be :'D
---
I liked the classes best in tbc, warrior talents got a lot more fun druid got better. 
---
I disliked dks, &amp; blood elves tho. Only played horde side though.
---
I'm also of the opinion that Karazhan was the greatest thing ever.
---
The crit % chance is indeed the same, but you have more time for yellow strikes (more yellow strikes = more chances to crit) within the 3 white swings until the flurry proc drops if you are using slower weapons.
---
level quickly
---
How fast are we talking?
---
Fallout 1 and 2 were the best IMO, didn't like that they turned it into a FPS
---
You sound like a  tauren druid I murdered on nostal a lot hahaha
---
Go to work. I’m no longer 14, I have a mortgage bro lmao. 
---
You have a point. It's not a massive difference either way, as offhand has lower % hit compared to mainhand but you still want a fast offhand on the chance of getting your crits ASAP, which is the main benefit. Getting flurry in the first 2 seconds rather than 4 is really impacting in pvp where encounters are burst and cc oriented
---
I highly doubt he is asking for PvP theory here.
---
True! And still, faster weapons are tried and true to be BiS for offhand fury warriors in pve
---
People will always take the path of least resistance - ideally they want top DPS classes, but realistically many guilds will take what they can get for 40 man progress.
---
Be the person who shows up early, consistently, and prepared - you'll have a place.
---
yeah but most humans are stupid
---
I just want to roleplay in an Azeroth that doesn't have Horde Blood Elves or Alliance Worgen. The lore/story was way better in Vanilla and I'm excited to join in on that.
---
Start playing Warcraft 3 to get ready for reforged!! Its coming out this year, greatest RTS every created.
---
Siiiick
---
60 in 1 week is the goal for me. Oof
---
That's amazing. Do you have plans for when it rains?
---
That is usually when talking about late end game raiding which I addressed in my longer post in this comment section somewhere.
---
Preraid-bis has ironfoe/felstriker on the list simply because the procs are totally op. If you could DW ironfoe it would probably come out on top.
---
More chances to crit, but also more chances to not crit and eat up a flurry charge. If your crit chance is not more than a third, you're net eating up flurry charges, right?
---
I never played a melee dps class at a high level of raiding in vanilla, what is the typical crit chance, is it usually over a third?
---
Not going for records or anything, just want a somewhat smooth experience without completely poopsocking. ~7 days played is my goal, too far out to know what that would be in real time.
---
?
---
My practice runs have me level 31 at the 24 hour mark.
---
For sure, ironfoe is incredible. Can't imagine it outclassing ZG sword set though- but this is just ruling out Felstriker for 95% of people. Not very feasible to try for- ironfoe is much more obtainae correct? Looking at 5-10% droprate on IF and 2% on Felstriker iirc
---
Oxhorn. The Hacklemans. I NEED them to come back.
---
honestly, no. the atmosphere was there, but everything else was just... wrong. BoS as a bunch of do-gooders? annoying as shit, unkillable kids? fucking *vampires*? Bethesda completely ignoring every roleplaying element that made Fallout 1-2 so great was just the final kick in the balls.
---
Fallout: New Vegas, however, is quite excellent.
---
Once you get intercept (and assuming you have tact. mastery and good macros), things change. You can definitely kill a lot of people. You start dishing out pretty good damage too after the whirlwind axe and assuming you keep your main hand up to date.
---
I think Ironfoe may be as low as 2% as well.
---
Oh Jesus. It is pvp it's just not a fair fight. Getting ganked is part of the experience and makes for a better game overall.
---
&gt;2.Your cat form isn’t as good as being a rogue
---
While leveling, it's better.
---
Mmm, Widowmaker. 
---
I get the shakes in EVE Online PvP
---
Upon looking on one database, it says ironfoe was .6% and fel was 1% . 
---
It will be on fire come summer
---
Send me a cutting of the monstera, I can't find one anywhere. 
---
Thanks so much! I hope I've managed to patch up all holes in the old roof!
---
2 mages with no mana engaged on melee combat speed weapon will decide the winner. Welcome to the show.
---
Nah, only white hits eat flurry charges, yellow does not.
---
I’m doing the same thing man, stocking up on snacks and planning for a long session. Unfortunately non of my irl friends are as hyped as me
---
Same here  
---
And after years of being forced to play complete garbage like Ark Survival Evolved and Rust with my low class friends, it's going to be such a breath of fresh air coming to WoW PvP servers where I know I'm not going to be killed because of some bullshit glitch or terrible game balance or terrible performance and lag. It's either because the other person is better than me or it just a low-life one shotting low level characters, who is still easily taken care of (and quite fun to take care of too).
---
But for now it's all we got :(
---
My son thats a mitherfuckingndragon. Get use to get gndragon as a boss almost everypatch now.
---
Instead of bitching about something Blizz is considering everyone could do something constructive and find solutions to stop abuse. 
---
1. Put a cool down on uses. Once per 24/72 hours.
---
2. Implement automated systems that recognize players that abuse the feature. Like if a person always plays with someone else across multiple characters and uses loot trade too much.
---
3. Make loot tradeable only while in the instance.
---
4. Require a vote on loot trades so everyone knows someone traded an item.
---
Im sure there are other ways to deter abuse of loot trading.
---
Oh yeah! I'd love to do a Mage one. Old parchment in dusty stacks, precious stones, viles of this and that. Oh, and old weird and wonderful contraptions for weights and measures.  I'm trying to theme my nursery with different fantasy settings, this room in particular will be my office! What class will you be rolling?
---
Amazing!
---
that shit like this that makes me so excited for blizzard server. no more excessing griefing
---
Are they really that bad in pvp until bwl?
---
Ye probably. But if CRZ is in the game im 100% out, that shit is cancer.
---
The int buff really bothers me. There's always someone whining about his missing AI, but nobody ever mentions how much it drains your mana pool. Like I get that you're upset about missing that extra 450 mana and negligible crit, but this is no MotW that you can just cough up whenever you want.
---
I DESPISE world pvp and think anyone who enjoys it is plain stupid, but in what way shouldn't what they do be allowed? It's in the game and is intended gameplay, I hate this new approach by games where some stuff are prohibited and punishable. Words I can understand, but actions? I myself am for a more laissez faire approach by game companies when it comes to anything but word harrassments. 
---
The Witcher series? Shadowrun series? Divinity Original Sin 1-2? KotOR 1-2? 
---
fucking making guild to corpse camp a low lvl town 24/7? sorry but thats autism level of excessive IMO
---
Yes it is
---
Did my 10 day trial in vanilla (which does not count) and started my actual account in TBC. Super excited. Me and 3 of my long time best friends who also played in TBC along with one who just started in Retail and 1 old friend (who we only recently reconnected with) are all going to play Classic servers together. All playing wow again as friends while experiencing Vanilla for the first time. Gunna make our own casual small guild, taking it slow making sure we run every dungeon together at least once, stopping for pvp at the top of each level-bracket.
---
No crazy min-maxing (not that it's wrong to do that), no hard core raiding, just 6 friends experiencing Vanilla and savoring the experience.  It's going to be great. I'm so excited. 
---
The one guy has a pet called Redridge B0ss and you can never fucking find him to actually kill him. Such a fucking lardass
---
If you live in Australia I'll send you a potted one!
---
We cant go back and unlearn all the information that is available. BUT it is going to be very interesting to see how blizzards data compares to private servers data.
---
This could alter the game in a major major way. Spell co efficients, boss resist values drop rates etc etc. While I dont think it will be to far off base of private servers I do think that it will have some effect on people's knowledge of the game. Many of YouTube guides may have to be re written. 
---
Fuckin autism man
---
&gt; Rogues are the most nerfed class in the game. /s if you haven’t seen World of Roguecraft (go watch it)
---
At least they aren't mushrooms.
---
168 hours. 28 days at 6 hours per day, 48 days at 4 hour per day, 84 days at 2 hours per day. I haven't been thinking about this much...
---
Same here man. WC2 was the first game I ever played and I absolutely fell in love with it. This stuff has been hard to watch. 
---
Now it's January and they haven't announced the plans for Starcraft 2's World Championship Series for 2019 yet... It's a bad sign.
---
Glad I'll be able to swim ashore to Classic in the summer.
---
Yeah fuck rogues. It's why I'm playing on a PVE server this time around, or keeping war mode off if they for some insane reason go with that solution.
---
I'm going to main a female tauren shammy. Alt will be a female dwarve shadow priest !!!
---
not what I meant, just too far out to know if ill be busy when it releases
---
Let's hope Activision sees it that way. 
---
It's February now and we don't know what the plans for WCS are... Hopefully I'm just being paranoid, but we'll see.
---
Hit level 60 on every race and every class and solo MC
---
So comfy

I wasn't in a raiding guild.  
---
When I exploited a glitch with plenty of walljumps, etc. to get to the chess event in Karazhan, win it solo, and actually got a piece of epic loot (necklace) I felt like I was the king of the fucking world.
---
Taking 4-5 days off work. Loading up on copious amounts of weed,adderall and healthy snacks.
---
Surprisingly gonna take my time and level fishing/first aid right off the bat. I was thinking that if I'm one of the first on server to farm nightfin's or squid, I farm up a boatload of them and unload then a little later in the servers lifecycle.
---
Or I push that off to level 40 and level mining/engineering as I level. I have always found it more engaging to level professions during the leveling process. Gives me a bit of a break from the grinding.
---
Also, plan on grinding the FUCK, out of the whelps in the wetlands, and the badlands to farm small flame sacs. Gonna stockpile these bad boys for a few levels and unload a few weeks/months down the line.
---
I highly recommend anyone leveling to grind out some levels and scour the AH in the servers beginning of its life cycle. You can easily get things for 1/4th of their value and you resell them after most of the server gets to 60.
---
Im looking foward to the world feeling less silly. Retail has crazy flying pigs and dragons with silly armor . Honestly retail feels like a weird carnival in major cities
---
One shake every 30 seconds :p
---
That's really good time. Do you use a leveling addon ? Ir you know the route that well ?
---
Really amazing corridor. Is it clear roofing or exposed? I want to live there 
---
/r/houseplants
---
I'm hoping to try a RPPVP server if there is an oceanic one. Not expecting serious rp but a little bit here and there will be fun especially as i love having cosmetic sets and fun items like Dartol's rod
---
also rp events sound like fun
---
That's one aspect of world pvp. Don't like it? Play on a pve server. I want the developers to add in something if they don't want that happen instead of just banning people for in game actions. 
---
U right 
---
google excessive
---
None. Being an altaholic was quite hard back in the day. With how long everything takes I'd hardly have the time for more than one character. 
---
I see the hookah.
---
A feeling absolutely irreplaceable. Such chills when the music sets in as you cross this bridge.
---
Netherwing is a PTE(Play Through Expansion) server, meaning they will release WotLK and Cata just like Blizz and not have everyone start at level 1 but your old character gets transfered. I don't think the server will get deleted and that way if Classic doesn't make a TBC server happen you still have a fallback character to play. 
---
That's what vacation days are for.
---
Maybe that's how they wanna experience the game? Just be known as a band of mischiefs who cause trouble for the opposite faction. In this case they can close down a whole zone, sounds cool to me although I'll never experience it. 
---
Thank you! It's a solid roof. I put some opaque skylights in to let some more sunshine through for the plants. I have plenty of space if you want to move in! The other rooms are like indoor jungles :)
---
I was horde and most of my wow time was spent on a pvp server. How else would I know enough to not roll PvP server?
---
It's like you're a really shit Sherlock Holmes.
---
I haven't played in years. What is this thing I'm looking at here? Legit trying to understand what's going on here. 
---
Specifically there for when it's time to level fishing!
---
Is that carpet?
---
You could rig LED's behind bottles of various colored liquids. Get a book shelf in there and stack it up! For some reason have more mirror's than necessary to bounce the light around the room.  
---
I will be playing a warlock..so i guess i just get a BDSM dungeon and a succubus body pillow? Realistically i'm guessing a purple light and lot's of patterns/runes thrown everywhere with reflective tape.
---
It would just be an anger management book next to the desk titled "How to convince DPS not to stand in the fire", and a bunch of "Hang in there" posters.
---
Thanks so much! Don't be jealous, put a few plants around your setup!
---
Not sure why you listed warlocks. Zerker rage is 10s of fear immunity, plus if you're fury you have Deathwish as well. Priests can actually be a bit annoying since you get no rage while damaging their shield. Honestly, druids can fuck your shit with root and proper kiting. I have a fond memory of a druid killing me with just root before diminishing returns. It was about a month after vanilla's launch. Fun times
---
got any black lotus growing in there?
---
I did my fair share of Duskwood and STV camping back in the day but I was never that autistic. 
---
I wish I was rich.  
---
If you think your average 60 warlock won't be able to get bloodvine you must be high.
---
I have my own guide to 30 with a fair bit of grinding, then follow a modified [Jame's Alliance guide](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version) with more grinding spots.
---
Slower means better WW damage (which you'll do a lot of), faster means better rage generation during the execute phase. It's a complicated issue, so I'd say do some research if you want to really suss out the best options.
---
Having said that, it's likely you'll find yourself taking whatever upgrades you can get when fighting for loot so I wouldn't stress too much about what full bis is right away.
---
Wait a minute. Did you shoot this in film or is it a digital filter?
---
Is this the emerald dream?
---
For hunter I'd say take skinning until you have devilsaur sorted, then switch to mining/eng. Herb/alch is a great combo to that as you'll be able to make arcanite.
---
Okay so that whole "do you need this?" thing can't happen in vanilla. It happens in retail because of personal loot. I'm fairly certain that the plan is to use the old group loot system, in which if someone needs the item, they need on it anyway. So no need to get scared of people asking you for your loot. 
---
Also this dude just spent 10 minutes saying "loot trading is a cost reduction method." Which we already knew. I'm pretty sure they straight up said it in the blizzcon classic panel. This isn't news, this isn't an insight, this is just someone pointing out the obvious. 
---
Haha definitely not rich! I own an indoor plant nursery so I have a lot of stuff growing :) It's just a filter on my phone camera, I'm not the best photographer!
---
If it gets people to resub to the game, it's not a goodwill project.  Retail has zero interest for me right now; nothing they could do at this point would make me spend that $15 a month.  But I will be there on launch night for classic.
---
You're confusing TBC prepatch with actual vanilla.
---
Funny how your two examples actually do change the balance of the game, though. High respec cost changes how you spec in the first place. It's also kind of a hybrid tax. You might disagree with it, but it's part of the balance. 
---
Duration on the paladin blessings as well. Increased duration means less mats needed to keep your group buffed, which means lower cost of living for paladins than in actual vanilla. 
---
Keep in mind that gold is power. Gold can buy you crafted gear, it can buy you consumables. 
---
OMG! How am I just now hearing about this?!?! I've logged more hours in WC3 than any other game to date.
---
WAAAAAAAAA

---
1. Shadow Form is awesome

2. Leveling is really easy

I'm expecting a lot of warriors who won't tank their own dungeons trying to form groups. Always a sensible chuckle when I see it. 
---
Rogue's t2 Bloodfang set would like a word with your number 8... :)
---
I just started playing a Druid for the first time and you're totally right haha
---
I quickly learned the recall/flight is the perfect time for crafting a super dank BLT and grabbing a drink
---
For Alliance, it's pretty much impossible to miss STV, since it's right after Duskwood, so it's very natural for them to go there.
---
For horde though... well I never played horde but I image that for completely new player (that just plays on their own without guides just like everyone did back then), it's not obvious thing to go to STV. After all you got there either through zepplin or ship from ratchet. What's more as a new player not knowing the zones, you see STV as another alliance zone.
---
In comparison.
---
On my first char which was human mage. i remember that the first time I leveled up in Kalimdor was only in tanaris which is +40. Before that, whenever I ended up stepping on the ship that would take me to another continent, I would always panic and immediately go back because I didn't want to get lost.
---
looks like it smell so good in there.
---
Going to go ham playing this game lol, I'm pretty hyped

I don't think Blizzard cares even a little bit about FF14.

1. Gnomes

Nothing else needed.  
---
What guild would wait 30 minutes to fill one slot? Just go as 39. Unless it's the tank. But if your tank isn't showing up you're probably not replacing him with a random meme spec boy. 
---
You choose when to gank. Actions have consequences.
---
PvP server life !
---
I was on a rp server where there was very little rp. I think rp servers are the best kept secret. Wpvp still happens on a rp server. It’ll be hard to figure out which ones are best for it at the start. 
---
You know, I'm kinda hoping Blizzard fudges the numbers a bit to fuck the pserver meta. I think pservers use their best guess for a lot of hidden numbers like boss armor/resistances, so just increasing the armor on bosses would be a soft nerf on overpowered melee classes, and there would be no way to know whether it's accurate or not, too, because we can never know the original values. 
---
I'm mostly going to play Classic for what comes next anyway. Whether it's new content or Classic TBC. Vanilla is overhyped imo, the idea of it is great, but gameplay wise it's pretty garbage. Even TBC heroic dungeons are more fun than MC/BWL/ZG. Can't speak for AQ or Naxx as I haven't seen those. I guess I'm playing for AQ, Naxx, and what comes next, then. 
---
Fingers crossed the project doesn't fizzle out within a few months and we get post naxx content. 
---
New Vegas story ripped of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  pretty well.  I always felt fallout was a shitty shooter, and a shitty rpg rolled into one. 
---
I play on a blizzlike server with blizzlike population, 2-2.5k concurrent players.
---
Mods are anal about naming names, even in code or if outright asked, so just DM me for server names.
---
Bloodvine is ZG gear. 
---
Why wait? I'm playing Vanilla WoW on a blizzlike server with blizzlike population, 2-2.5k concurrent players.
---
I've leveled three level 60s already, two of them the same class! Spent more than 2,000 gold on respects and different gear to test things out and theorycraft. Tried out classes and specs to see how I feel. Learned a lot about the game from the hardcore community. Got carried in raids!
---
Still having a blast. If Activision Blizzard doesn't ruin Classic, I'll play Classic for many years. If they do ruin it, at least pservers will always be an option (despite Activision Blizzard's best efforts to shut them down).
---
Very!
---
My issue with arena was the need to balance classes on a small scale, and give both sides the class they were missing.  Kinda killed the separate faction feel. 
---
This is such bullshit. Rogues were imba before 1.12 in 1.12 they are mediocre at best due to weapon normalization you cant make insane crits against equally geared players anymore, only against undergeared scrubs.   
---
Also get yourself a Dispel friend as you dont have cloak of shadows meaning any dot literally makes you obsolete for 20 secs roughly.   
---
Unless its Hunters Mark then you are USELESS for 2 minutes. Or Fearie Fire, then for 45 seconds, rendering half of your toolkit useless.   
---
Imagine if fucking Silence lasted 30 seconds. Thats how this shit feels.   
---
I love Rogues. But this idea that they are as good as they used to be is bullshit after playing on pservers, my full naxxx gear rogue can barely get a 2k crit on a cloth user with ambush or 2.5k with 5c evisc.   
---
Meanwhile full naxxx gear spellcaster still hits you for 3-4k crits.... ranged.   
---
So yea... don't think rogues are godlike like they used to be. you will be surprised
---
A mend pet set? Dawg wudda fuq kinda next lvl shit are u playing?
---
It was most definitely a joke in wotlk. They stepped up their game with Ulduar and ICC which are still two of the best raids ever created to this day, though. 
---
During certain festivals, banks become a literal Disco floor. Because that's a great fit for a medieval fantasy setting.
---
&gt;What guild would wait 30 minutes to fill one slot?
---
Not sure. But if you've got 39 and a meme spec online, would you choose to go with 39 anyway? Maybe you would, but it would just waste your own time. 
---
You ripped off his work, you mean. You should be ashamed of yourself. Anyone wants to see the content, go to the creator's youtube page, don't watch reuploads. 
---
ICC was pretty high up there too, tbh. Every scourge related content is the best content for some reason. 
---
Any choice items to look out for?
---
You'll meet some cool people in game anyway!
---
Yeah, periodic fresh servers seem like the obvious choice, but pvp seasons could go like 3 months or something like that, and just reset. You could maybe call it a pvp ladder or something, but yeah, it gets murky real fast. Frankly, I'm perfectly fine with them never adding any content. There's enough content as it is to play casually for years to come.
---
I absolutely loved that detail when I found it the first time, I had to stay and make sure I caught all of it.
---
Here is a [YouTube ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kxwE8c_9wOk)  for anyone that wants a listen

As long as the results of the voting is hidden until after the closing, I'm all for it. Just gotta make the voting unbiased as possible and uninfluenced by knowing the results. 
---
...? Of course they do. It's another MMORPG. Do you think McDonald's doesn't care about Burger King? I swear some of you have your head so far up your own ass, sometimes. 
---
Just posting to say that Lordaeron lore is absolutely awesome. I too fell in love with the  Warcraft universe thanks to the stories of the Scarlet Crusade, the Forsaken and the Scourge. Discovering the throne whispers was the coolest thing ever, as well as that quest in which you bring Sylvanas back her lost necklace from Ghostlands and watch her break. 
---
I still do that on every horde char, even if I level on another remote area.
---
&gt;if you are a warrior pre-naxx you probably will be
---
Blizzard is using 1.12 itemisation and talents. Fury warrior is one of the best (if not the best?) dps in MC. 
---
He had a spirit healer love interest now, by the way! It’s a new quest chain they added in Cataclysm. I think they’re super cute together. 
---
Also he probably gets free rezzes without the 20% durability loss and the debug, 
---
just wait for TBC man leave classic alone
---
Of course they can do whatever they want. But they are dicks. And they have mental issues. And I'm allowed to think that
---
Feral is great at farming. Even as bear. You get resources up the wazoo. Also they're great 5 man tanks, which is probably most of what I'll be doing when levelling my druid.
---
Yikes at the guild giving a binding to a dps to maintain GM main tank status. 
---
Damn. That is neat.
---
Just get a house 4HEad
---
I’m trying to stay optimistic here, but remember that when they opened servers in Australia - they didn’t offer RP ones at all. 
---
RP servers have one costly mechanism for Blizz: they have to enforce player names. You can’t have a name like “loldroodxx” on RP servers, there are terms of service that forbid non-medieval fantasy names. Reviewing all name complaints has to be done by humans and can’t be automated. 
---
This makes me think they’d try to move away from RP realms. They did say they’d implement loot trading for Classic  for similar reasons - it spares them the manual GM work. 
---
Australia here. No RP/RPPvP servers for retail WoW here unfortunately. I hope this would change in the future, for either Classic or retail.
---
These add-ons didn't exist in vanilla that I'm aware. Unless you can prove otherwise it sounds like it's specific to pservers
---
press enter twice after every line for formatting.
---
It costs money to pay the people tracking who runs pservers, and money to the lawyers to write lawyer shit. Once classic is out, pserver is direct competition, and lost revenue. Definitely more appealing to spend money when you can predict an increase in revenue from it. 
---
I think people who think vanilla pservers will be well and good once Classic launches are in for a rude awakening. 
---
I'm going to be ganking everyone trying to level quickly.  See you in STV boys!
---
The problem is that they get you in combat, you have to change to berserker, bloodrage, intercept, hamstring get 1 hit but they just use cc, blink, etc to get away from you and kill you from afar because you have no way of closing the distance again. 
---
This is amazing. Nice work man.

Normal server trade chat:   
---
WTS woolen bags 50s  
---
RP server trade chat:  
---
I kill da sheep all mornin' mon. Made sum bestest quality woolen bags. They's for sale mon. 50 silvers each. Taz'dingo!  
---
I’ve been playing on RP servers only since day 1, around 12 years ago - mainly Argent Dawn EU.
---
Here is what usually happens: 
---
1. Talking in /s is in-character speak. This is customary and not enforced by Blizzard, and not everyone follows this - but self-proclaimed roleplayers do. You would greet a friend in medieval fantasy lingo and don’t use modern internet acronyms like “lol”, “wtb” etc, unless in a channel. This often happens more in cities, since other zones are shardrd these days. It might be diff in classic, I hope. 
---
2. Some people have RP guilds who throw full-on in character events - battles, feasts, festivals, patrols etc. it can be fun. You communicate to others as your characters. Think about how NPCs sound when you talk to them or quest for them - players use similar style, and adopt the characteristics of their class and race (but let their imagination do some work too). They would often have websites with newspapers and short stories - anything that makes the world feel more immersive.
---
3. Many use addons to write a description of their charcter for others to see. TotalRP is popular. This addons makes it easier to spot a fellow RPer and strike an in-charcter conversation too. 
---
4. Other causal roleplayers would be in regular raiding or PvP guilds, and just throw a sentence here and there in charcter, between boss pulls (“ya want mana buns, mon? Here ya go”). We had a couple of undead rogues who used to discuss what races taste best when cannibalised during bio breaks (gnomes taste like chicken). Anything on /p or /raid or /g is out of charcter and can be used to discuss tactics, logistics etc.
---
5. Lots of players don’t RP at all and choose RP servers for other reasons. One common reason is less retarded names - Blizz enforces  naming policy for RP servers, so you can’t have a name that consists of multiple words, or a celebrity’s name etc. If they respect rule no.1 on the above list, I’m okay with that. 
---
Many non-RPer players just really like Warcraft lore, and RP servers are great for finding friends with the same interest. 
---
6. Pr0n. For some. This is the internet, and rule 34 applies, like anywhere else. 
---
I hope this clarifies things a bit. There’s a Warcraft roleplay subreddit here too btw. 
---
No Shaman/Paladin posts :thinking:
---
is there any risk of getting banned?
---
All opinion man. Fallout 3 is by far my favorite Fallout. My problem with New Vegas is just the fact that it has such a boring world. I loved the huge destroyed DC area in 3, which sadly doesn't really have an alternative in NV, besides maybe Freeside or whatever it was called, which I found really boring in comparison.
---
I was one of those people who only had one character back then. I'm looking to jump into the other classes that I never got to experience at endgame during vanilla. 
---
Guess one could say that I'm looking to flesh out my vanilla/classic experience. 
---
Also, it'll be a change of the pace from the mess that is called BFA. 
---
getting ready for classic
---
Funny that you're literally the kind of ignorant Blizzard drone i was laughing at.
---
You see, this brilliant logic breaks down and falls flat on its ass when you look outside your vanilla bubble and realise that live expansion pservers have been in operation for the last decade, even while they were in "direct competition" with Blizzard and whatnot.
---
Not to mention that a multi-billion dollar company like Blizzard has an army of lawyers and legal experts and "money for lawyer shit" (lul) isn't a problem over enforcing copyrights and brands. 
---
100% same here. started leveling on private to 12, but cant keep on doing so cazse i know, all will be gone in summer. currently i cabt play anything, cause it feels so boring and meaningless. just waiting for classic
---
I've played on RP servers for many years and I have little intention of changing that anytime soon. Let me explain some things that make RP servers different from PVP and PVE servers. I will not be talking about RPPVP per se, but I imagine they are very similar (although not speaking from experience in that end).
---
1- People in RP servers are nicer and more mature. This is a generalization; you will find an asshole anywhere, but I have found that people in RP servers are usually much nicer than those from other servers. For the most part, people are less competitive and find enjoyment in areas other than BGs and Raids. This leads to people being more willing to help, teach, or even carry in some situations.
---
2- RP servers' economy is slightly different from other servers. You see, in most servers, if an item is bad, your best bet is to not bother slapping it in the AH. In RP servers, however, people are particularly keen in wanting to look good. Pre-Transmogrification, many of us would simply carry our "RP set" in our bags, composed of gear that looks good and is fitting to who are characters are. Therefore, good-looking BoEs, even if awful in stats, will sell for truckloads.
---
3- RP servers are less competitive in the endgame. Now, this is a downside for many, I understand. But generally, RP servers have a lot less guilds interested in downing the latest raid, dominating in PVP or min-maxing their gear to high hell. Yes, RP servers are usually a lot more casual and finding a guild that takes PVP or PVE seriously is noticeably harder than in other servers.
---
4- What RP actually refers to is a little different to what you seem to consider it. Yes, rolling a character is a form of role-playing. But when you say RP, think of it more as you are actually doing improv as your character with others. In an RP, you may simply have a casual conversation with someone in a local pub, as someone in Azeroth would; or you may be involved in an intricate storyline that your guild has developed. It is more like playing D&amp;D in-game. I could go in really deep onto more of the intricacies of RP, but I can summarize the difference if you do not want to read too much: In a PVE server, I may be Boomboomshot, the level 34 Night Elf Female Hunter. In an RP server, I would be Thaelys Nightwing, a Sentinel recruit stationed in Ashenvale who has the best of intentions, but her naive nature often gets the better of her. In essence, in RP you want to flesh out *who* this character is, their personality, aspirations and flaws. In RP, your character is embarking in their own unique story, and not necessarily just an avatar of oneself in-game.
---
5- Despite what it may suggest, not all people in an RP server actually RP, so don't let that scare you away if you're not too interested in going too deep into that. As long as your name is RP-acceptable and you do not go out of your way to disrupt people who are enjoying their own RP, you'll be welcomed! So long as you understand that the general community of these servers is less interested in the competition of the game as a whole.
---
I'd be more than happy to answer any specific questions you may have or clear up any confusions you still have! But I hope this helped.
---
This is so cool! I've tried to add a few plants to our office space, but there's just not enough light in there. Even my pothos almost died, then perked right back up in the kitchen :/. The single window in there is faced so that it gets 0 direct sunlight. Bah humbug.
---
But it's horrible hunter green color, maybe I've got the start of a leather/wood/brown accented Hunting lodge.
---
The joys of renting!
---
I don't know why people are recommending a hunter take skinning over a druid. If the druid is in cat or bear form, it will be right beside the monster it has just killed and can skin it immediately. A hunter would have to run over to wherever the pet engaged it half the time... 
---
Whatever you choose, just pick complementary skills. Herb / Alch is great for hunters as you could literally pick flowers while your pet tanks. Also, its not too hard to flip back in forth between the different tracking skills. If the druid had Skin/LW, enchanting is actually not bad either as you would have a steady stream of greens and blues to DE and if you both go in a dungeon the druid can roll on enchanting recipes and just lie and say they have enchanting to double the odds.
---
You go bm, wear shammy healing gear and have your pet do all the damage while you channel mend pet. At 70 the world dragons were soloable in T4 healing mail
---
The demo only went up to lv 19 
---
In mythical open world pvp with flat ground and no mobs/other players - sure hunter's are pretty awesome. In any practical scenario in BGs, dueling or even while levelling a (probably UD) spriest with some decent pvp gear is going to be very hard for a hunter to beat.
---
Yes, you are free to think so. Hell, even I think they're wasting their time but I'm not for Blizz to come in and ban them if they continue. 
---
i have a wife, daughter and fulltime job. but that will not stop me from taking 1-2 weeks off when classic comes out and playing as much as i can as i were 17 again. 
---
&gt;In raids Warlocks are primarily a support class, meaning you're there to help the other DPS get fatter numbers. So you have a convenient excuse for being low on the meters! If you actually like topping the meters then wait until AQ and Naxx!
---
That is simply nonsense.
---
The only classes we can actually boost, are Mages and ourselves. Sure, in Theory CoE and CoS could work out for some hybrids as well, but those do nowhere near enough damage to actually benefit from it to a point where it matters.
---
And the warlock is more than capable of competing with the other pure dps classes before AQ already. Play DS/Ruin and watch mages weep.
---
Rogue: _"Look at me, I am taking on 5 mobs at once! My Spec is AWESUMMMM!"_
---
Warlock: _"Hold my Beer."_
---
Rogue room would just be empty.
---
Is that a garage? :S
---
The level bracket is not meant to be stringent by any means... it’s just the one listed by Blizzard in their original Dungeon Companion circa 2006 :) that’s where I’m getting most my info... from my torn up, over used dungeon companion 
---
But they are good guidelines for new players unfamiliar with the instance! 
---
I don't think items with spell damage/healing even exist in that level range. And if they did - imagine playing the classic demo and a hunter rolls on your healing gear.
---
Mage.
---
"Need portal to Ironforge"
---
"20 silver reagent. Discussing it. Etc. Wait while I run to you. Now I have a friend. Etc."
---
"Open portal first, then I pay"
---
"Need water. No, not that level, 34 water"
---
"You a chanter?"
---
I welcome any feedback, recommendations or requests for help.
---
With nothing to play until classic comes out I'll be updating the sheet whenever I have spare time. 
---
Yep, I played 3 months and then BC came out
---
 I was about level 50 and the old world went empty overnight. But was I motivated to get tthrough those gates!
---
The Winterspring yetis had other ideas. It was going to take time.
---
I don't know, maybe more than 50% yes, but you'd be surprised how loyal the original millions will show themselves to be.
---
No shit.
---
Fully enclosed shed, so I guess you could call it a garage of sorts :)
---
Thanks so much :) I can hardly wait for classic!
---
I'd pay that second troll 60.
---
Like it isn't enough that hunters need on all weapons in the game. Now they will need on healing gear also. 
---
I guess I'll play my shaman then...
---
Thank you! Try rotating your plants in and out of spaces with more light. In the office for 2 weeks, out on the deck or Shade for 1. Less watering when they aren't getting be much light is always a good move. 
---
I love the sound of the lodge, is Hunter going to be your class?
---
Holy shit! That's awesome!
---
For sure.  I spent a ridiculous amount of time in Org on my dwarf rogue trying to snipe the occasional red. Friends thought I was just wasting my time but oh hell no .. it was glorious even if I spent 2 hours hiding/lurking/running for one single kill.  Totally worth it.
---
I absolutely loved the name enforcement and the perceived "LUL MEMES"-filter that RP servers had.
---
I would get so high in this garden. Life goals for real.
---
That sounds really great! Have fun! :)

I started in Cata, I enjoyed it a lot, as I was exploring Azeroth for the first time.

WoW isn´t really medieval fantasy anymore (and hasn´t been for a while). I would compare it more to steampunk, sometimes going into sci-fi territory (with races like draenei and ethereals).
---
Don't get me wrong, revenge griefing isn't what i'm talking about. It's the no lifers that go around low level areas with no other goal than to indiscriminately prevent players from questing, that's what i'm on about here. 
---
I played one in Wrath, then around on various "not so legal" servers. I like it well enough, but I plan on getting through a priest first. My friend group needs one, and it's my favorite.
---
Now, leveling one is going to be an *adventure*, but worth it!
---
Thanks for the rotating tip! I'll see if that keeps Betsy happier in here. 
---
Can you link me this servers website I’d love to play on something like this 
---
I feel like that has a lot more to do with the more "hardcore", or for a better term, more knowledgable players playing on private servers that are confident in their ability to do those things. Once classic releases and we have more "casuals" that don't understand the game as well as someone who plays on a private server would, I think we'll see a lot more people "scared" of the tank/healer roles.
---
It was never medieval fantasy
---
Going to have to wait until the demo to test things like this. Level cap being 19, there wasn't really any way to reliably get any healing pieces to drop so we could test it.
---
You do know that there's going to be a lot of casuals and first-timers when classic releases compared to private servers, right?
---
Ive played on one once. The people on vent in the raid talked like the races there characters were. It was pretty wild. I was in a guild on the server that didnt RP at all. Lots of non rpers roll on those servers too.
---
In my experience, you've written out more of an idealist version rather than the reality of what happens.
---
1. /s is in-character in Goldshire and Stormwind only, because it's exhausting to be in-character all the time, and it comes off like a hack writer trying to shit out fanfic in realtime.  It's so stilted no human being would ever actually talk that way.
---
2. Guilds are going to be your best hope for roleplay, especially coordinated events.  Players in the wild are either too timid for it, or far too impressed with their Mary Sue toon to do more than monologue at you.
---
3. TotalRP/MyRolePlay are a window into deeper madness.  Marvel at the half-son of Arthas and a Loa, heir to the Spice Girls fortune, and his many fascinating scars and brooding stare.  Thrill to the 38-page biography rejected by Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way as "just too much".  Everyone's a dark savior or dark lord of darkness; nobody's a janitor or sweaty acolyte.  Or simply "TRIAL ACCOUNT, PST ME FIRST.  FUTA PEE FETISH ONLY."
---
4. No one will ever RP in a dungeon or raid.  They just want to kill the monsters.  Guild chat, however, may be in-character, if that's how they decided to operate.
---
5. True
---
6. True
---
I realize I'm being really negative, but it's the truth of my experience.  I honestly wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying out roleplay though.  When it goes well, it's a lot of fun.
---
The class design would be a combination of the best features from TBC, WotLK, Cata, MoP, and even a few things from WoD.  
---
World would be classic. Absolutely no flying! No LFG, you've got to form connections with other players and run to that dungeon. The world should be a dangerous and hostile players where you have to respect those dangers and be careful.  
---
I would introduce more world content as well. There would be no "warmode" just traditional PvP/PvE servers but there would be quests that encourage or require WPvP in addition to other world content offering rewards that make it worth doing. I'd give professions and the economy a complete overhaul and make them more useful and important and tie that into the world content, because I don't want gear rewards that trivialize more challenging content.  
---
Raids would be only difficulty and there would be zero expectation that every player should be able to complete every raid. The tiers would be scaled in their difficulty not just by the numerical challenge they pose but the later raids should be more mechanically challenging as well.  
---
I would have rated arena and rated BGs, as well as a solo queue option for the RBGs. Old AV would be back as well, but the other 40v40s would be removed so it would be all about epic AV battles that could last all day.  
---
PvP and PvE gear would be separate. PvE gear could offer traits, perks, or trees that further flesh out rotations with the type of mechanics that are unwanted in PvP but desired in PvE. Meanwhile there would be no PvP talents, all of that stuff would be baselined to the class (they would have large spellbooks) and if a particular button isn't useful to a particular player in the content they are doing, that's fine just don't put it on your bars.
---
Not sure it's allowed but search Tetherwing(might not be allowed to use the real name) and you'll find it. Hint: starts with N. 
---
I've been on stormreaver since day 1. Most use the RP servers due to them not wanting to see names such as 'loldroodownz' or 'ikeelu'.

This looks like something out of a handmaid's tale.

This is just lovely. I im inclined to druid aswell. :)
---
With nothing to play until classic comes out I'll be updating the sheet whenever I have spare time.
---
Looks exciting but I cannot open this in google docs!?. Is this supposed to be Excel only?
---
Yes. Gearing a raid takes ~3 months, minimum. An empty slot you don't have to gear is actually more efficient than bringing a meme spec. For every person you can cut for being bad, you save a minimum of one week of raiding for gearing them. If you get to the point where you can run two 25 man raids because your players are not getting carried, you double the gearing rate. 
---
Vanilla raiding is going to be so easy that you can bring a meme spec, sure. It is also so easy you can not bring dead weight you're literally carrying and gear up faster. Not a tough call really in terms of time efficiency; don't bring meme specs, it saves you weeks of raiding.
---
Are you planning on being in a super serious hardcore guild? If not, I wouldn't worry about it.
---
I just loaded it up in google docs, there are named tables which are being used in an Indirect() so it's just all errors.
---
For now xlsx only, i will remove the named elements next version to get it to run on google docs.
---
Hunter is the easy mode. Much better early, easier farming, easier leveling, PvP god and demanded early for raids. Warlock is a bit harder, you have to manage more stuff, you are little weak early. But all of this pays off. You are one of the most demanded classes in the game, everyone needs you even early when you dont have that much dps for the curses and it only gets better. You scale incredibly well and later on, you are a beast in PvP as well. I guess the biggest difference is the scaling. If you want to be OP right from the start and in the early raids (MC and BWL), go hunter. If you dont mind being weak early and scaling into a monster, go for warlock. It is true that later one, it gets hard for hunters to find a raid spot. However, if you are competent, active and skilled, you will always find a spot no matter what. The raids will always want like 2 hunters minimum even in AQ and Naxx.
---
Wailing cavern IRL :) Almost makes me feel like playing a druid! 
---
As I am already hesitating between warrior, chaman, hunter, mage and warlock, it's nasty from you to worsen my indecision!
---
Take a couple of days off work. Enjoy the launch day vibe on the server. Create a few alts and run them to various different towns. If the game's playable without queueing 20 minutes just to tag quest mobs then I'll level my main, if it's a zergfest in the starting zones I'll probably just kick back and do fishing until it quietens down.
---
Especially if McDonald's was in a decline while Burger King was soaking up some of their lost customers.
---
A handful of friends and myself are intent on RPing when WoW Classic comes out. RP server or no. It's a much more immersive experience, I think, Classic lends itself way more towards RP than modern WoW.
---
I don't expect there to be a grand community, but I am going to try and RP and find other RPers. Seeing this topic and the responses to it have been extremely encouraging. Honestly I doubted if anyone would even try to RP on Classic. 
---
Classic's a bit far off from release, but I created a Discord to try and get together any RPers I could find. If you're interested: http://discord.gg/2yXV6cv
---
Unpopular opinion, but the problem that this subreddit has with this system is absolutely exaggerated. I played until Wotlk and it was hardly a problem. The social aspect of the server is supposed to fix this. Don't group with people who do this.
---
Never knew this. Thanks for sharing.
---
I play overwatch in the meantime. Everytime I enter blizzard world and the music hits me...
---
I don’t think the reason is clear times. Most guilds do not care about that (as long as you clear it somewhat fast, and without whipes). Even on private servers, the guilds that care about speed clearing are in a small minority. The unconventional speccs will not make you alot slower. 
---
I think the main reason is gearing. 
---
But there’s be a ‘Dummies guide to PvP griefing’ in there somewhere
---
I totally understand that. It was quite the out-of-left-field move for the franchise. Weren’t the RPG elements a lot better in 1 and 2 as well? That’s what I’ve heard.
---
I mean, this probably wouldn't take too much money to do if you have an old shed or an enclosed porch. This looks like it could easily be done with some goodwill furniture and placing some vines.
---
How to avoid streamers:

Step 1: Roll on a RPPVP server. Done.

With any luck ERP will remain on retail so they can have their futas etc.

Is this Mappins?

No influence on my choice whatsoever. 
---
I would totally raid as a rogue again, but 5 hours buff mats farming is simply something I won't do again.
---
Never again.

“Hey, you know what would make vanilla great? Putting every spell on GCD” -blizzard
---
I completely agree with you when it comes to New Vegas. It had some great quests, dialogue options, and was much more open-ended, but man...the Mojave Wasteland was a pretty dull place! Freeside was the only decent hub, Caesar’s Legion was a gross and unappealing faction, and their representation of The Strip was pathetic. Crossing miles and miles of neverending desert got old quick too.
---
Where are you? New Zealand??
---
I'm probably on parentql leave when classic releases. So I just hope the kid will sleep for an hour or two, so I'll be able to hit lvl 6 or something. Really looking forward to classic, but it will be pretty casual compared to how vanilla was for me. 
---
Ahhh Wailing Caverns is one of my favorites.
---
 I don't know why, but something about standing out the front of the cave on the edge of that oasis waiting for the group to get together before heading down. That pond inside just before the instance portal is just gorgeous! 
---
Ahhh don't be worried, I'm sure it will just come to you before classic hits!
---
I played a priest from launch day right through to Cata. I always wanted to go back and level a Druid but never had the time!
---
How was healing in vanilla Pvp? i cant remember but was it doable surviving 2-3 people as a priest? 
---
East coast of Australia :)
---
No it's like having badly geared alts that nobody will inviter to groups.

Looks amazing!

Yeah, you're never going to achieve this before the discussions in your guild of re-rolling onto a another new server starts and your current server ends up dead.  The exception is if you're the GM or blowing the GM of your guild and you're the only druid, on alliance where there are no shamans to also compete with.  Maybe you might get there.  At that point you're being funneled all the feral/leather gear that the rogues/warriors don't want anyways.  So "re-rolling" in an alt raid is pointless since you'll face the same loot animosity there.

---
What's "traditional" wow?
---
I agree. But it is like at 60 a new game starts, but only for those that have time to raid. If you do not, it is may be more fun to level a new toon. (Disclamer. Raided upto most of naxx in retail vanilla, and upto naxx on private server (don’t have time anymore to commit to serious raiding))
---
What part of vanilla do you guys not get?

Classic wow isnt upgraded vanilla wow

Its vanilla wow released after decade because players miss it and blizz saw an opportunity to make some money off of it

No need to vanish for aggro, just use feint.

+healing did affect Mend Pet during BC. Not sure if it was all of BC or just early. There's a video of a 70 hunter soloing Azuregos with such a set.
---
There was also a time when +spell damage affected Arcane Shot damage in Vanilla. You could build a very OP Arcane Shot build Hunter.

Ret pally is actually quite high melee dps in leveling dungeons.

Play something else and wait a few days for servers to stabilise.

Maybe try to figure out what UI add-ons will work with classic...

I will play a rouge on a pvp server. I will bring tears to the eyes of my enemies.

---
Retail has got more spell details, texture resolutions, shadows and other graphical goodies that is quite taxing when massed in a small area.
---
I love this comparison. Pity that it is also true for me... 
---
I know this is a WoW sub, but FFXIV is a good mmo to play while you wait, the gameplay is much more reminiscent of Vanilla/BC/Wrath.
---
I have culture shock every time I read about RP'ing.
---
Tbh Locks dont even get to use their t2 because bloodvine is actually insane, and everything left besides belt/bracers is not even close to bis. And our t1 is basically garbage.
---
You're wrong and aren't at least polite lol.
---
What's a good PvE spec for the hunter at level 60? And which pet is good? What's the rotation?
---
I play the Troll race.
---
This is exactly why DM shouldn't be in the game at launch. People who hit 60 quickly like me or yourself will get even further ahead of more casual players.

---
Slow Main Hand, the MH weapon is used for instant attacks, and for calculating abilities. Off hand should be faster, getting in as many hits as possible for optimal rage generation.
---
Yellow hits cannot be glancing blows.
---
As a tank or dps you'll be great in 5mans but in raids you'll only be somewhat good iff you have great gear and work your ass off. If that's your goal and you want to do it then go for it but be ready for a lot of tedium and suffering.
---

Where does this speculation even come from? You're saying this without much substance to your statement.
---
Might get downvoted but I'd love seasonal servers in the future. Fresh server, start back at MC&gt;Naxx in a 18 month cycle, maybe 24 months and then wipe the servers and start over again.
---
They rushed the release of WoD to coincide with the release of GW2's Expansion at the time.
---
I've tried that on a private server and in all honesty the 3/8 tier 1 bonus is better anyway.
---
LBRS is the 5 man part, UBRS is the 10 man part, they take place in the same instance.
---
What do you mean? What are you expecting? 
---
I can understand the community will be different because classic/wow is not a new game. There won’t be a sense of wonder and awe with players. 
---
There was a small moment during Vanilla where Archbishop Benedictus became the City Leader instead of Bolvar Fordragon, it lasted for a short time though.
---
These are massive changes, reducing the price of respeccing will lead to rampant inflation higher than is expected in vanilla.
---
These are not QOL changes.
---
QOL changes are things like increased draw distance, Colorblind mode, enable toggle autoloot (you can already autoloot by holding shift or using an addon)
---

I’ve played monster hunter world and borderlands 2, would recommend both, for now I’m not sure and just waiting for Division 2 to release next month and then play that until summer hopefully

If a warlock sacs a voidwalker isnt it just a super priest shield then?  You build no rage while they basically stack everything they want on you?  Then they can always deathcoil and drop you.

But Mages can’t transform into Warriors or Rogues midfight...or at all!

Found this bad boy today at a charity book fair for $2. It’s in near mint condition and by the looks of it has never had a page turned or been opened in anyway. Couldn’t believe my luck!
---
Dont get me wrong, in certain situations mage is just OP. Like farming gold when he can aoe efficiently. But for those grinds in the open world, I doubt you could aoe well. So that makes hunter a clear winner.

---
Sorry.
---
Retribution pally is an "Okay" tier spec for solo and world PVP, but it's mediocre on Battlegrounds. 
---
The damage is fine for 5man dungeons, but it's probably the worst damage spec for raiding out of the whole damage spec spectrum.
---
Troll or Undead Priest? 
---
Long story short
---
Pve you will be healing, tanking doesn’t generate enough threat + you don’t have any taunt. I guess you could tank some five mans, but that’s about it. Dps? Forget about it
---
PvP it’s dps or healing. If you go holy you’re the most annoying class on the planet, if you go retri you could output some decent damage.
---
I have one of those. Sweet
---
Only if he plays Nelf
---
Okay but then i constantly got to switch specs which is lots of money. Or is there any other method? 
---
wow, that's all over the place. using ilvl to rank items, yikes.
---
mods are _____
---
Taz'dingo mon!
---
Unsure whether to level my main or my gold farming alt first. I won’t try to outpace the herd either way 
---
Very cool tool. My suggestions:
---
By default the sheet shouldn't be set to give defensive stats any value for fury warriors, they should be set to 0 and colored yellow to let the warrior know they can change them if they want.
---
Also there are a bunch of librams, totems, and idols cluttering up the gear results even when sorted by rank
---
Nope. 
---
I know (and everyone else who actually educates himself on the matter how software licenses work) 100% no court will ever rule Blizzard has to pay back everyone who bought their game. 
---
&gt; But with classic, they've actually opened themselves up to a potential lawsuit
---
Absolutely not. I don't even get how irrationally hateful one must be to become that delustional. 
---
I've always enjoyed rp servers because of the overall more mature and friendly playerbase. In classic though I'm a bit worried that is gonna be hard to find people for pvp and pve instanced content.
---
 Maybe on an rp-pvp there will be similar pvp enthusiast s I don't know.
---
What are your thoughts?
---
You're close. The reason why I put "up to" is to account for the many different systems that people use. I know people with PCs built in the early 2000s, still running and playing WoW. Those systems are much more inefficient and thus will use more power regardless of what state the PC is in (idle, light load, heavy load etc.).
---
Also the power draw is not linear, but exponential. Imagine that ~75% mark is just where the power draw really starts to ramp up and skyrocket. Between 1-75%, the total Watt usage might be in the double digits (again, depending on system), but once you go above that percentage it might hit triple digits.
---
Also I didn't know about the Classic client being built on the 7.x client. That's actually really good news. I don't think WoW was ever a difficult game to run, but the biggest worry remains with servers and their stability. Let's see how they pull that through :)
---
First  and foremost, the RP-PVE servers are (or were) populated by a majority  of roleplayers until wrath - before then it was a very pleasant villiage  atmosphere. Out of character talk in any public channels (/s /y /e) was  a big no, you got blacklisted, you could even get told off by GMs if  you did it repeatedly and banned for it. Very slowly since mid-wrath  people started coming to roleplay servers but refused to integrate. They  refused to roleplay and they refused to engage with anyone except to  troll, use them as a joke, or a spa. They treated the server like comfy  background noise and abused the good nature of the community. (Blizzard  scrapped most RP realm rules around WoD but the GMs stopped interacting  and caring around mid wrath so you can imagine how it escalated)
---
As  the game went down hill this became an increasing trend. After about  mid wrath normies started coming to the realm to abuse it, sites like  darknest started to get big and you had lots of people who had never  roleplayed, didn't care about the community or ever contributing,  transferring over to use places like Goldshire as hotspots for the  roleplay that reads like it was written by someone that has trouble  recognizing themselves in the mirror. With the only intention of giving  the thinly veiled guise that they were RPing.. but rather were actually  self inserting to ERP out fantasies. Before wrath Goldshire was a sleepy  town on AD EU with a host of characters that wouldn't be out of place  tolkien's fictional town Bree.
---
Over  time the people that actually made the servers what they were got fed  up trying to make a difference, the game's quality was declining, GMs  didn't care, things became unmanagable, the lore was getting fucked,  they left. Very slowly roleplayers were replaced by people that had no  intention of continuing the culture or contributing but were happy leech  the social the benefits the server provided.. for a while. RP realms  aren't even a shadow of what they once were, the difference is  indescribable. As more of the old guard left the quality decreased, the  community dwindled, until you have what we have today.
---
A  minority of roleplayers that are outnumbered by people who don't have a  basic grasp, or understanding of the fundamentals and refuse to learn,  take advice, or improve themselves. They come to the server to use what  little remains of the community as background noise for "immersion"  sexual fantasies, or w/e and then screech when they're called out on it.
---
As  for RP itself, no, plenty of roleplayers have ranked to 14 or raided  regularly. They just had enough respect to be OOC when it was  appropiate. (not around people roleplaying, not around populated areas,  not around roleplaying hotspots, avoiding OOC chat in public channels s/  y/ /e)

[Mods Are ____](https://youtu.be/LDU_Txk06tM?t=1m14s)
---
that is siick
---
Private servers aren't based on random info. They aren't completely wrong like many assume. 
---
You can hear the people cheering for Arthas when you walk through the room just before the throne room as well, and you can see the blood stains from Terenas' crown on the floor.
---
So most won't get it. Don't be thick. 
---
I camt believe it!
---
A few plants? You have a whole ass tree. 
---
That's just plain wrong. Paladin's were buff bitches who threw the occasional heal when they had downtime from reapplying blessings.
---
They lasted 5 minutes in large parts of vanilla, so in a raid of 40 you had to reapply them constantly. Even *during* boss fights.
---
Priests were the best raid healer, without a question.
---
Just take skinning/herb or herb/mining (can only track one thing at a time though), while you level for gold, then switch to tailoring later.
---
For caster dps you probably want to hang onto Tailoring for Bloodvine though. It's BiS well into AQ afaik and requires 300 Tailoring to equip.
---
What about 3/8 tier 1 with healing gear added? Ooooooooooooooooooooo
---
Dunno, never played pally before. But I would imagine you could stick to holy and farm dme with a mage or any other class. Or just farm mining / herbs
---
It's incredible (and sad) to see how many players now associate "new patch" with removal/deprecation of earlier content.
---
ZG is easymode and will be pugged regularly after main guilds have bwl on farm. If you're a warlock in a guild the only way you'd fail to get bloodvine is by being literally retarded.
---
That's not how vanilla works. Only a handful of classes and specs are actually viable, so you can't just "play how you want and what you want".
---
You will play what the raid needs, or not play at all.
---
How did you set the stat priority ? For example prioritizing hit for fury says 42 and 10.5 for tanks while hit is paramount for tanking. How did you calculate the proc points for chance on hit weapons ? I see only dead values.
---
While it is appreciated that you assign points for each spec for easier filtering something isn’t quite right when Arcanite Reaper are below some of the standard shields (filtered patch 0).
---
No, that's a balcony in Brooklyn.
---
You do RoL, they become neutral. Before RoL is complete, they are hostile.
---
&gt;and I dont want to spend all my non raid time just farming mats for the next raid
---
You will. Regardless of class/spec
---
&gt;Being a OT or even 3rd/4th seat tank sounds fine to me
---
There is no such thing as a 3rd or 4th tank in Vanilla, with exception of 4 Horsemen and other very rare occasions (and 4 Horsemen is exclusively tanked by warriors).
---
There is no such thing as anything other than a warrior tank in Vanilla, *period*. Not in raids at least. It just doesn't work.
---
Paladin doesn't work in raids because they run out of mana. Druid doesn't work because they can't keep threat.
---
If you want to tank, you *will* play a warrior. Even in MC and Onyxia.
---
Unless you're planning on going for a world first/realm first, it really doesn't matter. 
---
People will be putting together groups for all content and in a 40 man raid, there's plenty of room for a Paladin that wants to dps.
---
If you wanna play a dps Paladin, go for it. Their dps with the right spec, is actually not bad at all. 
---
None of the classes/spec in classic are THAT bad (except maybe shadow priest). Most of the videos and stuff on YouTube saying 'These are the specs you MUST play in order to be competitive' are either aimed at high level players or are totally misinformed. 
---
TLDR; Play what you enjoy, don't worry about 'meta' builds because they don't matter unless you're competing for world/realm firsts.
---
If your weapon is recently updated, then I guess you've got a fair shake, but let's remember ww axe isn't going to be a thing on fresh servers. And you won't have deathwish past 40 unless you didn't go arms, which seems like a big mistake to me. Druids can hurt you, shamans can really hurt you. Everything can hurt you for the most part. Also, this has been my experience, but when I'm leveling, after a while I'm no longer on hyper alert, and if a warrior doesn't get the engage, it's a pretty big disadvantage. IME.
---
These dont qualify as qol changes 
---
These are core game changes.
---
Qol would be something like colour blind mode, shift clicking in AH, multiple item mailing etc. 
---
Farm up as much as possible so when my leave is over im all set for MC. 
---
I thought this was true! Thank you very much sir.  
---
Yes, easily. 
---
This as a druid in STV. Immersion over 9000.
---
NO
---
+1 for Divinity 2, great game and easily a ton of hours if you explore.
---
Now a bird or two for the chirping sounds
---
Again, it's a situational ability. If you just think it's straight up never worth to use it you are bad, plain and simple. You use every ability in your toolkit whenever there is an opportunity to do so.
---
Go to /r/patientgamers and pick any game
---
Oh yeah? I used dampen magic all the time on my mage in pvp and in battlegrounds. Making use of amplify magic was a bit more tricky though, but I used it on the tank in dungeons with physical encounters, for example. Personally, I loved the weird spells (and items) in Vanilla, that only had extremely situational usefulness. 
---
I also don't mind classes and specs not being completely balanced that much. While I agree some specs need some tweaking, it's kinda cool when you see a person kicking some ass and you go: "Holy shit, that guy actually made a ret pala/survival hunter/whatever kinda work?!". 
---
No offense but you are assuming a lot. One you are assuming you cannot kite out of range in a duel area, which is nonsense. It is extremely easy to kite in duel area with conc shot and scatter. Spriests are one of the easiest classes for hunter. I rarely got challenged more than 1-2 times by a spriest in retail in a row because they knew it was pointless. 
---
It is simple, if I see a Spriest in open world pvp that gets hte jump on me, or in a duel. I immediately scatter shot, viper shot, conc shot and run out of range for a few seconds. Then 1 more viper sting and they have 0 mana left. You might have not played retail vanilla to understand how OP viper sting is, I don't know. Basically once all your mana is gone you can't do anything but wand. I would never get below 50% hp vs a spriest in tier 3. I would melt them quickly once they were oom. 
---
Needs purple LED's and a mist dispenser.
---
#🤣
---
It might be competition for retail, but Classic is an entirely different beast. They're not going to worry or care about scheduling releases around its expansions. Not sure why anyone would think that. 
---
couse thats why BFA is what it is they listen to players and we get that shit
---
No
---
This is amazing we should really see what the others might be like for other classes
---
3-6 months man, 3-6 months
---
3 - 6 months man, only 3 - 6 months
---
Oh that smell... majestic
---
Australia? When does a room open and how much per month if I provide mats for profs? /imseriousdoh
---
I am playing Marvel Strike Force, it has some inspiration from WoW with tier sets and rpg elements. And its fee on mobile. 
---
I might start playing some league of legends again also. We all suffer from Classic drought but need to be patient. 
---
Rogue continued:
---
1. Every other player is a Rogue/Warrior/Hunter and will roll on the same pre-bis gear as you, except Warriors can tank and thus decide the group composition as they see fit. 
---
2. Combat spec for PVE/leveling sucks for PVP. If you're unstealthed and fighting a mob you are vulnerable. If you're mounted, expect mages to do drive-by Polymorphs from a distance and Blizzard you should you stealth in time. There goes your opener.
---
3. Melee DPS is more susceptible to AOE damage in raids, thus more likely to die on a boss encounter thereby losing you all your world buffs and costly consumables which will need to be reapplied again.
---
4. Pickpocket farming is braindead and gets really boring after 2 hours of doing the exact same thing. In high level instances, a resisted pickpocket means you Vanish or you perish. You then have to wait for the Vanish to be available again before continuing or you might get an unlucky resist and die.
---
5. People assume PVP videos filmed before weapon and attack power normalization are a true representation of the class in patch 1.12 and onwards. No Eviscerate doesn't do a flat 2k damage anymore, it scales with AP.
---
6. Expect having to bandage inbetween mob pulls as you level.
---
Even better. Obsidian is releasing a fallout inspired new ip this year. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGLTgt0EEqc
---
Obsidian, team behind New Vegas .. is making a spiritual sequel/prequel to fallout and[ it looks amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGLTgt0EEqc). 
---
not to mention stance dance to throw some hots on yourself between mobs and your mana regens while you're back in cat form.
---
I gotta do that too! Nice job.
---
Professions while leveling a druid?
---
2. Combat spec for PVE/leveling sucks for PVP. If you're unstealthed and fighting a mob you are vulnerable and you won't get the opener. More or less a free HK if you're low and don't have cooldowns up.
---
5. People assume PVP videos filmed before weapon and attack power normalization are a true representation of the class in patch 1.12 and onwards. 
---
I get you man, I don't think rebalancing/removing everything that is a little bit janky is good approach. I loved most of those niche skills
---
I just hate when there is one, clear, even required by others way of playing class and it applies especially to vanilla tank situation which I think should be reconsidered
---
Deep in TBC I was still often getting loled hard when I went to dungeons as paladin tank, because people still couldn't get over stigma despite paladin being totally viable tank option
---
Pigeonholing people into certain ways of playing (you can only tank with warrior or if you choose druid your only viable option is resto) is poor design and main flaw of vanilla wow for me
---
I can think of a few first time boss kills where we had our rogue tanking at the end with like 20 people left up lol
---
If a piece has +40 healing then it'll do +8 per tick of mend pet. It's that bad.
---
the thought that warlocks don't have self peel is insane.  Deathcoil is one of the most powerful spells in the game for just that purpose and also servers many others.  Voidwalker sac while leveling makes it easy to get a fear off.. if you're geared you'll have a succubus out to seduce anyone who gets on you.  You also have howl of terror if you need more than 1 feared.  
---
There's plenty a warlock can do to get away depending on spec.. but most often you just kill whatever thought they would get on you.  Death is the best cc.
---
Absolutely works, the only one that don't is the "two handed weapon specialization" (obviously) 
---
This man fishes
---
I'm also thinking of rolling on said servers but I'm not interested in scripted roleplaying events and such
---
what I'm mainly looking for is themed guilds (assassin guilds, mercenary guilds, merchant guilds,... there was also a post on the front page a few weeks ago about a hinterlands guild with uniforms, a guild hall and chat restrictions etc which I thought was pretty cool)
---
and big strategic open world pvp raids
---
can I find that on rp pvp servers?
---
As a warlock I love to run in and drop a howl of terror to "help" them out..
---

---
Fuck I want to main druid now, I only have 4 plants I want to double now
---
Pro tip:  Bind it to 1-4 and press a different one each time to save your keyboard a bit
---
Any class can beat any other and consums kinda balance out the playfield by a bit , but hard counters remain hard counters . You are never going to see a warrior winning consistantly vs a mage,paladin,warlock,rogue,hunter  &amp; even priest when you are talking about the top end of each class players and assuming equal gear/skill cap.
---
This makes me feel so happy. Please, OP, tell me: what faction/race will you play? I need your preferences if not presence around me
---
Can I move in while I lvl my druid? 
---
THAT'S AMAZING!  
---
i'm joking. I have no knowledge regarding hunters at all :)
---
I could see him playing this set up with troll as well, maybe tauren druid. Jungle zones obviously
---
It is a huge perk, its just expensive. If you want to take enchanting i suggest taking mining or herbalism to make some money. One of you can do skinning and leatherworking to make your gear, and the other can disenchant the greens made from LW you didnt use.
---
Everyone speaks english nowadays my friend, litterly everyone in Europe.
---
I'm from Denmark and i don't think u can find a danish person that is between 10-30 that don't speak english.
---
Here is a list too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population
---
I don't think you need to worry about this at all, the only thing is that their might be some guilds on each server that won't be english, but that is something you can't change no matter where you start. Every server will have more then 50% of its guilds in english and every "hardcore/more serious" guild will pretty much be in english.
---
However, their might be an option for "german/french" servers at server selection, just don't start on these :)
---
You ll have sharding in the starting zones.
---
Personally i'm playing OW and EUIV, 
---
... and here I am playing in my basement. 
---
Fighting mages as a paladin comes down to one thing and one thing only: los
---
If there isnt any nearby you're dead. But if there is a tree or a corner you can hug your odds get much better. That is ofc if the mage is stupid enough to come and chase you around it
---
No troll druids in vanilla, friend
---
Disregard females, acquire gold
---
Warrior, Warrior, Warrior, Warrior and Warrior. With the huge imbalance of 1.12 they're FOTM all year round. 
---
The most similar one would be a fury warrior tbh
---
I never said troll druids, just trolls in general bring the jungle theme.  
---
^although I wish they existed^
---
What? Loot trading wasn't a thing in Vanilla, so of course it was hardly a problem lol.
---
&gt; The social aspect of the server is supposed to fix this. Don't group with people who do this. 
---
You literally nailed the problem. I want to be able to PuG a dungeon with anyone in the server. I don't want to only be able to dungeon with friends/people I know. Do you understand that? That's like one of the most important reason why we want to play WoW.
---
But the more tools you give a huge pool of people to cheat the system, the more they will feel encouraged to use them. If player A was never a ninja looter in Vanilla (because it wasn't worth it at all), then he might be for real in Classic because there it will be very profitable to make it look like you need something, to only sell it to a group member or give it to your friend that needs it really bad in the group. Is that fair for the people that are not part of your friendship to have to roll 1 against 2, or 1 against 3? Nope it's not fair.
---
Those talents (axe, sword, mace) specialisation do work for 1h. But the fact that the arms tree offers so many 2h-friendly talents that it really seems pointless going deep in it if you're planning on doing anything but go 2h. 
---
No loot trading even with no GM tickets would be overall way better for Classic. Let's stop to try telling Blizzard we need CS, because they won't change their mind. However we still can convince them to not implement loot trading at all. If someone makes a mistake, it's on them, and you won't be able to ninja loot discretely like you could with loot trading.
---
Hi, /u/brr123
---
I am sure that most people can speak English, but not so sure they would. Also not every country is on the same level of English as Denmark of Netherlands. From my playing years I remember that some servers really profiled into some specific local language (such as Czech) and it would be used a lot, even in the public channels. And the English does not necessarily have to be very good either.
---
The 4th one would be enough to solve it completely tbh. The problem is that this asks Blizzard to develop that solution, which might seem easy and cost nothing, but it's maybe not the case.
---
 Shaman
---
1.A full tier 1 set can be used and be competitive up until Naxx, neat set bonuses &amp; good looks
---
2. R13 set is arguably one of the best looking sets in the game
---
3.A male orc or tauren shaman in Naxx gear looks like THE TANK
---
4.Flametongue/fast weapon + shield/spikes combo with totems can bring you one of the most sustained and chill leveleing expirience .
---
5.Elemental is just devastating during certain patches given that you have the proper gear and resto is aways welcome. You wont ever have a hard time getting into pvp premades or getting into top end guilds as Shaman , there are never enough shamans
---
6.Mastering totems when,what and where to drop feels meaningful especially in pvp
---
7. You dont have to worry about keeping track of buffs in PVE. Keeping down &amp; rotating between totems depending on encounters becomes a part of your rotation rather then a buff that u keep track of .
---
8.FROST SHOCK - need i say more?
---
9.Most people either dont know or underestimate your capability to burst thru them in PVP as elemental . Given enough gear you can kill some classes with only instant cast spells . Trinket &gt; fire nova totem &gt; NS&gt;CL/LB into a Shock can bring most targets in the 10-25% hp range
---
10.Not the best with solo content , but if you are interested in experimenting with gear and specs , you can solo a lot of stuff easily that other classes struggle with . You can solo farm DME trash , you can also solo Hydro &amp; Zevrim inside there for example . Tanking 5mans , ubrs , MC &amp; some parts of ZG &amp; AQ20 is well achievable .
---
11.Healing 5mans can be done while you watch a movie . Simply bind Chain Heal on scroll wheel up &amp; Windfury totem on scroll wheel down and enjoy
---
12.Ghost wolf feels super neat in pvp &amp; in PVE ( when u can use it ) and it can be hella giggles getting an onhit build going and killing people while in ghost wolf
---
It won't necessarily take years assuming you do split raids. 
---
Dungeons aside, how is the questing life for a prot warr? Slow as hell or fine? 
---
Nobody here will get that. Have an upvote tho.
---
The thing all countries are picking up on this, 20 years ago u started learning english in 5th grade in denmark, my generation were in 3rd grade, today it's in 1st grade (6-7 years old). This is not just for Denmark, this is every country in europe bassicly, nowadays everyone knows english. The only way you have to worry is if some big polish/german/.... youtuber or streamer plays on your server, otherwise this is honestly nothing to worry about. If that happens, you will most likely be able to server transfer, however that will take a while before u can do that, also when you are in durotar, elwynn or so you can always ask the first few days if there is any streamers on the server so you can rerole fast if this happens.

Not necessarily, but probably.  It all comes down to the RNG, which can be very unkind.  Of course you could get both TF bindings in the same MC run too - but most people will never see that.

Sorry, forgot to answer your other question - in the end game yes Crit can for melee get higher than 33%, but that doesn't mean you will have a 100% flurry uptime doe to how probability works.
---
Yeah, that really sucks. Assuming we get an Oceanic server I’m hoping we at least get a PvE server, not just PvP. And, the ping isn’t too bad (I’m in French Perth).
---
What a useless post. If you don’t like it, just don’t read their posts and get on with your life. 
---
You wont ever get "full bis". If you do, its gonna be after atleast 2 years of classic release and at that point you will already have alot of feral/balance items because noone else wants them
---
Yes, we do. I will PM you the discord link.
---
Usually what happens (in the guilds I've been in) a druid plays resto and when no1 wants the DPS gear that drops one of the resto druid gets it and they gear up their feral gear that way.
---
Although if you really want to have the gear quicker you could also just run more dungeons once you're 60 and gather off-spec gear that way. I remember me and some guildies used to run dungeons so our resto druid could get feral gear while our tank got the other blues so he could disenchant it.
---
What a useless reply.
---
This is vanilla tho my dude
---
Negativity is a poison, you’re spreading it needlessly. 
---
I’ve only noticed people talking about pre-raid BiS.  Who cares though?  Stop being the reddit police, and enjoy your downvotes.
---
I didn’t find leveling a warror difficult. Mind you, the first char I leveled was a Holy Priest and my second a Holy Paly so YMMV.
---
Be careful with those books. They have been known to be frequent toilet reads and may be contaminated 
---
Have you heard about familial responsibilities? 
---
They certainly will be FOTM but a large part of them will be bad players that on top of their lack of skill won't be putting enough time into their warrior. Already looking forward to decimating those fools in pvp
---
Warcraft: lord of the clans 
---
Wait till it gets closer because that book will explode your hype
---
Beware it isn’t a kids’ book. They throw out some pretty dark shit right out the gate.
---
Fantastic read 
---
Fly to westfall life hack? Is that just porting to SW and flying back rather than walking?
---
I'd go with main... otherwise it's not your main! :)
---
My plan is to take 1 week off and do nothing but level. Goal is to get to 40 and acquire my mount by the end of that week. After that ill just play casually, like 3-4 hours a day just messing around havin fun on my way to 60
---
Awful. Warrior is the worst leveling class already and being prot spec gives almost no benefit when leveling. It's not safe or relaxing at all, by going sword and board and/or prot spec you will actually take more damage than a fury or arms warrior because you kill mobs much slower. You can tank just fine as arms/fury.
---
You also hear bells ringing where you pass the old bell crushed into the floor...
---
The sounds are still there on retail (for players below level 110 who haven't done BfA content, obviously). Turn down the music and turn up the ambiance. 
---
Imploring players to set reasonable expectations is not negative.  Comments like "What a useless post"  are though. 
---
Play the Teldrassil soundtrack through speakers on repeat.
---
Nah that question is totally fine here, IMO.
---
Are you new to prelease forums? 
---
&gt; Why wait?
---
Because I don't want to be burnt out when classic finally does drop, and most of those servers are going to shut down when they do. (At least they say they will shut down)
---
Thought this was the residential crazy canowhoopazz. Guess they're multiplying
---
Ever consider a tauren druid? At 60 you can casually fill in tons of roles for any of your friends, leveling is easy and gathering nodes is the best as a druid via quick travel. You haven't played horde over 30, so definitely give it a shot
---
Thank you for your suggestion. The class fantasy feels a little bit off to me (I'd feel better as a NE Druid), but AFAIK I'd need to heal for both PvP/PvE in order not to respec.
---
I'm jealous.

---
Dalaran wow with their eternal progression wotlk server is quite Fun to kill time
---
War, Priest, Rogue, Mage, Lock
---
Everything else just exists to soak up loot these 5 don't need/want can't use or buff.
---
&gt;  an old shed or an enclosed porch
---
Just having that costs quite a bit.
---
1. Mage - old main/ everyone knows what they're like
---
2. Priest - grinding with imp wands/tap is comfy,so makes for a nice alt. MC/mind vision/heals no matter the spec.
---
3. Shaman - Damage is dangerous with the resto/ele spec. Totems are great, short CD kick, 15 second grounding, tremor, ect.
---
Obviously there are quite a few choices.   I personally am going herbalism/enchanting on my tauren druid.  Engineering(for pvp) and skinning/leatherworking are also popular options.  I personally would find engineering to be too much of a hassle as a druid.
---
Tattoos are for stupid people.

That’s what he means

teaching second language from the first grade is a massive failure, waste of time and waste of funds  
---
kids don't even know their own language at that point  
---
my nephew is 5th grade now, barely knows anything  
---
I knew as much if no more in about 5 months of English when I started in 5th grade compared to their 5 years  
---
As for the server picks, I think its best option to wait few days to a week.  
---
Ill just sit out, see how server pop is and where people go, rather than rerolling.  
---
Yes but then again I had better gear than most.  Main survival factor is not getting an interrupt that locks you out of your heals until you die.  After that it is all about positioning and good use of your PWS/fear/trinket CDs.
---
&gt; The point is you Pug with people to figure out if they are cool people or cunts and if they are cool you put them on your friends list and you get to know who to avoid and who you can trust. No one ever said you have to play with real life friends only. 
---
By friends I meant ingame friend. I basically had no real life friends playing.
---
My friendlist wasn't 1000+ people, there were many days no friends were available / were busy / offline. I want to be able to PuG quietly. Is that really something too much to say for you for a game like Classic?
---
As you said my opinion does not matter more than others, but it sure matters more than the very, very few people that are worrying that we won't have GM tickets, knowing that many more share that opinion.
---
**The only thing I'm saying is No loot trading + no GM tickets &gt; no GM tickets + loot trading. This is pretty logical**. This goes with Blizzard needs and most people that want to play Classic as well.
---
&gt; I don't intend to ninja loot just because this system is in the game. People who are already cunts are starting to make excuses for themselves so they can behave badly once the game arrives. 
---
Yeah you don't really get how that works. Don't think all people are like you.
---
Nah. If people are just gonna use addons for that same damned thing, don't touch it.  
---
They are gonna leave raid UI.  
---
I am looking forward to classic rp, maining on a pvp server but I’m going to have some alts on one for fun.
---
Current WoW just feels so silly story wise and it can be hard to really take a character seriously in that setting.
---
the 5% per step came in 2.x, vanilla its 10% for honored, 10% for rank 3.
---
That quest is a bit server dependent, and the ashenvale one is a lot faster if you group up with other shamans.
---
At this point I just hunt down a group that wants to pvp some night elfs and take them to ashenvale with me lol.
---
Priest   
---
Druid    
---
Shaman   
---
Warrior

You forgot the ‘how I really am’ pic, with mis-matched bits of self-crafted bronze armor and rainbow-colored random drops from the murlocs along the coast of Westfall.
---
Thats exactly what emerald dream is like. ED is a RPpvp realm
---
I would redesign the crafting professions.  I would keep the general structure, 1-300, with certain threshold points, but I would add a lot of useful recipes at lower levels and also  update many items that were designed at patch 1.0 / 1.3  and are becoming very obsolete in patch 1.12.  
---
Some of those items just need a straight powerboost, but others can be changed to make them useful in niche situations. 
---
Druid, cat, bear, cheetah, sea lion
---
Seems mage has less problems then other classes no?
---
I was on a Greek server in vanilla. Also played on the server with the biggest Swedish population for a while. The only difference is that there are a decent amount of language-specific guilds. The general server communication is still in English. 
---
Even if a huge amount of Polish guilds or whatever decides to roll on the same server, there will still be a big enough non-Polish population that it won't turn into an actual Polish server. 
---
“Setting expectations on people fantasizing on a fantasy game” 
---
I can't decide on the top five, but here are my top nine (in no particular order):
---
* priest
---
* shaman
---
* paladin
---
* warrior
---
* warlock
---
* mage
---
* druid
---
* rogue
---
* hunter
---
&gt; although I wish they existed
---
Same. I like druids but taurens are just too big and bulky.
---
I honestly feel class design is much better now than it was in vanilla. I think it regressed with BFA, but legion was amazing. I love that each spec is it's own class in it's own right. Then again i'm a big fan of min-maxing and being the best at one thing. That said...
---
1: Paladin. There is nothing else like it in any current MMO. Yeah it's slow but can you kill it? I didn't think so. As much as I'll die on the hill of class design overall being better in current wow over vanilla, Paladin is the one case where this isn't true.
---
2 &amp; 3: Shaman and Warlock. The quests for totems and demons are just something that doesn't exist in MMOs any more, and that puts them at the top of my list.
---
4: Mage. I think having the most versatility of play style makes mage a need in my top 5. Even at the very top end theres always 2 PvE specs and 2 PvP specs that are playable and bring something unique. For PvE it's Fire unless stuff s immune to fire, then it's Frost. But there is reason to have Arcane mages for the incredible burst damage. In PvP you have the high skill and surprisingly not squish frost mage that can out kite anything, or go all in on PoM-Pyro glass cannon.
---
5: Warrior. Rage is fun, mmk
---
Even in top 5 druid forms, moonkin gets the shaft.
---
Not sure. Depending on the player, some of these can be huge. You need a lot of patience for a lot of this game, and playing mage can accentuate that to some extent (vending machine, drinking after every pull, boring PvE 'rotation', etc).
---
Rules:  
---
1. Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic. This is not a community for private servers or current World of Warcraft.
---
careful of the sidebar ---&gt;
---
All the retail kids will figure this out pretty quickly on their own. Then I can see one of two consequences:
---
* They bitch about how stupidly hard it is (RNG this, RNG that) and bemoan classic, slandering it constantly and generally bringing the whole community into the negative zone.
---
* They leave and go back to retail.
---
1. Rogue  
---
2. Hunter  
---
3. Mage  
---
4. Druid   
---
5. Paladin  
---
r8
---
It is the second picture
---
If you, as a dev, implemen arena and it is popular, you are obligated to improve on it. One of the biggest issue with arenas in MMOs is class balance.
---
For example you can't have lot of RNG spells because they can screw with arena ranking. Notice how much less of an impact RNG has on the game in TBC or WotLK, compared to vanilla. Most of the procs have been normalised.
---
 You also want to balance the classes differently than in a 1v1, bg, or big scale battle environment. That affects me as  well.
---
It is, though usually locks run the felhunter or succubus instead. Voidwalker is pretty useless in pvp
---
Congrats, you made gw2. It sucks.
---
Not here. r/wowservers
---
I think it funny how all these people fell for OPs troll lol.. well played sir!
---
Don't think anyone was talking about leveling outside from general difficulty. At 60 isbthe context.
---
What that's like a white item dude. Cool find though.
---
That’s not really true though. It’s not this great meaningful thing you’re supposed to hold sacred. If you wanted to raid, you had to have a certain spec. If you wanted to PvP, another. If you liked doing both, it meant you were respecing. A lot. 
---
Agreed
---
If you’re both a PvPer and a PvEr you are respecing constantly or your doing very poorly in one of them because you’re playing a bad spec. I don’t think being  expected to play either one with terrible talents and making you worse than everyone else doing it was a design decision made by the creators. 
---
“Pick a spec that works for everything “
---
And you call me casual lol
---
Yeah that's the "Level 1 Noob" cosplay from a Blizzcon costume contest years and years ago, I'm sure there's a video of it floating around somewhere haha
---
That’s fair
---
Yeah literally every group I joined all the way up to 60 and even at 60 I was miles ahead of everyone in DPS in dungeons, consecration was crazy OP in vanilla, I remember being one of the top DPS in UBRS runs as well haha
---
Of course people are. It's against the sub rules to talk about which private server you use though. For that use r/wowservers
---
Lots of people are playing on pservers, but keep in mind subreddit rules 1 and 4. You should Google "light vanilla server", if you want to be directed to the most popular vanilla pserver currently.
---
English servers have generally always been just that, I've at least never rolled on one only to find that barely anyone speaks English. There are guilds made for people from certain countries of course, but server communication has always been in English, I think it'd take something really crazy for a server to more or less be taken over by a certain country.
---
I suppose so but I figured it would make everyone’s life easier and have 0 effect on the game balance at hand. I had no idea this one change would have such a dramatic effect on the game like this. I’m not an economist xD
---
Really fantastic looking place my friend, reminds me of a Stranglethorn vale camp of sorts :)
---
I am, but I decided to stop - because I am hyped about classic and I wanna keep my enthusiasm and energy for leveling when classic arrives. 
---
Don't think so.
---
It's fairly easy to experience it from that approach though. Just look up which zones are for which levels, but even then it's quite straight forward for earlier zones. For example the game kind of suggests to you Elwyn&gt;Westfall&gt;Redridge&gt;Duskwood&gt;Stranglethorn?
---
Fem Tauren or bust. Also, “moooooooooo”. 
---
Not sure how I can ask you this without sounding like a dick. But there's plenty of evidence supporting starting at an early age is better than starting later on, like many European countries did 10 or 15 years ago. But yous anecdotal evidence of your nephew compared to you is worth more than that?
---
Hm yes, thats another 14 chapters in "War and Peace" down, ah perfect i'm just arriving in TB.
---
Not true at all, also it's just simple stuff you learn, just hearing the other language helps a ton
---
Yes... You're the one asking for reduced respec costs because you don't have time to save for them, either pick one spec that can work for whatever you're doing (however sub optimal it may be) or respec constantly and incur the cost that everyone who wants to play optimally will and always have payed. 
---
This scares me.
---
Are there really no reasons to play Paladin?
---
I know. This why I will join guilds where only 1 or 2 females are allowed to join as mascots and jerk off material.
---
Holy hell so much unnecessary talking from that guy. I just wanna watch the thing, not listen to "hey guys..." for 48 seconds and then again between the two segments.
---
Why youtube why.
---
If Venture Co. comes knocking don't answer.
---
Time to start a horde character I guess.
---
I don't think British-English servers were ever a thing, in the sense that you would see everybody being English. However, your best bet would be to play on the 'most famous' servers there are. I personally played on Ravencrest-EU back in the day. As a Danish person this was full of Danes and just Scandinavian people in general, but most people were speaking/talking English in random groups and in trade/world chat, because of so many different countries on one server. 
---
Your best bet, would be to find a server like the above, which is 'the' place to be in terms of PvP and/or PvE and make sure it isn't labelled German, French or Spanish/Italian, the mentioned countries tend to speak in their own tongue quite a lot, completely disregarding people not speaking their language. I don't think you have to wait 6 months to see what servers end up being the best places to be. People will most likely recruit and try to get everybody speaking the same languages or something else on the same server(s).
---
Spot on... vendoring dungeon blues is good money. The trading system is so incredibly unnecessary for many reasons that heavily outweigh the positives derived from this system.
---
Yes.... isn’t everyone...?
---
I am yes, to decide what class to play on launch. Found a nice lil insta-60 corner of Azeroth.
---
Theyre both in a room trying to figure out who pepe Silvia is
---
Would never do that! Wondering if people are crazy enough to do that (hope not). 
---
Probably the official wow guide, the book.
---
No, since the respec costs are going to force you to pick a spec and stick to that for PvE/PvP
---
Which you can do ^decently as a HotW spec
---
Bruh there's always like maybe one or two servers for the live expansion and they're always complete garbage. Think what you want, you'll see what happens to vanilla pservers when classic releases either way.
---
Breath*giving*
---
you'll have to specify what is not true, because most of stuff I said is true  
---
It's like having alts but you don't have to level up again. Might not be able to get all the best items for each build due to things like head of Onyxia that you can only do once.
---
my nephew was just an example of his generation  
---
he doesn't have bad grades nor super good, he's average  
---
and in 5 years they weren't taught shit  
---
Came here just to check this had been recommended. It's one of my all-time favourite novels, and just like you said, will explode OP's hype. Most of Rise of the Horde would be a decent read as well for covering the events on Draenor pre-vanilla, but then much of it also crosses into TBC territory.
---
What happens in BfA so that  the whispers would no longer be there?
---
Hi, /u/VMNC
---
My point is still that it isn't massive failure, waste of time and funds to learn a second language at an early age.
---
1. Druid. It does everything I want (healing, stealth, fun spells to play around with, good for world pvp solo or duo, and HoTW spec which makes respeccing non-essential) The only thing I'm not a fan of is the general theme.
---
2. Warrior. Has a really fun kit which makes the game generally fun to play - I actually really enjoy the leveling process because there are a lot of mechanics to play and improve with compared to other classes.
---
3. Warlock. Tons of fun specs to play and experiment with (Heavy destro is my favorite), nostalgic for me because it was the first class I really go far into the game with. Great class theme and I love all of the class quests.
---
4. Hunter. Like warrior, has a lot of different tools to play with that make it fun at all stages of the game. Even from level 1 you can be practicing kiting with your autoshot timer. I'm considering making an alt early on solely for tribute runs in case Blizzard patches it out after launch.
---
5. Priest. I haven't played one in vanilla, but this is entirely due to Mind Control. No matter what class I play, I'm always going to be jealous of priests for having this spell.
---
they don't learn shit, so actually it is  
---
first they have to learn their own language in order to properly understand a second one  
---
This whole topic is dumb. Everyone whos not for 1.13 will obviously quit at some point. Cant this discussion be had when the people who are still playing, is in favour for future content? Let the no changes crowd have their way until it becomes an issue
---
Hmm, I'll consider that. Thanks!
---
&gt;they don't learn shit, so actually it is
---
As I said in my initial post. There's literally evidence supporting the fact that learning a second language early on is the best.
---
Thank you for the reply!
---
Just explore. 
---
You're hired!
---
But yeah, sorry OP. Please try r/wowservers.
---
Or you took your game manual to a book shop and took a picture of you holding it.  
---
I just can't trust anyone anymore! 
---
Considering the state of the regular wow reddit with retail and soon-to-be-classic-players, it will probably be the former.
---
I'm playing on Netherwing TBC right now in anticipation of classic launch and it's pretty great. When I completed my Kara attunement and walked in there for the first time it was such a huge nostalgia bomb
---
I thought about leveling a priest or hunter on there, I just don’t have the patience right now 
---
Rogue or Hunter are probably safe bets.
---
The botters already took em
---
sure thing my dude  
---
learning how to say robot and apple when you don't even know how to write is a great help  
---
The  Alliance attack the Undercity to reclaim Lordaeron but Sylvanas plague bombs it so no one can have it.  
---
What is Rogue levelling / pvp really like at early levels? Tried playing it at 60 in BG's on RetroWoW and was shocked at how long it took to generate energy / deal decent damage
---
Yes it helped very much. Thanks for the response!
---
You're being taught basic words no matter if you start in 1st or 5th grade normally. So what's your point? - Literally everybody starts out with basic shit then transition into harder and harder stuff. This is true for children and it's true for adults.

Literally go on Google and look for the studies on children and learning a secondary language and you'll see that a huge majority, it not all, state starting to learn secondary languages early on is the best. If you don't trust random Google articles, then go to google.scholar and you'll find the same results.

this!
---
What? Classic trying to hard?
---
He's vomiting changes onto classic
---
Hunter is probably the most powerful bc you have range which pushbacks caster spells plus a dps pet on them would be real annoying. Plus your traps if they get in melee range.
---
Personally I like Druid though because you got stealth to hide if level 60s come through. Also you have nature's grasp and travel form to get away. And also aquatic form which is super fast. If you are ever ganked, just quest near water and you have the fastest getaway ever. They have zero way of catching you.

I mained a Tauren Restoration Shaman(turned Goblin) for about 6 years straight before maining a Goblin Hunter during Cata. I have only raided on horde side barring a very brief stint as a Gnome Mage in Vanilla.
---
I have recently been playing a Tauren Hunter North of Dale and so far I'm enjoying some aspects of it (especially the nostalgia of questing), but I think I miss healing/casting and wonder if I'm missing out on giving the Alliance experience a fair shot.
---
Can anyone sell me on a Dwarf Priest? Would the Alliance experience be worth basically learning the questing all over again?
---
for dps only
---
druid (slight exception hybrid spec)
---
priest
---
rogue
---
hunter
---
Hahaha, what the hell are the chances man?? That’s crazy
---
Is it the guy with his spider?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if they camp the area's spirit healer, couldn't you just ghost run to another area and rez at a different spirit healer? It's not like you need to use a specific spirit healer to rez right?
---
While on the grind to 60 what will you be primarily listening to? Though i'm sure i will be all over the list, for me it would probably be voice chat. This is a one of a kind chance to relive what it was like back in vanilla, and  take advatange of the social aspect of the game once again.   
---
I'd love to play on an RP or RPPVP realm but unfortunately my plan with classic atm depends on finding the right kind of guild beforehand trilling around on the forums, so realm choice might not be up to me. But if I do end up playing on an RP realm, I already have a character concept in mind.
---
Hahah yeah I freaked out cuz I held onto them so long and thought I had tossed them before Classic was announced but I still have them and a bunch of old guides
---
that's Denmark, kind of a different world. for example, while most Poles can speak English, judging from irl experiences, they won't.
---
spending time in a realm with a certain language majority can easily lead to a very bad time, just ask any non-Hungarians who rolled on Bloodscalp.
---
Btw they sell code red and voltage Mountain Dew which is probably what these were before they branded them 
---
Don’t see why it would be a stupid thing to do...
---
Voltage is actually my favorite one 
---
This is classic they were referring to my guy
---
I've only ever played on PvP servers in WoW but I fucking hate invasions in Dark Souls. To me Dark Souls is a single player game. I hate that I can be minding my own business and someone can swoop in to fuck up any progress I've made in a level. I don't understand why there needs to be  multiplayer especially when it feels tacked on and out of place. I don't need to be constantly reading troll messages that other players leave behind and if I need help with a boss I'll just use the NPC summon. I'm so glad those games have an offline mode.
---
do you have a WoW fansite in your country? ...or, since times have changed somewhat, national WoW facebook group?
---
back in 2005, these sites supplied the info about the chosen servers for certain nations, I kinda guess it's going to be the same nowadays. 
---
I believe this will be accurate. 
---
Propably my wife screaming how useless bastard i am because i just sit at computer.
---
Accurate. 
---
Well, if you somehow think Vanilla was good relative to today's game outside of community, anyway. YMMV. 
---
This is my perfect gaming room, I don’t like the neon lights rooms that most of people do as a gaming setup 
---
Oh my...
---
I think we will see like a week or two where there are more people on classic than retail, and then it will slowly shift back towards more people on retail. 
---
if you can open on someone, you win. if you get caught with your pants down, chances are you'll lose. rogues are great for ganking, but by 1.12, they have received significant balancing, the days of "world of roguecraft" are long gone...
---
It’s like 1-2 hours played at most for virtually every class to farm 50g if you’re being efficient and take the time to research. Not to mention there’s a few builds that can make 50g much quicker. 
---
Haha, i actually thought of putting in significant other or kids in the background... but then I just did other.
---
This is correct.
---
The big difference between Joana and the average leveler is that you cant grind from A to B killing stuff because there are lots of people there. Then there are quests that are not worth it, because too many people at the same spot like killing the fire elementals in the Charred Vale in Stonetalon Mountains.
---
Now you are short of XP to follow Joanas quest to the t. As hunter or WL no problem, but warrior leveling gets significantly worse if you dont fight mobs 2-4levels below you. That is because you glance a lot at mobs above you and you need a lot more hit to not miss so often. 
---
That means lots of folks will do the normal leveling guide which will make you do 90% of all quests. For example the orc leveling guide makes you skip Mulgore, Tirisfal and Silverpine. That's it. In all other zones you do the vast majoritiy of all quests. Even elite quests and dungeons such as Wailing Caverns are recommended if you can find a group for it. 
---
So my recommendation: Do Joana's leveling guide, therefore accomplish most quests, skip on the grinding if you dont have a good grinding class like hunter/WL and do dungeons at the appropiate level range.
---
Well personally I say the release date is August 4th 2019. Go ahead and speculate on that too guys, can't reveal my source ofc. 
---
Mostly Youtube and Twtich
---
Jump
---
I revealed mine :c
---
This is gorgeous 
---
I'd be to distracted with those in the background or even watching... i need something ambient that I don't have to pay any attention to. I would do audio books as i love them but i'd zone out and miss details and get confused later. 
---
I will not listen to music. 
---
In dungeons I always play tank and I'm at my best when I play with ingame music turned off and only ingame sounds enabled. 
---
I can play hours on end and never get sick of the combat noises.
---
Its not because they “listen to players” its because the players they listen to are the vocal minority. The core community has been voicing their distaste for Blizzard’s content since WoD but they dont listen to us, they listen to the part of the community screaming “this is too hard, gimme items”. Its not the core community’s fault that BfA sucks, it is Blizzard’s. They chose to listen to a small part of the community, having a vote system would accurately show the WHOLE community.
---
Your blessings obviously work the same and that is helpful, but your healing is pretty shit because you have to wear cloth gear and stuff to have Flash of Light that doesnt suck and then you just get deleted. You obviously cant run around in the world and expect do kill anything as holy either, but with judgement you are very scary as holy 1v1
---
The game does a pretty good job of that itself. Literally just play the game...
---
You'll never even need to leave for fresh air
---
lvl 45-57 dire maul  
---

---
Whole faction getting honor points for winning AV.   bonus points for defending a City leader.....  
---
It's fun to see how many things got switched during design
---
 
---
Well it's all about taste, some people prefer vanilla to garbage. But hey one man's trash is another man's treasure.
---
And you are an capable only of farting words out of your mouth without any intellect to back them up.
---
How do I know that? Simple: If you had your heads for purposes other than balancing out your arses weight, you would be able to state where you think I am wrong. 
---
As you don't do that, you show that you are just another online sheep who lives in a world where likes trump brains. Pathetic.
---
but what DO  they put on those shelves now, assuming any physical stores still exist..  I mean, back around 2000 they had hundreds of big box titles on shelves, they are all gone, so what fills up those empty spaces?   
---
Thats the thing with tattoos right? It’s personal. For me it would be a stupid thing. 
---
Good point
---
That's a hard yikes.
---
Sadly I'm almost the opposite when it comes to leveling. I enjoy leveling but after doing 1-60 so many times I need a distraction on my second monitor whenever I'm traveling or mindlessly killing mobs.
---
If you're a hunter you spend your time in DM:N killing bosses like a real man. =P
---
Shit meme and shit template. Doesn't even make sense.
---
The class fantasy is actually incredible if you consider its roots/inspiration. Tauren are very indigenous-inspired and the Druid is the perfect RP fantasy for a culture that has spirituality (a beautiful one) that focuses on a harmonious relationship to nature. 
---
Talking over discord with the guys I'm going to level with and sometimes during late nights when we don't feel like talking (but still wants to be in a call together if something happens), then watch random Twitch streams on my second monitor.
---
Maybe I'm weird.. but I have never listened to music while playing games.
---
I am very similar but I usually am able to zone out most music. I cant be very distracted or I'm not inefficient . In raids besides voice chat I'll have everything but combat noises off.
---
As Fox Mulder told us - Trust no one!
---
Ingame soundrack is NOT for nostalgia, it's just beautiful.
---
I listen to it (from all expacs) like every other kind of music, even outside of the game.
---
I know, right?!? Patricia handed it to me all excited and I couldn’t freaking believe it - of all the people to find it :P
---
BGs are a different beast compared to open world PvP. You're less effective when an enemy is likely to get healed mid fight. If you never want to die roll Druid so you can escape at any time, and you still have stealth so you can get the opener. Hunters are also crazy strong at low levels, spell pushback will destroy clothies and you can kite melee.
---
See, that was my thought at first, but that's exactly what I did in Vanilla. And that ended up only getting me to 40% of the dungeons. I think the main thing this time around is just being more purposeful with dungeons.
---
We will probably know by April, so I find speculations pretty useless. But I hope the release happens as early as possible.
---
Summer starts 21st June, right? Then that's the date I choose.
---
Oh don't get me wrong I have a bunch of classic stuff on a playlist I listen to all the time. But I can only listen to the same song a few times in a row before I need to listen to something else. 
---
Damn...
---
What do you mean doesn't make sense?
---
Activision vomiting changes into the game and fans leaving the game because of it.
---
I don't know how much clearer OPs meme can be.
---
"A future we all fear" makes plenty of sense.
---
Well hes not going to have to respec and start raiding  MC all over again. He will already have off-set pieces by the time he has naxx on farm. and thats IF he gets that far. Most people wont even set a foot there
---
Ele shaman,
---
Can level fast provided you have water.
---
Can PvP
---
Can Heal
---
Shaman Mustard Rice
---
Lol
---
He will get the off pieces from healing Naxx and AQ then
---
I loved the class descriptions in the manual with a few select abilities chosen to showcase what abilities/spells you could use with each class.
---
Opinion from a druid:
---
To a certain degree, there is a hint of quality of the sort you're describing. If you want to tank something, you can. If you want to heal, you can. If you want to dps...you can. In fact, I would say that to be a "good druid" you kind of have to...as a player...be _able_ to do this, and step into any role.
---
That said, in actual practice you generally _won't_ do this very often much after you start raiding, simply because respec costs rapidly spiral out of control. Personally I don't entirely buy into the popular notion in this sub that nobody will take ferals. Classic is going to be Classic, not a private server, and there could be a lot of people playing who are not private server players and who haven't built up the expectations that private servers have.
---
But playing feral is not like playing a rogue. Rogues have a much easier time and are...with apologies to feral mains out there, a lot more _fun_ to play than feral. Feral is kind of a lot of work. So try to imagine yourself after you've geared up to some extent, and imagine that respec costs are now 50 gold. You have people you play with, you have a regular raid slot as a healer...are you really going to pay 50 gold for the chance to work a lot harder to get worse results than a rogue, just for the chance to do worse and then pay 50 gold to respec back in a couple days?
---
Again, you _can_. But will you?
---
Now yes, there are times that you might. For example, regardless of how you level, you absolutely might respec to tank for grinding pre-raid gear once you reach 60. If you don't respec very often and costs stay low, yes you can ad probably will occasionally decide on a whim that "hey, I'm going to be an X for a couple days." Or maybe you'll stumble on a video showing some specific spec you don't generally play has an easy time soloing some specific dungeon boss, and so you'll do that for specific gear drops that you want. Princess Theradras and and Lord Roccor come to mind.
---
But it's not like having an alt.
---
Also, you might find that you don't particularly _enjoy_ certain specs, or you might not be very _good_ at them. Yes, if you're going to play a druid you  should know how to play each spec, but if you follow your plan and for example play resto until you're "done with gear progression," when you go and swap to something you haven't played for six months or a year or whatever, don't be surprised if you make it about 5 minutes before you realize that you don't enjoy it at all. Going from fully kitted resto to starting-over-at-the beginning gear feral, is _not_ going to be very much fun.
---
If you want to do this, the "correct" way to do it is to maintain gear seats _while_ you progress, not to go back and start over. It's not particularly difficult to do if you pay attention. There's a fair amount of overlap in druid gear. Resto gea and balance gear tends to be similar. Feral dps and bear tanking gear tend to be similar. Yes, there are some differences, but if you do your research and know ahead of time what to watch for, it's not a huge burden to do this. For example, if you're healing a party without a rogue and a piece of agility leather drops, it's probably yours by default. Add it to your feral set. And of particular note, the best in slot bear tanking trinkets through all of vanilla don't actually come from raids. The first comes from a dungeon quest, and the second comes from enchanting. So if you plan ahead, you can take enchanting early, get that trinket in your 50s, then drop it for whatever profession you want long term, do the quest, and have both BiS tanking trinkets before you even set foot in Molten Core for the first time.
---
The biggest burden is likely to be pvp gear. A lot of druid tanking gear in particular comes from pvp. Checking the Nostalrius lists, BiS tanking legs come from Warsong Gulch Exalted. BiS shoulders come from Arathi Basin Exalted. Second best pre-AQ helm comes from rank 13. Second best pre-AQ hands come from rank 12. A lot of bear gear comes from pvp. If you main resto and then try to go back to fill in bear tanking gear later, it might be better to stay resto and do pvp in your raid gear instead of swapping to bear and then trying to farm battlegrounds in dungeon gear. But that kind of goes against the spirit of what you seem to be proposing.
---
Yes, having gear sets for all specs and being capable of playing any of them is a thing you can do. And yes, a fair number of druid mains do. But it's not like having an alt, and it's not done by doing each spec "one at a time." It's done by doing _all of them_ as a cohesive whole, watching for gear all the times, and by swapping out of your main spec after raid on Thursday night to play a moonkin or whatever until you swap back for your next raid on Tuesday. And simply eating the respec costs.
---
I know, that's why I phrased the question that way.
---
Why april?
---
See my edit
---
I thought this was gonna be like what genre of music. I voted in-game music, however I've always found that WoW goes great with 'angry' music such as melodic death metal (In Flames, Meshuggah, Soilwork), as well as some more conventional metal like Disturbed, Lamb Of God, Velvet Revolver etc.
---
Now there's the true classic experience if your parents did the same 15 years ago.
---
How much would i'll be gimping my self in end game pve If I play a NE rogue instead of a human rogue wich has +5 swords skill?
---
Bro do you understand the state of retail currently. Everyone I know has quit. Blizzard has turned that shit into a mobile game disguised as a triple a MMO without the RPG.
---
Good points. Sounds like Joanas guide, plus finding out all of the dungeon feeder quests (so I can potentially get all dungeon quest turn ins after one run) would probably be a good mixture. That, plus just letting myself explore at times!
---
Planning on listening to the music, at least at first. Once I hit the real grindy part of the leveling experience (40+) I'll probably put on some shows/movies in the background like Pokemon, LOTR extended editions, and some other nostalgic stuff.
---
Winter here in australia starts in may, so opposite that is for america, so earliest is may 1st
---
I would definitely recommend to level as either Arms or Fury, you'll save yourself a lot of heartache. Personally, if you want to lean more towards tanking while levelling, go Arms since I find it provides more utility that makes tanking and levelling really smooth.
---
Some of us actually enjoy that kind of game. Not everyone in the WoW community wants to play “press button get drop”. Personally I enjoyed vanilla all the way through WotLK because of the challenge it posed, the story behind it, and the fact that I would have to actively play the game to be better at it as opposed to current retail which is just log in once a week and raid. 
---
Switching between the soundtrack and marathoning sailor moon. I've been holding off on watching it just for classic, ahaha
---
I rarely get tired of the in-game music so mostly that. Sometimes, when doing hardcore farming, I'll listen to an iTunes playlist or something.   
---
I expect to be running a lot of dungeons with guildies so there will be Discord as well.
---
From what I've seen they've mostly just expanded their console game/accessory selection and occasionally offer some Razer PC gaming gear. 
---
Like I said, I don't like speculations so I just threw out April because that's the month they announced BfA (if I even remember that correctly). The main point is still that there will be a few months for the players to prepare, so a release date will most likely be announced around April.
---
It makes the most sense for me at least.
---
The problem is not capability, but willingness.
---
Yes you do. Only keep the essentials. Keep you computer for Classic Wow and get rid of evening else. With a garden you can even have a garden bed and grow your own food to sustain you while you play. 
---
Been listening to some of the WoW books on audiobook recently. Will likely continue to do that. They're surprisingly really fucking good. 
---
Wish I could pick all of the above. I have a specific playlist made for caving and dungeons / traveling in scary areas
---
Looks quite cold, is it?
---
I would recommend looking around youtube for notable quest lines and noting the zone and level range.
---
Shaman:
---
Does flametongue weapon have its damage reduced from flurry(talent) as attack speed increases since FTW's damage is based on speed?
---
What are the two middle panes even for? The Eric Andre show is one huge cringy forced meme to begin with. "Look how stupid and random and low production everything is." "Our market research shows this is what the kids like!"
---
Shit's not funny even in its original form. It's even less funny in meme form.
---
Yeah but Blizzard is not based in Australia and have never based their launch dates around australian timezones or whatever, so.. you know.. pretty irrelevant.
---
This is the answer right here. Unless yours extremely dedicated, you will not be able to freely switch between specs. You would have to pay 50 gold to switch over to feral, and then once you decide to raid again you pay another 50 to switch back. 
---
It was a cultural phenomenon. If Blizzard called Toyota today to try something similar with BfA they’d laugh.
---
You sir, need to play Paladin
---
I think you mean that Paladins were the best single target healers in Vanilla? They could Tank heal all day due to mana efficiency.
---
1. Warrior 2. Mage 3. Priest 4. Rogue 5. Warlock 6. Hunter.
---
Think I’m going Warlock
---
And a good thing too. Seriously he would take 3-4 days off work and if private servers are any indication, he would still be struggling to take starter mobs on the 4th day without sharding. 
---
Starter zones were completely fucked for 2 weeks on Nostalrius launch until they finally increased spawn rates. There were literally level 20+ people sitting in starter zones tagging mobs just to piss people off and slow things down further. 
---
True! 
---
Music + my wife as she will be playing with me :)
---
Sure you can be a night elf, but you won’t get into any serious raid guilds. 
---
We had a feral druid as our third (adds) tank throughout Vanilla, but we never finished AQ40. It was never a huge issue, but I could see a paladin tank being problematic due to the lack of a taunt.
---
I think on my first leveling, I'm going to be too engrossed to listen to stuff on the side, besides a few discord calls with my friends who'll also be playing Classic. Once the first character is leveled, I imagine future leveling will be abit more of a routine and therefore Netflix will get a lot of use.
---
I have one, I’d be convinced to part with it for a 120k usd
---
Yeah you will. If you are a great at playing your class you will get in.  Granted the racial is preferred for dwarfs. But it’s not be and end all.  
---
July 16th
---
Those undead aren't very well known for keeping things clean are they
---
Yeah, pretty sure that's still Autumn for another month, mate.
---
sounds sad :(( I dont like dwarfs
---
Or play however you want, unless you want to srsly raid then dwarf is a must 
---
I never really liked music while playing either, its like mixing two moods together 
---
what means "srsly raid"? Will it be impossible to raid MC/BWL/AQ/(Naxx?
---
iam probably a cascual gamer but I still want to clear all Raids 
---
So when classic is released would it still be an issue?  People won’t be so obnoxiously geared and the heals will be more proportional. 
---
&gt;When you first charm a pet, the loyalty meter yoyos. Is there a point when your pet will never run away? Or is it always possible to run away if you don't feed it enough?
---
You'll go through 5 levels of Loyalty with the pet, starting with Rebellious right after you first tame it, to Best Friends at Level 5. That highest level is almost a point where you don't have to feed it, but you still need to keep an eye out, especially after big fights with multiple mobs, deaths, etc. Personally, I just get in the habit of feeding my "Best Friend" pets every couple of days and haven't seen their happiness meter dip.
---
I wonder what the current estimates are for WoW's subscriber count and how far back before WotLK you would have to go to see similar numbers.
---
night elf racial spells are... well... bad. very, very bad. starshards* is only good for leveling, and elune's grace is useless.
---
on the other hand, so are human spells - desperate prayer has a few uses, but feedback is a joke. their +5% spirit isn't useless, but it's not much.
---
so... if you're min-maxing, dwarfs own all the alliance races, otherwise, night elves work just about as well as humans, don't worry about it. or join the troll master race, they're almost night elves anyway, except better is every aspect.
---
*bit of useless history: there was a brief period post patch 2.3 when starshards became just another DoT, and as such, it was kinda good, but other than that, night elves were pretty much at the bottom of the food chain.
---
BfA was announced at Blizzcon, Nov '16. However, I agree that April makes sense, simply because at that point it's getting very close to summer.
---
Yeah I've finally reached lvl 2, so that's good. The really annoying part is AFKing in the cities. I have to remember to dismiss my pet.
---
By srsly raid I mean hardcore raiding, if you join a casual raid guild then yea probably you might get a chance. I mean you deff will clear all raids, but maybe not on release of the raid 
---
That's cool. Starting at level 3 it gets easier and easier.
---
In first grade you don't have capacity to learn something a fifth grader could.  
---
Fifth grader could understand something within a month that took a first grader a whole year.  
---
Not efficient at all.  
---
"Go google" lol no  
---
"Early on" doesn't mean jack shit as it can be interpreted as almost anything.  
---
Pre school? Quite early  
---
First grade? quite early  
---
Fifth grade? Still quite early as child is only 11  
---
You'll be fine. I think you'll regret not playing a character you want to play.
---
You'll be able to end game just fine. Min-maxing is not necessary.
---
&gt;humor  
---
wow, this is sad  
---
Most guids will put you in touch with more quests than not. Perhaps just use one to educate yourself on quest chains so you don't miss them but don't worry about the pacing of the guide.
---
Warlock room would simply get you arrested for Satanism and stuff 
---
Oh come on, don't tanks who srsly raid know how to stance dance? Not trying to be a smartass here but really, mean
---
Yeah it was announced at Blizzcon but the actual release date wasn't announce until later on, right? That's usually how it goes
---
&gt; But it’s not be and end all. 
---
It most definitely is for most top tier raid guilds.
---
Oh my bad, I see what you're saying. :x
---
Listen dude, I'm not talking from experience and I personally don't give a shit I'm just giving my opinion based off research and watching vids 
---
Most guilds will clear MC/BWL
---
If you want to do AQ/Naxx, seriously consider going for everything that's "best in slot" and finding yourself a top end guild that will actually be able to do these harder raids.    
---
Which means, rolling a dwarf.
---
Classic Wow is using their modern engine. This very like means (and is rumored) that it will not run ANYWHERE near as efficient on old hardware as the original client and engine.
---
I suspect the client itself won't be too badly bloatware but the newer engine absolutely won't run as easily server side. It will have a huge overhead of modern systems and the modern retail version of Wow has become completely dependent on sharding and phasing for performance. I have no predictions if we ultimately see any real different client side.
---
Dungeons: Do them all. Some aren't nearly as popular as others but experiencing all dungeons on the leveling curve is the most fun. Too many just start to expect carries later. You can't relive FRESH unless you go full FRESH again later.
---
Like I said I wasn't trying to sound nasty, but just think about it. A full 40-man raid will have 10-15 healers, with multiple priests. The big thing with Fear Ward is to put it on the tank. So logically, the raid doesn't need *all* of its priests to be dwarves. 
---
I don't think Blizzard themselves knows the exact date atm.
---
Oh yea i didn't mean it like that lolol
---
In the end just play what you want, you'll def do the content regardless 
---
Its not that serious. People that act like theyre above the circlejerk on a site fundamentally about it are obnoxious tbh.
---
I don’t think this OP is trying to min max for world firsts based on his post. 
---
I've spend countless hours shore ganking players on my druid. Wise players know how dangerous shores can be when druids are around. :)
---
You seem like the type to think Diablo on mobile is an amazing turn of events lol.
---
DAT IMMERSION BRO
---
2000 music to keep it authentic
---
Herb/Alchemy is set in stone for one of the characters. It's too good to pass up. May go with the skinning/enchanting combo. Can always get bags. Just have to find someone to make the tanking cloak.
---
Meet somewhere in the middle road of these two answers. This one seems like it leans too much towards how RP is on modern retail servers. It definitely wasn't this bad back in vanilla, and I'd wager that RP quality will be better in classic than modern, if only because the population will be new and not old and diluted.
---
ilvl shouldn't rank items, people don't want to download spreadsheets so it should work in googledocs
---
Only chance that happens is if Blizzard truly fucks it up somehow. Classic is a great game and plenty of people want to play it. It's that simple.
---
You don't have to know much about lore to RP. 
---
There are different views of what RP is. Some go to inns and chat nearly entirely using emotes ... even when /say is a real thing in game emote talking is idiotic. These are basically digital LARPers. You are either part of this group, or you think they Barby Doll fans and ignore their actions as the insanity it is.
---
Others just realise what RP actually is: Playing the character as if it only knows the world it lives in. That's it. You don't have to go crazy. Just stop projecting yourself onto the character (which is sort of childish and, frankly, a style of play typically used by young girls as revealed in child gender studies ... real psychology and not modern "social sciences". Just apply personality traits and play it out. Fighting, talking, eating, drinking, adventuring, dungeon crawling, etc ... all done normally but it's the character's perspective and not your personal one even it's nearly the same.
---
Role Playing is very, very simple. Just pretend the world you play in is real. Use the normal tools in game and you don't have to pretend through emotes, you just react and play the game normally.
---
"Did you see me lay down the law? I am the law giver!"
---
Just another Ret Paladin desperately seeking the attention and vindication of his peers.
---
Vanilla isn't perfect and the live version of the game may be more balanced but it's also horribly over engineered and has lost the original idea of the game that made it popular in the first place.
---
I'm not sure how many expansions Live has left in it, I had some hope after Legion and thought that there was no way Blizzard could mess Live up so badly against after WoD but it seems that I was wrong. 
---
Fact of the matter is that you can't make an MMO by appealing to the lowest common denominator, that's not how these games work. 
---
People have been saying this for decades now, but for some reason Blizzard just won't look at falling subs and take what that means to heart. They better be making real bank off those micro transactions.(The might well be, it's the only way their actions make any sense.)
---
Hehe half the reason I love druid so much ;)
---
The cringe is real.
---
I have a playlist already made for that. You got any recommendations?
---
Lol no one is turning down a priest who has good mechanics bcuz race
---
There is a difference between camping and trying to quest in an overpopulated place with all the mobs taken by enemy players.
---
This legit happened to me today in Ashenvale in the satyr bases. Usually I just kill a guy once then move on (and if he is grey I won't attack) but if I need the mobs, I'll kill you if you come back.
---
Then of course somebody asks for a level 60 to come by and watch over. Which didn't help because I could still kill the enemies in retaliation, then just moved over when i was done with the quests.
---
Given the ways mounts are these days, I'm mildly surprised there isn't actually a Toyota car mount in the game.
---
I mean getting taken into raids as a night elf priest? More than likely not happening. If I’m running a pug, and unless the priest is overly geared(t2 for mc kinda geared) I’m not taking a night elf in. Shows that they more than likely don’t know how to ply their class.
---
Yeah it does suck. The racial is just very much needed for alliance. 
---
I just picked up Neverwinter again. I last played like 3 years ago and they've added a mountain content since then. It really is a solid game that'll fill the time for me. 
---
Penalties for dying were higher aswell, gear repairs cost. Less graveyards etc
---
very accurate
---
Great idea. You don’t need a guide for this - just ask around and do a bit of research
---
That's what most of us want though, a tough grind. Boring? You actually have to work for your shit, as opposed to retail where you get rewarded so much it no longer becomes one.
---
&gt; In first grade you don't have capacity to learn something a fifth grader could.
---
Obviously not, the very same way that you're not being taught fucking trigonometric functions when you start with math. You gradually increase difficulty. You're acting as if when you start English in fith grade for example, you're suddenly speaking fluently and making perfect sentences. You start at the bottom, because in a school not everybody is on the same level, so to pick everybody up, you start slow and increase difficulty. By starting in first grade, you basically start at the lowest possible level, as you said yourself, with words, no sentences. By doing that you ensure everybody picks up the language and by gradually increasing difficulty through the classes, you're suddenly further ahead, because by the time you reach fith grade, you've had English for 5 years, while the kids starting with English in fifth grade have to start on a lower level, and since you're starting later, you'll have to increase the difficulty faster, which can increase in difficulty too fast for some kids to follow.
---
On top of that, studies also show bilingual children learn other things faster. 
---
&gt; Fifth grader could understand something within a month that took a first grader a whole year. 
---
They're still learning something, which by the time they get to fifth grade can be used on different things or to learn even higher level English than the fifth grader just starting.
---
&gt; Not efficient at all. 
---
It's efficient in the sense there's no alternative. Being good at English these days is literally one of the biggest traits you can have and an increasingly amount of classes and just general things in our daily lives, is in English. With everybody getting better and better at it, you and everybody else have to be somewhat just as good as the majority of people learning it, otherwise you're behind.
---
&gt; "Go google" lol no 
---
You won't Google actual studies, but rather speak out of your ass?
---
This is the most unlikely, wouldn't be surprsied at all if retail had less then one mill active players. The game is completely ruined and anyone that doesn't think that way hasn't been keeping up at all, its not a case of wah games dead in cata, mop wod etc, the game is actually at the worst state its ever been.
---
Looks like TBC
---
If you add up the pop of each server for “active players” (not characters), it’s around 560k. 
---
1)  Warlock, deathcoil lol.
---
2) Shaman, frost shock!
---
3) Mage, POM pyro.
---
4) Warrior, stance dance!
---
5) Druid... Boomkin.
---
 very true.  I plan on creating a guild so I doubt I'll have any time to listen to stuff... though on alts I'm sure it will be a different story. 
---
-Druid. My fav all around class especially if on pvp server. Complex and fun.
---
-Shaman. My favorite support and I just love Elemental build.
---
-Rogue. Haven't played one since retail but was one of my mains.
---
-Hunter. Just a damn fun class. Always have to have one if even if just parked in a pvp tier somewhere (higher ones. Low tiers are too boring for me).
---
I used to like Warlock a lot and played one a ton in retail but I find them a little boring these days. 
---
Mage. Boring concept for me.
---
Warrior. Always a boring concept in any game for me.
---
Paladin. Some appeal but is too boring offensively for me.
---
Priest. Too boring offensively for me.
---
In nearly all games, I typically prefer complex and twitchy classes. Wow is a bad game to describe a twitchy but rogue, hunter and feral play is easily the best representation of this based on my preferred style.
---
Not even close. Good deduction skills. 
---
Bosses weren't tauntable in vanilla so that wasn't the problem. It's only really a problem in dungeons.
---
What I would really like to know is if pets were tauntable by warriors in the demo. I heard it’s a pserver thing.
---
Vanilla isn't a tough grind at all. It's easy as shit. It's just grindy. There's zero skill involved in anything vanilla. You're right about the instant gratification though, but that doesn't excuse literally grinding mobs for stupid things. 
---
It's not reasonable to ask Blizzard to spend millions of dollars per year to manually shuffle loot.
---
Loot is a major issue to the average player and being able to facilitate the correction of mistakes is necessary to maintain a player base.  
---
I agree with the video completely, it's not going to be as big of a problem as the classic WoW echo chamber says it is.
---
Hunter would be a huge collection of mall ninja shit, a bunch of weird lizard/bird cages, and a terrible smell
---
This is how I am going to handle it.
---
I just don't see how it's going to impact my enjoyment of the game at all, and I won't be rolling with people who would use the system this way.
---
I agree with the sentiment about loot but that's it.  Vanilla didn't offer any form of challenge other than grind. You enjoying WotLK's loot is funny though considering that's the begging of what we have now with badges. 
---
How many posts like this do we see a week?
---
Yes, there is a risk it falls flat on its face or withers away. There's a risk you get mauled by a bear in the next week. Everything has an associated risk. 
---
I don't waste my time thinking of things outside of my control.
---
All evidence is pointing toward the Classic project not failing so until I hear otherwise ... ZERO sweat.
---
Depends on what your definition of success and failure is with regards to Classic. Will it have millions of active users after the first 12 months? I doubt it. But, then again Blizzard probably only needs a few hundred thousand MAU to break even on their investment in redeveloping and maintaining Classic.
---
It’s interesting to see yourself fall out of love with WoW. Like, you look at new mounts and gear and stuff... and you just don’t care. You’re not invested in the game or your character enough to give a shit what mounts you have or what your gear looks like. It’s weird. It’s surreal. In Vanilla I find myself *wanting* stuff, but in BfA I feel, like, numb. I can’t bring myself to care about anything in that game.
---
This is a spoof of the famous Leeroy Jenkins video which is a popular vanilla moment.
---
&gt;that quest in which you bring Sylvanas back her lost necklace from Ghostlands and watch her break.
---
That was the coolest moment in all of WoW for me, as a huge WC3 fan I had been waiting for a moment like that for years.
---
OW has lost all it's magic for me. Enjoy EUIV!
---
I think the funny part is that you didnt understand my post at all. I didnt mention loot once other than the “press button get drop” analogy. The entire rest of the post was about different aspects of the game that were present in vanilla through WotLK and are absent from retail. Thats fine though.
---
The sound of silence 
---
slow paced, calm, good for both pve and pvp with the exact same spec? holy paladin.
---
no idea about hunters, they might work, but as far as I know, warriors and mages have entirely different specs for pvp and pve.
---
Getting in touch with your roots. A true keeper of the grove 
---
If you haven’t been touched by WoW you haven’t lived.
---
Just because you personally don't want an inconvenience while pugging doesn't mean the entire player base shouldn't be able to handle legitimate loot issues.  
---
There was always the risk of grouping with a ninja looter, and it sucks people could increase their ninja'ing odds by bringing friends, but this isn't a behavior people are just going to tolerate.  Lots of people agree this isn't something they want a part of the game, so like in the days of dealing with ninja looting we need to speak up and let the community know who is abusing the system.
---
Maybe with all of the resources to communicate like discord and slack, someone on your server makes a chat for only people who wouldn't abuse the system when they pug and you join it.  No one is abusing loot to effect your gaming now, and legitimate loot issues can be solved.
---
Having reasonable e-celebrities around can change the culture of a server, but usually it isn't particularly bad.  The issue you can see with streamers is a huge number of players basically becoming a flash mob.  I don't think I would avoid a server just because of that, however- the odds of that streamer's swarmbase constantly being where I am seem low.
---
You stomp on sand castles at the beach don't you?
---
Maybe what they've done so far has prevented sub drops from being even worse or the game dying
---
Nope, sorry I'll probably just listen to the 2000's playlist on spotify or bust out some CD's
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z60-erywKVs
---
Bruh what guarantee is there that those people that quit will even be playing other MMOs or coming for Classic. They just dropped a genre that ain't as appealing anymore
---
And the only thing Blizzard is saying is due to the massive amounts of tickets we received asking to trade loot, it's no longer possible to manually do this with human beings and we had to automate it.
---
I think WoW is pretty much the equivalent to things like Shakespeare literature or any other super-famous set of books from the old times. But only that it's in digital form, of course.
---
I think the next big industry-shaping game that would happen after what WoW was is Star Citizen. But let's give it a few more years to come out. 
---
In Vanilla almost all gear is valuable but in retail even the high end gear is worthless.
---
Just so happens I leveled my priest during that patch, lived starshards then
---
&gt; Fact of the matter is that you can't make an MMO by appealing to the lowest common denominator, that's not how these games work.
---
You're in an echo chamber. The fact is that any MMO that didn't appeal to casual gamers has shut down or is F2P with microtransactions.
---
Wildstar just shut down a few months ago and it was literally developed by ex-WoW devs who felt WoW had become too casual and wanted to cater to the most hardcore players.
---
Turns out players *want* catch-up mechanics and hate grinding.
---
&gt;What is Rogue levelling / pvp really like at early levels? 
---
"Look at that level 23 mage drinking at half health ima go sneak up on em and ambush backstab em like a bitch."
---
"Oh yeah you like that Mr Mage, taste my forsaken balls"
---
"101 101 L t A A F"
---
Stoneform pretty dope too.
---
DAE Retail blows? Jesus this sub is just a long list of posts that are all summed up as "classic &gt; retail"
---
&gt;I honestly think there's something wrong with people who play Live in its current state. I honestly don't understand these people.
---
????
---
Some people partially roleplay in emotes because it fits easier. /me Grok pats Tok on the back. "You've got yourself a deal." is easier than doing two separate messages and doesn't run the risk of having someone else post something in between your two messages.
---
Honestly, I have no idea what you're trying to communicate. Why are you bringing up gender studies? What does it matter what young girls do? How does this even connect? You're a fucking weirdo. People's real life experiences and sensibilities are going to impact the character you play, and if you try to completely disconnect a character from yourself, you're either going to create a character that's utterly lifeless or you're taking for granted that your perspective is universal. I've roleplayed for years over tons of different platforms and EVERYONE I've played with puts a part of themself into their character, even when playing a character totally antithetical to yourself IRL. And even if someone goes ahead makes a fantasy version of themself, why do you care? As long as they're fun to roleplay with, it doesn't matter. The biggest issue with RP is people making characters who aren't conducive to interesting RP (loners sitting in the dark corner of an inn waiting for someone to ask them how cool they are.)
---
I honestly think there's something wrong with people that still play vanilla 15 years later
---
/roll need

Its the lowest level of circlejerk possible

and its sad  
---
Fortnite is probably more ubiquitous than WoW ever was
---
If you're burnt out then you won't want to play. And you can move on with your life. Having aaid that if you're just playing for a specific crowd of players then yes you should probably wait.
---
&gt;Obviously not, the very same way that you're not being taught fucking trigonometric functions when you start with math. You gradually increase difficulty  
---
Comparing another language (while not knowing your own) to math.  
---
Wow gj bro  
---
not reading the rest, that sole idiotic comparison fried my brain  
---
Without the mmo also, phasing takes away the massive online, you find a party to kill a world boss but you dont see them, because you are in a different warmode.
---
Retail is an online action fantasy, there is no more rpg and no more massive online.
---
What means "GF"?
---
I think that's mostly because Fortnite is not only available for every single platform imaginable, but also because it's getting immense free advertisement from a lot of media and especially streamers.
---
In its core, Fortnite is such a silly game that offers literally no real interesting gameplay, and I bet the majority of its playerbase is very underaged (not a bad thing but definitely a telling factor). Out of personal experience, I can tell you that both my cousins have 2 kids each, very young ones, and they all only think about Fortnite and play it on every single platform they have at home. From the telly they'll jump to their pads, and from the pads maybe on the console and sometimes on a laptop.
---
I mean, we can't even compare WoW and Fortnite on a game-level, but I guess nowadays when you say WoW and Fortnite, most people would probably recognize the latter first.
---
Either way, I wouldn't think of Fortnite as industry-shaping or an actually great game to look up to. 
---
The largest issue game suffers from the severe anonymity that crossrealm and groupfinder brought to the community. 
---
I feel it wouldn't be plausible to take these functions out of the current retail either.  Grave has been dug out already.
---
&gt; Comparing another language (while not knowing your own) to different levels of math. 
---
The idea is literally the same, you fucking moron. You start with something easy, and gradually increase difficulty. You do it with languages, you do it with math. You do it with literally everything you're being taught in school.
---
&gt; not reading the rest, that sole idiotic comparison fried my brain 
---
I've never seen anyone as stubborn as you. Instead of just admitting you're talking out of your ass, you change the subject and refuse to read what I write. I wonder how far you're going to get in life thinking you're more clever than the countless of people doing actual studies on these subjects. Lmao.
---
Yes.
---
Or maybe Wildstar just wasn't as good.
---
Love this mate 
---
God, it was the original Fortnite. 
---
Streams? u forgot that one :p
---
I can guarantee that I will come back.
---
They also need spell damage for that big arcane shot damage crit lol
---
Wildstar died because the game was terribly optimized (on launch), had a terrible art style, a terrible story, and to top it all off had boring 5-button action combat.
---
Too probable to not make me tense up
---
You have to ask *why* Wildstar wasn't as good. When you ask that questions you realize it was the attunement process, the lack of catch-up mechanics, the focus on 40-man, end-game raiding, etc.
---
But you can extend this to a number of MMOs that are in the process of falling apart, like EvE Online, the famously hardcore game which was [finally sold to a Korean MMO-maker.](https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/06/black-desert-online-creator-pearl-abyss-acquires-eve-online-maker-ccp-games-for-425-million/)
---
is this really what you spend your time thinking about? holy shit what a dumbass post
---
ah, I never visit those stores anymore, I only had a console once, a PS2  , to play GTA San Andreas.  I sold it  within a year because WOW didn't leave time  for other games in 2005, and I have never been interested  in consoles 
---
Kind of. I remember seeing alot of wow stuff in main stream media 
---
Amazing horticulture skills. That hookah in there looks great too with the flash of color. 
---
&gt; Wildstar died because the game was terribly optimized (on launch), had a terrible art style, a terrible story, and to top it all off had boring 5-button action combat.
---
These are all things that Classic was (and is) regularly accused of too. *Especially* the [boring 5-button combat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aj6hq9/is_the_frost_mage_rotation_really_just_frost_bolt/)
---
Not really seeing the issue here. Just go do every dungeon when you reach the appropriate level.
---
Shaman Mustard Rice? What does it mean?

What would you say about: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uE00qoZE0b0hx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uE00qoZE0b0hx)
---
https://youtu.be/fO1BxlaP53c?t=68
---
I know nothing about Wildstar but your comparison seems pretty disingenuous. 
---
How was the class design, setting, lore, graphics, difficulty etc? Like theres so much that goes into an mmo, and youre literally trying to tether the failure of this game to classic because they both have things like attunements? Bruh.
---
Buggy imbalanced and grindy is what true mmo’s are. It’s impossible to please everyone so don’t try to. The point is to create a fantastic new world that people want to immerse themselves in.
---
Wow Vanilla demo gave me the same feeling as D2 gives me, when I go back and play, "holy hell this is clunky and feels bad, but it was great in it's time".  Nostalgia only goes so far, and so long.  The only D2 I can play is heavily modified  (median xl, and to some extent path of Diablo) and the game still shines through with it's clunkiness.
---
I highly suggest instead of a disbelieving, knee-jerk reaction like this—instead read the articles I linked, written by people who write about games and gaming professionally and might—just might—know more about the topic than you do.
---
I like how you conveniently omit the fact that it was by far the buggiest MMO to ever be released (and yes, I understand the magnitude of that claim). It also had a completely broken crafting system which meant every single drop in any dungeon/raid for the ENTIRE LIFE OF THE GAME was not worth equipping.
---
You just can't use Wildstar to discredit the idea of difficult attunements/content. Wildstar had far far too many problems to control for.
---
I saw a similar post which said roughly 4% PvE sword dps, but if you really want to play a night elf I’d recommend playing a dagger rogue. The damage is similar, you have higher burst, and since NE’s have the highest combined str/agil starting points, they are technically the best dagger rogues. It will also make gearing significantly easier since your guild will likely have more human rogues/warriors looking for swords that you don’t have to compete with.
---
Plus Perdition’s Blade looks amazing.
---
I think it’s formative in the way that it maintains revenue while remaining free.
---
They develop desirable content packs and add ons to keep people spending, but don’t change the scale of the game for those who don’t buy in.
---
I might be off base, I haven’t played since the game took off because it’s not the social scene I enjoy.
---
I mean, fear ward is just a huge crutch. Some people like to demand it out of priests, but if Horde was able to get through all the content without it (stares at tremor totem) on their priests, I don't see why it's such a huge deal to have on Alliance side. But I digress, some people just want to min/max and want others to play what the "raid needs", which is the crutch.
---
So the idea of playing a shallow game whos design philosophy is rooted in accessibility is "not even close" to true, but you still play retail lol. 
---
If it's a heavily contested area, then I just move on. I like grinding non-quest mobs in secluded areas. If I get camped in one of those areas, then it's a certified griefer that will face my main until he doesn't want to play more that evening.
---
Daily reminder that any form of sharding and loot trading is a change and thus should be strongly opposed by the community
---
0 money down and 50 easy monthly payments!
---
Legion was really, really good. Artifacts, class halls, hidden skins, mage tower, actually good M+ dungeons, pretty cool raids, fighting Legion itself...It was a great expansion. It had its flaws, true. But overall, I very much enjoyed it. I think Legion was the most fun I had since probably Vanilla.
---
Fortnite is to shooter games what WoW was for MMORPGs. Easily accessible, cartoony aesthetic, something for everyone.
---
July 2nd just in time for the release of something else..
---
&gt; by far the buggiest MMO to ever be released
---
Once again, conveniently forgetting the buggy mess that Vanilla was—and every other MMO, actually—was when they were released.
---
We're talking about *design* philosophies. All of you are so mad right now that you keep bringing up shit like the *art style* or problems at launch, or broken crafting systems.
---
*You're making my argument for me.*
---
Turns out, *the journey*, or the hardcore gameplay is not enough if the game doesn't get the casual stuff right. Ironically, WoW Vanilla was called *Casual*craft.
---
I think we can go lower.
---
That's perfectly fine. Once your gear improves many people prefer 30/0/21 for natures swiftness as it give more flexibility, like an instead heal and being able to instant cast CL while on the move.
---
Bro, there aren’t any troll druids. 
---
Why are you posting this a second time?
---
money doesn't mean shit if the server is hosted in a country that doesn't give a shit about USA business laws.  
---
You are delusional if you think that Activision can do anything about a server hosted in let's say the Ukraine 
---
I'd enlarge the text for you but clearly you can't read anyways
---
There aren’t any troll druids in vanilla friend. 
---
Yeah :)
---
If you want to be a night elf priest then be a night elf priest.
---
Only in the most extreme min-max try hard guilds would that even come up as a problem. There will be plenty of guilds doing just fine with people playing what they enjoy.
---
Dwarf priests in retail classic were fairly few and far between from what I remember and many of those were probably re-rolled after it became apparent that it was a pve advantage at times.  The encounters are not designed around needing to have it, it just may make some of them easier.
---
June 25th. 
---
Why? The latest FF14 expansion drops July 2nd but Early Access starts June 26th. Announcing it in say, March or April might sway some people from FF14 and come right back to Classic WoW, especially if it launches sooner than it.
---
I'm not saying it's going to tank FF14 playerbase, but it would be a cheap move to snag a few of their players who are on the fence about 2 big MMO "releases" during summer.
---
Well, for the vote thing, EVERYONE should have to say OK on the vote. If you're the one random guy with a group of 4, the 4 would obviously vote OK on the trade.

The question here is: Are you a bear Druid? If so, enchanting, if not, anything you like. The Smoking Heart of the Mountain at 265 enchanting is BiS for Bear Tanks through Naxx if I remember correctly. The flat armor bonus on the trinket scales up with bear form and the resistances are always nice in vanilla.
---
Gathering and high end production professions make money, engineering is the best profession in the game but it’s a huge gold sink. Outside of that it’s mostly preference.
---
Leatherworking helps immensely while leveling, as I’ve had guildies help gear me with things like wolfshead helm or other helpful blues. You can also fill gaps in your questing greens with leatherworking armor, get early green shoulders/helms by crafting them, or make a supplemental set for healing rather than try to get lucky.
---
*Wolfshead is widely considered to be the best Druid dps item up to T6 in TBC because it enables powershifting. If you want to DPS seriously as Feral this item will be required, and it can be worn as early as 40 if you can craft/buy it from leatherwork(ing/er).
---
This, love classic but I will love it even more if I wait for it another 6 months 
---
Do you mind PMing me the server? (i think saying it outloud is against subreddit rules)
---
Been looking to entertain myself with a good server before summer
---
yeah, it was very good in PvE back then from what I heard (free DPS), and sorta scary in the arenas, UA lock + NE shadow priest suddenly had a much higher damage output. troll shadow priests were still better in that combo, but that ain't exactly hard, since it was basically built for them.
---
I removed some panels, people were getting confused about the meaning
---
Live isn't that bad. I'd much rather play it than a private server. I'm super pumped for classic and will hard switch 100% once it comes out and only play it, but all this hate on retail is pathetic. 
---
One really nice thing about live is that you are less beholden to a mediocre or even bad tank/healer. I really hated dealing with entitled tank/heals in classic and BC. Hopefully people have gotten smarter since then and will call people out on their bullshit. I'm planning to tank most of my 5 means to avoid it but hopefully people playing those roles aren't quite as arrogant this go around.
---
I started feeling that way in wotlk, and every time I played after that, I got even more disconnected from it.
---
It's annoying because you're just listing a few features you don't like that Wildstar had and then using the fact that it was a huge failure to conclude that only those specific features are bad. When in reality Wildstar had a preposterous amount of problems, so many in fact that you can't possibly narrow its failure down to only a select few features you didn't like about the game.
---
You're being intentionally dishonest, and yes, when I see people doing that it does make me kinda mad.
---
You sound like somebody who defends the morals of the bible (killing children and homosexuals, slavery is good and more of that nonsense)
---
I would level your main first. Every class has some method of farming gold and this is a very unique opportunity to relive wow when many people will be seeing it for the first time/first time in over a decade. Enjoy the experience and play what you want to play. 1-60 is a serious time investment and you may get burnt out if you speed level a class you aren’t that interested in just for the sake of continually grinding later on.
---
Plus, if you have your main leveled earlier that’s more time to meet people and join a solid guild that will stand beside you through whatever you choose to do in the game. 
---
&gt; You're being intentionally dishonest, and yes, when I see people doing that it does make me kinda mad.
---
I highly suggest that instead of such a disbelieving, knee-jerk reaction—read the articles I linked, written by people who write about games professionally, and might—just might—have better insight than you.
---
I really can't see a Paladin being able to generate the threat to raid tank a boss (Feral had similar issues with bosses), but I mainly raided Horde so I could be mistaken. I was under the impression that Paladins were even worse at threat generation than Druids.
---
Yeah I agree but in the context of starshards vs fear ward. Fear ward every time. 
---
The makers of the Oil of Immolation really screwed up their marketability with that name.
---
I could see them just doing the raid locks when the classic servers launch and gradually unlocking them, but I don't see them doing "new" servers that start over from scratch within the first year or two of classic being released.  
---
Not everyone is going to rush to max level so the whole "3 months" would spread the player base so thin and leave nothing but dead servers in its wake because everyone will go to the new shiny servers every few months and then at that point they'll have to merge.
---
Best way to do this: Release all the servers at once when Classic drops. Time gate raids like the original Classic did. After all the content has gone through its complete cycle (nearly 2 years), come up with alternate servers that start from scratch for people who want to do the journey again.
---
Too many new servers = more low pop servers than anything.
---
That largely depends on how much CC they have. Against competent players? Usually no. If you have teammates who can peel, better gear, unskilled opponents or catch them unprepared then you can definitely have better chances.
---
Vanilla isn’t an age of unstoppable healers like some later expansions have been.
---
When your healers are all feared or hunters are feared when magmadar enrages and you have no tranq. 
---
Dont be so ridiculous. Because someone picked a certain race, they dont know how to play their class.
---
DI.FM Probably the liquid channel for most of it, but I could be on any of them realistically.
---
People are making a bit deal out of it. Most serious guilds will take a player who has time and commitment over a player with best race/class combination. Only the most hardcore guilds demands specific combos. 
---
Exactly this ^^ MC and BWL no problem. But you won’t see cthun or KT bro. The only guilds that will make it that far are the ultra try hards that won’t touch anything but dwarf priest. 
---
Not needed in pve. Fear ward is actually needed from lack of tremor totem. 
---
I agree though stoneform is dope.
---
I know. It's easy to blame rogues for ganking, but they get ganked too lol.
---
They get the worst rep, probably because so many people play them as PvP characters.
---
Not for myself and a lot of others 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
By that way of thinking, though, absolutely zero Horde guilds would have ever cleared MC even, which we all know just isn't true. I'm not saying that Fear Ward isn't a great advantage *especially* in MC, Onyxia and BWL, but as you get into later content where fears are less used as a mechanic, an army of dwarf priests maybe isn't necessary. Even if those Qiraji Brainwashers are a huge pain in the ass.
---
Yeah, you will be doing 90% of the quests anyway to get to max if you're not grinding excessively. You might miss 1 or 2 obscure neat chains but if you'll be quest starved enough to see basically every zone from 30-60.

Wildstar shut down because of mismanagement.  It was "hardcore," but only ever released 2-3 raids.  It had an attunement system, but it was speed runs of every dungeon.  They started with a huge surge of people and mass released servers.
---
Wildstar didn't fail because it was hardcore.  It failed because the company screwed up.
---
And even if it had failed for being hardcore, that'd be irrelevant.  WoW was never a hardcore only mmo in the first place.
---
Your opinion that retail is better than classic is just that. An opinion.  And one not shared by most people on this sub.  In fact, this sub largely exists to support the opposite of your opinion.
---
The fact is at the end of Wrath WoW had 12+ million active subscriptions.  The fact is, based off of server counts of active characters, we can estimate there are currently less than 2 million active subscriptions (heels vs babyface has a video on it, though he misses the fact that the server sites declare characters are not separated by account as they can't verify account details).
---
The fact is. WoW is being propped up by a combination of subscription and microtransactions and we've still reached a point where Activision Blizzard have agreed to launch classic servers.
---
We can therefore conclude that retail isn't bringing in enough money anymore.  We can also conclude that Activision Blizzard is hoping to boost income by propping up retail's floundering sub numbers.
---
Keep enjoying your retail experience.  Really.  If WoW fails overall because retail finishes it's slow death classic will die too.  But stop coming to a subreddit that exists because people have the opposite of your opinion about a game to try and browbeat us into accepting that a game many of us have stopped enjoying at all is somehow objectively better than a game we still enjoy after all this time.

What i love the most about the classic community, is not that they want the game because it was good, they want classic because retail is bad. Hence there is this constant circlejerking between the two. Well that's my theory at least.
---
I just don’t like private servers that much personally, always some drama or sketchyness after awhile lol.

I played druid during vanilla. And to me it was like that yes. I leveled a rogue to level 60 before, but got bored by it, especially in PvE. When I got my druid to 60, I never bother to play my rogue again. 
---
I was mainly a feral druid during raids, but also quite easily collected the resto sets too. I didn't have to join extra raids. Because there are not many other druids in the raids, it's much easier to gear up a druid than most other classes. I never specced anything other than feral, but could easily heal lvl 60 instances, or sometimes support healing during raids. Mind you, I was not in a hardcore raiding guild. They were doing ZG, MC, BWL and later AQ20, but not going for server-firsts.
---
And in the same respect, playing a Rogue/Druid who counter-ganks has been just as much fun as playing a Darkmoon Blade, except I get to PvP more than once a millennia.
---
I personally think the idea of “seasons” in wow clashes with what vanilla wow stands for. It’s not a race, it’s not constantly restarting fresh, it’s not separating the player base.   I agree that after while it may get stale. And as unpopular of an opinion as it might be, I would love to see them experiment with adding new content to vanilla.  But only after all the current content is exhausted and if it starts to die. OSRS Has has success adding new content and still does to this day
---
I’m not sure if you’ve played vanilla. This is the thinking of the community. It’s like taking a guy in greens. Sure you can make it work but your not as optimized. 
---
Well I just watched a video of it and the character movement and combat looked pretty bad. Not at all what I want from an mmorpg.

Oh, good to know daggers are viable too, everyone makes it seem like swrods is the only way to go for raiding. I actually prefer playing dagger in dungeons.
---
Thx.
---
&gt; And even if it had failed for being hardcore, that'd be irrelevant. WoW was never a hardcore only mmo in the first place.
---
And I'm pushing back against this idea that if only retail was more like vanilla it'd be more popular. *It wouldn't.*
---
I highly suggest that instead of such a disbelieving, knee-jerk reaction—you read the articles I linked, written by people who write about games professionally, who might—just might—have better insight than you.
---
&gt; And one not shared by most people on this sub. In fact, this sub largely exists to support the opposite of your opinion.

Which is exactly what I said. Here, I'll quote me again:

“I've played on private servers for years but I gotta say, you're in an echo chamber right now. This thought-process only makes sense as long as you don't step outside of this artificial bubble.”

Yes! The one expansion that introduced all the things the boomers in here claim they hate about modern WoW.

&gt; Keep enjoying your retail experience.

I don't play retail. I'm just one of the only honest commentators in this sub.

No real interesting game play? What lol. I like wow, played in vanilla, played cs a little back in highschool and got into fortnite. I still play other style games (MTG, legion TD, WoW private servers) but can assure you, fortnite absolutely has "interesting" gameplay, mechanics, and above all, a very well polished graphics design

When you can only get "special" mounts that are either from another race of your faction, or extremely rare drops from ZG and Stratholme UD, or from the Scarab Lord event. That's basically your race's mount + the other 3 and then 4 others. So it's 8 total mounts if you disregard the colors you can  choose from. Now you get a mount just for sneezing, of course no one cares. 
---
Loot is being drip fed to you through an RNG slot machine system where you practically can't target any item, as opposed to the earlier expansions where you knew which item was where and you farmed it until you got it and you were done. Now you feel like you're never done, you don't feel like the item has any value because it was basically like a scratch lottery ticket. Nothing has value.
---
The biggest thing people don’t consider when raiding is the idea of loot scarcity. Sure swords are technically BiS for Combat &amp; Sub with an advantage for Humans, but it’s entirely RNG to see what drops. You might see only maces or fist weapons for 2 months before a sword drops.
---
I’d much rather be the dagger rogue who’s just looking for the 2 dagger drops from MC that will last you up to AQ40 with much less competition than 2 of the most stacked classes who are each dual wielding in that tier.
---
I tried WildStar, wasn't my thing, and I'm what you'd call an old school Vanilla player. My best times was during Vanilla and BC. The reason WildStar didn't appeal to me was that it simply wasn't as good as Vanilla/BC WoW, in spite of ex-WoW developers making it. 
---
I tend to get stuck in those moments when 2-3 areas have only orange/red quests.
---
I encountered that a lot in my mid 30’s and especially in my 40’s. The 50’s aren’t really that bad.
---
&gt; wants to focus on trying to experience as much of the leveling content as possible

I am not sure how this is possible while:
---
&gt; stay away from the really bad exp-per-hour ones
---
Money is literally the only thing in the world that can make things matter where they might not otherwise... Are you in elementary school or something?

---
WoW can only die by suicide.
---
Mostly Twitch or a podcast.

Automated systems like these don’t really work in Vanilla, since itemization is so unique.
---
*forest
---
I fully agree with you from an objective standpoint.
---
But subjectively I'am not drawn to retail since Wraith (I stopped shortly after release) and many of my friends were neither. The ones (2) that still play modern WoW are very casual style players. Not in the sense of how much they play but *how* they play and what they want from a game.
---
**Two examples of people who play modern WoW**
---
One of them openly said to me (many times) that he simply wants to completely zone out w/o facing a real challenge. He especially doesn't want to be "forced" to socialize and build relationships to accomplish anything. For him WoW and many other games are purely about flair, fluff, fantasy, lore and *cosmetics*.
---
The other one actually tries to dabble in competitive and harder games but never really achieves much because he is easily frustrated (my observation). As soon as he faces a challenge (in a game) he externalizes the problems he is facing. Also he cares *very* much about cosmetics, the looks of stuff and even RP. He is also easily fooled by fake accomplishments, which ties into the previous point. I love the guy but this is how it is.
---
**Examples of people who dislike modern but play vanilla**
---
Me, my brother and a good friend, who played vanilla/tbc quite hardcore, recently started to play on a pserver together. The reason: We wanted to play a game together again that is relaxing and casual. Casual? Yes, MMOs as we see it are "casual games". They are almost purely a function of time.
---
From our standpoint "accomplishments" in WoW and basically any MMORPG that we know of are inherently fake. I personally never played alot of the more hardcore MMOs like EVE or DFO, but even there it is fundamentally true. The requirement of mechanical skill and player coordination you need to have is *very* minimal to competitive online games. The only real standout attribute you need to learn and develop, is the weird but fun social aspect of guilds/pvp-premades.
---
And that is why we like playing vanilla: The social aspect of it is what makes the game interesting for us. We are havily turned off by the coercing nature of modern WoW, because vanilla already has more than enough of that.
---
it really isn't. 
---
I can see why some people prefer legion over vanilla but bfa is just trash that doesn't cater to anyone but addicts and maybe the 1% top players that spams mythic content
---
Exactly how I've felt for several years now. It really was a strange thing to behold. I think the 'slow but regular' significant moves away from the classic game with each xpac slowly chipped away at our love of the game until there was nothing left to care about, it was all gone, either eliminated or replaced.
---
Retail is on that path but Classic will save the day lol.
---
I triex Warhammer and Age of Conan.  Rift. And what I thought had massive promise, Wildstar. 
---
Does it not negate fear effects? Fear ward is the only mechanic the alliance has against fear. Why dwarf priests are valued so highly. 
---
Priests other than dwarf are taken, were taken and will be taken to raids. I don’t think you’ve read my replies. I’ve clearly stated the dwarf is superior but unless you are min maxing you will be fine as any race. See horde priests. 
---
Ingame music
---
That seems pretty much impossible to me. I've lost count of how many toons I've leveled on retail (starting in late vanilla / early tbc) and on private servers and I've never had to grind or go searching out new quests. Maybe alliance leveling is different but for me it's always been extremely linear.
---
I think I reached skill 37 in fishing once, and that took me 2 months. Never had any other character with a skill in fishing above 1

WAR actually sucked me away from WoW completely. I never went back after that (until Nost). I was a heavy PvPer anyway, so WAR was was *right* up my alley. It's a shame EA killed it. 
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
If I'm in the Blizzard/Activision front office I'm looking to generate revenue with existing assets.  The natural progression would be Classic - Vanilla into Classic - The Burning Crusade, if the metrics show Classic is holding enough subs to justify it.  Not new content on an aged platform.  Runescape and Wow are two different animals.  
---
Otherwise, I can't see seasons but there will be new realms and realm mergers once the old ones die.  
---
Same here. Day 1
---
The best advice I can give to you is to *not* go into Classic already having aspirations for BiS. I don't think lots of retail guys understand just how ridiculously difficult and long it will be to obtain a full set.
---
I'll be listening to the good old 2004-2008 teenage metal playlist while chatting with my leveling buddies all day long and it's gonna be awesome.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Oh its been practiced to perfection haha Im locked and loaded.

---
&gt;I like to call it: *How Blizzard Better Get Classic Perfect or The Company is Fucking Doomed.*
---
You literally don't even read your own articles. Karl is a good writer, which is why he's honest in pointing out the truth:
---
&gt; ... the success (or failure) of Classic will not single handedly transform the company in a radical way.
---
If you bothered to actually read my entire post you'd know that I already mentioned this:
---
&gt; Classic is just another game mode designed to keep players like you subscribed to Blizzard. 
---
&gt; I've played Vanilla p-servers for years, so I'm not some retail-fanboy. But what I am is honest about the lay of the land and what these games actually contain within them. The fact is, retail is a better game for most people than Classic will be. Classic is for an older generation of players who need a certain type of gameplay in order to feel rewarded.
---
So, I agree with Karl Ahlstedt's analysis and not yours—I don't think that if Blizzard messes up Classic the company is *doomed*. Classic's success will not single-handedly transform Blizzard in a radical way.
---
I'm too enthralled by the utility of shamans in raid and chain lightning/heal. Otherwise I'd hybrid dps/tank
---
After Death Coil for sure.
---
I spent MONTHS running every dungeon that had shadkwcraft for my rogue, only ever saw 1 piece drop, the helm, and a Druid rolled on it and took it, so yea while I have a list of bis gear and will try to get it, i’m not holding my breath because I remember what WoW loot is like.
---
TT is reactive, Fear Ward is not-- which makes it a bit simpler to keep it up on the people you're assigned to protect.    
---
&gt;Why dwarf priests are valued so highly.    
---
Thanks, I know that already. I still think it's possible to clear a vanilla raid without taking 100% dwarf priests.
---
I would say nothing was a "WoW Killer" until GW2 and then FFXIV
---
Like I said at the end of my post:
---
&gt; The fact is, retail is a better game for most people than Classic will be. Classic is for an older generation of players who need a certain type of gameplay in order to feel rewarded.
---
They are hemorrhaging management at a dooming rate. Sure, they could float on Overwatch et al as a company but Classic is crutch in recovering their stock, period.
---
One: The reason people on this subreddit believe WoW might be more popular if it hadn't abandoned all of its old design philosophies is because subs cascaded downward the expansion after those changes started happening.
---
Two: Yes, Wrath is the expansion that introduced many of the changes that started the new era.  Note: not all, but many.  Also note, by the end of the next expansion (Cataclysm) which finished the initial transition, subs dropped to roughly 6 million before surging to 9 million for MoP release.  That's literally a loss of half the subscribers over the course of an expansion.
---
Three: You say you don't play retail.  When was the last time you played retail WoW? Have you tried BfA?  I have, and it's a shitshow.  You've said class fantasy is at an all time high... and we're the ones with delusions?  Legion had great class fantasy, if you ignored the glaring lack of any before you could take the artifact weapon quests.  BfA killed all of that.  Class fantasy is dead again, because Activision Blizzard releases every expansion like it's a new game and we should never touch anything else in WoW.
---
Four: I don't know if WoW would have not lost a net total of approximately 10 million subscribers between Wrath and now if they hadn't changed the game.  I do know I'd still be playing it, and I do know that with the changes they made they lost the subscribers they did.
---
Five: Popularity may be a measure of success, but it's not exactly a measure of quality.  Even if classic is a less popular way of playing WoW than retail, I will still have fun playing it.  And that's something retail doesn't give me.
---
&gt; Well I just watched a video of it
---
Lol, unironically the hottest take in this thread.
---
Aye! Those shoulders were not available in Vanilla.
---
There was an article claiming this would be a natural chain of events- it was a really interesting financial advisory article actually, since Blizz/Activ stock is down 43% from last Q I believe, and it is charted to raise back up with the launch of Classic for the next 3 years, and then again they say until 2025 due to the likelyhood of Burning Crusade launching. However, I think this is a fallacy; many players are returning *solely* for Classic, and the inevitable Burning Crusade is a *fad* that *has* to be followed if one wants to keep playing the most similar playstyle game. It by no means ensures a playerbase, and I infact think it will fall off incredibly hard if they take the tried and true route. If we know TBC follows Classic, we know WotlK can only be what comes next. And after that? This is ultimately disheartening, and the beginning of the end.
---
Swtor was pretty big 
---
Yeah these guys just don't get it. There is no such thing as setting goals for optimum loadout like BiS from the get-go. The only people that are going to even come close to doing that anytime soon will be Raid leaders and master looters. Classic is all about watching the AH and getting the best you can. And yes, you *will* wear greens... a lot. 
---
Retail BiS == Classic "I finally am wearing all blues"
---
I'm not sure yet if i want to go in with the mindset of levling guide, rushing etc. Or if i just want to take it slow and try to enjoy every moment and "stray from the main path" etc as i did in vanilla. But in the case of this post, i just find it very fun to speculate and theorycraft what might be the best items while we are waiting for Classic. To me it seems more fun to have a goal atleast, evan to i might not reach it 100%, if that makes sense.
---
Herbalism/Enchanting with an alt you can mail your herbs to, preferably one who's lvl 15 and has Tailoring to convert your cloth into more disenchantable BOEs.  At 55-60 switch to Alchemy/Enchanting because consumables are life.
---
Skinning will tempt you into leatherworking which is just a gold sink.
---
I managed to kill a cactus once  :( 
---
Wasn't Rift a Wow Killer?
---
This is a good attitude and the best way to approach it. I mean, you need goals, but don't get blinded by them. Playing classic will be more carrot-and-stick, because you will be constantly excited about every little upgrade you get that's marginally better than what you're wearing. 
---
You will be fine. A bad priest is one that refuses to heal. You aren't forced to be dwarf on alliance to be good in PvE same as you aren't forced to be undead priest on Horde for PvP - it is just a bit better to be one.
---
This commercial was during Burning Crusade lol
---
But that's how WoW became so big in the first place. By being so extremely forgiving and friendly towards the casual players compared to all the other MMOs back then.
---
DAE Activision BAD?
---
Coming from someone advocating playing a game that literally has and will never have no new content where everything has already been done before you'll even login, sure guess we're a little illogical huh? Although if I think about it, I'm not sure the last time I saw the 99% get far in a mythic raid, high m+, or high end PvP. So I guess that whole accessibility thing means jack, eh? 
---
Actually the theme of Wildstar never convinced me, so I never even tried it. I want a fantasy mmo not a cartoony space mmo. 
---
&gt; Popularity may be a measure of success, but it's not exactly a measure of quality.
---
Then I think we can find some common ground here. I agree with literally everything you've said.
---
While popularity might not be a measure of quality, it is definitely a measure of how long you can keep the servers on.
---
My perspective, after years playing on private servers, is that I understand that Classic won't be massively profitable, but I want it to be profitable *enough* to last for the long haul.
---
This means understanding what compromises need to be made over the years to ensure this. Unlike the other posters in this sub, I don't want just the short-term nostalgia-hit, before moving on to the next thing.
---
I want to see what Vanilla would have looked like had TBC never been released. I want to see a fully-realized endgame where everyone has access to full Naxx gear and what crazy builds and compositions will be possible once that happens.
---
None of those things will happen unless we're able to fit the square peg (an MMO released in 2004) into a circle hole (the gaming world in 2018.)
---
What is this Leeroy Jenkins you're talking about?
---
Rogue is kinda crappy for leveling and PvPing at the same time. First off rogues, even when full PVE spec, are bottom tier for leveling speed. I've leveled four rogues on PvP pServers and you sacrifice even more leveling speed/convenience for the ability to destroy people in PvP. Daggers are beyond slow in a solo PvE experience because you have zero ability to backstab/ambush beyond the opener. Gouging to get behind is doable but again, extremely slow. 
---
You can do a combat hybrid spec with improved sprint/kick and endurance for the CD reduction, but at the end of the day you're still sacrificing a lot to be PvP oriented as an already poor PvE class. 
---
Engineering is almost mandatory as a rogue to offset the weaknesses you will have as combat spec. Iron Grenades, Net-o-matic, and Discombobulator Rays are a boon to your PvP capabilities early on. 
---
&gt;The idea is literally the same, you fucking moron 
---
No its not you sperg. Its like trying to teach kid a math while the kid doesn't know numbers.  
---
They added too many mounts to the game that have no useful connection with them. It used to be only faction based mounts or mounts that required a long quest chain, but were still linked to a faction. Now there are just way too many. 
---
Do you not DKP?
---
It is not a real story of mine. Sorry if this was a joke. I am bad with those. ¯\\\_(° ͜ʖ °)\_/¯
---
Every few days I get the itch to play WoW. I turn on my computer, go to the WoW site and log into my account. But just before I hit the resub button, I think - nah, Classic's almost here. I can wait.
---
It was unfinished, the dude tells you that the road ahead is long and blah blah then just hands you the totem. There was air elementals on top of a needle in thousand needles only viewable with the sapta that never got used, proving they ran out of time with the quests, or scrapped it
---
Almost the exact opposite of what your article stated. Amazin' takes, dude.
---
&gt;How popular was classic WoW?  
---
Around 7 million active monthly players at the time this commercial came out.  
---
Terrible UI placement, how did that get past QA
---
I love how he turned into a troll at the end
---
You're cherry picking my comments so fucking hard. You haven't answered once, if the countless of studies are wrong on this subject.
---
&gt; No its not you sperg. Its like trying to teach kid math while the kid doesn't know numbers. 
---
Except you said that teaching basic words was useless, according to one of your first comments. So you do agree you have to start somewhere easy, in terms of languages, by learning basic words and their meaning?
---
The thing is... the majority on this subreddit actively dislike what Activision Blizzard has done with retail.  It's therefore no wonder they panic at the thought of Activision Blizzard making changes to classic.
---
It's a case of fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.
---
We don't trust the people in charge not to turn classic into a game we don't enjoy playing.  Again.
---
That's the concern.  It's not "Vanilla was perfect," it's "Retail is so bad, and the people that turned Vanilla into Retail are now in charge of Classic.  We can't let them change anything or it'll be Retail all over again."
---
And while that's certainly borne of fear and panic, it's not entirely wrong.  We're the people they've already alienated and abandoned in pursuit of a larger market.
---
Not charry picking anything.  
---
Just ripping apart your first sentences since they are that shit, rest must be even worse so I dont bother reading.  
---
100% agree.
---
I mean it's true to some degree. 
---
Just don't go in thinking you can do as you please in endgame content. 
---
He's joking, that date is just made up out of thin air. Blizzard only releases games on Tuesdays.
---
Since you're ignoring my question, I'll only ask that: Do you disagree with the huge amount of studies and articles out there, on this subject, which literally say the opposite of what you're saying?

If you think that's a positive article you need new eyeballs. That is a warning article. Between the sensitivity to Classic's success and even worse -- the transition into mobile -- the company as far as we (gamers) know it is gone if this fails. I'd sit here and fucking pedantically cherry-pick clauses with you, but I can already see you're in the wrong fucking subreddit anyway.
---
It's fine.
---
I played NE Priest on pserver to 60 as an alt just cuz I wanted to shadowmeld + MC hordes off cliffs. It's pretty fun but not as strong as you'd think.
---
You are going to get constantly whispered about how you should reroll Dwarf, so prepare for that.
---
In dungeons while leveling and at 60 you are gonna be equally desired to any other priest for dungeon groups.
---
At 60 Raiding, you easily can find a guild and raid but if a guild has 2 applicants where 1 is Dwarf and 1 is NE, they will prefer the Dwarf, but only need like 2 of them in a raid, and since most pserver gamers are hardcore most of them play Dwarf so it's not a problem.
---
In PvP you are going to be a lot less desirable than both Human and Dwarf, it's kind of a big deal in PvP that you don't have Desperate Prayer. 
---
If you have any interest in being a Druid healer instead, I would suggest that. You can play a Night Elf and be extremely desired if you do.
---
The problem with NE Priest is not that it is weak, it is that todays elitist players turn their nose when they see it and blow it out to be a much bigger deal than it is. I never regretted playing my NE Priest.
---
I would rather say them to be prepared to play the class, not the specific spec. I think being a oomkin in MC is fine if you have T2 raid group with you, but you should be fine with healing until then. Or being the one feral druid. Same goes for all the other meme specs, perhaps with the exception of prot paladin. That just doesn't work in raids. 
---
HOW DARE U DO JOKE?! SEIZE HIM!!
---
I love WoW music and listen to it all the time. But in Classic I get tired of the repetitive Plains track over time. I wonder if someone will make an addon to play the Cataclysm music they added to old zones. Mulgore is fantastic. Obviously I don't mean the battle music, just the new unique zone tracks they added.
---
You fail to understand what I'm saying tho.  
---
You also edited your comment so I didn't even see your question.  
---
You say its beneficial to start early on even with bare bones.  
---
Sure.  
---
What I'm saying is that its a massive waste of funds and time as kids barely learn anything from it that they couldn't do in 10 times shorter time at later grade when they have the grasp of their own language first and foremost.  
---
If you really want to raid heal as a night elf, and you don’t want to deal with “lolstarshards” and “y u no fear ward!?”, then roll a Druid instead.  It’s an easy way to avoid the stupid memes and elitism that you will face as a night elf priest.  Raid leaders would be very happy to have a Druid vs begrudgingly accepting a night elf priest.  If you don’t have thin skin, and you’re willing to fight a little harder for your raid spot, by all means roll that sexy nelf.
---
Fortnite is for kids still shitting themselves lol
---
&gt; ...  The pivot towards mobile gaming poses an arguably greater risk **&lt;than classic&gt;** for the firm

Oh, and:
---
&gt; I'd sit here and pedantically cherry-pick clauses from it with you
---
I was still wearing blues in AQ40, I don’t think I ever wore all epics until mid TBC.
---
I read the articles the last time you copy/pasted the original comment on this sub. There's no science behind them. Just opinion masquerading as objective fact.
---
I had three 60s in classic (pre-BC) and among them all I had a single epic. And it was BoE trash really (Eye of Flame).
---
Troll Hunter ftw 
---
Dark Spears 4 Life! 
---
pretty epic
---
I feel like SWToR had potential, I remember being really excited about it but its flaws killed the game. Too bad as I think it was released during Cata which was when WoW took a nosedive in quality for me.
---
I guess I have to quote myself again:
---
&gt; written by people who write about games professionally, who might—just might—have better insight than you.
---
I literally just said that. Insight. You can write about literature, art, and other non-scientific things with more insight than the average peanut gallery.
---
I know Reddit is full of STEMlords, but come on.
---
this is awesome
---
Bring the player, not the c̶l̶a̶s̶s̶  race.
---
If you killed your father, you'd want a keepsake too.
---
Idk about official classic, but the point of weapon skill in real classic was never hit. It was to reduce the severity of glancing blows against mobs above lvl 60. I don't think ranged attacks could even glance, so the effects were just a minor hit buff (def not 3 %.) It was 100x more important for melee than ranged. 
---
Pro warlock slightl out gearing each rogue? Yea, he's having 2 free meals out of that one. (Soul Link spec included)
---
During WoTLK (or maybe Cata?) everyone was raving about Aion. Ended up being the biggest garbage ever when it was released.
---
i feel like people who were calling GW2 a WoW killer either didnt know WoW or didnt know guild wars.
---
I’m leveling a lock now for the first time. 30-40 felt really strong in world pvp. I can constantly beat people many levels above me and 2v1’s. You have a lot of tools at your disposal with healthstone, fear, and sacrifice shield. Mages, warriors and druids will have a pretty hard time with you.
---
&gt;You also edited your comment so I didn't even see your question. 
---
The question was never edited in. I edited typos.
---
&gt; What I'm saying is that its a massive waste of funds and time as kids  barely learn anything from it that they couldn't do in 10 times shorter  time at later grade when they have the grasp of their own language first  and foremost. 
---
According to who? You? - It's not a massive waste, because one of the best traits in today's society is to be bilingual, because not only is our society more diverse than ever. We're also communicating with people all over the world, much more than 10 or 20 years ago. On top of that, we have only gotten better at being bilingual, and if we somehow deem it a "massive waste of funds" you're raising a generation which is going to statistically be worse than the generation before them at languages. 
---
I'll ask again; Do you disagree with the with the huge amount of studies and articles out there, which have studied being or trying to be bilingual at an early age (before fifth grade)? 
---
We're not talking about efficiency here, otherwise, we might as well have started learning many other things at a later age, because we need less hours and can transition into harder content much quicker.
---
Theyre saying they want a guide. If youve played vanilla a lot if course you know when to go to dungeons, where they are, and where the questd are, but speed leveling guides skip a lot of that.
---
What is more Vanilla/Classic than a Human Warrior?
---
King's Honor
---
Random Photoshopper speaks the truth,
---
Alliance leveling is harder from 1-30 for newbies or people that dont plan their route or travel to far away zones. Horde had the barrens which solves much of this.
---
That’s exactly my point. You literally said that if Blizzard fucks up Classic the company is *doomed.* 
---
It’s okay to be wrong, mate. No need to keep fighting after you’ve lost. 
---
You will have a BREXIT realm. Don't worry 
---
My ex got matching hearthstone tattoos with her bff on their wrists. No pics sorry.
---
Yeah we heard you - it just doesn’t make any sense.
---
Having the ability to pick your fights, to get the jump or avoid a bad fight is a huge advantage. It is tedious to level with daggers, but you’re still decent with good swords / maces in combat spec. It’s hard for any rogue when you get caught out of stealth. If you look up and see warlock dots it’s GG.
---
Can you explain how it doesn’t make sense?
---
This is funny
---
Agreed, if they choose to continue through the expansions the player base will drop and only cause more conflict and different groups of people clashing on what they want/should be done.  Im pretty sure we're only going to get what we can out of classic and then it kind of looks bleak, But im hoping they figure something out if classic is a major success.
---
To my original comment I think adding new content to classic could be very successful, but it also could be a huge disaster. But either way ill be there :P
---
Hahaha you're so out of touch! You must own shares and are here to try and try and salvage your ill-invested retirement.

Aion, Warhammer, Age of Conan, GW and GW2, FF15, Wildstar, Swtor, ESO. And they've either failed, gone F2P, or simply coexist and do well on their own. Seems weird people have basically been asking for WoW killers since WoW has existed.

FFXI, rather.
---
I don't disagree. Like I said in the post, I believe people will soften up to the idea as time goes on. I was just curious how they thought the issue should be approached. Personally, I think it would be healthy for blizz to make some systemic decisions to set us up for post-naxx content, at least the option of it, along with community participation, but I highly doubt they will, especially since they've rushed it out. 
---
You’d be surprised how a podcast or YouTube videos that are just talking are soothing. I love listening to people talking even though I’m not hearing them. I pick up more than I ever think. 
---
“Battle for Ass-Off?” No that doesn’t sound like anything we’d be interested in. Thank you for the offer.
---
I do have a few hairs trying to become something better on my neck so I guess it counts :D!
---
they have all the tools to make it just as good but they choose not to and i dont ever see it happening, that is if we are talking about retail wow and not retail classic wow
---
It's become a collecting game, which is fine but makes any one mostly meaningless.
---
I recently got the 100 factions exalted mount. Don't really care much about it...
---
I can really relate to this. Around the time a lot of those streamers started Project 60, I bought BFA to give it a try. Got to 120 and then just lost all interest. Nothing is tangibly rewarding or enticing. It's literally a carrot on a stick and once you realize that, the game loses all meaning. 
---
Classic WoW, while being less flashy and grandiose than retail, has this amazing system to make even random quest rewards worth it.
---
What the fuck! 
---
Hey man own it. Props.
---
There have been so many hyped up "WoW-killers" out there it's impossible to name them all. The only one I actually switched from WoW to was Age of Conan, it lasted roughly 2 months before I went back to WoW. BUT I did actually have fun in it, which was surprising to me because I hated everything related to MMORPG's except WoW and Runescape.
---
I've always been in the "there's no WoW-killers out there" group so.. I didn't really care about all the games that came out and rightfully so because 99% of them died.
---
True, and if someone asks you about WoW or what is it you have no quick way to explain it to them without a sentence which is like 50% jargon. 
---
Your last point was pretty dumb making WoW:Classic a P2W point and click adventure would turn lots of folks off the game. 
---
I can only speak for my own experience but I don’t recall Hunters getting top priority during the raiding experience for melee weapons. If it wasn’t an unwritten rule, it was certainly understood that even if a hunter had the DKP, they should pass if a weapon was a significant upgrade, particularly for a rogue.
---
Perhaps the one tricky part is that once Hunters get Rhok’Delar, it’s probably going to be a long time before they replace it, so they may eventually get some weapons that should go to melee DPS. No system is perfect though and as long as everyone works together there is surely a way to make hunters and rogues happy.
---
Idk if this is necessary a “simple” question,  but here goes. I’ve always leveled rogue as combat no weapon specialization up to 40. Then after getting the SM/RFD quest swords respeccing combat swords 40-60.
---
Is there a good dagger build for leveling that doesn’t rely on front stabbing? If it doesn’t gimp the speed too much it might be fun to get into the class fantasy a bit more while leveling. 
---
I was considering rushing up to improved ambush, then going up the combat tree.
---
This was the shop icon in every custom wcIII dbz map that some 12 year old made.
---
I’m telling the dude realistically, he will not be taken as a night elf to naxx, or later parts of Aq40. If buddy wants to play a night elf have at it. 
---
Sure. So compete with the 1-2 raid slots for non dwarf priests. Aka you will not see later content. 
---
Just wait til your pink dress in aq40
---
Yeah I understand that weapon skill seems to be much stronger for melee, but i find it strange that Blizzard would use weapon skill for ranged as a stat if it did not atleast give some reasonable numbers of hit. They evan continued using the stat for hunter gear in Naxxramas when their itemization of gear was much better, like:  The Eye Of Nerub. But as I said I think its hard to say 100% what the % of hit actually was, but in my experience with just the raw numbers of people who have said its around 3%, I choose to believe the majority for now atleast.
---
You will want to just look up what quest items or rewards from dungeons you want and go with that since 99% of all guides will be specific about where and what you are doing as well as class types and other aspects that are best suited for certain spots or quest chains.. You could just follow any guide you like and just stop and do other things as you move along that seem fun.. 
---
Outside of that, the tips are fairly generic and standardized but with all that you lose a lot of the content meant to be stumbled upon or explored but that's what 99% of all these guides are about, they aren't really magical or anything, they just help you avoid the quests that aren't worth while and sometimes that pertains to certain classes.
---
Seriously, world PVP is what slowed me down the most, BG's are pretty quick really and can break up the grind of leveling but world PVP as a rogue was essentially life as an ambush predator so there was a lot of waiting in weird spots for moments of opportunity. 
---
I played Tera for a while and they had little cars as mounts in it. It was mega lame.
---
Back when games were made by passionate people. Now its all capitalists trying to squeeze money out of a dead horse.

The sad realisation you are not, indeed, a farseer to the warsong clan like the song says, but rather, you’re shrek in a dress throwing heal flowers on the plated up knight/berserker. Kek 
---
&gt; Player-freedom is unmatched
---
Player freedom must mean something totally different to you as it does to me. Sure there are a lot of different activites to do in modern wow, but each of them is a totally on-rails, handheld experience where what you do is carefully constructed and designed. There's zero sense of exploration or discovery or interacting with a living dynamic world populated by fellow players. A totally valid playstyle in vanilla PvP server is to just wander off into a zone and see who you run into and what happens. To do that in modern wow doesn't even make sense.
---
It looks like the border area if it was crushed down. The 3 way path looks like the path in Westfall. Off screen to the right there should be a hill and farther right should be the border bridge.
---
That’s not a good analogy. 
---
And I fully acknowledge in the main post of that thread that I know it would be extremely unpopular. 
---
My argument is that when real crimes and real people’s data are on the line, safety trumps player experience. 
---
On PvE servers there might be less skill involved.
---
Try farming Silithid Carapaces for AQ gong or Earthstrike on release and you will know what it means to juggle 80men raids in a cramped up tunnel with hardhitting mobs respawning constantly and two enemy 40men raids attacking you in a pronged attack from two entrances.
---
Many classic players farm PvE content to take their e-peen into the world to PvP. Something you dont get to experience in retail with Devs breaking up city raids and graveyards letting people run back to their corpse in 10seconds.
---
All grinds in the world are a hassle and not at all easy in classic.
---
The latter.
---
Warrior, Priest, Druid, Shaman, Lock.
---
I can't stand not being able to tank or heal dungeons.
---
I would love to see myself enjoy retail more than Classic. I would play it if it was good, but it’s a pipe dream to ask for a retail expansion with a proper leveling experience, no sharding and cross realm bs in every aspect of the game, no lfr that I really should do because the gear is still decent, and no class homogenization. 
---
It’s sad that there is 0 chance that they even improve half of those problems.
---
Forza Motorsport is teaming up with Activision-Blizzard to deliver a top-tier expansion with micro transactions for everyone!!
---
Yes but it's about location too. An old shed that big is going to cost considerably less in the country than it is in the middle of a city.
---
Be sure to pick mark of tyranny on the quest because its bis for tank and you will never find anything as good. (You might want to level enchanting to get the other tank trinket even if you drop enchanting later).
---
That’s just your opinion. You don’t know that for certain. Plus their isn’t a huge amount of fear mechanics in aq or naxx compared to ony, Mc and bwl. 
---
And many people beg to differ, because life isnt so black and white. You can also RMT on various websites that are safe. There are whole websites set up that use scrutiny to see that the gold is handfarmed by legit players. This gold often comes from Russia and other less developed countries in which handfarming and honest trading still nets you enough money to be able to afford a decent living from it.
---
It's similar to the nigeran prince offering you 600% interest in his next big gig. It's willful ignorance that lands you at credit card theft. 
---
So while the RMT market will be bigger without tokens, you can buy honest farmed gold, but it will cost more obviously, because it does not come from tainted sources that often get tracked and then the hacked account + middleman + buyer get banned.

I don't know a guide but just use Joana's guide except doing every dungeon and maybe doing additional quests(that you find fun), and voila you've made more or less what you want out of it.

Early tiers are irrelevant though, people will bring Mages because when the content gets more difficult they are great. 
---
Sure thing, I'll keep it short.
---
If "retail is a better game for most people" then why are retail subscriptions cratering? All the adaptations and concessions they made in the game mean its more suited for young spergs now right? So why are they quitting?
---
&gt; Classic is for an older generation of players who need a certain type of gameplay in order to feel rewarded. 
---
So your position here is players 5-10 years older that someone playing retail now has a radically different psychology and reward schema, just cause. Ok, sounds good!
---
So many wanna be tryhards in here with strong opinions.
---
Obviously dwarf is better. It's amazing for pvp, and really useful for MC/BWL/Ony. You want fear wards on preferably well everyone if possible, especially on rogues doing mag/nef. but COUNTLESS of more casual guilds will take NE priests, it's not a huge deal and if you are the kind of person who cares more about playing NE than having the best racials, you are prolly not considering joining a guild were fear ward is mandatory. 
---
“personally help determine the result of this world conflict” not “solely be known as the one true saviour for which without his intervention we would surely meet calamity”.
---

---
Sorry to be a downer but it would be easier to post my bottom 4 instead . I love all the classes for what they are but I don’t enjoy playing them all.
---
Druid - tried it recently in Vanilla, they’re fun, I like to tank and heal and be able to hide from gankers, but overall their endgame play is just not fun for me. I appreciate the people who play mana batteries but it’s not my ideal. 
---
Shaman - Totem management always seemed like a hassle, they always felt really slow to level. 
---
Rogue - I love to dick around at low levels, but I’ve never had any drive to be that guy, the high level rogue who ganks all in sight oh their way to ZG. Also, rogues seem to be dicks more than any class.
---
Hunter? - I would say priest, but I’d enjoy their 60 play too much, I love to heal. Hunters are just a little meh. I leveled one in old school Classic because it was easy, and I had fun, but something about your pet doing half the work isn’t as fun.

I mean it’s the opinion of every serious guild that clears naxx and aq40. You don’t see too many t3 night elf priests on private servers man. If dude wants to see those raids his best bet will to be roll dwarf, or literally any horde race.
---
Ea and the fact that the servers couldn’t handle the large scale battles &gt;.&lt; 
---
Or in other words, you'd tell them to play what is strong, instead of what is cool. 
---
But you're the OP... did you post this ironically?
---
going the other way, WoW (and the incompetence of Sony) basically led to the suicide of SWG. the developers decided that SWG, with it's innumerable professions and incredibly varied class system should be more like WoW, 12(?) classes and that's it.
---
...they lost about 90% of the subscribers in a month or so.
---
Quite interesting view but MMO’s had those aspects years ago it has just vanished... sadly...
---
I wish Shamans were viable dps along with all the rest of the 1 dimensional classes. Even in retail shamans are still trash dps lol.
---
Yeah this guy is delusional, not sure what he's trying to accomplish here.
---
Whenever a company is vague and says there's a summer release, it disproportionately ends up very late like in August. Even early September is "SuMmEr" technically.
---
It was pretty damn good too until the F2P/P2W bull.
---
Wildstar failed because it catered only to the hardcore raiders and nothing else. When others say WoW is failing due to appealing to the lowest common denominator, they are not referring to the fact that they are not appealing to raiders...but to the idea that the dev's are designing features that reward players who put in a minimalist effort. It still felt rewarding to be a casual player in Vanilla. 
---
Players want choice and variety on how they do content. Wildstar just felt like another on rails experience that led to hardcore raiding. It felt to much like modern WoW and less like vanilla. 
---
Yeah Dwarves are kings as priests gor fear ward, but going witb another race is really not a big deal. Dont expect anywhere near the shit youd get for being say a boomkin.

That's actually really cool. Joining a guild when you had 0DKP but people we're taking things for their offspecs was always annoying, but at least they got to experience the content.
---
I like how you post your opinions, people disagree with them, then instead of admitting your opinions are wrong you start crowing about how you're the only "honest" person here. 
---
Appreciate the answer! I’ve done the 1-60 grind as warrior three times (on private servers though) but only as arms &amp; fury. This would be the first time I’m even tempted to do main tank/going prot. Point taken though, basically I shouldn’t respecc to prot until I hit 60. Which would you say is the better/easier for tanking during my way to max, arms or fury? 
---
Pretty sure he just means play whatever class you find cool just know that youre playing a class and not a spec

Self centered as fuck is this a joke post? Just dont click on shit you dont wanna read Hitler.

&gt; guide that points out the quest chains that are more fun
---
Sadly those just don't exist, outside a few that you'll be doing anyway(Ony attunement and such).  Questing in vanilla was absolute garbage compared to what exists today.
---
I remember leveling some toons back in mop or wod and it always sucked to get to 58-60 because you had to go to Outland where the questing was so bad.  Well, when TBC was released the questing in Outland was awesome - soooo much better than vanilla.  But nowadays the improvement from vanilla is considered horrible.
---
Questing isn't fun - going out in the world and experiencing it with other people is what's fun.
---
Skeedadle skadoodle, I move elements like noodles
---
Usually it was the other way around and Hunter bows would go to a rogue or warrior a lot of the times.
---
i want stuff on my private server characters more than i want stuff in bfa.. even though i’ll ditch those characters when classic comes out.
---
Unfortunately Vanilla Shamans are doomed to look like ass 
---
There has been an unbelievable amount of these articles posted in the past week alone. I think I've seen over 15 of them no lie.  
---
I think it's more that people don't want to invest a lot of time in a server they know will likely be shut down at point. At least for me that's what it is. Classic can't come soon enough!
---
Mmm. I'll hopefully be an extra cute gnome mage for those slots. 
---
And honestly only the worse guilds will value dps &gt; prepared and consistent people.
---
Warrior
---
Paladin
---
Rogue
---
Priest
---
But I find it all cool
---
Rogue is one of the slowest leveling classes. Probably just a bit faster than warrior. Hunter is a great option for leveling fast, and can also hold their own in world pvp especially 1v1
---
There's a song correlation between effort and reward in Vanilla. Retail, as have been stated 19 million times by now, is and feels like a casino.
---
Yea I watch that guy from time to time. He used to play vanilla (and everquest) a lot, so he knows what he is talking about. He played retail and he doesn´t like it. So yea I hope he will return to vanilla even though he has 3 kids haha.
---
Just..what? Your post doesn't even make sense, lol
---
Warrior, Paladin, Mage, priest, warlock 
---
I think we gotta wait and see, ye. You're right that ranged skill gives %hit for ranged attacks, but how much is hard to say. I think one priv server had +5 skill = 3% hit for a while, and that they found evidence that it should be more like +5 = 1%, but I don't quite remember how it went. Seems like the github is down as well, so can't find the thread...

Lol. You gonna main Warlock? Kind of wanna go Orc Warlock to be duel king 
---
Yeah, let's design a game around world pvp, but it is so laggy and buggy that you don't want to do large scale battles.
---
I quit a few months after release when we FINALLY opened up a city siege after bug fixes. It was a single public quest playing against nocs. And the buggy po system meant the first people there were at the top every time. It was the most disappointing in nothing garbage ever.
---
&gt; All the adaptations and concessions they made in the game mean its more suited for young spergs now right? So why are they quitting?
---
Because *just* having group-finder, or balanced specs, or casual game modes, or catch-up mechanics, or the WoW Token, aren't enough to keep players playing. It's enough to retain players, but you still need engaging mechanics.
---
While the current raids have all gotten great reviews and reception, the way systems changed in BfA weren't exciting enough.
---
For all its fault, the Artifact Weapon and the Legendary system were far more interesting than the Netherlight Crucible-esque Azerite Necklace.

In an attempt to mitigate the RNG problems of Legiondaries and make a more predictable system akin to the Artifact Weapon paths, they ended up at a bad compromise that kept none of the good things of either system.
---
Furthermore, WoD failed midway through, not because it strayed too far from Vanilla, but because of a lack of content. Making retail more like Vanilla is not the panacea that people in this sub have deluded themselves into believing.
---
&gt; So your position here is players 5-10 years older that someone playing retail now have a radically different psychology and reward schema
---
Player expectations are incredibly different between 2019 and 2004. The MMO genre is a ghost of what it was at its peak, and this isn't just WoW. It's every MMO. Players just don't play MMOs anymore. Of the subset that do, an even smaller subset is going to enjoy Classic.
---
If none of that makes sense then I can't only imagine its because you haven't stepped outside of the biased bubble that is r/classicwow.
---
I would say Paladin is the best PvP healer for sure in Vanilla. You are just so tanky compared to other healers, there is only really two things in the game that ruin things a lot for you. Counterspell and Curse of Tongues, if you get Counterspelled in a cast, you can't do anything for 10 seconds. You are also unable to remove curse as a Paladin, all your heals are casted except 30CD weak aura in Holy Shock, and curse of Tongues is 60% increased casting time..You just gotta try to avoid getting in rage of Warlocks and try to fake cast against Mages.
---
Going to reply here to save time (we're also fighting further down but I wanted to directly challenge your main ideas up here). Alright!
---
&gt; I've played on private servers for years but I gotta say, you're in an  echo chamber right now. This thought-process only makes sense as long as  you don't step outside of this artificial bubble. 
---
Ok good, strong start. Claim pserver authenticity to get us on your side. 
---
&gt;Wildstar just shut down a few months ago and it was literally developed  by ex-WoW devs who felt WoW had become too casual and wanted to cater to  the most hardcore players. 
---
Game is developed in response to failings in WoW = game is immune to making all new mistakes. Turns out making MMORPGs (with no established IP) is hard. Must have been the 40 man raids though. 
---
&gt;And it's not just Wildstar. Any MMO that didn't cater to the lowest  common denominator is dead/F2P, or extremely niche and an empty shell of  what it used to be. EvE Online was [just sold to a Korean MMO-maker.](https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/06/black-desert-online-creator-pearl-abyss-acquires-eve-online-maker-ccp-games-for-425-million/) Classic is just another game mode designed to keep players like you subscribed to Blizzard. 
---
If you did any research you would know CCP has been slowly going bankrupt for years because they blew all the proceeds from their incredible, breakout hit (the ultra hardcore Eve Online) trying to make a shitty FPS and a vampire game.
---
&gt;Like you yourself said: Balance is at an all-time high. Class fantasy is  at an all-time high. Player-freedom is unmatched. The new raid has  gotten almost universal praise for its mechanics, challenge, and  variety. The amount of activities, whether it be pet battles, transmog  collecting, achievement-hunting, challenge-mode dungeons, etc. is  insane. 
---
And despite all that, nobody gives a fuck and people are leaving in droves. The specific kind of player that you believe retail "is a better game for" do not like BFA. 
---
&gt;I've played Vanilla p-servers for years, so I'm not some retail-fanboy.  But what I am is honest about the lay of the land and what these games  actually contain within them. The fact is, retail is a better game for  most people than Classic will be. Classic is for an older generation of  players who need a certain type of gameplay in order to feel rewarded. 
---
Already criticized most of this in another post. Short version - human psychology is what games appeal to and how and how deeply they appeal to it is the measure of a good game. There is no significant variation in reward psychology in two average adult  people 5-10 years apart. Or, there is no good reason to think there is. And you're just pulling it out of your ass anyway. 
---
&gt; A totally valid playstyle in vanilla PvP server is to just wander off into a zone and see who you run into and what happens.
---
First off, this is absolutely something you can do in modern WoW and it's a thing I did all throughout Legion and the start of BfA before I switched to pservers 100%.
---
&gt; Sure there are a lot of different activites to do in modern wow, but each of them is a totally on-rails, handheld experience where what you do is carefully constructed and designed.
---
The lack of historical context in this sub is insane. Everything you're saying is something that Vanilla brought to the table. Vanilla is an on-rails, handheld experience. That's why everyone in 2004 criticized it, calling it a theme park MMO and *casual*craft.
---
Only because the arguments people give for disagreeing with them are fucking stupid and irrational.
---
They actually did put a Wow tribute in RDR2. Just south of the N in Bayou Nwa on the map 
---
I forgot that show existed lol it has been awhile 
---
Plenty of games still are made by passionate people. When your game becomes successful and you go from 15 minimum wage devs on the verge of bankruptcy to a billion+ dollar yearly revenue company with thousands of employees things change. Shocking I know.
---
in classic 60 is 60 and not obsolete one day 
---
community will be great. not like now where nobody knows the other.
---
great fun to explore the World and his secrets.
---
pvp will come back from the death 
---
you can look at people before raiding and make the 5 man instances.
---
no more need to play with noobs.
---
classic players = real heroes 
---
no crying kids because difficult is part of the game.
---
City raids, open World Bosses all this have more value in classic.
---
This is a PepeHands and FeelsGoodMan at the same time.
---
This reading is totally at odds with the second part of "Sam's" statement.
---
IF the text just said "You should play what you find cool" then maybe you'd have a leg to stand on. Instead it explicitly disclaims playing something strong, and puts that as an ALTERNATIVE to playing something cool. The statement is: "You should play what you find cool, NOT what is said to be strong." You're basically replacing this NOT with the word AND. Which is a very different meaning. 
---
Everyone who played vanilla has to be disappointed by retail... the whole challenge is gone these days man ! Hope blizzard doesn’t fail us here.
---
Yeah such a shame. I still miss playing my Warrior Priest 
---
raid bosses are considered lvl 63 if i remember correct
---
Carful what you say... legend has it you say anything past WotLK in this sub people with start sharpening their pitchforks 
---
And then they went full retard with it. 
---
Front stabbing is a private server bug.

Rift was a amazing for a couple of years until FTP.
---
&gt;In its core, Fortnite is such a silly game that offers literally no real interesting gameplay
---
Au contraire Fortnite is this generations great competitive FPS game, a la Quake and Counter Strike. Its shooting mechanics are crisp and reward twitch reflex shots as Quake did, and precise pixel perfect shots like Counter Strike did. It also has an incredibly long time to kill which allows for all sorts of creative counterplay. As does it building and editing mechanic. 
---
Its building mechanic is absolutely crazy. Every single fight has the potential to turn into a cat and mouse chess style game, both players attempting to out build each other, get high ground, get a better angle, block the opponents shots, and edit a hole in someones structures. Its an incredibly deep and complex movement system that the playerbase has only recently begin to hone. 
---
&gt;I can tell you that both my cousins have 2 kids each, very young ones
---
I don't see why age of the player base would invalidate a games quality. Video games have always been enjoyed by kids. Minecraft was enjoyed by all ages as is toys like Lego, Runescape was famous for kids playing it in the elementary school library, and I'm suspect of own mothers morality due to all the 13 year olds that claim to have slept with her. Games are fun, kids are going to play them. That doesn't make them kids games. 
---
Fortnite is a damn great game. It does a lot of things really well. It manages to be both light hearted, zany, approachable, yet incredibly complex and rewarding. 
---
&gt; Game is developed in response to failings in WoW = game is immune to making all new mistakes. Turns out making MMORPGs (with no established IP) is hard. Must have been the 40 man raids though.
---
Yeah, you're not arguing against me here. You're arguing against games journalists and critics and writers who have written at length about Wildstar and its failings, especially within the greater context of MMOs in the past fifteen years.
---
I guess you're the lone genius who knows more than everyone else though, right? Sounds like it, by the tone in your responses :D
---
&gt; If you did any research you would know CCP has been slowly going bankrupt for years because they blew all the proceeds from their incredible, breakout hit (the ultra hardcore Eve Online) trying to make a shitty FPS and a vampire game.
---
CCP has been hemorrhaging subs for years even before those ventures. The fact that the MMO genre itself is waning is the reason why EvE was unable to retain players after fifteen years. Player retention was the biggest nail in CCP's coffin.
---
&gt; There is no significant variation in reward psychology between two average adult people 5-10 years apart.
---
First off, *welfare epics* were introduced in WotLK, so the 5-10 range you're hedging with is a bit off.
---
Secondly, I think an MMO style released in 2004 and an MMO adapted to 2019 are going to reflect a different generation of gamers.
---
I don't understand why you're making this about “Oh, I played Vanilla and I'm the same person today that I was back then.”
---
It's not true and it's a hot myopic take. No one can argue that a generation of gamers has gone by between Vanilla and retail.
---
Interesting! So you’d say going arms is preferable to 2h fury when lvling &amp; tanking dungeons at the same time? 
---
Just curious, when I get to around 55+ &amp; start tanking scholo/strat (where there is a somewhat difficulty jump in dungeons) should I respecc to prot or keep going arms/fury to 60? I mean with the pre-bis gearing in mind that people usually start 50+ I’m guessing I’ll spend a lot of time in dungeons during those last levels so maybe it wouldn’t hurt my leveling speed all too much if I switch to prot around that time &amp; with the ”difficulty jump” in mind &amp; how much time I’ll be spending in those dungeons it might even be more efficient? I’m not sure, maybe I’m thinking about it the wrong way...
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
Ah... the gankist. 
---
They based the gnomes off that guy.
---
“Doesn’t rely on front stabbing”
---
It’s almost as if I said this because I’m aware it’s not a legitimate mechanic that will work during classic!
---
I feel the "you think you do but you dont". Is a very true statement from the amount of calls for "qol" i feel they most likely wont give us a true vanilla. But a qol vanilla. Which imo kinda sucks. 
---
Hi, /u/Sometimesiworry
---
Druid: It has the flexibility to be anything my guild needs pre-raid, I can change my play-style completely on a whim if I’m bored, and the T3 set is one of my all time favorite sets.
---
Warlock: The first class I played back in Vanilla. I love the more technical approach to combat.  The class could do many things but whatever you specialized in, it would be unrivaled. I ran a variation of DS/Ruin that went into Emberstorm for Soulfire crits that put fire mages to shame.
---
Rogue: Control, burst, stealth, and that beautiful T2 set. I just wish subtlety was more viable.
---
Paladin: My main through most of retail. The tankiest character in PvP and the hardest to gank. Also the best healer in endgame raiding and PvP.
---
Shaman: I don’t know why, I just love this class. I like healing and playing elemental. It would be higher on my list but I haven’t played a ton of Shaman and I truly enjoy all the other classes listed.
---
Actually MS Paint. I am too cheap for Adobe stuff.
---
The RNG evens out since an active player gets so many loot rolls per week, so the correlation is definitley there and as strong as ever.
---
But it just feels off to get loot from a single chest per dungeon and weekly chest instead of bosses. And personal loot is boring as well.
---
People like you, sir, can make the decision by throwing dice.
---
You know what they say, if you ran into an idiot in the morning, you ran into an idiot. If you run into idiots all day long, you're the idiot. 
---
Actually the original saying used asshole but I adapted it for your situation. 
---
Too bad what I find cool is probably extremely not viable (axe+shield Enhance Shaman).
---
(Where my economists at)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost]
---
**Opportunity cost**
---
In microeconomic theory, the opportunity cost, also known as alternative cost, of making a particular choice is the value of the most valuable choice not taken. When an option is chosen from two mutually exclusive alternatives, the opportunity cost is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit associated with the alternative choice.  The New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as "the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen." Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice." The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in attempts to ensure that scarce resources are used efficiently. Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real cost of output forgone, lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides utility should also be considered an opportunity cost.

They are different games. People thought the same with Runescape when Oldschool came out. Oldschool players like oldschool runescape, not the current state of runescape. Id imagine classic wow players feel the same way
---
there was also a southpark episode, but it was pretty obscure so im not surprised it hasnt been mentioned yet
---
Has the community at large really grown this elitist over the many years of pservers? Kind of depressing if so.
---
Great argument!
---
I rest my case.
---
It is intended, or else Blizz would make lower levels non targetable. I said I didn't want Blizz to make it prohibited even though it's in the game. Why not make anyone 10 levels lower or higher than you unable to attack you since that's no real "PvP"?
---
I don't think personal loot was wrong for pugs overall.  I really see what they were going for but going multiple dungeon runs and not getting a single drop(whether it be an upgrade is another story) just feels bad.
---
t0 set and all enchants will be good.
---
and 2 1h axes from maleki stratholme 
---
Bone Slicing Hatchet 
---
+15 agi enchant each =total 56 agi 
---
this makes a lot of damage. and is ok to start mc.
---
Rogue PvP is either a long cc chain that slowly kills someone, or an ambush build based around a quick burst to an injured/cloth character. If either fails you’re dead, and under level 30 it’s harder to level than a warrior.
---
That said, with all cooldowns + engineering you will be able to win more fuels than any class except a SL warlock.
---
Hunter would suit you well:
---
 Levels fast, great in PvP, not gear reliant, easy to solo hard quests...
---
Dunno, but I have a set of wireless mouse/kB that I play from the couch all the time just relaxing.
---
INB4 Hunter needs on healing gear
---
'TIL YOU DIE
---
There's an addon for this purpose for retail, it's called [ConsolePort](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/console-port). You could prod the author and see if they have plans to port it to Classic.
---
Odd because the braces were boe so surely you got them from the auction house?
---
True but I know there’s a way to do it now. There’s a couple of you tubers that have video of them playing with a controller but they didn’t mention what program they used. I also remember a guildie I raided with on Nost and he said he was playing with a controller but I didn’t care to ask him how at the time.
---
&gt;Yeah, you're not arguing against me here.  You're arguing against games journalists and critics and writers who  have written at length about Wildstar and its failings, especially  within the greater context of MMOs in the past fifteen years.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I guess you're the lone genius who knows more than everyone else though, right? Sounds like it, by the tone in your responses :D
---
Some redditor down below already destroyed you on Wildstar, so I'm gonna pass on that. Never played it and don't care about it.
---
&gt; CCP has been hemorrhaging subs for years even before those ventures. The  fact that the MMO genre itself is waning is the reason why EvE was  unable to retain players after fifteen years. Player retention was the  biggest nail in CCP's coffin. 
---
This could be true. You didn't provide any evidence that it's true. I don't know if it's true. I do know about CCP's poor business practices and failure to develop other games. If you know so much about the issue you must have too, but didn't include it because it contradicts your thesis. That's not very honest of you bro.
---
&gt;First off, *welfare epics* were introduced in WotLK, so the 5-10 range you're hedging with is a bit off.  
---
&gt;Secondly,  I think an MMO released in 2004 and an MMO expansion adapted to 2019  are going to reflect a different generation of gamers.  
---
&gt;It's  myopic to say: “Oh, I played Vanilla and I'm the same person today that  I was back then.” It's not true and it's a hot myopic take. No one can  argue against the fact that a generation of gamers has gone by between  Vanilla and retail.
---
Not sure where to start with this word salad. TBH not even sure what you're trying to argue. You asserted before that there are fundamental differences in the reward psychology between relatively similar demographics of players. I pointed out that's stupid (because it is), and you didn't post any evidence, and you pulled it out of your ass (you did). 
---
All of this, and you still haven't address why - if BFA is a better game for this new species of gamer for which you are the prophet - why are they all quitting the game?
---
I actually want to play on my iPad with a controller I got. That’s what I’m trying to make work lol
---
Enhancement is kinda weak in PvE but absolutely dominates PvP. Same as Ele tbh
---
It's fine for pugs, sure, but enforcing it on guilds was a silly move. Just means that loot won't be distributed as efficiently. Non-corrupt guilds shouldn't be hindered because scumbaggery exists in others.
---
I think the variety and rarity of mounts in TBC was the perfect balance.  
---
There were a lot, but they were all very different from each other, but not too many that you couldn't get most of them (minus Ashes)  
---
However I also love the mount scenario in vanilla. Seeing an Alliance on an undead mount makes you stop and think for two seconds "How is he...? Wait... no way!"
---
Podcasts. As an adult who can afford all the Lego I could ever need, having something to do while I listen to podcasts is the best way to spend a free day.
---
Well DKP is fucking dogshit.
---
&gt; This could be true. You didn't provide any evidence that it's true. I don't know if it's true. I do know about CCP's poor business practices and failure to develop other games. If you know so much about the issue you must have too, but didn't include it because it contradicts your thesis. That's not very honest of you bro.
---
Damn! Dat backpedaling! How quickly we pivot! This is rich coming from the guy who so confidently stated that:
---
&gt; If you did any research you would know CCP has been slowly going bankrupt for years ... trying to make a shitty FPS and a vampire game - neither of which ever released.
---
&gt; if BFA is a better game for this new species of gamer for which you are the prophet - why are they all quitting the game?
---
Because just having group-finder, or balanced specs, or casual game modes, or catch-up mechanics, or the WoW Token, aren't enough to keep players playing. It's enough to retain players, but you still need engaging mechanics.
---
For all their faults, the Artifact Weapon and the Legendary system were far more interesting than the Netherlight Crucible-esque Azerite Necklace.
---
Furthermore, WoD failed midway through its existence, not because it strayed too far from Vanilla, but because of a lack of real content. Making retail more like Vanilla is not the panacea that people in this sub have deluded themselves into believing.
---
When everything is special and epic, nothing is special and epic. 
---
Also, when they inevitably release TBC/WOTLK all the priests will get normalized anyhow.  I know that's pretty far out, but just something to chew on.
---

Excluding Gnomes and Trolls. This guy fucks.
---
How I wish tabards covered the lower part of the dress as well. That way we could at least hide our shame a little bit.
---
&gt; Because *just*  having group-finder, or balanced specs, or casual game modes, or  catch-up mechanics, or the WoW Token, aren't enough to keep players  playing. It's enough to retain players, but you still need engaging  mechanics.  
---
&gt;While the current raids have all gotten great reviews and reception, the way systems changed in BfA weren't exciting enough
---
Gotcha, the changes didn't go far enough. Nice and vague, impossible to test or disprove, I like it!
---
&gt;For all its fault, the Artifact Weapon and  the Legendary system were far more interesting than the Netherlight  Crucible-esque Azerite Necklace.  
---
&gt;In an  attempt to mitigate the RNG problems of Legiondaries and make a more  predictable system akin to the Artifact Weapon paths, they ended up at a  bad compromise that kept none of the good things of either system.
---
So if they could have tinkered the endless AP grind and acquisition for the welfare legendaries juuuustt right the game wouldn't be failing right now? In all seriousness Legion was just devs cashing in lore and OP bullshit they would never have given players in 2006 to save the game after WoD. Hurr durr here's Ashbringer and a couple free legendaries. Why don't you launch into space and kill every major villain in the series while you're at it. The biggest problem in BFA right now is the game has jumped the fucking shark. They smell desperate and nobody likes that. 
---
&gt; Making retail more like  Vanilla is not the panacea that people in this sub have deluded  themselves into believing. 
---
Gonna label that an opinion for you. People who play MMORPGs tend to like MMORPGs. 
---
&gt; Player expectations are incredibly different between 2019 and 2004. The  MMO genre is a ghost of what it was at its peak, and this isn't just  WoW. It's every MMO. Players just don't play MMOs anymore. Of the subset  that do, an even smaller subset is going to enjoy Classic. 
---
Genre's going to stagnate when the last good MMORPG came out in 2007. Turns out when you start abandoning the tenets of an MMORPG and turn it into a shitty action-rpg with bigger groups, MMO people don't want to play it. BFA is not an MMORPG. I can see how you're getting confused. 
---
I agree with that completely.
---
You want to have the game running on an iPad? Doesn't sound likely.
---
Not with that additude...
---
