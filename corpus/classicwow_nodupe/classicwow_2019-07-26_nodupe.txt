Of course people are going to go for the insanely popular ToEP build.

Blizz won’t split the servers. Would be real bad for populations etc.
---
Can't get Frostfire, that is gone
---
Balance druids and prot palas also belong on your list. They bring absolutely nothing that's worth their spot in the raid.
---

---
Feral dps/tank is somewhat decent at naxx levels of dedication, and some people actually do use an enhance as their nightfall slave.
---
Cold. Blooded.   Nice you realize your mistake years later.
---
Rogues have knives to throw that are excellent at tagging mobs.

The op was asking for a mouse to play wow. We don't care about you playing fps.

Losing all my vanilla wow screen shots due to HDD formats.

You can't take arms and shadow priest really as they're so debuff slot hungry.
---
Is he selling out and going horde? That rat bastard probably stole this from an alliance gnome.  He is obviously a war criminal.
---
I was going to and then realized I couldn't do it.
---
All 3 of them?
---
I'm well on the side of Devouring Plague being relatively overrated compared to Shdaowguard/Hex. Let's face it, Touch of Weakness is a non-factor as it's so freaking useless, it's like a single chance at a blackout proc vs an opener and that's it.
---
Devouring Plague mana cost, plus the 3 minute CD, makes it inferior to the strength of both Troll Priest Racials. Troll Priest Master Race.
---
Whatever Blizzard does about buying gold from 3rd party sites will be the same for trading gold between game versions. The evidence they use to flag your account is the exact same.
---
Well there's your problem. All you need to do is go out for smokes with your computer and you're all set. You can get a less paying job/part time job since you'll only need to pay for ramen, shelter, electricity and an internet connection.
---
I'm not an expert on retail wow, cause I quit in WoD... but I'm pretty certain you simply go to the Black Market AH to get your T3.
---
Except this is not a thorough rebuttal at all, it's long winded and based on flawed information. It's mostly just flat out wrong.
---
The guy is literally saying that warrior can out threat a Bear with MCP which is just hilariously wrong. If we're factoring in Thunderfury that's a different story but it's such an edge case it's not worth talking about. So you can see within the first 10 lines of his "thorough rebuttal" there is just nonsense information. 
---
OP simplified it a lot, but in general he was right about Bears being threat tanks. Warriors can certainly switch to threat gear, including dropping their shield for an OH, but this guy fails to acknowledge how much mitigation they sacrifice for that (no block, no shield block, etc.). When warriors go full threat gear Bears will pull ahead in mitigation. 
---
So while warriors have the flexibility of going high mit. or high threat, druids are a nice in-between where they have innate really good threat and decent mit.
---
This poster is so uninformed, just because his post is long doesn't mean any of it is valuable.

---
The kind of people who actually put in enough dedication to match undedicated players with their meme specs aren't going to be in casual guilds - they are going to take up the sparse meme spots in the exact guilds that go for server firsts.
---
Having DPS doing less damage than the tank will negatively impact you even harder if you're in the kind of guild that struggles to clear MC.
---
Horse shit.
---
If you cant handle playing with a greasy mouse and keyboard then you aren't a true pro gamer.
---
Going by memory here but BoK is overwritten by Warchief's Blessing. I'm unsure if tranq interferes with salv. The rest should work fine.
---
You pretty much read my mind on hunter. To add to that it's also a solid potential twinkling class.
---
We've told you, 2pm isn't "late night"
---
I played a pally through to BC. Rest spec, I healed and helped tank in 5 mans. Never raided. I liked being fairly self sufficient whilst grinding on my own. I don’t have the experience to understand the irony here. Can someone do a ExplainLikeIm5. I think I’m going to run the same class again as my friends are rolling tank, priest, hunter.
---
QOL change really but change the cursor to a pointer on hover in your css.
---
We're talking about farming straight up gold to buy things.
---
Part of me wanted to cuz of how great I think elwynn forest is. But alas I bleed red.
---
I am the pack.
---
Don't forget druids hibernating other druids! Not that it's really relevant here though...
---
I’m going ally this time around. It will be a pretty fresh experience since I never played ally pre Cata and haven’t seen a handful of their early zones in Azeroth.
---
I literally cannot decide off the top of my head. That only narrows it to like 4 classes lol
---
I prefer my recipe for a low carb peanut butter sandwich.
---
Prep time: 4 seconds
---
Ingredients: peanut butter
---
Step 1: scoop a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter into a spoon.
---
Step 2: eat it.
---
Same. I might be able to pull off 5-6 hours for a few nights but then I require a 12 hour binge sleep afterward.
---
Next episode "wasdwawdwasdFFSICANTMOVE"
---
Get the family and kids into WoW.
---
I relate to this. It was druid for me but I still can't decide
---
Played Horde in Vanilla, switched to an Alliance DK in mid WotLK. Going to go Alliance for Classic as I never got to have that lvling experience before revamps.
---
I've been thinking about it...I pretty much only played horde back in original vanilla; I never leveled past 30 on alliance.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Part of me wants to play alliance this time to experience something new, but the other part of me wants to stick with horde because I think I would have a hard time dealing with the soft/weak alliance aesthetic, and the thought of grouping with human or night elf players makes me cringe.
---
It wasn't really that popular, it mainly for pvp videos. Playing a spec that is only strong 10 seconds every 3 minutes isn't that much fun in practice.
---
[The skill..](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/397/625/be7.jpg)
---
Priest or Shaman?  I want to raid primarily, but still want to be able to have good fun in PVP.
---
Using a different word isn't gonna make a difference.
---
You can clear raids as 30 people so technically it's also "viable" to have 5 people be afk. So the word viable in your context does not mean anything. I don't care what you think the word means. Words mean what what we choose them to mean, and in this case viable means competitive to other alternatives.
---
I am stout, round and I have found, speaking poundage wise, I improve my appetite when I do Dead Mines.
---
Isn’t early Mc fury 2h better dps with windfury than dw until getting raid drops?
---
that must be useful when you're homeless playing wow all day
---
its a video on youtube, it must be the truth.
---
Wailling caverns: WC
---
Blackrock depths = BRD
---
Upper blackrock spire = UBRS
---
Lower blackrock spire = LBRS
---
Sunken temple = ST
---
Molten core = MC
---
Ahn'qiraj = AQ
---
Blackwing's lair = BWL
---
Diremaul East = DME
---
Diremaul West = DMW
---
Diremaul North = DMN
---
But Deadmines = VC?
---
Objectively wrong.
---
also warlock dps is throttled by Threat,  giving them an extra 15% damage on their shadowbolts just means they spend more time playing hop scotch with the imp.  It doesn't actually increase raid DPS
---
Dude is reminding me of part of the reason why I moved off from WoW. Yeesh.
---
Neat wallet dude.
---
Should be permanently bannable plenty of other games have that rule in place and it's for good reason.
---
I won't even bother trying to quest/farm mobs until level 5+ from exploration xp. Got my route planned out and everything.
---
Presumably. We should assume the 1.12 version unless otherwise indicated.
---
Was horde back in the day and would prefer it but going to slowly, slowly level an alt with my nine-year old 3-4 hours a week. Alliance side has so much more visual polish she'll enjoy it far more and keeping my main on same faction will let me funnel some funds to make dad/daughter game time more enjoyable.
---
No because pvp videos are not an accurate representation of how pvp works. Pvp videos = Highlights, big numbers, RNG, using cooldowns. Actual pvp = Well being actually useful.
---
I plan to play both (different pvp servers) so yes. I played alliance the first time around and then horde on pservers. I just enjoy so many zones I must do both factions!
---
Feral is far better DPS is played properly than Ret.  You were not playing the spec properly.
---
But they cant use MS in raids because the debuff limit, so.. Auto attack and HS dps?
---
 /gremove
---
The fact that you assume the Paladin should be healing is both accurate and proof for the post.
---
Blue Monster and Pepperoni Hot Pockets were what the lan center I played at sold.
---
I tried to tank ZF with a two hander in berserker stance. My group was forgiving enough to teach me the basics of tanking, and how the pulls worked.
---
Quite the gongshow it was up to then, but looking back I guess it would have been way more trouble to find a replacement tank rather than teach a bad one how to play.
---
Problem with this idea is that the account trading away the classic gold is going to look like a gold seller, and you are selling gold just for retail gold instead of $$. Up to blizzard to decide how they feel about it. If it leads to a stream of token purchases with $$ to then sell for classic gold they may not come down too hard since it would be a de facto way of them selling tokens to classic without being the bad guys adding a cash shop and tokens to classic
---
Lol really? Did the dev's design the class to use MCPs and a level 40 helmet? Nobody 15 years ago did that.
---
Nice. Goodluck
---
That's why the good lord also made sweatpants and basketball shorts.  Wearable napkins.
---
Also refer to anyone who doesn’t agree with you as “kid”. Oh and throw a jab at retail wow too for extra upvotes.
---
Most want the game as it was. This is how it was.
---
My friend and I spent a good day convincing everyone we knew to come jump with us after we figured out the timing for the parachute. Laughing our asses off at their corpses as we slowly floated down.
---
Do you have a horde version?
---
If I'm lvling a warrior no pallys allowed.
---
Ah there is its! Was wondering if I missed daily "what race for shadowpriest" thread
---
Is that a real thing?
---
Alliance dog, we spit on your kind here. LOK’TAR OGAR
---
I laugh at the thought that meme specs will only be accepted into casual guilds. 
---
So you're a casual guild, you're probably not the most capable bunch already. So you invite a bunch of meme specs...
---
I'm not sure how many people can stomach having the potential of losing loot to a person that does less DPS than the tank for very long.
---
a lot easier than doing a lowbie run from / to Teldrassil
---
Maybe they view it as a niche game that doesn’t need mass advertisement, idk just a thought
---
&gt; Pvp videos = Highlights, big numbers, RNG, using cooldowns
---
... Yes. And that's what's **popular**.
---
It feels like people are reading the word popular and are hearing THE BEST PVP SPEC. At no point in this post did anyone ever say pompyro was the best PvP build.
---
Jesus christ.
---
It's a bit of cloth and some elements.. nothing like truefaith with the mooncloth cooldown
---
Great read thank you for posting.
---
I actually did a pug on my alt hunter once, we had 3 hunters and one of them had it already. Lost the 50-50 roll to the other hunter god fucking damnit.
---
It's a possibility. Mr "You Think You Do" is president now. This entire thing is against his ethos but he has had his arm twisted until he relented to, if nothing else, stop private servers.
---
What's the best overall/most desirable healer over the course of the entirety of Vanilla (not private servers or anything like that, just the one that's being released officially by Blizz). Not only best as in how good they are as healers, but how easy they find it to get into dungeons/raids as healers at 60, again over the course of Vanilla, thanks.
---
I'm not talking about good, I am completely talking about popular. But what is popular for people watching on youtube is not what is popular to actually play.
---
I don't understand how you can fail to see the difference.
---
I think we should split WC into 2 versions.
---
WC for all the leather wearers who are just in it for memememe armor of the fang, all mine mine mine,  and don't want to do the last boss, in spite of it by miles having the best drop table in the instance AND a quest associated with it,
---
And MTD: so that if you join a MTD group, you aren't surprised that yet, I am tanking your useless ass through like 11 bosses spread over 3 miles because I am actually trying to get loot out of the instance.
---
Can you link a guide? Ive only found 1-3 guides..
---
they think, you'll subscribe for classic and switch to retail
---
hahahaha
---
even a priest without any talents put in can shackle the undead, it is not a shadow talent.
---
I don't think I've ever done WC and people decided to not to last boss. Maybe once because we literally couldn't kill the boss but else no.
---
So idk what you are referring to
---
Ya dude, you're totally right. No one's gonna try out pompyro once they get ToEP or ZHC.
---
You got me.
---
Devouring Plague is even worse when you take into consideration Paladins exist and are the single best cleansers in the entire game. Hugely popular class with loads of people playing retri in PvP just spam cleansing everybody. If you cast Devouring Plague in a Battleground environment you're just gonna watch your 3 minute cooldown disappear 9/10 times.
---
Plus dwarves have a racial that straight up devours the devouring. You're gonna see a lot more of them this time around too, because PvPers are recognising that Stoneform is absolutely the best thing ever.
---
Long story short: Trolls best. Troll high five.
---
I dealt with this shit well up into cataclysm
---
i couldn't even touch Dalaran in Wrath because it would run at like 1 frame per 5 seconds
---
If you arent planning on raiding past bwl the dps fall off wont even matter for you
---
I got fire emblem that comes out tomorrow.to help pass the time. Thank God.
---
Hunter 2.5 is a weird-ass set.
---
Most people created a character with 0 clue about the game and played it to 60. 
---
So basically no one knew how good dwarves were. There will sadly be less diversity this time around at least on some classes.
---
For those sweet, sweet arcane shots

If you want to "pull ahead of the pack", you better worry about 1-20, cause I'll bet it won't be until 20-30 that the spread really starts.

Apart from oomkins and maybe ret applies, all other meme specs easily reach min. dps requirements for raids

Please use your reddit name for your toon name when Classic arrives.

I'd post the art that makes me want to play a Tauren, but I'm pretty sure this is a SFW sub :\^\]

Sure...but that's not what you were talking about above. You made a bad comment, you'll survive without twisting into knots here.

You can't aoe kill until much later on and even then it isn't fast.

The only thing visually appalling will be my axe in your skull

Remember, some of the guilds that aren't all private server veterans will need the world buffs for progression.

Remember, there will be guilds that actually have trouble progressing through raids.

Remember, you are not the eye of kilrogg and cant tell me what to do.

I mean that'll suck, sure, but you and the rest of your faction are not getting any prettier while you do that
---
I would love to see you do Nax or even AQ 40 with 10 people afk

You'll do fine. With all except #4, that's easier said than done.

What deems prettier when all of your kind is dead ?

I've pretty much only played Alliance. I've never had a Horde toon leave Barrens. My guild decided to roll Horde so this will basically be an entirely new game of quests and NPCs and areas I have never explored.
---
Apparently crit doesn't have the same diminishing returns at 60, either, but yeah, 1-59 druid scaling is apparently way off.
---
Imagining how a dual bow wielding hunter would work makes my brain hurt. Do they shoot with their feet? Wouldn't be very mobile.
---
Hey,
---
I'm really interested in playing a shadow priest because it is probably my favourite spec/class but I have heard that they aren't that great in classic and only became viable in TBC. I plan on playing mainly dps so I am worried I won't be able to get into groups for dungeons/raids. I don't have alot of time so I will be playing pretty casually, but I don't want to level a shadow priest to 60 only to never get invited to groups whenever I log in. My other options are probably rogue or warlock.
---
Thoughts? Cheers
---
they're garbage if they can't do it without world buffs and need to get better
---
IMO the path is hit 60, farm BRD, then other stuff, for basically every class theres 6-10 upgrades in BRD, after that your probly fine
---
It's a stamp. Definitely not skill intensive, but cool personalization nonetheless.
---
Really wrong on so many levels. If you’re still reading this I’d advise watching YouTube videos so u don’t follow bad info

---
Never tried raiding on 56k, but I did play on 56k during cata a bit.  I couldn't go into a populated town. There was just too much data, and it would disconnect you. Vent was out of the question. 
---
YET, In vanilla our raid had everyone on vent.   IF YOU could do a 40 man with vent, then you were on cable or dsl or t1 at college.   You had internet more than capable of handling wow with low latency.
---
Anyone trying to play wow with shit internet,  dialup or satellite, wouldn't even be able to raid.
---
It should be bannable 100%. Trading gold for any service/currency outside of the game should be bannable. BFA is a different game.

From patch 1.11.0:
---
&gt;An updated set of armor rewards have been added to vendors for Honor ranks 7, 8, and 10.
---
When these items were added, they were a new, separate set. If you had the old one in your bag it was unchanged. You had to gain rank again to get the new one. They were new items. Blizzard's statement was that items that had their stats changed would have the final stats even in phase 1, but that's not what happened in this case.
---
The Warlord level items also represent a unique case as they were **not** new items, and they didn't just have their stats changed, they had their item level increased. Adding them before Naxx would make them much more powerful compared to raid gear which greatly changes the calculus on whether to play PvP or PvE if you want the best gear.
---
It doesn't apply to ranged attacks since they can't be parried, dodged, or glanced.
---
Funny how Thunderfury is an "edge case" but you assume it will be the norm for all druids to max pot and MCP.
---
Cherrypicking and skewing your assumptions of player behaviour to fit your narrative.

Dear Deadhunter the dwarf hunter on Emerald Dream EU in 2005/2006. 
---
I'll never forget how much I hated you and how we always targeted each other first no matter what.
---
I don't really see why. It is exactly in line with what Blizzard calls an "unsupported transaction" (meaning allowed but they won't be able to do anything to help you if you get scammed) and is common in the closest real analogy to classic vs retail in online gaming (OSRS vs Runescape).
---
Trading in-game behavior for in-game currency is generally allowed across Blizzard games. Hell, wagering (on things like duels or rolls) is allowed. That raises far more red flags than this.
---
That's why I prefer the option of just not letting them stack.  You can go in with 1 buff.
---
Missing out on its transmogrification was definitely a big loss. Mine was more about emotional attachment to the weapon though. In vanilla I replaced it with the 2h hammer that dropped off Theradras, vendored the WW immediately after.
---
Weeks later I was definitely sad about it. 
---
The whirlwind axe I first beheld in the hands of a Tauren warrior in Orgrimmar and because it looked so badass I immediately asked where he obtained it. When he said that it was from the long and gruelling warrior quest chain that I was only two levels away from being eligible for, it felt like destiny.
---
So I did it. I killed trolls for hours for the Bloodscalp Tusks. I spent most of my meager savings on the Liferoot. 
---
I reached Hammerfall and spent an hour dying to the red elementals before asking for help. The community was really good back then, so I somehow ended up with a full group with a 50s hunter in there. They all stayed around and paused to help me kill Cyclonian and celebrated when I linked the Axe in /party.
---
I killed many, many mobs and probably something like 50 HKs worth of Alliance with it. Level 30-48 with a weapon that swung just as mean as it did the day I got it.
---
Also during a run in ZF, a priest was levelling enchanting and I ended up with the nice cool glow of +5 weapon damage for free.
---
And I vendored it for barely over a gold. I'm still choked up about it even now. A weapon with that amount of service should have a place of honor bank slot.
---
 I'm glad I kept my Stormherald for this reason. But that axe with the +5 glow was lost.
---
Mostly the struggle for me will be reaching level 6. Then I get Moonfire and insta-tag to win questing becomes my life.
---
These are some spicy opinions you got here boy
---
Luckily my guild had a very good drop rate on it and in the 3 or 4 months we were doing end of bwl all our hunters got it
---
The introduction of Holy Nova nerfed Vael considerably
---
That's how it's intended to work. There were ways to circumvent this but not sure if anyone tried it.
---
I was on Farstriders for the longest time which merged with Silver Hand in WoD. Could have sworn I've heard about The Leftovers from one of my friends I made on SH at the time, cool to see history like this.

[Here's something](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/50023213002-2-0502520103511051) that makes a ton more sense for a pvp/pve spec.
---
They did this to answer the rampant gold selling that existed.  God it was so bad in Cata.  Hacking lvl 1 players flying at mach speed underground farming all the nodes and among other cheating or exploiting methods to generate gold on each server and then buying it off a sketchy 3rd party site which could get you banned but you know that site would keep rolling along with no punishment.
---
They couldn't stop it so they just did it themselves which IMO is a good thing because it stopped all the hacking exploiting bullshit from the gold sellers (afaik).
---
T1 is really solid. Even in PvE you keep it until you have full T2, and sometimes if a hunter has full T2 ( imp Hunter Mark 8/8 set ) the other hunters will want to stay in their T1 for the Multi Shot damage.
---
Multishot is your most reliable nuke in PvP so it's nothing to scoff at. The pet resists also help in not getting CCed. 
---
So basically, you only replace it with superior PvP gear ( very hard to get ) or T2 and T3.
---
So you're still reading the word popular and actually hearing THE BEST SPEC.
---
Good chat.
---
Unfortunately if you don't spec into reducing it you've got a 30% chance for your attacks to get stuck on the hook thing.
---
&gt; Remember, some of the guilds that aren't all private server veterans will need the world buffs for progression.
---
You have to be extremely bad at the game to not be able to get through the raids without consumables and world buffs. We didn't use them 14 years ago and we had some real shitters in the guild. The only thing that was any sort of challenge was the four horsemen and that was only because we had like 5 warriors in the guild and no other guilds to recruit from.
---
&gt; What on Titans Azeroth were they thinking?
---
They weren't. Vanilla items were really bad.

Support priests are always in dire need for horde premades. Druids/shamans are poor substitutes for the pure support role.
---
"... if you've ever studied language as I have." and you write in asterisks "Puts on my best MC fire resist gear". The neckbeard is oozing out of you.
---
They can definitely pick and choose different rules for different games.
---
In classic gold selling was a bannable offense.  No Changes would dictate it's a bannable offense again.
---
If they support this or don't deal with it they'll see people vacate their game because they want to sketchy money hungry leech that everloving dollar out of classic plebs who can't make gold.
---
My god it all makes sense
---
how would u go bout this starting as nelf?
---
&gt; Hoping to find a class that can gear up through BWL. Then just focus on pvp.
---
Hunter is the best. Chromaggus Xbow, Ashkandi ( bad for PvE, should go to Hunters/Warrs as a PvP weapon ) and T2 is lit.
---
I got into a forum war with a hunter from a really lame guild on our server. He would post on the forums talking about how great his guild was and how he was the best hunter on the server. He was awful and always tried to get into our premades. He'd also never cuss, and would just type &amp;$S@ whenever he wanted to cuss.

He got me multiple 3 day bans from the forums, and one from the actual server. I still hate that guy
---
Ummm no wow tokens they will ruin the economy, I would rather golf farmers come in then let people just buy the tokens, because at least blizz can ban you for buying gold. The entire point of classic is the value of of gold and adding buyable currency that you can obtain easily through the client would be dumb af
---
Fooding is for casuals. Hard core raiders are basically skeletons slumped over a mouse and keyboard.
---
Mage that wears plate. Battle mage.
---
Magic bows that load themselves
---
I got a big laugh out of this one
---
There is nothing logical about adding wow tokens dude
---
Will update tomorrow with results 🙏
---
&gt; Wow tokens. Buying gold Will happen regardless. 
---
I bought thousands of gold during vanilla and will do so again during Classic since they just ban the sellers and not the buyers. However it pains me to support the chinese gold farmers since they work under pretty horrible conditions. I'd much rather buy gold from a fellow player on my server, maybe some kid who has no money but all the time in the world and get to play the game for free through selling his gold.
---
I had heard from some that they became available to alliance during the tbc pre patch.
---
Can you explain why it's so important? I just can't imagine that it saves much of anything (over right-click+A/D) if you already have right-click held 100% for turning
---
Alliance Capital cities (specifically IF &amp; SW) are infinitely better than Horde.
---
And your 3.5 hours in and everyone else is the same level as you or higher
---
Ever since the spell that summoned treants, I've always wanted a Druid class that focuses on in-battle summoning (or "growing") plant minions.  
---
Basically, Resto Druid but DPS / Off-heals that summons treants and lashers (like the ones from Dire Maul) for different purposes.   
---
Maybe a spell that summons treants with a limited mana pool that cast rejuv on injured people for you?   
---
Maybe melee lashers that apply bleeds, or even take aggro for help with dungeon tanking? (As in feral tanks only would use this spell)  
---
Arcane lashers that shoot their own starfires?
---
A Balance Druid that focused more on nature-based spells than cosmic ones would be much more than acceptable too  
---
I just want nature druid again
---
Good time to upskill for work/career or get any real life arrangements that you have been delaying out of the way.
---
Pretty much this. Try to be friendly to the tanks and healers, build up a friends list or social circle that you can rely on for dungeons and then be selective about the random DPS you invite.
---
My guild plan to clear all the content without world buffs or much use of consumables so no we won't allow meme specs. An optimized group setup will blast through the content without consumables and world buffs.
---
Sorry i should have specified this would be on the Horde, would it still be a Priest?
---
Lot's of shared accounts you're competing with.
---
Shut up, *Meg*.
---
Wf is a ducking curse.
---
shouldnt you be storming Area 51 rn
---
What else was there to say  ? Your main argument is “using another word doesn’t make a difference” read that back, you sound like an idiot. From everything you’ve said it’s clear your just another classic enthusiast who’s never actually played the game (at least not much endgame) and gets all they’re information from other people like yourself with 0 experience of vanilla. To say feral druids (the absolute best flag carriers in the game btw) are useless in PvP shows how much you actually know about the game. If you don’t know shit about a subject don’t speak on it.
---
Nostalgia is a powerful thing. Its gonna be good to relive that time of my life and hopefully make new friends :)
---
Holy.
---
You kinda don't.
---
That's part of the problem with playing meme specs, why would anyone carry you in order for you to take their loot?
---
A BM Hunter that legit used its Pet as a viable tank.

---
Agreed, I like madseason but his logic is based on pve raids really and poor judgment.
---
Trolls are better. Even fucking more so now that berserking is 10%-43% haste.
---
No changes
---
Yeah a long time ago, but I wasn't sure what it was like now.
---
This is where you make yourself look kinda stupid.
---
He literally shows he has (some) Naxx gear in the video you linked. And it's a really bad idea to use a tryhard like Skarm in tryhard guild to create your disingenuous blanket statements that druids are better.
---
Most players aren't Skarm. Most players aren't gonna be in tryhard speedrun guilds, or dedicate as much time as him. Sure, druid is viable. But warrior is the better choice for +90% of tanks out there.
---
It allows rich kids to just buy their way through the game. Especially in classic where you can buy good gear on the AH it will allow people to put in no work for any gear. Atleast with gold seller they can be banned for their actions. If poor kids really want to buy their sub then they can go buy them on retail which they’ll have because it comes with their sub so there is no upside to adding them
---
So, it doesn't ruin the economy.  You just don't like it.  Also, gold selling happens regardless.   This is the best way to stop gold sellers and it also helps the pop.
---
No it's garbage
---
Good for them I guess?
---
If this was the reason it would not have been delayed to an undetermined date. The announcement would've been a simple "Unfortunately we've had to delay our second stress test by two weeks to date so and so".
---
No it does it allows people to buy gold directly rather then earning it flooding the market with unearned gold which will cause inflation in gold making it less valuable and causing the difficulties that go along with earning gold to go away. Alongside being able to buy all you’re pre raid BiS with real world money. So no you’re wrong it will ruin the economy
---
You can do that either way by buying from the Chinese , and you can only get a few good items on the ah.  C'mon now.
---
I have your solution... Play Horde
---
They have a global release countdown on the main WoW page... it certainly won't be delayed, not after that's been up.
---
There was a huge warden update sometime in MoP. It flagged people using model morphers and things like minimap hacks to track things that weren't supposed to be trackable. (Specific items, like the cloud drake eggs or netherdrake eggs would show as nodes on the minimap) But yeah the whole point of them introducing the token (in WoD I think) was "if people are going to buy gold they might as well buy from us."
---
But if Blizzard really wants to go #nochanges then we should have people no clipping through the BG gates, capping bases in Arathi before the game starts, flying the flags back in WSG, etc.
---
It's so they can have the stress test around August 1st instead and force people to give them an extra month of sub only for 1 day of playtime + a name reservation. Goes well with the other scumbag techniques they've employed such as making the demo + the virtual ticket into one bundle. Or all the people that were tempted to re-subscribe in hopes of getting Beta access like the influencers did on the first day. 
---
Oh, and making us pay full price for a 15-year-old re-released game they can't get the bugs out of, calling it a service to get us to support garbage BFA while playing Classic. Only with far less GM support and an automated system instead that lets you right-click report and trade BoP items. Layered, too. ***Possible reason.***
---
thats what me too, i played looking at the floor till ICC patch
---
Once again you can ban people for doing that which discourages many player from ever using it. C’mon now think out your argument before you try to ruin the game.
---
Not exactly because gold sellers actually have to make money in the economy to then sell it. Buying from Blizz is like a country just printing more money...inflation. Yes, golf selling will happen, but that’s not an artificial injection of gold into the economy like tokens would be.
---
They need to make it look like it's not blatantly planned for somehow, right?
---
Oof
---
Hiya, I don't think you need to be so hostile but the guides I've looked at for PRERAID only have 3% hit max. Presuming we aren't playing a human or an pro then that means we are still missing 6-7% of the time. This is why I created this posy. Please link the gear you would suggest for pre raid which gives 9% hit. Thanks.
---
Um..... other way around... most of the  games formulas and coefficients are know they were ripped from the game files during beta. Classic wow head has a lot of them listed and granted some are missing still but a lot are there.
---
The guy farms the gold, earns it, then he sells it to someone else for playtime.   The gold is earned.
---
Granted I’m not going to just go crazy. But I’m not going to lie to you, I’m gonna consume a lot of Mountain Dew when I play for the first few days.
---
Daggers attack faster than swords/maces, so wouldn't Hemo be effective with daggers as well? It may be immaterial vs casters but it helps give a win condition vs plate/mail like you said
---
What about the guy who goes on the client and pay 15 bucks then sells it on the AH 🤪 you’re forgetting the other side of wow tokens bro
---
You’re quite confident in this horribly flawed suggestion.
---
As stated earlier, buying tokens from Blizz is exactly the thing that will make inflation uncontrollable. Gold sellers at least have to make gold in the game economy first...huge difference. 
---
Why post if you simply dismiss any challenge to your ideas?
---
Just set up your UI and add-one on a p-server and copy it over to your classic install
---
No one will get banned for buying gold
---
"Ret/Prot Paladin" - Never.
---
Enhancement Shaman - 1 is not meme at all. 2 can be okay. But they have to build a raid spec for totem twisting, as 60-90% of the raid dps they provide is via their totems. Resto is still better but 6-7 resto shamans is a lot and really limits the number of priest and rduids you can have.
---
Balance Druid - No. But NG+moonglow/resto is more than acceptable. I hear balance druid by late naxx could actually pull ahead of the other hybrid casters... still.
---
Alternatively in a separate category,
---
Arms Warriors - No.
---
Feral Druids  - Yes, 1 is more than acceptable 
---
Shadow Priests - 1 is acceptable.
---
Hell yeah. Lazily playing some d3 season to kill some of the downtime that will be classic sessions in my Daily schedule soon soon
---
People got banned all the time when it was a thing are you daft ?
---
This reminds me of a GM I had, who was also RL and MT.  If a tank died, she blamed the healers.  Didn't matter if they got globaled, she blamed the healers.  Didn't matter if they were globalled within the haste cap and healed during the global kill, it was the healer's fault.
---
You play disc weaving usually.
---
I plan on playing a warrior and leading groups all of my groups are going to be me as the only plate class.
---
For you I feel like boomkin should be your END goal but hey all the more power to you if you want to level as balance. However you "might" have a much easier and faster level by being resto or feral.
---
Lag. 
---
Disconnect. 
---
Rage. 
---
Quit.
---
Those thing are expensive these days
---
Show us where the mean ol blizzman touched you.
---
Just play the spec to the best it can be played. Small bit of info noone will ever tell you is that the nature's grace talent is actively trying to fuck you over. With wrath talented you will global yourself by criting. And starfire with its travel time requires 2 consecutive crits to actually get the cast reduction. So if your spamming starfire you need to have a macro that stops a cast and restarts a new one when nature's grace procs. With normal ms this is ~.3s time save on your cast. Which is equal to 20dps. A small dps gain but when your playing an unconventional spec every little bit helps.
---
My launch plan is to play with any of my friends that are on at the time and if they happen to get off I’ll keep grinding.  Leveling, farming money, profs and I will be making potions for my friends and myself to help speed up not only my leveling but the speed my friends level. I generally have more time to play so Providing as much as pots to help increase leveling times really do help.
---
I listen to audiobooks while playing.
---
Some kind uf buffs/debuffs bender.
---
It would be a support class that the main focus is to move buffs/debuffs between your raid, making it weaker/stronger, giving it to players that are more powerful (as an example, feeding multiple combustions to a warlock)
---
It probably wouldn't work on WoW, but I can dream about a 4th role that isn't about healing/tanking/dps
---
Hunter: Dwarf PVP, Dwarf PVE, Orc PVP, Troll PVE
---
Mage: Gnome PVP, Gnome PVE, Undead PVP, Troll PVE
---
Paladin: Dwarf PVP, Dwarf PVE
---
Priest: Dwarf PVP, Dwarf PVE, Troll PVP, Troll PVE
---
Rogue: Gnome PVP, Human PVE, Orc PVP, Orc PVE
---
Shaman: Orc PVP, Shaman PVE
---
Warlock: Gnome PVP, Gnome PVE, Orc PVP, Orc PVE
---
Warrior: Gnome PVP, Human PVE, Orc PVP, Orc PVE
---
I loved Skullcrusher back in Vanilla :(
---

---
JRE
---
Yea, this time I will be human scum.
---
I don’t think that works. I don’t know the correct technical terms, but classic is built on the stuff retail wow uses, pservers use the old stuff. 
---
Addons for example, that people use on paervers are having to be remade for classic because they don’t work in classic
---
Also tried this, I got a warning that the tab was slowing my browser, clicked "Stop It". All the nodes then showed but the map crashed and is no longer interactive.
---
Incorporate talent trees. It's important. The lack of extra crit damage, crit chance, cast time reduction and hit chance hurts a lot of specs, every spec basicly. World / Raid buffs as single toggles are important as well for many classes. The target you hit, be it a boss or pvp would be neat too, though you should just prioritize PvE, no one really needs PvP Dps.  
---
Another thing potentially is trinkets. Currently the on use one doesn't give me anything as far as I can tell.  
---
Maybe the rotation used (I know it's weird when most specs spam a single ability). But it would be nice to see something like, average / hightest hit / crit and such. Also consumables, mana usage ? Before all shadows come out of their holes posting their leet dps without mentioning being oom 30 secs into the fight.  
---
Anyway good job, solid foundation but still quite a long way to go.
---
All but one of my 60's in vanilla were Horde and I always liked them more. It helped that from my perspective that the Alliance storywise were kind of dicks most of the time and the Horde were underdogs who banded together out of necessity. 
---
My friend wants to go Alliance this go around for some "newness" to our nostalgic return. I'm really into pvp so it's really weird for me to adjust to seeing Horde characters as my enemies to gank. It was much easier to justify murdering Alliance.
---
If the game is so easy regardless of world buffs then why do you even care? I mean why can others not enjoy and benefit from world buffs if they wish to?  
---
I personally dont give a shit about PvE and certaintly not 14 year old artificial intelligence but I have to do it in order to get better gear for PvP. World buffs makes the game more enjoyable for me because it allow me and my guild to do raids quicker (if we dont wipe) thus allowing me/us to spend more time on PvP and other stuff.
---
+1 for this, really surprised there isn't a link to a github repo.
---
If you roll human (swords and maces) it's not any worse I dont think. Doesn't really matter anyway - you want to play 2h fury? Play 2h fury, regardless of faction.
---
Mages are nice to have in an instance for sure. They aren't *required* by any stretch though for levelling dungeons, and it's going to make loot time much more fun for a boomkin (especially if you can get a pally/shaman/druid as a healer).    
---
    
---
If you're going to do this I would say taking an extra stack of water with you for the healer would be a really good idea. Dungeon runs where the healer runs out of water are so annoying.
---
Yeah, it’s not perfect either but ammo is easier to manage than soul shards. At least from a time perspective.
---
Pretty sure he's saying the dungeon would take the 2 hours
---
1 spriest and 1feral tank druid shoild be in every serious guild.  
---
Maybe 1 enhancement shaman if he is super dedicated, and understands his job is twisting and nightfall.  
---
The rest is a no.
---
There's no way it's worth it to cancel a starfire cast to make use of NG.
---
For me, after leveling on staves, Corpsemaker is the first non-staff weapon I will get.  So, protip:  Once you get corpsemaker, get yourself a faster 2h axe to skill up with since corpsemaker is sooooooooooo daaaaannnnggg slooooww.
---
Its high priority it will push off other buffs.
---
It would be funny if this was retail, but the main problem that guilds are gonna run into is finding 40 people who regularly show up to fill slots. If I have a choice between no-one and a meme spec you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be taking that memer.
---
Ofcourse, once my raid team starts running into walls after all other 'problems' have been resolved then I'll be asking the memers to respec to something better. But that's essentially the last thing to happen.
---
It's generally referred to as "hand-tooled" in the biz, cool piece!
---
Dude, nobody gives a shit.
---
The sub is full of people telling you your attempt at having fun is wrong and you'll fail.
---
I sincerely whish you the best of luck in finding a guild that accepts you as cat DPS. imo tho as raidleader I'd be reluctant to take a cat into AQ40/Naxx since there is a dps loss (compared to other classes). However, if you want to cat-dps and also dispel (if necessary), heal (if necessary), and tank (if necessary), I'd invite you for sure :) people who put the success of the team first are always welcome
---
How is he wrong?
---
Is there a list of these exploitable world buffs, for science of course. I only remember the ony one.
---
Go to Ironforge, talk. Have fun. That's my plan for release. Basically enjoy the socializing again #MakeAzerothSocialAgain
---
What are the downsides?
---
Indeed.
---
for pvp moonchicken seems great outside of topend premades, you can stealth up and nuke fools. Specify your spec and in raids you might be getting reduced loot at first but stick with it and the right guild will reward you. I plan to play mage and be the biggest loot whore in the world, but I love having the crit aura to make my CoC that much bigger. Later in the game as kill times get faster you may not even oom and that might increase your overall damage dealt but idk the details.
---
I know i was just joking lol
---
What you said it true but when you take in to account kill speed and recovery time, killing lower level can work out better.
---
Uhh everyone in vanilla...
---
No, you don't need to be hit capped. I doubt you will be able to get the hit cap for for a very long time. All that hit does is it makes your threat more consistent.
---
A miss chain is pretty rare - 2 misses in a row is a 0.64% chance of happening without any hit on your gear - but if you get a bad string of misses at the start of a fight it's basically a guaranteed wipe. Everyone loses their world buffs and consumables when you wipe, which slows down progress.
---
I think Warriors should prioritize hit on their rings, necks, back, trinkets, and a few select pieces (Lionheart Helm is a good one). It's harder for Druids to make room for hit because they want bonus armor on their rings, trinkets, and cloak, but they can save any leather pieces with hit + necklaces (Onyxia Tooth Pendant especially) for fights when that extra hit might be important.
---
Yeah but shadow priest goes OOM faster than most, except maybe ele.
---
It's exactly the same as buying gold from the Chinese. The wow token does not generate any gold it just gets transferred from another person. It has to be farmed.
---
That makes it all the more realistic since classic wow was basically a giant grief fest of people telling you that you’re wrong and will fail no matter what you did. I remember how people who weren’t in my PvP group treated me when I was a shadow priest grinding to field marshal. You woulda thought I was an American minority who raped a baby based on some of the horrific PM’s I received.
---
yikes lmao
---
Maybe he is a time traveler, or he just ages very fast
---
that's like saying all buffs do nothing positive for the game
---
Waiting for classic is like waiting to meet with a girlfriend after a long time apart.
---
Time moves slow, so incredibly slow. It feels good that you are going to see her again soon, but its frustrating that you dont have her with you right now. You try to get a relief by watching "clips" online, but its not the same as being able to get on with it yourself.
---
When the day finally arrives, there is a rush of emotions and you can't keep your fingers away. You go on and on, and then you sleep like a baby feeling complete again.
---
I fully expect for the game to be literally unplayable for the first day.  As in the servers simply will be down.  Like Diablo III’s launch and pretty much every WoW expansion ever.
---
I keep changing my mind. On the one hand I got talked into rolling alliance when I first started playing and my nostalgia for the ally zones and quests is very strong but on the other I've never leveled a horde toon to max so it would be like playing a whole new game. 
---
Do I try and relive the magic of my youth and roll alliance or go in fresh and acknowledge that I don't know what the fuck I'm doing as horde? Decisions, decisions.
---
Although on the third hand the male night elf death cry does make me unreasonably happy.
---
On this subreddit that is blasphemous.  You might as well have come out as a pedi.
---
* Memespec knows it will create drama if he needs on cloth gear.

* Memespec doesn't want to create drama.

* Memespec still wants to need on cloth gear.
---
Seems like you've painted yourself into a corner there mate.
---
But if I'm being serious for a while: I'll be a warrior in Classic. I will probably never invite a memespec, UNLESS I already know that person. You need to be EXTREMELY social and make friends with tanks and healers on your server, because a memespec is dead last for random groups where people don't know you.
---
It's fine that you want to be a memespec. You already know the challenges you will face. There are no real solutions. You play a memespec. Deal with it, and you will probably enjoy Classic anyway :)
---
Nope I'm still talking about popular are you mental everything I have said is about how many play it and how much
---
You actually think flag carry druids are feral? Loooooool holy shot how deluded are you
---
exactly, you can't judge someones performance before hand.
---
if you take 10,000 players, on average, the better geared players will in fact  be the better players. that is just the reality of the situation.
---
&gt; will you be changing factions this time around?
---
So I look like a homosexual to you sir?
---
No, I will happily leave the alliance for the players who prefer to cross dress and dance naked on mail boxes.
---
same plus i like being a snowflake and not being an ud lock like most locks
---
In vanilla 3 dps weren't lfm , they were lfg.  You could try to make a group as a dps, but it was really hard.  Pservers have 3x the pop as classic.
---
I hope to play on launch so that when the weekend rolls around I will be level 10 or so, and can gank all the people that just started playing on the weekend!
---
Oh right, got it, Thanks!
---
Also don't forget about rebinding the tilde key
---
What he's describing isn't in game behavior. Retail is an entirely separate game. It's just gold buying my another name.
---
Within world of Warcraft vanilla skills?
---
Easy. Give me a rogue baseline. 2handes sword skill. And windfury weapon + purge + earth shock/chainlightning
---
Essentially a hemo rogue + elemental shaman with mail armor and 2h swords.
---
Not saying its okay, just being real.  You won't be banned for buying gold.
---
there will at least be enough questing content to get to 60 with the level 58 grind so maybe
---
Not clearing Naxx. Hope to change that this time.
---
I never played one it’s just what my guild did. From what I remember shadow runs out of mana really fast and ends up wanding. I’m sure most guilds will just bring a spriest though. At least in tbc they’ll get time to shine even more!
---
Thanks for the name idea. Nakedbacon
---
Checking out this guy and his “sleep”. Filthy casual!
---
oof. I clicked the video and instinctively tried to up the quality, thinking my youtube settings were on the fritz.
---
Yep, rolling horde this time around. Better racials, thicc femorcs &amp; finding a guild that suited my “niche” raid times (who happened to be horde). That’s a lot of pluses.. with the only minus being my hatred of Orgrimmar’s layout.
---
What absolutely sealed the deal for me.. was messing around with a warrior, on a naughty server this week. Now I can’t go back. What’s the point of even playing this game, without windfury totem???
---
Wow so jealous. Anything like that for horde?

I wanted to try horde this time but I'm just too attached to ironforge. It's too good
---
I remember they were vocally upset about it, but I probably said it was cool  or something to quell them.
---
You could argue that they shouldn't have joined anyway, but it is what it is
---
I plan to make a raiding guild with no warriors
---
Arena gearing is certainly a grind, it’s just not necessarily a ridiculous time sink compared to BG gearing. Elite gear provided an incentive to actually grind beyond the scenario you described that rewarded skilled players with better gear / weapons. It’s definitely a better system imo, rewarding good players who maybe didn’t have 14hrs a day to grind for R14, which is more indicative of time played.
---
i am saving up several good netflix series to binge as i autoattack seal of roulette my way to 60.

They have had enough successful launches recently that I don't think it will be a terrible experience (looking at you D3 May 2012). 
---
I think the first 4 to 5 hours is going to be an absolute shit show.  I am planning on just grinding mobs in the starting zone if it is anything like the stress test.  Gather quests were not completable.  Once I get out in the 6-12 range it should open up a bit.  I expect it to be calm after 12 straight hours of play.  
---
I expect to be at least level 30 by the time I sleep (Wednesday night sometime) and somewhere in Tarren Mill.  
---
I am going to duel box a Tauren warrior and an undead priest.  So I will be solo until I start doing the dungeon grind.  In BC (didn't play classic very long) I was able to tank and heal myself on two seperate computers with great effect.  I'm expecting to be able to pull off the same thing with classic dungeons.  If I can be effective at that, then I have the two most critical roles covered for dungeon leveling and hope to have a fairly easy go of it.   What do they say?  Every tank has a plan until the dps pulls an extra pack.   Being able to chose to let DPS die if they pull extra crap is honestly the most rewarding part of being the healer AND the tank.  I don't plan on informing anyone I am both characters either. 
---
We shall see how my reflexes have aged in 12 years though.

I expect to get lost in WC again.

Slay the Spire - its actually really fun.

HT isn't inefficient, it's very efficient and scales better than any other healing spell. It's just slow. That's the only drawback. But we also get swiftmend and NS+HT for big instant heals on CD. Swiftmend is massively superior to holy shock and NS+r10HT is basically lay on hands with 1/20th the cd.
---
Be the change you want to see in this world!

Enter a group: "Hi, I will be rolling on cloth spell DPS gear"

I've been a core raider in loot council and I've never been part of the council.    But I've never heard of people complaining even in whispers about who got what loot.  If I was on a council and someone whispered me telling me they deserved a piece that dropped over who we gave it to I would likely put that person on a very low priority for loot.  It makes them look like they are out for themselves and not the guild. Which screams of someone who's thinking of ditching the guild.
---
It depends on your gear, the racial is only for base attack power, which means attack power converted from stats, which sometimes is less than half of your overall attack power.
---
 I'd assume it's similiar to the benefits a warrior would get, as that's what i play, and it gives me about 6-7% increased white damage, so divide that by cooldown or by length of the fight and you have your answer.
---
It is powerful on rogues for pvp though, as i think you can pop it during stealth to have it on your opener and such.
---
I have the same plan. Maybe get started the first couple days but I’ll have work. Take off thurs and fri and then I’m behind the huge pack that started release, not competing with them, but I’ll be ahead of the people that don’t take off and can’t start until Friday, also not competing with them.
---
Kinda considered it, but nah, gonna relive the glory days as a horde. It was the only time in WoW that I felt proud to be a horde.
---
That is my master mute button for all vc needs.
---
Damn, guess the world first naxx clear in 2006 didn't deserve to kill KT since they used wbuffs then.
---
Yeah, that's nice and all, but your main city is still made out of sticks and kodo shit.
---
Sure, it helps at launch with tagging. But then you're stuck playing a druid...
---
Yup.  100% agree and tbh this is coming from an alliance player personally so I hve no skin in the game.  I’ll be going dwarf and I’ll be laughing my ass off while watching all the UD priests trying to kill me.
---
Everyone wants the two handers for pvp, I doubt you’d have prio on the other warriors because you play 2h fury.
---
I was obsessed with the game pre launch. Huge WC3 fan, and just a huge Blizz fan in general. I had been really lucky and received closed beta invites to Wc3 and the expansion, so as time went on with the Wow beta running and no invite, I got more and more frustrated. Eventually I realized people were actually selling their closed beta accounts on eBay, and somehow I performed the necessary mental gymnastics to justify buying it. I was a sophomore in high school, and I convinced my parents to front me something like $250 as my bday and Xmas present for this persons account... 
---
2 weeks later the open beta opened. 
---
2 weeks later
---
I must have struck a nerve. 
---
Launch is going to be an absolute shitshow. Theres going to be so many problems and issues and bugs and broken things everywhere. What could I help with? I'm going to be going slow at my own pace and people are going to be angry because it's already a slower paced game than people remember and the amount of people playing will make it worse. I'm going to laugh at all the salt and flames. 
---
So please tell me how minding my own business and observing people self implode over pixels makes me a toxic shithead? Does not explaining what the quest text already says make me a bad player to people who skip the information to be "faster"?
---
Awesome mate, exciting times!
---
Nobody liked you and nobody likes you.
---
You've had fifteen years to take a hint. 
---
It's free of charge, take it for your own sake; if not for everyone else unfortunate enough to be in your proximity.
---
This doesn't work, Classic uses the BFA API, not the 1.12 one.
---
Hah, I remember being on the bus on the way home from tennis matches with my team in highschool, worrying that I was gonna miss the Onyxia raid. 
---
They'd even mess with me "How'd onyxia go last night?" Even though they didn't play.
---
I was so sure I'd be playing lock. Very tough call to play orc over ud but that's what I decided. 
---
Then I was like, "what class can I play that is best for ud?" "Priest!" I said. Well turns out trolls are arguably better than ud! 
---
So now I may be maining a troll priest someone help me.
---
That was important
---
I regret not playing WoW because it was for nerds.  I was a nerd what the hell was wrong with me I love this game!
---
&gt;Old BRD
---
I'll be honest with you, I'm not looking forward to that damn maze.
---
Rogue/Hunter hybrid is what I'd love to be. Stealth + Dual Daggers and a pet to distract enemies while I shank them in the back.
---
5head right here, your an idiot if you think FC druids don’t go into feral. 30/21 is extremely strong and common.
---
I did think it was funny that in Gnomer they gave you a parachute where you could have a mage cast featherfall in order to skip.
---
But ultimately I want excursions into dungeons to last longer. To feel the weight of things like Scholomance and Gnomer. To revel in unlocking shortcuts.
---
Possibly a dumb question: Are there any builds that max out a single skill tree?
---
For thematic reasons it would be cool to have a mono-spec, even if the output is not 100% ideal.
---
People play it because it's a pve spec and they don't want to respec?
---
It's also good to gib FC
---
I have a map up and still get lost in BRD every time.
---
r/ihavesex
---
Very possible - I don't know when they dissolved completely but I know they were still running after I quit in Cata.
---
Keep in mind might be just anecdotal shit, but I always got it done really quick there
---
Amen to this.
---
Yea
---
Old BRD I remember fondly... Until I remember I spent 4 hours running the entire Dungeon and that pretty much burnt me out of BRD for life.
---
However the entire experience of moving through-out the world, interacting with other players, directing them to the dungeon, waiting at the FP because one guy doesn't know the way, fighting through mobs to get to the entrance.... That shit I love.
---
Greetings! I am Duggest!
---
It's easy for me - Warlock
---
I swear if soul harvester for warlock is in the game in phase 1 it will be proof blizzard has no idea what they're doing when it comes to classic.
---
It's huge because it's much easier to eliminate glancing blows.
---
Yeah, but both queues and server merges are not really desirable outcomes.
---
If you're worried about layering fucking up the economy, which I agree can happen, I think a server merge fucks it up worse
---
Don't expect a lot of love, but there will be groups for you.
---
People farm dungeons for lots of things from rare drops to recipes to  off spec gear.  Even then you won't be first choice as an *undergeared* meme-spec, but with persistence you can pull it off.
---
Classic deadmines was as close to perfection as anything could come. All the quest leadup since lvl 1. Good drops, fun dungeon. 
---
Its actually so good I'm a little sad the people I know are going horde this time.
---
No you can't. Fuck off with these posts.
---
Hmm thanks for the input. How do they go in battlegrounds? 
---
Ugh I can't decide, I guess I could always play shadow in PvP and whatever groups I can get into , and just re spec if I really wanna raid. I've never really healed tho and Id get a bit worried going into groups but oh well, I'll learn eventually
---
and forget about spot with a gap and fall through into a bunch of mobs
---
When shes still doing her makeup
---
3 minute mage was only viable for a short window of time. Once they made it so you could no longer stack zandalarian hero charm with ToEP the spec fell hard on its face. There's no reason to ever play this spec unless you want to be a burden to your team in BGs.
---
Not everyone was made of money
---
Another question if you don't mind answering, do most buffs persist through death or are they usually lost upon death?
---
You will also be competing with the Paladins for all 2handers for pvp purposes if they go ret. Shamans can’t use swords.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Thats when pallies begin to pose a real problim
---
Thanks
---
I'm switching from long time horde player to Alliance
---
I blame Remi Lacroix
---
The downside is if you keyboard turn you are a slow piece of mud. 
---
In pvp people can walk through your character model and never get hit by you. In pve you are slower and more prone to death when reacting to mechanics.
---
Yeah I keep wondering how it will be, due to a not too early morning start, some people might try to have a crack before work, people choosing to take the day/ week off for it. And for SA/ WA its 7 or 6 am (I think?) so maybe more chance of people having a crack before work? Who knows!  
---
What ever happens its going to be interesting, and I am super excited haha!
---
If you decide to level with daggers I dont think combat is the way to go.   AR and SND arent great with daggers.      I cant recommend leveling with daggers but if you want to do it I'd would suggest sub tree.
---
Classic isnt considered a big launch for acti. Their earnings call very briefly mentioned it
---
Omg I thought that guild name sounded familiar. I used to raid for them (though much later on) when I was probably still in like Middle School on this little night elf hunter Fannispir. Geez. 
---
I remember Zaknarfien and Gendty, and a few other names. 
---
Gosh that's nostalgic.
---
You're not wrong Walter
---
I love hearing old names from Deathwing. Personally I'll never forgive Xantim for crushing my Ret paladin and then putting it in his pvp video. https://youtu.be/sALZHCmAMVo jump to 2:29 to see my banana shoulders get dirt roaded
---
They have to do something. Splitting the community effectively kills vanilla wow.
---
Put my phone down to laugh at that part
---
Just saying, I was a specced into Pom/pyro build in vanilla BECAUSE of those pvp videos, and as a casual raider and paper it was a VERY Fun spec.
---
Blessings, BOP, LoH, HoF to name a few. Also, are their racial better?
---
Whenever I think of Classic WoW I always think of BRD. You spent so much time in that dungeon on the way to 60 and even at 60. Rogues looked forward to [Barman Shanker](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12791), caster dps for [Circle of FLame)[https://classicdb.ch/?item=12791], warriors wanted [Savage Gladiator Chain](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11726), melee dps always farmed for BiS trinket [Hand of Justice](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11815) and was a cool item to have [Ironfoe](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11684). The instance was just full of good gear and it took so long to run (2-3 hours full clear) you were ready for a break by the end of it.
---
I have a buddy who got r11 and said it was pretty nuts. He wasn’t in one of the better guilds but he was always on so he would get invited to their premades after like 2am when normal guildies were logging off. He was in high school and did school to work and between skipping school/using school as sleeping time he hit rank 11 and then not that long later they made the black war mounts super easy to get lol
---
Exactly, people forget how much more the game has been theorycrafted in pservers since.
---
Real plus of feral though is you can offtank, offheal and decurse/abolish poison with a quick gear switch.
---
Run some high keys and tell me there's no difference between good and bad tanks.
---
Escape Artist is legit gamebreaking. 60s CD. 0.5s cast.  In wPvP, getting caught is very bad. Hamstring, wing clip, all that stuff.. almost spells certain death. Being able to get out of a slow or immobilize may be the difference between winning and losing.
---
Music really sets the tone. 
---
Doubles as a love making station too!
---
They are undead, so having the Paladins bubble sand holy wrath them was an effective tactic
---
Why don't you afk some more raids ;)
---
I'll find your wife. I hope she's alive and not under a bridge
---
12:00 am is midnight. Unless you were just confirming that?
---
I ABHOR original gnomer!!! Ugh!!! Those fucking alarm bots!
---
And you'll be at level 10 with shit gear and no money for training ranks.
---
I played in the guild as an officer dude would go afk for trash pulls on a constant basis and was warned multiple times. Had it coming.
---
I’m okay with being a bit behind 
---
Gonna Walk everywhere 
---
No sprinting except if I need to run away
---
I killed Heroic Argus back in Legion with 10 fps lower than the lowest graphics settings using console commands. I don't miss that. Next time you're in game type /console renderscale 0.2
---
That's what my game looked like. /console renderscale 1 to reset it
---
Same but maybe a good thing cause I leveled a Druid. Which was super fun in end game tbc but idk if I would have enjoyed it as much in vanilla endgame. I loved resto in tbc but I liked lifebloom and hots. Idk if I’d like spamming different ranks of healing touch
---
Even on retail (where you have a map for the dungeon) it's still confusing.
---
Warning warning, intruder alert!
---
Nah this is 2019 Blizzard. They'll ignore feedback until the problem is fucked
---
Bullshit. You can hit more armless and blindfolded than a hunter under hit cap. I imagine it's basically the same but more shots come out so when you do accidental dps (which is all a hunter ever hopes for anyway) maybe it will be higher than the memespecs.
---
I know it inside out, it'll be fun leading a party there
---
Honestly, I'll probably wait a day or two for the shitstorm to die down before I play.
---
I have little to no interest in end game Classic content, so leveling is all there really is for me. I'm not in any rush. I'll still be running keys and PVPing on Live, but this will give me something low stress to do in my downtime.
---
The post-private-server meta revolves around Paladins (Blessing of Salvation makes raiding easier, and they turbocharge PvP premades with near-perma Blessing of Freedom on melee) so the hardcore guilds are generally going to roll Alliance.
---
a bard ! thinkin like a hunter with an instrument instead of a ranged weapon, and some kind of pet bar/stance dance mechanics to alter buffs that are short duration, but combo-able? i guess? shaman totem/warrior shout style? 
---
or even voodoo troll with the bongos hexing ppl to the sen jin village song 🗿🗿🗿
---
Just play a first person shooter for a week. I couldn't stand not having it be wasd from my first moments playing the game because it feels just *awful* after a lifetime of Half Life and CS.
---
The first time I ever played ANY kind of multiplayer game was when I wandered into Deadmines as a mage at level 20. I did not even know what my Polymorph button was good for.
---
The tank on the evening walked me through what was required of me step by step. And is still my friend to this day.
---
Obviously we're very different players but I love getting lost in dungeons, BRD is a dream for me. thats how dungeons should feel in games, huge and overwhelming
---
I'll be honest, when I'm on mobile I still look at these kinds of threads and reply to people, but I literally can't even load the video on mobile :(
---
1-10 recovery time is not really an issue for any class.  after that it might be but you would have to kill substantially faster to make grinding like green mobs worth it so fast i don't think you could make up for it.
---
It's a meta spec iirc. There are top specs but each few months and with new item progression people will see new specs arising for a month and more - survival Hunter is a good example.
---
The mage class call had them poly people with unobtainable polys animals.
---
I've had friends get banned for buying gold so ya it will it wasnt permanently banned cause it was their only offence but it was still a few days
---
Oceanic launch is 8am Tuesday. I'm working a half day and then starting at midday hoping I'll skip the launch zerg and the after work zerg. I'll catch up to launch players in the evening and have congestion.
---
Taking the next day off with a goal of level 30.
---
After that it'll be a few hours every evening and reach 40 on the weekend. That will be well ahead of the pack.
---
And +30 to starcraft
---
Yeah you right 2% is useless
---
I had a buddy that was a miner, and noticed he wasn't looting the stone from the nodes. He said the stone filled up his bags and he only wanted the ore. I was irrationally angry about it.
---
That was cool
---
The 1.12 item stats already invalidate this gear as there is alternatives that are much easier to get with a similar power level. If anything this change actively kills off that content which is a bad thing IMO.
---
Well you never strictly needed one to begin with.
---
You could zone in from the living side and make your way towards the dead side. The key drops in the living side and then you can go and kill the baron.
---
Having the key beforehand allowed you to use the service entrance, and make a much quicker baron run
---
Can confirm, dark blue
---
Oh ya ok. I remember we had the “live run” and “baron run”
---
but their lightning fast heals are great just put them in a dress
---
Considering a corpse run can EASILY take more than three minutes, this is still more than enough time to camp someone endlessly.
---
People forget its not just lower dps, there are also things like the debuff limit that have to be given serious attention to. No one wants feral bleeds in the raid period.
---
Fuck em. Plain and simple. Just do your best :D
---
Good luck speed clearing brd
---
Incorrect.
---
I can't wait to do SFK again. I don't know why but I always loved that dungeon.
---
Really... this thread again?
---
 here we go.
---
Survive over threat. 
---
Dps can always slow down pre naxx healers cannot always go harder
---
One of the things I wan't people to realize. And this is not the end of the discussion just a point I think everyone should keep rattling around in their heads when thinking of maining an "offspec" in a raidgroup.
---
One of the setbacks to maining an offspec in a raid group is that you will be taking gear that for the most part would have gone to "pure" specs for pvp. Let me give you an example.
---
If you are a ret paladin or an enhance shaman, unless you are married to the idea of using a nightfall axe, you will want to spend dkp or get loot counciled the nice 2h weapons from raids. Now, in a guild of more "pure" spec raiders these 2h weapons would go to hunters/resto shamans/fury warriors/holy paladins for their pvp enjoyment. I am not saying that you getting these weapons would be a bad thing. I am cautioning that this may be a point of contention with raid groups. Do not be surprised, this will be part of the reason the "pure" spec raiders may have animosity towards the "offspec" raiders, coupled with the fact of lower dps/utility and whatever other factors people perceive. 
---
My one example was 2h weapons but this applies to most gear.
---
TL;DR: I calculate Blood Fury being worth about 18 DPS.
---
At level 60, an Orc Rogue has 83 Strength and 127 Agility, and an Undead Rogue has 79 Strength and 128 Agility.
---
This means the Orc has 3 more base Attack Power but the Undead has 0.03448% more crit.
---
Blood Fury increases this base AP by 25% for 15 seconds. So an Orc is getting 52.5 Attack Power for 15 seconds.
---
We're going to use Phase 2 [Combat Dagger](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005203104-3203052020550100201-05) BIS against a Boss Mob as our base for both, which is roughly (once buffed):
---
* ~1200 Bonus Attack Power
---
* ~35% Crit
---
* Yellow Attack Hit Capped
---
* 18% White Attack Miss Chance (when including Dodge)
---
* 5% reduction from Glancing Blows on 40% of White Attacks
---
* ~35% reduction on all Attacks from Armor (after debuffs)
---
* 20% Chance to get an extra Perdition's Blade attack /w 315 bonus Attack Power
---
* 2% Chance to get an extra Perdition's Blade attack
---
The relevant attack table looks like this:
---
Note: Slice and Dice is already up for the duration of this scenario. Also, you've just vanished to reset threat, so your swing timers would have reset. We're going to start you off at 60 Energy (out of 110) with your Energy Regen at 50% (1 second remaining) when you use Adrenaline Rush.
---

Adding that all up:
---
* 15x Swing (Perdition's Blade)
---
* 17x Swing (Core Hound Tooth)
---
* 5x Backstab
---
* 1x Eviscerate @ 5 Combo Points
---
Our average BASE_WPN_DMG is:
---
    (WPN_DMG_LOW + WPN_DMG_HIGH) / 2 + (ATTACK_POWER / 14) * WPN_SPEED
---
So for Perdition's Blade:
---
    PB_BASE_UNDEAD = (73 + 137) / 2 + 1407 / 14 * 1.8 = 286 Damage
---
    PB_BASE_ORC =  (73 + 137) / 2 + 1462.5 / 14 * 1.8 = 293 Damage
---
Similarly for Core Hound Tooth:
---
    CHT_BASE_UNDEAD = (57 + 107) / 2 + 1407 / 14 * 1.6 = 243 Damage
---
    CHT_BASE_ORC =  (57 + 107) / 2 + 1462.5 / 14 * 1.6 = 249 Damage
---
Backstab base is PD_BASE * 1.5 + 210 and has these relevant Talents:
---
* Lethality - 24% more Critical Strike damage bonus
---
* Improved Backstab - 30% more Critical Strike chance
---
* Opportunity - 20% more damage
---
So:
---
    BACKSTAB_BASE_UNDEAD = 286 * 1.5 + 210 = 639 damage
---
    BACKSTAB_BASE_ORC = 293 * 1.5 + 210 = 650 damage
---
After factoring crit and armor reduction and those talents:
---
    BACKSTAB_UNDEAD = 1.2 * (639 * 2.24 * 0.6503448 + 639 * (1 - 0.6503448)) * 0.65 = 900 damage
---
    BACKSTAB_ORC = 1.2 * (650 * 2.24 * 0.65 + 650 * (1 - 0.65)) * 0.65 = 916 damage
---
Eviscerate is:
---
    (904 + 1012) / 2 + ATTACK_POWER * 5 * 0.03
---
    EVIS_UNDEAD = (904 + 1012) / 2 + 1407 * 5 * 0.03 = 1169 damage
---
    EVIS_ORC = (904 + 1012) / 2 + 1462.5 * 5 * 0.03 = 1177 damage 
---
After factoring crit and armor reduction
---
    EVIS_UNDEAD = (1169 * 2 * 0.3503448 + 1169 * (1 - 0.3503448)) * 0.65 = 1026 damage
---
    EVIS_ORC = (1177 * 2 * 0.35 + 1169 * (1 - 0.35)) * 0.65 = 1029 damage
---
Similarly for our White Attacks (including Miss Chance and Glancing Blows):
---
    PB_UNDEAD = 0.84 * (286 * 0.95 * 0.40 + 286 * 2 * 0.3503448 + 286 * 0.2496552) * 0.65 = 208 damage
---
    PB_ORC = 0.84 * (293 * 0.95 * 0.40 + 293 * 2 * 0.35 + 293 * 0.25) * 0.65 = 213 damage
---
    CHT_UNDEAD = 0.84 * (243 * 0.95 * 0.40 + 243 * 2 * 0.3503448 + 243 * 0.2496552) * 0.65 = 177 damage
---
    CHT_ORC = 0.84 * (249 * 0.95 * 0.40 + 249 * 2 * 0.35 + 249 * 0.25) * 0.65 = 181 damage
---
Hand of Justice (calculated as a value of *per swing*):
---
    HOJ_UNDEAD = 208 * 0.02 = 4.16 damage
---
    HOJ_ORC = 213 * 0.02 = 4.26 damage
---
Windfury Totem (calculated as a value of *per swing*):
---
    WF_UNDEAD = (208 + 315 / 14 * 1.8) * 0.20 = 49.7 damage
---
    WF_ORC = (213 + 315 / 14 * 1.8) * 0.20 = 50.7 damage
---
Back to what we did:
---
Adding it all up:
---
    ORC_PB_TOTAL = (213 + 4.26 + 50.7) * 15 = 4019 damage
---
    ORC_CHT_TOTAL = (181 + 4.26 + 50.7) * 17 = 4011 damage
---
    ORC_BACKSTAB_TOTAL = (916 + 4.26 + 50.7) * 5 = 4855 damage
---
    ORC_EVISCERATE_TOTAL = 1029 damage
---
    UNDEAD_PB_TOTAL = (208 + 4.16 + 49.7) * 15 = 3928 damage
---
    UNDEAD_CHT_TOTAL = (177 + 4.16 + 49.7) * 17 = 3925 damage
---
    UNDEAD_BACKSTAB_TOTAL = (900 + 4.16 + 49.7) * 5 = 4769 damage
---
    UNDEAD_EVISCERATE_TOTAL = 1026
---
That leaves us with:
---
* Orc: 13914 total damage = 927.6 DPS (over 15 seconds)
---
* Undead: 13648 total damage = 909.9 DPS (over 15 seconds)
---
Thus Blood Fury is worth roughly 17.7 DPS.
---
The only time I see is on the map with the release times in all the time zones.
---
Loved me some POM Pyro. I don’t recommend it as a main spec, but definitely worth spending some time having fun with it!
---
I love the travel to the dungeon, it really helps immerse you in the theme of the dungeon by traveling through a similar landscape to get there. Like going into the caves and having to fight your way into the wailing caverns.
---
Gotcha.  I guess the other 39 people in that raid and the GM must be terrible, too, since they're playing with him.
---
Blue post says it follows the same schedule on the 12th/13th.

I doubt ferals in vanilla even used pummelers. Or even wolfshead helm
---
Incorrect Indeed.  From exploration and fedex quests and few kill quests, I will have all my level 10 spells, 4 bags purchased, 2 green items on me and 25s on the side to buy a wand and 8s left over.
---
An LFG tool, not the dungeon finder
---
There's more than just wind force. Haha
---
Is that a snake u own or another exotic kinda pet?
---
I look forward to camping korgath
---
I would say most of the guild/raid leaders I've known have been DPS toons.
---
Usually tanks have enough to worry about, so making them explain strats, positioning, calling out on Disc, etc... puts a lot on them. Usually better to have especially ranged DPS that can more easily deal with those things.
---
Majority of folks on this sub did lfr and world quests , then said retail wow has no community and is ezmode. Truth only gets downvoted here.
---
Help you what?
---
So you’re rolling human male paladin?
---
just this old danish
---
This gets posted at least 5 times a day.
---
To the quarantine sub with you, r/classicwowplus
---
No idea what the IcyVeins guide says, but teach her pet dummying. That way she can get through an area without aggroing a million mobs. Oh, and also tell her to ALWAYS dismiss pet before jumping down anywhere in a dungeon. It'll save her (and her group) a lot of headaches.
---
Same. But I’m rolling female orc cause I think male orc shoulders are a bit much and to me they look silly on warlock mounts
---
People say this....meanwhile u see how people cleared SM....
---
If you get caught researching on the train, just tell the Officer, “it’s Ok, I’ve got Blessing of Protection, baby..”
---
except...... no?
---
shamans are pink in classic
---
Hey that’s the tooltip!
---
We've been practicing on Friday mornings in rusr for years for this sweaty 8am grind!! I wonder how many Aussies will no-life it like us...
---
You'll probably have to wait in the back of the line for gear when raiding.  For 5 man pug shit, just roll.
---
Good info. I was leaning toward mage already, so this helps a ton. Thanks!
---
Little things, uhm... Teach her to keep her pet on passive and use commands, either through binds or clicking, for attacking and following. It's the easiest way to control your pet which is important, especially for dungeons and stuff.
---
When she gets more comfortable with the game you can introduce her to the concept of kiting, which is an important skill for Hunters. But honestly don't push her, she'll learn a lot herself and she'll find her groove.
---
There is a version with all the classic models included. I have it on my pc. Will pm you later with the name
---
The only difference is the cool down on dragon slayer which is not a big deal.
---
If she's not totally new have her watch this. If shw is totally new go wild
---
https://youtu.be/gKx3qqbdMfY
---
Yeah but arms was decent versus other classes in pve.
---
I can already tell we’re going to be best friends. For the alliance! Lemme know what server you pick
---
Scarlet Monastery is absolutely incredible. Every single wing. I have such fond memories of that place.
---
Appreciate it :D
---
I missed out on real Vanilla, but I loved the atmosphere in Zul'Farrak.
---
Cloth only give a little less armor.
---
It’s not a pve spec. The pve spec is either arcane/frost or deep fire. There is no pve spec with PoM + Pyro.
---
Na it’s really bad. Nobody plays this on private servers.
---
Perhaps, but it’s definitely not taking Wyvern Sting, lol.
---
If people want tokens they can farm it on retail. Otherwise leave that shit out of classic.
---
**Jesus........ O_o**
---
If it's red, it's dead.
---
3pm pacific on the 26th. The countdown on the blizzard site and other places is still accurate.
---
What is wrong with using right click to strafe? That's what I was asking.
---
Hit start popping on tanking gear only in the later tiers. To get it early you have to go out of your way and wear non tanking pieces.
---
Remember that you’re playing a game with other people. Always try to bring as much as you can to raids and groups.
---
There are some phenomenal resources on this website devoted exclusively to twinking in world of warcraft, they have a section for Classic wow. Here is a guide for BiS gearing for each class and spec, and a guide that covers all the abilities classes have and how to play each class :) Enjoy!

Warden has been a thing for a loooong time.  It's their anti-cheat system that runs behind the scenes.
---
Good one, have some DKP
---
I have heard a ton of warnings about this. I have never played any version of wow before. Is this really a big concern? I am EST and looking for a pvp server, I heard there will probably only be one per timezone for each type of server. If a big streamer chooses an est pvp server am I just shit out of luck? It seems crazy that they have the power to ruin an entire server
---
That’s what I like to fookin hear!

Literally the 6th link if you google it:

---
Hey. Thanks for the info. :) I've actually been looking at these when making my stuff. I've been talking to the creator of one of those pages for advice as well. I've found some issues so far with JamesB guide however. Still a good resource I refer back to though
---
Feral DPS is very competitive when played correctly. Ret doesn’t come close even when minmaxed. And Feral is way more valuable to the raid because you bring Innervate, Brez, 3% crit aura for the melee group, and you can off-tank when needed. All in all feral is not even a meme spec. It’s just that most Ferals will be a meme because they don’t want to do so much work just to stay competitive.
---
Force yourself to use a different setup...strafe on q/w/e, a/s/d/ or even s/d/f is nice if you dont play other games. Switched to qwe when j got serious about pvp healing and it helped a lot compared to even awd strafe
---
I'm guessing most people aiming for this at this point aren't even going to last a month in classic.
---
You know thats a very good point. These days when I want a game I just go buy it, don't need to think twice.
---
This is probably the first game I actually have to wait for, in a very long time.
---
It also doesn't matter. Oh boy some people will have epic mounts fast and a glowing brightwood staff.
---
Most of us that leveled quickly cleared Naxx 25 with an entire set of gear from Hyjal/BT/Sunwell. With the set bonuses and proper itemization the leveling gear just didn't even come close.
---
How about this leave classic as close to vanilla as possible no new content no class changes.
---
Threat is part of tanking. I see onslaught girdle as tank gear even if its also bis dps.  Band of Accuria should go to the main tank first. If you dont get lionheart helm as a tank, you are bad.
---
I came from the back ground of strategic games like Civ, total war, so after watching Southpark’s ‘Make love, not warcraft’, I decided it was time to try a totally different genera of game. Strategic games where always an enormous time sink, so that didn’t worry me too much. However choose warrior because I thought hitting things will be much easier then casting spells…I didn’t have much of a fantasy background or knowledge of anything DND like, period. Little did I know I was expected to lead dungeons (wtf were those), not key board turn, not smash my own face with a mace, trying to get the gnome tap dancing on my Taurean head. Having such a bad start in the game, really wrecked my confidence and I barely participated in any end game stuff…just played the AH mostly, got rich, spend the money on slim BOE upgrades, play AH and finally left with a ton of gold on that avi. Still manage to have lots of fun though being scrub…I’m sure ruined other’s enjoyment
---
In one month we actually realise it was all an aprils fools joke and there won´t be a wow classic!
---
Time to go attack Crossroads
---
Sadly I disagree. I played recently and had some asshole Shaman around level 30 in red Ridge just killing everyone all the time
---
Thank you for advertising the sub.   
---
However the people there are some of the most creative and well thought out players on reddit. This sub could be seen as a quarantine of elitist jerks and loot council communists.
---
Not quitting WoW after getting fucked over by Blizzard in patch 1.12.1. I never found the right place to tell this rant. I guess I should tell it now:
---
I was horrible at making money. I wanted my first epic mount to be a tiger mount, but I was human.
---
I spent months, yes MONTHS trying to get exalted with Darnassus. That included doing the daily AQ War Effort [Runecloth donation quest in Darnassus](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7800/a-donation-of-runecloth).
---
I remember the weight coming off my shoulders after I exalted AND finally paid for the riding skill. All that was left was to get a PvP Black War Tiger. It's easier to get than a regular 900g tiger.
---
Then, without me knowing, Blizzard goes from 1.12 to 1.12.1. They replace the old version of riding skill in the spell book to a new version. They also switched the prices for mount and skill. Now the skill is 900g but the mounts are cheap. Good thing I just got it, right?!! haha....
---
They said *DON'T WORRY* to those who already have epic mounts. If you're already ride an epic mount, you automatically learned the riding skill and don't need to spend 900g. Sounds pretty neat, right?
---
Except, that I **DIDN'T HAVE MY FUCKING MOUNT YET!** They deleted the riding skill I busted my ass for and now I had to grind 900g to re-learn it!!!!
---
I'll skip to TBC and say, I couldn't afford an epic ground mount until I was leveling in Shadowmoon fucking Valley. It slowed down my Outlands experience. I might've been happier if I quit WoW near Vanilla's end. I loved Blizzard (went through 14 books &amp; many games) but fuck Blizzard for doing this. Even as a grown ass man with real things to worry about, I will hold on to this grudge forever.
---
------
---
Oh yeah, um............... my second regret was picking Enchanting/Tailoring combo. Expensive as hell to level. Decent stuff made along the way but nothing great until you're raiding. Fuck that stress.
---
what about wc3 reforged?
---
portrait
---
Memespec
---
They ruined so much...
---
I am still amazed that we have managed to get raid frames and other addons on our 17" or 19" CRT monitors with crappy resolution.
---
don't you think classic if well marketized could be a big hit for acti?
---
I refuse to believe that the class that allows me to seamlessly download lesbian pornography between pulls is the source of any problem.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13394#dropped-by:0+1-8
---
Better than deathbone.
---
maybe its cuz i played too much P servers
---
like tier 0.5 on release!
---
what's so strange to me is that people would understand if you were also a mage/warlock/priest and rolled on cloth.  The fact that you're a druid caster dps shouldn't change that.
---
I mean, what else happens?  Any cast dps that takes your slot is going to be rolling on that same cloth gear.  Don't sweat it.  You'll find people to play with who aren't loot whores.  Enjoy your chicken!
---
World buffs doesn't destroy the initiative to players the game
---
Uh, sorry dude i need that 2-h weapon for my hunter.
---
Noone is sure. If anyone was actually sure, we would know boss damage values. 
---
Classic is not Vanilla. We have stronger items because of 1.12 itemization. We have stronger talents because of 1.12 talents. 
---
Who knows if bosses got nerfed at some point.
---
But private server bosses are beefed up based on values known for some bosses in Vanilla. Not all values are known. Some bosses could be stronger. But at least some bosses are definitely harder in Classic. They have even been simulated with the increased parry chance and all. And you can still tank them in full hit gear as a human.
---
It is harder to get to 9 hit in progression as a non human/orc, which is why the race is so coveted, even over tauren as a main tank. 
---
The best way is to go for daggers, and wear Aged Core Leather gloves, those gloves basically give you 3 hit. But you will feel squishier than a human would.
---
Your statement makes no sense. 
---
If I want to watch a movie I don't do it to get lectured and virtue signaled by political radicals while I have to pay them. Go woke, go broke Disney.
---
I forgot how hard that fight was to heal. You had to hit flash of light every 20 seconds and not move once
---
i'm sorry you feel like your future experience in new classic has been pre-emptively attacked or tainted
---
Some people maybe, but my computer ripped Vanilla just fine. 7800 GTX etc
---
Definitely avoiding this sub after launch. It's going to only get worse with this stuff.
---
What do we do now?
---
But 20% from a rare spawn. So the chances of actually getting it are not great.
---
The beginning of BRD would be a good farm for a 2 person group. Vendor / DE boss drops, vault runs if you want, dark iron if someone picks up mining, wolf meat to cook up.
---
I remember struggling to get into Razorfen Crawl(downs?) That maze of thorns outside to finally make it to the portal to actually start the dungeon was a fantastic feeling
---
Keep telling yourself that retail boy
---
I was interessted in SP too, but the brutal lack of mana (regen) drove me off.
---
Watch some classic videos, after every fight in pvp u have to drink and in groupcontent too. (I guess you could go heal fof that)
---
the game has been successful securing millions of subscribers during vanilla, wouldn't it be basically the same this time around? or does the new generation don't play mmo anymore?
---
WoW tokens also make gold buying politically correct and the customer friendly way to buy gold makes more money people buy gold. 
---
They also farm gold they wouldn't have farmed if tokens didn't exist so the market is flooded with gold.
---
Keeping gold buying politically incorrect and unsafe keeps a lot of people away from doing it
---
Gold selling is likely to be a huge problem the only question is who sells the gold.  Farmers for rl money?  Or players for gametime?
---
Tokens actually bring the market under control, gold sellers are disincentivized because they have to bottom out there prices to compete with a legal system.  Its also worth mentioning that a lot of this gold comes from hacks.
---
I hate that buying virtual items with real money is a thing in mmos, but it's going to happen whether I like it or not, tokens are the lesser evil.
---
Just flag on an pvp server omg
---
Speaking of shanker. How do you aggro that boss without his adds?  I’ve seen it vaguely mentioned but with many google searches it’s hard to find much info about him.
---
Kind of just sounds like a bad business strategy not to get people hyped for the launch. It’s almost unprecedented that a game is brought back by popular demand. Advertising before launch huts on the excitement of that, while advertising after launch sounds like they’re just pulling all the stops to get people back to the game.
---
I deleted a 60 paladin out of hatred for blood elves. Not sure how I endured leveling it to 60 honestly... or why I put myself through it in the first place!
---
Labor of love.
---
I remember making most of my gold from boe greens. If its something a twink could use and its the best in AH in that slot go crazy.
---
There is a good handful of green items that are best in slot at there level. People will pay stupid amounts for these. You hit a gold mine if you find a level 19 leather peice of armor and there is nothing else in the AH that comes next to it.
---
Loot every thing.
---
Depending on the server and population maybe just selling raw mats from herbs and mining could be a good source of gold.
---
Instant freeze  traps that can't be trinketed out of.
---
Non normalized weapon damage on special shots.
---
Ranged attacks that can't be dodged.
---
Good hunters wrecked in pvp in vanilla.
---
Let's do Troll /w Berserking, which is 10% haste at full HP and 43% haste at 40% HP for a total of 10 seconds.
---
TL;DR: A Troll *should* do 54 to 176 DPS *more* than an Orc. Can someone check this for me? If it's right, then why is Orc considered the best?

---
    EVIS_BASE_TROLL = (904 + 1012) / 2 + 1413* 5 * 0.03 = 1170 damage
---
    EVIS_TROLL = (1170 * 2 * 0.351724137931 + 1179 * (1 - 0.351724137931)) * 0.65 = 1032 damage

The question stands though, how long is their driveway that they can't day afk and run away and take out the trash?
---
Shouldn't take more than like 1-2 minutes?
---
Most groups would be fine waiting.
---
So, my main will be a druid. Should my alt. be mage or rogue?
---
&gt; I played FPSes since before KB + mouse were a thing.
---
Honestly, this is probably the main problem. If you grew up in the age of Doom being new then you kind of also were in the age of awkward and bizarre control schemes that are not good. But once you get used to arrow keys for turning it's hard to to change. You can still turn with the mouse in auto run either way, but maybe play a bit of CSGO anyway. Worse case is you play a great game for free while waiting for classic, best case is you move better in addition.
---
You can jump down from the balcony several times to kill yourself, then resurrect inside and open the door for your friends. No need to farm the key, since it's a bit expensive too.
---
Oh for sure.
---
That's why I plan to start at 6am - I don't expect the majority of people to take a day off and start playing around that time. Those who do will probably start at midnight (launch time).
---
I was a priest main back in the day that wanted to go shadow, but I ended up going Disc/Holy for vanilla because its honestly not that viable.  Once TBC came out I made the switch.
---
From what I've read, Classic is keeping the original 8 debuff limit at the start of the game, this means that low priority debuffs are essentially bumped off.  Or even worse, one of your debuffs is regarded by the game as high priority and bumps off a debuff your raid wants on.  You will be told not to put on dots for this reason, actually you'll be told not to be Shadow in raids at all for this reason (Onyixia excluded.. MOAR DOTS).
---
Half way through BWL, I think the ZG release, the debuff limit is increased to 16 and Shadow becomes somewhat viable.  But your sole purpose of being allowed in is for the Shadow Weaving debuff to increase the DPS for warlocks.
---
So if you REALLY want to do it, you will need to accept the roll of healer until the ZG patch.  Then ask to be the ONE and only Shadow for the raid.
---
You will also need to have huge stacks of Major Mana pots and Dark Runes to keep your mana up during fights because of how mana intensive Shadow is.
---
If you're dedicated enough to do all that then go for it, but I wouldnt pick my class based on hoping that will all work out, especially if you do not have experience with having done it already in the past.
---
Also I just read your comment on respecing between PVP and PVE.  That wont be viable for long either.  Unless you hit the jackpot and get some rare recipe that the entire server needs and you're rich, the 100g (max cost) to respec will put an end to that dream real quick once you realize how long and hard it is to earn that much gold.
---
Sorry to crush your dreams, but its better to hear it now.
---
Why would this be an issue at all? It's not like we only have a single month to play classic. It's not going anywhere. Everyone else is going to be doing the same things, so it will be slower for sure, but equally slow for everyone. If there was some secret to getting ahead of the pack, the people who know it probably wouldn't share it.
---
I missed that this was PVE specs.
---
I love it, how people hate on each other and their faction. I can't understand why anyone would like to play on a pve server. The faction war IS wow for me.
---
I played alliance in classic and from bc to bfa i played horde, because my friends favored horde.
---
I convinced them, to go alliance this time.
---
Vanilla wow was going through changes. 
---
The entire idea of wow doesnt work without change and content.
---
This! I’m really happy for you. Will be 2+ Great years to come 😊
---
Just communicate with others and be open about the fact that you're new, because it's easier to explain how to do something beforehand rather than after the group has wiped.
---
It's a great dungeon.
---
Btw: the turn keys automatically change to strafe while holding down the right mouse button. I always move with W key and turn my view with the mouse (holding down RMB). A and D become strafe immediately.
---
I don’t care about server first but I want to feel like I’m capable of killing most other players if I don’t make a mistake
---
Would not be that hard to do but would require an addon to export the data
---
Oh god he hauled down that road, should be fun though! Nothing like dying to a large elite mob well leveling lol
---
Epic.
---
Unlikely.
---
I'm sure their analystis can make a better projection than us.
---
Priests are probably the best and highly desired, but Shamans are really good too and will be even more desired as most raids will want to run 6-8.
---
Cant go wrong with either.
---
Thanks for the list!
---
Never! For the Alliance!
---
Not that this game approaches realism in any way.  But I found it more interesting that you had to have a strategy just to walk down a tight upper corridor.  Felt like if you peeked over someone down there spotted you and the whole place was going INTRUDER ALERT.
---
Of course it was just aggro range and potentially not well thought out.  But I like the additional knowledge/strat/challenge/punishment.
---
Yes I will. Played horde in vanilla, want to see Alliance Stuff this time :)
---
This guy pet manages.
---
that's my issue with #nochanges and blizzlike numbers.. it's gonna be sooo damned easy now that we don't have all the hurdles we had back then. It's going to be far TOO easy.
---
It's also probably a hard pill for Blizz to swallow considering a bunch of people would rather play the game they released 15 years ago rather than the updated version.
---
Marketing that fact is tricky.
---
My plan is not to start at 00:00 during the release. but rather go to bed in time and start at 06:00 in the morning. Hopefully there's less people in the starting area by then.
---
And remember to take off all your gear first, no need to pay the repair cost for that.

Everyone... but most won't get past 4hm and down cthun...at first. Then everyone will copy pasta and farm. It's PvE..not rocket science.
---
I'm really looking forward to the wailing caverns. Loved every bit of it. Meeting outside, fighting your way into the instance, and then the dungeon itself. I had so much fun in there, and I have fond memories of my tauren druid twink trying SO hard to get all the set pieces.
---
Aq- 10%, naxx -5%
---
Yeah more like 95%.
---
It really depends on your gear level and skill if you want to succeed in MC with meme specs.  
---
If everyone's got epics already then sure.  Preraid BIS, probably.  Still in a mix of blues and greens, 10 meme specs is going to make some fights pretty hard on your healers.
---
Imagine choosing to play paladin in classic wow. Not only do you know all your specs are going to be potatoes forever. But they also won't have decursive and the pally mod that did blessings. Talk about asking for the worst gameplay ever designed.

Given enough time, I’m sure a large portion would be able to clear it. If TBC launches shortly after though, that would cutoff many people from “doing” naxx
---
BRD is, in my humble opinon, THE quintessential dungeon of any mmorpg. It is just SO well made.
---
Don't worry, as soon as everyone 3 free days expire on the 28th they'll announce that the stress test will be next weekend.
---
I have the same res... the mines at Arathi Basin, no turning to look for both entry points, marvelous.
---
I have seen homes in American movies that look good. But those homes are designed by interior designers. And they look good. No question about that. 
---
The first thing you do is imo add art to a wall. Almost every wall should have some art pieces. 
---
But. I have seen many many homes from ppl from different sub Reddit’s. And I have seen American homes from television series. Obviously some of those “families” are probably considered white trash. But probably not all of them. They living room is basically a big 10 seater brown “sofa”, light coloured carpet and absolutely nothing on the wall but a small shelf for a youth trophy.
---
You think they will launch tbc?
---
Dude same here, I figure I'll probably rock that Bad mojo mask forever on my future troll priest for that witch doctor aesthetic.
---
Doesn’t gear in your bag get damaged as well?
---
Everything is 1.12
---
Thought the key dropped from dead side before barons gate with the abominations
---
I won't check your math but intuitively Troll should give you more net dps than Orc as a rogue as long as autoattacks are a substantial factor in overall DPS (and for rogues they are).
---
The only problem I see is off-hand hit chance and glancing blows, which may actually cause Blood Rage to be superior to Berserking - but you seem to have included that into calculations so if it checks out then it should be all good.
---
Generally speaking Berserking is a flat amount added damage to all attacks and Berserking is % attack damage increase from autos - that means by default that what you gain via Blood Rage is more and more negligible the better gear you have and Berserking provides more and more the better gear you have.
---
Strath is baron, scholo is gandling
---
Dang really? And how will the t3 affect pvp? Will hunter be useless in pvp against all those te ppl? If so, i might consider rolling mage.
---
i regret wasting my time even bothering to explain something to people like you.
---
Bloodfury gives 242 AP @ 60
---
I plan to play for the first 30 hours straight, then play 14 hours straight the next 2 days, followed by 8 hours + for the next month. Trying to hit level 60 as well as play an alt with my girlfriend regularly in the first month. No-lifeing it.
---
I think he's being sarcastic.
---
The end of barrens/post barrens is way better for horde, though. Especially that mid 30-mid 50s bracket. You have such easy access to the best dungeons and many more quests in the available zones.
---
Originally wanted to roll an undead rogue. Ended up making a dwarf rogue because of friends. Definitely undead this time.
---
I think that's just the shortsightedness of the community and some bad timing on Activision-Blizzard's part.  It's probably a great time to invest in them.
---
60 fps you peasant. I'm running 240 fps constant.
---
I really like the Ulduar way of hardmodes. Push a button or something to make the encounter harder and reward better loot. Closest thing to it in vanilla would be the bug trio where the loot and difficulty depends on which bug you kill last. Something similar to that could be cool. 
---
Not in Classic though, we want vanilla and once it's been out for a couple of years they can make something different.
---
Shadow priests are fucked mechanically.  Their 2 main dps tools (SWP and Mind Flay) take up debuff slots and we only have 16.  They don't have any mana recovery tooks (other than runes / pots), and their threat management is bad despite low damage because of mind blast's extra threat modifier.  
---
Also no crit modifier and dot's cant crit so it limits their scalability later.  
---
In fairness, early they can probably contest locks in phase 1 because locks do so poorly due to needing spell hit really badly and having none of it.  But once they get some (ZG drops and they get their pre-BIS otherwise) they will race past Spriests.
---
Troll has Berserking, which when coupled with Improved Mana Burn, can absolutely shut down almost any mana based class in a matter of seconds.
---
Some kind of Survivability Rogue: +Mail Armor, +One handed Axes, +Offhand buckler (I think I read somewhere there were supposed to be real shields and small bucklers in the game but they scrapped that), +Engineering stuff as class spells (bombs, distraction stuff)
---
Well... release in the EU is at midnight and I need to work the next day and I also enjoy sufficient sleep so I‘m not going to be ahead of anyone. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
This kills the classic.
---
I thought the last part of the new deadmines was pretty cool. The way you see yourself 10 years prior killing VC from the perspective of his daughter was pretty cool. And then the pretty difficult gauntlet to Vanessa where you only get one shot.
---
Pretty sure the whole point of the nicker was that it was a large edge not a small one.
---
&gt; Yeah, cause the Marvel properties don’t go R rated ever. Oh wait.
---
Like the fuck are you talking about? We can all read your dumbshit post. Disney Marvel has never gone R. How stupid are you?
---
No, it only increases on your base stats at 60. For a Rogue that's your AGI + STR, which is 127 and 83 for an Orc. That gives you 52.5 AP for 15 seconds.
---
For the rest of us it’s just a joke, no reason to take it this seriously
---
I originally had a mage that I got to 46 and was almost guaranteed a raid spot. Decided rogue was more fun and leveled that from 1-60. 
---
So dumb because I ended up not getting a raid spot in that guild because they had too many rogues. 
---
Was between warlock and mage forever for classic and feel I owe it to myself to do mage.
---
I raided naxx.   And unless your meme specs were already decked out in AQ gear I have a hard time believing you.  Also, Anub'Rehkan, Noth and Patchwerk were all harder than Nef, which I Downed in a guild that got walled on all 3 of those bosses.
---
So many poopsocks have grabbed vacation days there so they can ding 60 in a few days, would be pretty funny to see it all go to waste.
---
One problem. Bloodfury gives more than 52 attack power.
---
We simply don’t know. We can just make best guesses based on the beta and our understanding of their general communication. But practically all those guesses are biased.
---
&gt; Go woke, go broke Disney.
---
So either Disney HASNT gone woke, since they are **insanely** lucrative right now, or wokeness pays. One or the other, but youre still ridiculous for thinking a female or black hero is woke. Go cry elsewhere.
---
lmao way off,  at least 75%
---
Progressing slower and wiping more on earlier bosses because gear is unoptimally distributed is fairly yikes...
---
Bad idea
---
You are going to have more than 210 attack power at 60....
---
I loot everything for the sole fact that +1 copper is +1 copper
---
Yeah, make a priest sacrifice half his healing talents to buff the warlocks, that priest won't be around for long. Just bring a shadowpriest mate.
---
Dwarf Priest still, just be sure to keep the Furlbog disguise up and the Horde will never know!
---
Somethings not quite right.... 
---
ok its legion... but still i liked this one..
---
There is a flat AP modifier that is level-based, I specifically asked a beta tester in the discord that shall not be named regarding this. I only asked about warriors, but from my knowledge all melee physical classes follow it. The formula is not conclusive yet but follows something along the lines of: level 1 = -17, level 40 = 100, level 60 = 160. That is, you should add a flat 160 attack power to the base AP for a level 60 character.
---
Its manual crowd pummeler, items dropping in Gnomer with 3 uses, wich increaes attack speed iirk
---
it hurts but it is most likely true :-/
---
Your character grows in power you can feel, not just bigger numbers. Cant wait.
---
I gotta find this "Ol' Turric" Mountains zone - I don't remember that from vanilla, but if this guy says there are cool rares there, I'm gonna look for them.
---
You think you do but you dont
---
If you think Bloodfury only gives 52 ap at level 60. You're high
---
Melee warlock is the greatest meme spec.
---
You can rez through the door in scholo.
---
What the actual fuck lol
---
bad idea because you would split up the Player base.
---
Also very unlikely because Blizzard is ~~stingy as fuck~~ cheap when it comes to server costs...
---
Exactly
---
I think the trash packs before and after Twin Emps will be the new Vael. Modern raiders really shouldn't have any problems with BWL. But I've seen guild after guild on private servers explode on the Anubisaths and CT trash. AQ in general is a horrible raid without good tanks.
---
if you have interest in healing but are intimidated, then start with 5-man dungeon healing as you're leveling. It's not that hard and you can get comfortable healing.
---
Truly .. here I am enjoying the game and then my tank is "Dundermifflin" hell naw breh.. get outa here with all that.
---
As far as I know from my 14 year old cousin, WoW is very appealing for him and they are not happy with monetization. Problem is, they dont really get to choose different games. He wont be playing due to money however
---
Okay, now that is some solid proof. Before I begin my adjustments, can you help me confirm that a BIS Combat Dagger Rogue will have roughly 600 base Attack Power?
---
I'm using this spreadsheet, including buffs from consumables: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#
---
The gear adds up to 80 Strength and 245 Agility.
---
More often than not it's mistakes that cause a wipe. 20% extra dps from a retri won't prevent Billy Geddonbomb from blowing up the raid. The only real dps checks are Ouro, Patch and Sapphiron.
---
TBH, levels 20 to 40 don't have really huge differences. It's at level 40 where you get shadow form (you probably know from private servers). And another interesting build out there is a Holy Nova build where you can attempt to be an AOE mage :D
---
I as well leveles up several priests on private servers and as soon as I got 5/5 Imroved Wand I went all out in Shadow tree.
---
Because your rep with players doesnt matter any more. In Classic if you are shitty to other players, people wont invite you to groups. Really looking forward to seeing the same set of players as I level and gear up again.
---
nothin wr0ng with trolls. they have the best hair styles and mounts in the game. and the tusks are awesome
---
Sadly it's racials with a follow up to animations.
---
I'm a spike, and I don't care who knows it..
---
Where is the list ?
---
PvE professions for mage/lock for the crafted robe and bloodvine set bonus.
---
depends on many things. If you like casters, go mage. If you like melee, go rogue. If you want to play a different role, then pick whichever is more different from your druid. If you'll focus on balance/resto, then go rogue. If you're going to go feral, then go mage.
---
Why would the tank want cloth and leather with int and SP? OP's boomkin, not feral
---
Probably already had a flatscreen before WoW even released...
---
The obviously delayed the stress test so that people couldn't use their free 3 day pass for it. 
---
The passes expire on the 28th so we'll get an announcement on the 29th that the stress test will be next weekend.
---
Mage class call, specifically.
---
Dude... Do yourself a favor. Have a nice calming cup of chamomile tea, take a shower, and just be patient for the next 30 days
---
Yes.
---
they didn't mention Classic release on their earnings report because they're \*prepared\* for Classic to make them zero extra dollars. That's WHY they didn't include an added cost in order to play it
---
in case you haven't been on classic private servers, or, well...you captured it nicely in your last paragraph, what it was like launch day and launch week
---
expect that. anticipate that. be unsurprised by it. assume it will be part of the experience
---
If anyone still have a premium account at warcraftmovies, they can view my contribution :D.
---
https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=22099
---
If anyone could reopload that movie I would be ever so thankful. Havent seen it 2006 :). Would be awsome to see what 16 year old me created, one more time :)
---
It's not that the newer generation doesn't play MMOs anymore, they still play plebty of them in more modern iterations. It's just that MMO**RPG**s aren't that big anymore. There are also far better non-shooter PvP options nowadays compared to the mid-late 2000s, which is why athe majority play WoW primarily for PvE. And if you're not into PvE your best bet is being into collectables and WoW has more than plenty of those. WoW PvP is fine on the casual side but going hardcore on it will probably get you more annoyed than anything else.
---
FFXIV for example focuses primarily on PvE and collectables/housing and has PvP as a little side note and is currently thriving with the new expansion. Imagine that game's gear progression akin to Cataclysms token and points system.
---
Anyway, nobody really can tell how Classic will far and bow many people it will attract. There is currently some discord in the modern WoW community about patches being basically seasons due to gear inflation and too much rng, which in addition to BFA being sub-par at best (except for raide, they are pretty damn good) made many people jump ship, hoping for either Classic or switching to FFXIV for more static and linear gear progression as well as meaningful content outside of raids. Or they completely left the genre.
---
 Classic won't be **as** financially successful for activision blizzard for three reasons. 
---
1. No shop and no character services.
---
2. No WoW token. The token helped reducing illegal gold selling but is also always a profit for Blizzard, since a lot of people pay their sub with tokens, which have to be bought by the seller for 20 bucks, 7 more than the sub costs in europe.
---
3. The monthly sub is shared with modern WoW and stays the same price as far as we know, meaning from ActBli's point of view we get two games for the price of 13€ a month. Doesn't matter if you play both of them or only one.
---
That's a shame. If you can kill Razorgore the rest of BWL is more or less a cakewalk. Chromaggus can be annoying, but apart from that it's fairly smooth sailing.
---
That is not NECESSARILY the way it HAS to be, and it was not the way of classic dungeons.
---
You only need NS from resto as a FC though
---
Oh I will be here. Just bring your popcorn.
---
I didn't spend 90% of the fight AFK. Dunno about you.
---
You didn't mention bloodvine in your post, maybe you're thinking of another post you made? :) 
---
Robe of the Void is prebis for locks until you get bloodvine at which point you still need tailoring for the set bonus. Mages can replace bloodvine for T2.5 and warlocks wear it until T3 and Leggings of Polarity.
---
The Icecrown Citadel dungeons were actually pretty challenging, I remember struggling on Halls of Reflection especially.
---
Yeah, but the amount who have done it on pservers now that will be able to walkthrough others who haven't will be a huge influence on not just naxx content, but all content leading up to naxx, allowing a top down effect to occur leading to more mc-bwl-aq20-aq40 clears, which will mean more naxx ready raiders.
---
a feeling isn't 'true' for anybody but the person 'feeling' it
---
granted, if you play on a PvE server and actively avoid talking to or engaging with anybody else...you may find it boringn
---
but that's you choosing to make your experience boring\\
---
Your MT just died, no one else can pick the boss, paladins just start to bubble / earthstone, saying "sorry guys, can't afford the repairs!" and slowly in your brain a foolish idea is born... what if I had a druid battle rez to save the day!
---
Druids deserve love too!  
---
As a horde player, I would even say, druids deserve love but paladins don't!
---
They are cloth so that everybody can use them.
---
The fuck you got against the greatest paper company there ever was?  Do you even know how paper is made? Its not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace do you know what would happen? You’d ruin it.
---
On mechanics fights where they keep dying?
---
i think you could make a guild based on that system, but it might be time consuming to explain the entire new system to every person you talk to interested in joining your guild
---
Oh yeah this was for classic, it's probably more auto-attack based in there than in retail. I didn't play shaman back then so I'm not sure (played Warlock in Vanilla).
---
They want money so i doubt it. Plus making new servers fir people to xfer to can generate revenue as well if they don’t offer free xfers.
---
Not really sure what people expect them to say, they could do a "We are fine and doing well :)" message but personally I just assume thing are going according to plan and if that's isn't the case we will probably find out when name reservations are scheduled to start.
---
If seperate TBC servers would kill the seperate Classic servers it would have happened whenever a half-decent TBC private server released.
---
Jesus this reminds me of the gamers copypasta, spending so much time analyzing for something like 10 dps in difference.
---
remember, kids...if you're playing alone, that means you have no friends
---
What does dying have to do with the spec?
---
I'm in a similar situation; with up to 4 hours a week I plan to reach 60 in a few months (probably not even in phase 2). I then wish to join either a casual Friday guild or Friday night's PUG and collect my tier1. I love the fact the servers will stay up for a long time and no TBC is planned, I would like to take my time to reach my goals.
---
Fair enough. Thanks.
---
Melees can't hit you if they can't reach you.
---
[This post really nails how BWL is the first reality check in Vanilla WoW.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs6mxw/gather_around_vanilla_newbies_let_me_warn_you/)
---
It talks about the convergence between mechanics-fights, memespecs, guild psychology, and DPS-check fights like Vael.
---
thats so true, but so not helpful for my decisionmaking xD - but maybe i go holy for the versatility; faster heals can come in Handy in instances
---
golden rule: nothing you do will entirely ruin WoW Classic, but every choice you make (including your mindset) will affect your experience
---
I play Tauren cuz they big and go smash.
---
No lol maybe if you are FC in pugs or bracket 3 premades and besides in my post all I said was that feral and ret dps specs can't pvp and you cannot dps as 0-30-21
---
Maybe. I do think that is an extremely likely scenario. Probably 100% what’s going to happen. But I wouldn’t be surprised if the opposite happened. When a lot of our servers rang the aq gong most of the serious guilds were decked out in T2 and it’s not like we didn’t eventually know the strats. The knowledge was out there, videos where up, guides where out. cthun was just fucking hard. But then again now players have better computers and these retail raid encounters are some pretty intense shit. So it’s very likely people will just scoff and roll over it.
---
Why should I let it go when I'm clearly right? You keep repeating yourself, but what you say isn't what OP asked for. 
---
We get it, you understand the literal meaning of what a loot ninja is - congratulations. That is just not what OP ask for, he wants to know when people consider it to be ninja looting  - in other words, he wants to know how the *decision is made*.
---
Just find another thread to be useless in.
---
I agree if they actively fight against gold selling.
---
If farmers spawns everywhere and you get /w for gold every 5 minutes then it's the lesser evil
---
Elemental Druid
---
Can spec/choose elements while in various animal forms which gives it different abilities per element per form
---
Most of the people who wants to clear it, and put in some effort, will end up clearing most of it
---
But if we are talking about the total amount of players TRYING classic, then it will be pretty low, because only a lowish amount will likely reach 60 at all, because they quit the game before. Naxx is also 1.5 years away, so thats even more players quitting
---
So the % of ALL players trying classic will be pretty low, but the % of players who are trying, will be pretty high
---
Your like me. and im rolling druid. You bascially just described a druid
---
I doubt I'll be grinding for r12 though. I figured the blues might be worth going for, as they are available earlier in the PvP rank grind.
---
Thanks for the info though, will do.
---
yeah, goddess forbid players get together and, as a community, populate the world
---
(protip: the reason why going out as a team and murdering zombies in EPL won't be as fun now as it was fifteen years ago...is because you've been doing it for fifteen years)
---
no negative resistance does not work in patch 1.12
---
it's harder because you can't exactly predict what kind of playstyle different from your main class will best cover up whatever burnout you accumulated in getting your main to sixty
---
Lol im not sure how that makes me a r tard because im curious if im going to be able to play on the 26th instead of 27th because i live in NA.
---
nnnope
---
I hope the ST class quest are in very nice.
---
I've played Horde so many times in vanilla and on pservers.
---
While I did level once up to level 58 on Alliance, it still feels fresh to me.
---
In Classic, I plan to mainly play Alliance and to also have some Horde alts on another server, in case I feel nostalgic (and to finally level a Shaman past 30 :) )
---
Pre-*raid* bis? "Prebis" makes zero sense.
---
The big issue with Wyvern sting isn’t really that it’s only usable in combat. Traps too are combat bound. The thing horrible about Wyvern sting is its 3 min CD, making it almost useless in PvP. Actually I’m not even certain if it was 3 or 5 minutes, I remember testing the spec and finding WS just unusable in most scenarios when it could be needed in battlegrounds.
---
Its really nice, but not horde
---
It was fairly common for the spirit based healers to take mana breaks. You sorta 'rotated' healers, rather than just all pump at the same time and then all go oom.
---
He could've wanded for sure. And definitely should've.
---
These days you pump consumables, and a Nefarian fight is like 5 minutes long, instead of 15.
---
Hunter, Druid and Mage are all incredible casual classes, because they are all very solo friendly. 
---
It's not about damage power imo. I think being able to solo stuff is casual friendly, because if you play maybe twice a week, you want to do stuff and not search for a party everytime. 
---
The difference however between hunter and druid vs the mage is, that the skill or the deep knowledge of the class is very noticeable in these classes, compared to the mage. 
---
We had this incredible hunter on the server and the difference between him and anyone else was huge.
---
You expecting blizzard to be as prepared for classic launch as they are for an expansion? Because I’m definitely not. They seem to be wilfully wanting it to be a minor thing, like it’s more of a server hazard than an income
---
heh, yeah
---
i \*guarantee\* that your experience on a PvP realm, or on an RP realm, will not be my experience
---
but i guess that's why one of us assumes responsibility for crafting the community experience they want to see on their server...and one of us needs a new server type 'just for them'
---
Yea, but its a pain in the ass doing it as Alliance.
---
I'd argue Horde do it much more frequently than Alliance. Just based on my experience, though.
---
Why didn't TBC private servers kill Classic private servers?
---
you will never appease everyone
---
I guarantee that, after fifteen years of writing the book on 'long lasting, profitable MMO greatness', that's one lesson Blizzard learned.
---
You aren't talking about individual players being indecisive...you're talking about 'the playerbase in general' being indecisive. But that's the point. We're individuals, not the Borg.
---
I want to raid MC, BWL, ZG and AQ20. 
---
But I'm not so sure about AQ40 and Nax, because they both are more time consuming and I don't know if I can and want to invest that time.
---
Honestly it's crazy how much ping and PC power handicapped us. I feel Vanilla WoW was really ahead of its time, I guess proof of it is people wanting to play it on 2019.
---
I can't wait to put my hand on it once more! Thanks for sharing the video!
---
Probably got confused. I know I was for a long while about that one
---
He's referring to you not being aware of how timezones work. I wouldn't say that necessarily makes you retarded but it definitely means you ain't the sharpest tool in the shed, mate. : P
---
The Pro Druid Fake News needs to stop.
---
prepare for being bombarded with requests to tank dungeons every time you log in
---
there will still be fun after a month, if you can find it
---
Lucky for me I work off hours, so I usually get to play in the 9-5 slot. Less players online, less competition (outside of those on vacation). I'll probably just grind mobs if the starting area is too over run.
---
...and none of the people whose comments inspired this vaguepost will ever read this or post here.
---
Thanks, definitely will farm this guy.
---
they do it to reserve names
---
And who said i dont know how time zones work? Because i didnt think about it before i posted which i even mentioned and if its gonna be playable for NA on aug 26 pretty sure my question was pretty valid.
---
it's not about 'need'
---
it's about each guild leader choosing how (and if) to delegate guild leadership as they see fit
---
Judging by the stress test starter zone experience I don't think it will be that bad. It was bearable and fun being around so many players for a change!  
---
I've got my 1 - 10 route down to a T. My 10 - 20 isn't too bad, still need to run it more so its memorized better.  
---
Once I hit 22 its AoE time, might jump into dungeons if it transpires the hype about AoE dungeon grinding being fast AF is true.
---
And coffee ofc. ALL the coffee.
---
But... Mythic+!
---
To be honest, any of the classes are at a huge disadvantage in t2 against a full t3 geared player (pvp). So this should not affect your decision between hunter and mage.
---
Btw huge disadvantage does not mean its impossible to kill a t3 player. Especially in wpvp as a hunter. Some classes may not even be able to touch you and in that case gear doesnt really matter.
---
Calling balance druid damaging a "nuke" is very cute :3
---
vagueposting about topics that annoy me but which I lack the guts to respond to individually...part 90000!
---
&gt; It affects your reputation to roll on main spec items? :D
---
A leather rolling on cloth while a cloth-wearer is in the party will absolutely lower your reputation.
---
That's only if you zone in through the service entrance. If you get inn from the main entrance you'll find him going right at the first fork and clearing some trash.
---
Tell her to roll a night elf
---
Another alcoholic as well :)
---
I won't have enough time to lvl 2 chara to 60. So it's even more important to choose the right class from the start.
---
I am considering Hunter, Mage, (s)Priest.
---
Biggest negative point for me: 
---
Hunter: Dps drop off
---
Mage: Have to play Gnome.... (i have to play ally because of friends and i hate human, even more than gnomes)
---
(S) Priest: Mana issues and lack of mobility
---
&gt;From my experience on private servers: Was in groups that didnt talk much at all, met the occasional "you guys are useless Im the only guy with skill here"-rage nerd, met a group of drunken guys which turned into "we might need 3h for DM" mainly because people were more busy cracking jokes than actual fighting and also met a group who were just doing really well and kept explaining tactics for rooms.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;had fun in all of them. I know the gear gets obsolete a few levels later anyways and the exp sucks compared to questing. I was just in it for some group play/breaking up questing.
---
Same here.
---
The only thing she’s ever done is the Pandaren starting area in a 20 minute demo at PAX, so it’s up to me to guide her through it!
---
Sure. 
---
Mish'undare (1% hit)  
---
Cloak of Consumption (1% hit)  
---
Bracers of Arcane Accuracy (1% hit)  
---
Bloodvine Legs (2% hit)  
---
Ringo's Blizzard Boots (1% hit)  
---
Band of Forced Concentration (1% hit)  
---
Neltharion's Tear (2% hit)  
---
The above set leaves you at 9%, however if you insist on capping at 10% I'd opt for Jindo's Bag of Whammies or the Hit/SP ring from ZG, depending on your existing ring and OH.
---
Here we go, https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/2
---
Shows a github for a pserver docoumenting bloodfury from a vanilla video showing a gain of 282 attack power, so enough that it has to be counting all modifiers but flat attack power.
---
I heard that a lot of progress raiders stopped tryn that hard, because tbc was around the corner.
---
Affliction lock isn't a thing look into how warlock works. Not trying to be a prick just want you to be informed
---
He got a blister on the finger he used for AoeE.
---
5 minutes afk? What are you? A casual?
---
We only know the details of servers for EU. There will be English, French, German and Russian servers, although Russians will be isolated on their own client for reasons.
---
I guess "soon" we will know the details on the NA servers.
---
Ehm, it's clearly midichlorians bruh
---
Jeah thats true, my heart knows i should play hunter, my brain on the other hand is a litl bitch who can't commit to a class.
---
I may hope they won’t make the same mistake they did 15 years ago. Which is releasing expansion packs several years too soon.
---
I quit first patch of bfa but still managed to do +11 before I quit. (and all of heroic Uldir, + first boss mythic)  
---
Retail PvE is certainly not faceroll, but its difficult in other ways than vanilla. Things like timers and tons of "skillshots" to dodge, its more like an intense action game, twitchy and requires some quick reactions. Its certainly more fast paced.  
---
Vanilla is harder in other ways. Like finding 39 other people to raid with. Some dungeons taking forever, hard to recover from leavers, which happens in pugs if you wipe too much. (in retail too, but there you dont lose as much time, you just go again with a new key)
---
No. And no copying; that doesn’t make any sense at all
---
Holy shit people are overanalyzing everything to have to most optimal outcome possible. If you are gonna play rogue, you gon be undead
---
Instead, they will introduce loot boxes for retail
---
Yeah.  
---
Played Alliance in Vanilla and TBC, only to change to Horde in WOTLK. Then back to Alliance through cata, mists, legion and BFA.  
---
Will be going horde now, since most of my current social circle rolls horde. And rolling horde this time will give me a good mix of nostalgia, and sense of trying new things.
---
We are talking about Vael. Vaels mechanics consist of doing max dps and if you get burning adrenaline run out of the raid before you explode.
---
There are very few fights, where tanks can exceed a dps players dps.
---
I'm not eliminating it completely. There's a 5% hard cap, which I use in my calculations.
---
I don't think you want 20.000 logged in at the same time, that's 7-10 times more then the game was designed for. In terms of total server population 20-30.000 active accounts was not uncommon in Vanilla, with the cap being around 50.000.
---
It'll be a common occurrence, unfortunately. I don't think there's much Blizz wants/can do about it.
---
It is not really 'advanced' but something that people foten forget  (all classes). Run in on the tank so you can be ready to engage the fight ASAP to not lose uptime as you dont have a gap closer like warriors/rogues/ferals. BUT be careful if the tank asks for treath early you might overaggro if you get a Command procc and double crit.
---
Arthas killed mankriks wife before leaving to northrend
---
I'm looking forward to Sunken Temple and Maraudon, because I don't remember one single thing about them. I could explain you every other dungeon, but those two are just erased from my memory. I don't even remember how Sunken Temple looks like. From Maraudon a remember the wall textures at least. And the drop into the pool at the beginning and the princess at the end.  Everything in between ...nothing.
---
You forgot the ‘sorry if it’s been announced but is there a update on language specific servers’....... why people wait for Reddit replies when they can search on google and get an instant answer
---
Class quests?
---
A flat screen even so!
---
Oh shit, Adrenaline Rush and Blood Fury are on the GCD. But oddly, Troll Berserking is not. I also did not remember that Berserking costs 10 Energy. Back to the board after a much needed break.
---
No? Which dungeon would that be?
---
the whole "25 different difficulties" for the same dungeon, does water down the experience somewhat, and make it so players dont "have" to be any good, to complete it.  
---
The bottom difficulty is higher in vanilla, which is why tank skill becomes a larger factor for the majority of groups, whereas in retail you cant really fail unless you willingly enter harder difficulties.
---
Mage. Not gear dependent. One, if not the best, scaling class in the game. You should only lose  to Locks on PvP. A lot of spots in raids. Easy to find 5man groups because everyone wants a Mage for food/water, hard CC and a free portal when the dungeon is over.
---
Why dwarf would be best for warrior ? Like prot with stone shield racial ?
---
Did the ogre elite quest in loch modan a few days back. Had 3 Mages and a priest. Initially I was worried this would be hard without a tank, but between 3 sheeps/frostnovas it was really easy. We just CCed everything, nuked the ogres down and when one came to close it got nova'd.
---
The chain in Badlands for the Skull of Impending Doom https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4984/skull-of-impending-doom
---
\*wouldn't be best...?
---
True but you should reply to the guy who brought that data into this discussion not the one who is currently examining it then.
---
Wouldn't go as fare as saying it's tinfoil hat crazy to say that they delayed the final worldwide stress test because it conflicted with a promotion for retail.
---
I'm not say he is right, but of all the theories about why it was delayed this is nowhere near the top of the crazy list.
---
That is in no way the same scenario.
---
If Classic split it means around half of all servers leave, if not more. Now classic is either a bunch of ghost towns or they require a lot of merging. Either way, the community has just been completely ruined.
---
Not saying I'm for or against it, but it is clear that splitting it like that will cause quite a lot of changes to the community.
---
Hmm never thought about that. Id actually like, if they would relese tbc and wotlk, given enough time inbetween. And im talking at least 2 years.
---
Yup and I'm fine with that so the natural response would be "shit, my bad, I didn't think about the time zones" but he doubled down claiming it's a normal thing to forget about time zones being a thing and it doesn't make him look dumb, which makes him look even dumber IMO... : P
---
Most people will be doing AQ40. On private servers there's weekly pugs doing AQ40 and if you look around in cities almost every 60 has some T2.5 gear minus the players who recently hit 60. 
---
Naxx is a lot harder especially Construct. I'd say eventually after a few months 60-70% of the population will clear most of Naxx but not all of it.
---
Thanks for posting.  Hearing the coms really brings back memories of what BWL progression was really like
---
Lol pretty much every good oldschool video maker has been mentioned in the comments... except the king; Vurtne 1-4
---
If the sub is the problem you should totally pay his sub for him so you can play together :)
---
Cataclysm dungeons were also pretty brutal in the first patch, at least for pugs. You needed cc on most mob groups, and could wipe multiple time on harder bosses. I think it took me 5 tries to find a group with the patience to clear Stonecore.
---
This is a great feeling, but try not to take it so hard when after the 2 month honeymoon phase, you'll lose interest.
---
(Ofc it depends on how hard you go so could be longer)
---
I just don't see the average player pushing to clear raids after doing MC, dungeons and professions.
---
This isn't a post to say "lol classic will be dead so fast"
---
It's to reinforce that LAUNCH and the first couple of months will be the BEST time of Classic WoW.
---
Sure some people might say getting Thunderfury or r14 - that's a small portion of players and I don't see those achievements as grandiose as they were 15 years ago.
---
So I hope you all cherish launch, we are so close :)
---
Warrior weapon from quest there is OP
---
Cataclysm heroics were quite challenging at the start too. Actually had to cc stuff and know mechanics.
---
I'm very anti social so this is one of the few things about Classic I'm not looking forward to.
---
Yeah, he did say it's on midnight for *Europe*, right? : D
---
I always played alliance so I actually feel like I've missed quite a few dungeons because they were "horde".
---
I am considering focusing on completing a few of those dungeons this time around. Like Shadowfang Keep, Ragefire Chasm and Wailing Caverns.
---
Shadow weaving isn't a good reason to take a Spriest to a raid.  Why waste a whole priest when you can just waste a few talent points?
---
A healy priest can pickup shadoweaving.
---
Won't be here anymore when the game comes out LOL
---
Nostalgic for some (they won't last long).
---
Overall classic represents the most full form of WoW, for too many reasons to list.
---
A couple things are, no flying, not every class does the same exact role, professions actually do something, buffs actually do something.
---
I'm sure you will find yourself at work browsing Reddit or sharing something interesting that happened.
---
50% of humans are below average
---
What the data tells us little as its way tot random to read into what is occurring.
---
True, omegalul - anyone that's on reddit for the first 2 months of launch is weirdchamp.
---
Poggers.
---
*retired
---
And this place is tolerable for passing the time but I'm actively choosing for it to not be a part of my game Community experience
---
I quite enjoy tanking and it's tough to have two lives in WoW, so while I've decided I'm going Warlock first, I'm afraid it might imply I won't really get to do much with the warrior.
---
You know what the answer will be
---
Late in this video there are a chapter for sword progression for both horde and alliance.  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkawrueQYXU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkawrueQYXU)
---
The game doesn't autoplay, you're actually required to be engaged in the content and the more time you put into it the more the game gives you back.
---
Game has content that requires you to think outside of just deciding which skills to use and when to move away from AoE, like deciding where to travel, as you'll spend a lot of time just moving around, money being an actual problem etc.- the world simply feels much more alive (hence *World* of Warcraft).
---
Mish'undare doesn't have hit. The bloodvine legs only give 1%, but including the off hand is 8 and with zg enchant that's cap.
---
However your boots+ring+off hand+ River of the archmage give
---
47int 28sta 119sp 3hit 1crit
---
If you go bloodvine chest+feet (you already have legs) AV frost offhand +mindtear band you get:
---
44int 6sta 102sp 3hit 3crit
---
From a dps perspective you're trading off 2% crit for 3 int and 17sp. At BWL level when you have in the ballpark of 450-500 spell power that's not a good trade, the 2% crit is far more valuable.
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
Select Patchwerk and Paladin. The two 1200 dps logs from Mourtagh are spelladin. However we can expect spelladin dps to suffer a bit due to differences between classic and pservers, so I went with a more conservative estimate of 900-1100.
---
Of course there is a [www.fraps.com](https://www.fraps.com) water mark. I love it!
---
80% of private server players don't clear naxx lol. On my server 5 horde guilds killed KT.
---
Botting in classic is one of the things I am concerned about. Hopefully modern infrastructure has what it takes to deal with it.
---
I'm sure it's still going to be repetitive, but with different things. That's just reddit. I'm predicting many screenshots with "It's good to be back", Level ding photos, "Look I got my first mount finally", etc.
---
If he's new to WoW then your answer doesn't provide him anything he can use - he doesn't know how those things changed WoW and can't relate to that.
---
Just relax, enjoy your family, your pets, your lawn and patiently wait 30 days as life takes your by the hand
---
Gluth gothik patchwerk loatheb 4hm sapphiron (especially this) are the main humps for differing reasons.
---
&gt; I want to make sure she feels well-informed and powerful as we level  
---
&gt;She doesn’t seem interested in topping DPS meters or pwning n00bs in PvP
---
Those two kind of conflict. I actually had my girlfriend start playing GW2 a while back and honestly, the biggest thing I learned was to stop trying to teach her everything. She just did not care. You might think she needs to be well-informed and all that, but unless she asks for help, just let her play like she wants to. If she doesn't want to top DPS meters or own in PvP, then that means she literally don't care about doing well. She cares about having fun. You looking over her shoulders as some coach will most likely do more harm than good.
---
Seriously, just teach her how to send her pet into combat and how an auto attack timer works. It isn't really rocket science, once she knows those two let her use what spells she thinks are fun. If she likes to overuse arcane shot, let her. She is having fun and keeps playing WoW with you and honestly, what does it matter? She doesn't care for topping DPS.
---
I agree it's up to your guild etc but just on point of fact "optimal" is not subjective but "viable" is.
---
its leddit, nothing is going to improve
---
I support this message.
---
It's funny how you can say "classic represents the most full form of WoW', proceed to list a number of things it *doesn't* have, yet still be right lol
---

---
time traveler
---
Dungeons during levelling were much harder in Vanilla sure, but m+ dungeons are the hardest dungeons the game has ever had.
---
the quest swords from doing SM and RFD are good for 30's/early 40's, Thrash blade from Mara is good for mid 40's into late 50's. Those are the big ones I would say.
---
Same, it wasn't Christmas and I didn't get it as a child, more like a teenager but yeah I haven't felt that level of excitement towards a videogame in a long long time. Too sad I start my first job on September 1st but until then it will be pure joy:)
---
Lmao
---
Wat? Why isn't that a thing?
---
gold doesnt just appear in thin air.
---
I would go horde but I'm playing a paladin so I have no choice.
---
They were never considered the best PVE rogue race for horde tho. It has always been Troll, same for Hunters :)
---
Getting 40 people to spread and rotate on cthun will not be possible for 'everyone'. Loads of people won't be arsed farming NR for huhu and this wont be able to do viscidous especially on alliance.
---
I wouldnt want them to change anything in Wrath. That was the most fun i had in WoW.
---
I'm in a complicated position where I really want to tank and raid, however,  my worl schedule means that one night every 3 weeks I'll be working late and as such cant raid, which realistically means I cant tank ,right ?
---
You think you want it but u dont
---
Yeah, no to TBC. Vanilla *only*
---
Resto druid from tbc that is the exact same but doesn't have tree form walking slowly and hiding your armour you work so hard to get.
---
As an American who recently moved to Scandinavia: no, we do not, and holy crap, it does.
---
do what you want and have fun
---
Nothing.  If they change something then it wouldn't be classic.
---
Missing the Hunter Scatter + Trap
---
The Deadmines hc runs were brutal af since it wasn't designed like most recent ones and had lots of pats and clumped up packs. Groups didn't even get to the first boss before disbanding.
---
Depend on how will work BG. If we get match against other country no way I'm playing on french server. French loose every BG.
---
farming in classic would be extremely profitable since only 2 classes can actually make decent gold. Cant wait for theprofits
---
Ulduars Hard Modes were perfectly done though imo. Things in the fight to increase difficulty and reward.
---
Hhaahah omg i didnt think anyone else did this! I even had to get my friends to log onto my account once because i got stuck in Dalaran at like 6pm peak time and couldn't even log on without getting disconnected
---
Same in Norway. And yes. We still moan. Sad really. But it’s all relative I guess.
---
He was easy to avoid, as you want to run outside the road to kill mobs on the way anyways. 
---
Son of arugal on the other hand... that fucker.
---
I'm pretty sure missing one day every 3 weeks will be alright lol.
---
No shit, this one was in but I threw it out for the tips for new players, because they've been here for months and the marketing posts started to show up daily just lately
---
Yep, I love game launches. :) Sadly, I don't think I'll have anyone to share this one, but I could still get the beer, haha.
---
TBC was mostly fine.
---
The reward system in WotLK would need to be changed and all raids would need to difficult adjusted, all dungeons would need the difficult greatly increased, and many of the QoL changes would need to be removed.
---
That's incorrect.

---
You and me both, brother. You and me both.
---
Same here, this was the peak of WoW for me, and although I'm really hyped for classic, nothing would make me happier than being able to relive through Wrath, but this time not as a complete noob who just started playing WoW at 14 years old with no clue what to do. The only downside about it is that I most likely won't be able to re-experience the OPness that was DeathKnights in 3.0 and 3.1, as we'll most likely get a 3.3.X patch, but I'd probably be playing MM hunter anyway, I miss that version of the spec the most.
---
Duplicating gold? What are you talking about? The gold has to be farmed by someone, there's no getting around that. You can't magically create it.
---
isn't the point of B-I-N-G-O to have a 5x5 card?
---
At least we had Halls of Reflection, one of the most fun dungeons ever for a tank.
---
Wait whaaat? And now you will tell me they didn't call it WORLD of Warcraft because it's about World PvP?
---
I  demand Pendulum Servers. The only thing you do is clear Uldaman until the Pendulum of Doom drops.
---
Its callee the Pavlog dog theory or something. Basically the dog anticipating eating starts drooling and the anticipation is the most exiting part.
---
"where we needed 3 battle resses"  It happen often in progression especially with the long cool down.
---
For gear, well for tanking, prot warrior and druid almost don't share any common gear so you can gear both faster. For dps, well again there's a few pieces that nobody else really want but i was mostly fine with getting dps gear last since i was tanking the majority of the time. With mainly dungeon gear, and some raid gear i was able to do some decent dps when i switched (was about middle of the pack).
---
well said.
---
I asked myself the same question (just with priest as the other option): Can I gear that guy for PvP in a reasonable time as a casual player/raider, competing against 6+/- other shamans?
---
I think it's gonna be not easy. Hunters can vear pretty fast and have access to a pretty strong set and weapon early. So p1/2 should be really good for hunters that have a raiding spot for MC/Ony. 
---
I ultimatelly decided to just go for the class I like the most and worry about gear later.
---
Is it? I think I'v seen 3x3 Bingo, but you may be right.
---
I think a 5x5 card with 25 fields would've been too much for daily posts though
---
Norway is a rich country. No doubt about it. We are privileged for sure. One thing we lack is a strong military. 
---
Source for the poor in the US is basically too much to link. It’s well known. I guess it’s a result of a focus on the military might of US.
---
Oh, yeah. Knew I missed something.
---
Checked his other encounters as well and they are actually quite impressive. The more you know!
---
They probably wouldn't have to change a thing to get me to play TBC and Wrath. I loved both of them.
---
I'd definitely prefer to see flying cut. As much as I love flying, I personally think it was bad for the long-term game. Hindsight is funny like that.
---
For Wrath, I'd like to see LFD go, or at least ditch cross-realm and as much automation as possible.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Atlas has maps I believe, should be availible on launch
---
WARCRAFT.. wait is this game related to Warcraft 3? OH MY GOD.. is Warcraft 3 related to 2 and 1???????
---
Sure mate. Meanwhile my entire guild from vanilla probably bought hundreds of thousands of gold collectively just so we could stay in competition with the rest of the world first guilds and none of us got banned for it, I suppose you claim that we were all super lucky all 50 of us? We got plenty of warnings though but they were always more on a "think of the people who get their accounts hacked" kind of level.
---
You are dead anyway when tank got his threat resetted.
---
It doesn't proof it scales
---
This is TBC but my lock CC was insane in mechanaar.
---
Banish on one, seduction on another, fear ping-pong on a third. We could take 4 elites with just one person CCing. Ahh good times.
---
Might want to check your facts there bud. Viewership for both the Uldir and BoD races was huge. Over 5 million viewer hours and 200k concurrent viewers. This is definitely something Blizzard is interested in.
---
Literally maybe saw this spec twice in the last two years of playing vanilla. Wouldn’t say it’s popular. Everyone plays frost. For good reason. And those who don’t, play ele, not PoM. We’re not in 2005 anymore.
---
It’s inevitable, basically zero development costs and guaranteed subs for 2 more years. Remember that tbc was more popular than vanilla.
---
Have you seen the numbers it's pulling on Twitch? Wow peaked at around 200-250k for one of the previous world firsts, that's unheard of for Wow since forever?
---
Maybe, maybe hes just rambling some incoherent dribble. We will never know, because whos gonna check :D ?
---
Meh. The 40s are pretty even and 50+ alliance is way better.
---
I don't feel attacked, I feel like I've been brutally murdered.
---
Care to explain why Seal of Righteousness does procs in Classic Beta now?! 
---
"But yeah 2.1 is TBC" .
---
&gt; Did we still need a key to get into scholomance in patch 1.12?
---
You only need a key to open the door. Which someone else, even from another group or even faction, can do for you.

Those raids is definetly pugable mate.
---
How are they delaying the release?
---
TL:DR; OP got wrecked.
---
Can’t wait to be on the receiving end of all this abuse
---
Yes, I know. My point is that that no matter when a TBC server released and no matter how good or bad it was it did not kill any of the vanilla p-servers' populations.
---
I think you misunderstood me.
---
But hey, keep slinging your schoolyard insults.

I did the same, my gpu tended to overheat, so I put a bag of peas onto it. Actually worked quite well for half a year
---
What why wouldn't you be able to no-life?
---
No-lifing has to always be compared to your Situation. 
---
Let's say you work 10 hours. Have 5 hours with Family, eating, getting ready etc. - and then 9 hours to ~~sleep~~ Play wow all night! :)
---
No one Needs sleep! Leveling is almost like sleeping anyway in classic. Pull - autohit for 20 secons - repeat ;)
---
As of this comment, 45,431 minutes until Classic!

You spelled elemental shaman wrong

Pro tip for fellow shamans. Sell your water and food and grab rockbiter at lvl1. Cuts your kill time in half and u dont need to drink anyway
---
5.0 would like to have a word, I loved running 5mans in early Cata.
---
Just remember to come to BRD with pots, tubers, Nef and Ony world buffs, DM buffs, flask, runes, oils, elixers and food buffs, whilst being the correct race/spec, or you are not invited.
---
No its not. The entire point of classic is only to provide a real MMO how it is suppose to be. It has nothing to do with having a orginal version or not. The original version coincidentally also represents a true MMO.
---
&gt; You can't strafe with the right mouse button
---
What else would you call it then? When I press (and hold) the right mouse button, my A and D keys get my character to strafe instead of turn. Without the right mouse button pressed they turn my character. I really don’t see the point in changing those keybinds.
---
Base attack power just means all sources of converted attack power, such as attack power gained from strength, but not itens such as devilsaur leggings that give bonus attack power

This reverses the damage calc of a vanilla video for bloodthirst to see bloodfury gave 282 ap, which coincides with the characters chatacter sheet and "base" ap.
---
No? That is not how average works.
---
Doesn’t that also kill you? What is so good about it?
---
800x600 you peasant. I had a 21 inch flat crt with up to 1280x900 and it was only 50 pounds light.
---
I also had the best cable internet that would only go out when my neighbor fixed his after me fixing mine made his go out.
---
RP-PVP!
---
Really wish the release could be on a Friday so I could play all weekend. I'll just not sleep in the first day and hopefully that will put me ahead of the zerg in the following days when I'll be playing just a few hours each time.
---
I hate the spanish translation. I wouldn't play in a spanish server even if we had them in classic.
---
I know I could just play in a spanish server with the enGB client, but still, I don't want the chat filled with [Furia del trueno, espada bendita del hijo del viento] or shitty spanish memes.
---
Seconding other guy. 
---
You'd just, uh, redesign the raid schedule at best or simply not be there at worst. 
---
You'll be fine bud.
---
Can we just take a second to appriciate this bingo plate doesnt contain "streamer" posts anymore.
---
Btw as a Druid i CAN approve of this post.
---
I literally was in an argument today about the viability of Druid tanks in Vanilla.
---
If you're a caster I recommend SFK for sure but either way it's a great dungeon and not too hard for alliance to reach. You will not access RFC as a low level alliance. WC is out of your way but possible to reach. If you're on a pvp server it will be much harder. Great leather gear from there though.
---
And what did i hear this morning? Hotfix! Phase3 to stronk! Thats blizzard bois! TT
---
organized-PvP I'd say Druid. Being a skilled flag-runner in WSG is some great shit. 
---
PvE it's basically the same but Paladin has to re-apply buffs after every death/wipe/5/15minutes.
---
 and they have those at low level?
---
Who let grandma onto reddit?
---
For EU if your willing to destroy your sleep pattern on day 1 it should be easy to get ahead of the pack as alot of people will be sleeping if they could not get time off work etc, (obviously alot of people will be playing at launch though) but compared to US it should be easier.
---
I would play TBC if released but I dont enjoy it as much as vanilla. Not really interested in wrath unless they completely remake it.
---
Sort of. I've played both factions, but past Wrath I only played Alliance. I will be going Horde in Classic.
---
The leeway and spell batching posts are either gone or infrequent, so they don't fit the bingo :) still annoying though!
---
Shedo's guild let him use bleed tho.
---
For me i've only played current WoW, so i have no idea where these dungeons actually are in the game. It wasn't until i found WoW Classic that i realised dungeons are actually a physical place in the game
---
&gt;Added in patch 1.13.0.28211
---
I played arenas at like 2400+ rating. I know retail requires skill when pushed to high levels.  But the rest of the game is dull and boring, so fuck it. Classic is just a better game overall
---
Hey yeah it's your boy thick grundle Grundleheart here to answer your question unequivocally right up in the words after this shit. 
---
Turns out Warlock is the sickest shit in the world because not only do you have fear you have DEATH COIL that shit is a horrify effect that literally can't be broken by any single ability or trinket in the entire game so GET FUCKED everyone also turns out that the debuff from the HORRIFY effect is just as long as it takes to cast FEAR which can be countered by like TWO OR MAYBE three things but that shit doesn't matter because you're not a scrub and you've got a Succubus out so if they use their PVP trinket and some other shit (warriors I guess) then turns out you can still just fucking keep casting fear or Seduce until one hits and then run to 36 yards and murder them as they can't do shit. 
---
That said Priests can turn into demon-priests which is cool but they also have to buff and heal people and that shit's weak as fuck cuz if you're not murdering your enemy you're basically the enemy
---
Thick Grundle Out. 
---
Aaaaaaand...
---
Post.
---
Yea that one was pretty good.
---
25 unique post topics a day?  Scandalous!
---
SM is pretty much mandatory whereas DM is not. Over 8+ years as Alliance most of my characters didn't even run DM.
---
&gt;What's stopping the community from designated one of the pvp realms the defacto RP realm?
---
The community is stopping it. If the server says "PvP" people will join it as such. Sure all the RP players might try to band together pre-launch and pick one to roll on, but there will also be a ton of non-RP people. And why should they want to leave?
---
Then there are also the rules. On an actual RP server, Blizzard have rules. For example for naming, as to keep immersion for RP players. If it is not an official RP server, this will not be done. If a large amount of RP players gather on a single server, it will also be prone to extreme trolling from everyone else, and again - not being an official server, Blizzard won't come along and help the RP players.
---
Personally I don't really care much, I don't like RP, but there are certainly a difference in having an RP dedicated server or for the community to try (and fail) at making an unofficial one.
---
Depending upon n your expectations you either mean that you are worried that the game is shit or that it's gonna be awesome and you're not worried at all. 
---
You sum up this Reddit very effectively.
---
Almost every 40m raid will bring a shadowpriest because of the massive boost to one of the two caster-dps slots (Warlock &amp; Mage). 
---
Your 5man groups will probably regularly have you heal. Unless you've got a pocket healer friend. 
---
So: If you're cool with healing in 5mans (pre/during raids) go for it.
---
Oh Druid, everyone wants to tank or dps but no one on here wants to heal. It's okay, I'll be ret pally, surely I'll be invited :D
---
The other poster was wrong, there's a 16 debuff limit, the shadow-weaving debuff will absolutely be something most raids look for.
---
It is a thing for leveling. I dunno what he's on about.
---
if you think that getting shadow form will switch your playstyle - it wont
---
with or without it you will wand
---
So, plants VS zombies, but in wow?
---
I'll try a smoking analogy.
---
If you dont smoke, you feel normal.
---
If you do, but can't for a while, you feel bad. But as soon as you can it relieves you so much that you forget that this is the normal feeling you'd have when you're not smoking at all.
---
I rushed to get to endgame to play with my friends, and skipped everything inbetween, thinking I'd get to it later.
---
Then it was gone.
---
SM/Ruin Warlock thank me later you do good/great in PvE &amp; don't have to respect to also do good/great in PvP
---
My advise: since its your first time, TAKE YOUR TIME! Explore the world as you go, immersive yourself in the quests, lore and locations. Interact with people IN game and learn the ropes by playing. 
---
Do as you please ofcourse, but my advise is just to experience the game and to try and not get sucked in by the rush that many people seem to feel.

Don't let their green bars get empty.

Most of your spells fill the green bars.

When their green bars hit 0 you can make them be not-0 again! It's fantastic.
---
... What on earth you talking about? It's called "Classic" because they're *replicating* a *version* of a game that is no longer available. How does "World of Warcraft Classic" have *nothing to do* with having an original version? If they wanted to simply "provide a real MMO" they wouldn't have to remake a game from 2004.
---
They are called Realms in WoW, in case you needed that little extra information.
---
As someone who leveled 3 hunters to 60 on private servers, if you're a solo player or don't have a guild, don't roll Hunter, dont make the same mistake I did 3 times.
---
First of all, people wont invite you to 5mans, everyone sees Hunters as retards, even if you're a good player, they wont give you the chance to prove that you're capable of not fucking their runs, they'll always prefer a Mage/Warlock over you, most of the time you'll have to create ur own groups, and even by making ur own groups, most people wont join because its a "Huntard" advertising.
---
Also, forget about raiding past MC, most guilds run 2 Hunters max and all spots are taken, not to mention guilds that force you to spam wingclip with Nightfall from MC to Naxx, ur only chance is MC pugs which is a wipefest and you'll be competing with all the benched/left behind Hunters, PvP premades also run 1 Hunter max so forget about that.
---
Keep in mind that Classic Hunters will be even weaker compared to Private Server ones, Scatter DRing Trap, leeway and batching, unresponsive pet AI, so your problems are doubled.
---
Yep, I quit all Hunters I did on private servers because I couldnt do anything on endgame, you'll be left in the bottomless pit of misery.
---
Tl;dr: Hunters are only good if you have another main character and you want to farm gold on maraudon/diremaul, don't roll one, you'll regret it. Choose between Mage/Warlock/Rogue, these are the 3 classes that are top of the food chain.
---
Realm names available yet?

Are hunters really that bad?

FML the list of Topics that have been discussed more than 1000 times and are still posted and asked daily is incredible...
---
&gt; That race ability that lowers stun by 25 percent seemed awesome for pvp
---
It's one of the top pvp racials. Hunters naturally counter rogues, but if a rogue gets a good stun opener on you, you're very often minced meat regardless.
---
It won't save her, she can just feign death, filthy hunters.
---
Is the social aspect a result of the game system or just the people back in 200x and wow is one of their first major mmorpgs
---
SM? Scarlet Monastery is as much alliance dungeon as it is horde. It's jsut pretty difficult to get to for alliance comapred to horde, but everybody does it while levelling.
---
The alternative is still worse. You'll end up just hating yourself for the most amount of your playtime just to be just the nth *pure spec* that tries to get &lt;insert piece of gear&gt; hoping to get a moment of fun. 
---
Most won't ever get to experience it due to burnout. And, worst of all, in my experience it isn't even worth it at all.
---
I know negative resistance (or "spell vulnerability") was removed later on.
---
Does anyone know beneficial is it to have spell penetration in PvP as a Warlock or Shadow Priest?
---
Bearing in mind most teams will have a Druid for Mark of the Wild, giving everyone 20 to all resistances. Most will also have a Priest for Shadow Protection which gives 60 to shadow resist.
---
Is it worth the WSG and AV rep rewards Mark of Perfection and Don Rodrigo which each give +20 spell penetration, to cancel out the effects of the Druid and Priest buffs?
---
You have no idea how hard it was to concentrate on just nine... I've tried to only take the recent ones, that's why leeway and spell batching aren't included
---
Wait, what sub is this again? O*h shit, I'm on* r/classicwow*?!* I meant to say retail sucks, Classic is flawless, druids CAN... Give me a sec, I'll get a picture of my Alliance / Horde battlestation... I know it's somewhere here in my 15 year old folder!
---
This is hilarious, takes me back. GPU would always tear unless I took the side of the case off and pointed a fan at it.
---
Dual spec was in WotLK and I think it a good example of where thing started to go bad, it wasn't an improvement it just made the game easier. It's where things started to change towards the philosophy of you don't need to work to get the reward, they removed the work that was considered tedious which over time removed everything that gave the game meaning.
---
People living week to week isn't something I would describe as greatness.
---
There is an incredible amount of stuff already posted in this sub with links to that kind of information, I’d recommend using the search function and taking your time reading through it.
---
Paladin using rage instead of mana, requiring you to get in there as a holy warrior, instead of standing on the backline wearing a dress like a priest wannabe.
---
Cataclysm heroics were the tits. Until people complained that they actually had a challenge after WoTLK, and then Blizzard nerfed them.
---
No because I have played on several private servers and the game is amazing. It's not a question of nostalgia.
---
I started wow in vanilla and played regularly until cata. After that I'd get hyped for an xpac and play until bored and cancel, each xpac shorter than last. I don't think I even made it a full month with bfa.
---
After discovering p servers over a year ago I haven't quit playing. IMO it's just a better game. Too many reasons, but the biggest being retail feels like a single player game and every class feels the same. Vanilla forces you to socialize and I love the rock/paper/scissors and unique identity each class has.
---
Yeah pretty obvious on a post coffee reread
---
Dark Souls has a reputation for being difficult, but fair. Some bosses in dark souls have bigger health pools than others, the ones with larger health pools are generally harder. You know why? because the longer a fight is, the more chances you have at making a mistake. There is nothing artificial about it. Everything doesnt have to be dodgeable skillshots. Vanilla is more strategy/tactics, using your whole toolkit to the fullest. A good player can solo many elites, while a new player cannot.   
---
By your logic you might aswell make every mob die in 3 hits, because inflated numbers is only artifical difficulty anyway.
---
I am very excited about your excitement and I’m sure you’ll enjoy it. The pace is slower but it mostly means you’ll get to see the nooks and crannies!
---
If it's anything like Destiny you may want to bail on the sub or you'll be reading about the sky falling all day.
---
Well, feral dps pre-wotlk is just shred spam -&gt;ferocious bite (as finisher) while powershifting. Bleeds only became worthy PvE-wise after wotlk changes.
---
Wow, lots of asshats in the comments on this one.
---
Nice wallet man.
---
yes we have one https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit#gid=0
---
In comparison to warrior, you have to get pummelers, mana pots (and runes in AQ and Naxx) in addition to regular melee consumes. However you don't farm rage pots like warriors do, nor get thistle tea like rogues. You also don't need Shadow Oils like the minmaxer warriors on their weapons. The biggest grind that people consider requiring huge commitment is the pummeler farm, and that is probably due to the fact that you can't buy them like you can pretty much every other consume. You just have to do it yourself. I raided always with people who use every possible consume as well on their warriors and rogues and did really well, so it's not that as a feral you have to get everything you can ever find and when playing on a warrior or rogue you don't need any consumes. Of course you have advantage especially on warrior as it's an op class, but the consumes are big and you can't do too well without them on any class.
---
Thatss my man. My guild needs some raid leaders, I think you would be a perfect fit. We raid monday-friday, and on the weekends we meet IRL to stomp out copies of BFA in the parkinglot outside gamestop.  Application requirement is a vehement hatred of any expansion past Cata
---
Play Warcraft 3 first
---
&gt; I think the last time a dungeon really felt like a challenge was in WotLK.
---
TBC was the last time dungeons were truly challenging imo.
---
Hitting Mythic+ dungeons as soon as you are geared enough at launch is tough too.  I usually play the first month or two of an expansion now, push M+ to 10s and then get bored and go back to playing Battlefield until the next expansion.  
---
Classic is going to such a relief.
---
Not knowing *where the dungeon even is* really changes your perception. 
---
Even with the Looking For Group tool as it worked during BC (everyone looking for a group showed up in a menu and summoning stones worked), you'd still need to physically walk through the instance portal so you'd know where you were in the world. 
---
I don't know how corpse runs work nowadays. Are you supposed to find an instance portal you've never seen, or do groups just instantly disband? Mind you, in BC I was already constantly walking into the wrong instance because each place had four different portals, but still.
---
There's a thread exactly about this...
---
You clearly don't play the game, it's fine.
---
Honestly im glad activision is largely forgetting classic. Its what keeps their fingers out of the jar, it allows us to fly under the shit radar(shout out to Lahey). 
---
The success of classic lies in the game itself, word to mouth. Besides I think most who are interested or potentially could be already heard of it either through friends or game communities.
---
I don't know man, I've also had friends who bought gold and didn't get banned, and then one friend who bought gold during WOTLK and was banned for a few days.
---
Literally gods. 
---
You've got loads of dots, fears for shit that hurts your buddy, death coil for the thing you can't fear, heals for the shit you can't fear from your buddy. 
---
tl;dr you'll crush almost any 2v2 combo outside of whatever tryhard replies to my comment that says WELL ACKTUALLY with a combo describing a 2v2 situation where the other team gets a 100% drop on your partnership. You'll win like 90% of anything and that's being generous to the 10% possibilities where you could possibly lose. 
---
Ignore the diminishing returns on fear it barely matters and since Seduce is also a thing fuck it. Unless they're somehow on the same DR but they weren't (IIRC) in classic so fuck it y'all win aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnndddddddddd
---
post.
---
the ooga gang approves this
---
I'm happy that dungeons are back to normal, but one of the few things blizzards nailed in the last years in my opinion is the mythic + system (which could just be renammed heroic+, since HM and MM are both difficulty levels for max levelled players).
---
The Mythic+ systems keeps dungeons relevant far into an expantion even after raids are out. I wish I would go to death mines once or twice while levelling then being able to come back at a later level while there is still incentive to do it.
---
The system could maybe be changed a little, but keeping all dungeons relevant for the whole duration of an expantion was really a good idea and gave us a lot of content for a little mork work on Blizzard's side.
---
i guess the playstyle stays the same, but the dmg increase is noticable?
---
SFK was like the quintessential classical (not in terms of wow, just in terms of fantasy) "battle your way up a crazy mage's tower and beat his ass"-dungeon.
---
Just go into the game blind dont get wrapped up in min/maxing or what is the most efficient way to level. Explore the game do the quest level professions. Also play what you want.
---
It's all up to your preference. Some people like to play games with as little information as possible while others do enjoy improving in any way possible (guides, websites, forums).
---
 I'd advise you to decide for yourself and don't listen to anyone here.
---
Exactly that, it was the effort that bound you and the people you came across along the way
---
the game forces you to talk and work with people.
---
False logic, seems you think attendance is the only thing that matters. I rather get brilliant raider for 2 nights than trash one for 3.
---
I don't think dual spec alone ruined wow, but so many changes follow the same philosophy of making the game easier without doing anything else. You can use the same argument about LFG, it didn't really hurt anyone and you didn't have to fly to the dungeon or wait for the group to get ready.
---
The road to retail is paved with good intentions.
---
Good point, ty
---
As long as my imp is called Nubjub again like in vanilla I’m happy
---
Zero comment then
---
For sure. I was just underlining that wotlk was the best version by your definition. Not in general. But the Subscriber count would fit.
---
Going for enchanting as a priest for wands is a good option ? For leveling (wand OP), but after this expensive profession, why change it ?
---
My bATtLEStaTioN iS rEAdY
---
The one and only true answer is to play whatever but with a hack which allows you target members of your own faction.
---
Or an arm claw that drops it halfway between you and them
---
where the pallys at??
---
Most people don't realise the contribution dps from a sweaving spriest is in a roundabout way the spriest dps as well. So a spriest's personal dmg+contribution dps will IF PLAYED PROPERLY come close or even surpass traditional dps classes. This efficiency in dps out damages the healing efficiency of a holy weaver.
---
Lol whats with the whole anti-US propaganda? No country is perfect. I´m from Scandinavia as well but man stop jerking yourself off, norway is not the utopia you claim it to be.
---
One thing I miss is that mobs would not use their AoE fear unless 3 people/pets were in melee range.  I hope that comes back.
---
The battle station shits my favy
---
I watch the news and read papers both on an off line. I have been doing it for about 30 years. No need to source it all.
---
What professions is everyone taking? 
---
Tailoring and Skinning for me.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love exactly what you're mentioning. This is the guy that literally got my one handed skill in Skyrim to 100 before leaving Helgen just by whacking that guy. I'm just saying that it's time consuming, which I also love. I never said it was bad design. For example I love that there's no portals everywhere and no flying mounts which extends the gameplay.
---
My point was that comparing retail difficulty to vanilla is not fair because I keep hearing the time consuming argument.
---
So an enhance shaman that's not rubbish then
---
proceeds to show a room with both Horde AND Alliance flags and a totally clusterfucked map with flightpaths, questgivers, mailboxes, graveyards, walmarts, hardware stores and the top 10 5* restaurants of Azeroth
---
Those add-ons felt to me like WoW 2 and WoW 3, where you could import your character from the previous game. They both rendered content that came before irrelevant and emptied the two original continents.
---
I don't care much for TBC, because it felt disconnected from Vanilla. However, I'd like to see Northrend back in the game because it concludes the story arc that began with W3. But only if they could integrate it into the 'old world' seamlessly and without changing too much. Just for the lore.

Here's my number 1 tip : Enjoy the F out of it. In my opinion, too much knowledge is probably too much knowledge. The game will take you on quite the ride, enjoy it...! )
---
PrIvAtE sErVeRs GoT tHiNgS wRoNg MaYbE aTtAcK pOwEr DoEsN't AcTuAlLy InCrEaSe DaMaGe
---
TBC still manages to keep the game feeling like a proper mmo but it is less immersive than vanilla and makes the world feel smaller. I’m definitely not excited for tbc but if it’s what follows classic and everyone’s hyped for it I’ll definitely play it. 
---
Personally, I’d much rather tbc be released in such a way that it’s all additional level 60 content that doesn’t make all the previous endgame stuff completely irrelevant. I’d also like there to never be a capital city that is neutral. Idk exactly how they could go about doing that and I doubt it’ll happen since it’ll be a lot more work but I strongly believe it would make for a much better game. 
---
As for wrath, I don’t see why people are so interested in it. There are multiple difficulties for raids, dungeon finder is introduced(dungeons also are very easy), and the only reason to go into the world is for daily quests. It’s basically the first expansion where the majority of the endgame content is sitting in a capital city waiting for queues. I’ve played every expansion and I loved wrath at the time but I really don’t see the allure of replaying it for more than a couple of weeks.
---
Go moonglow/NS and heal for your spell dmg gear
---
Any spot for an experienced shaman tank once stuff is on farm?
---
Blackout can be a disadvantage : you stun a mob and the patrol arrive... Happens sometimes and causes wipe.
---
Sooo - where do you Druid get your Barkskins from? I guess you are not so environmentally conscious afterall :d I think priests are the MVP's
---
It is so odd to read your wrath suggestions. 
---
The only 2 things Id debate to be a good idea would be on the one hand the LFD tool. I was a tank back then, I loved that shit . Que up, relax and go in. I actually think at the time it was impelemented it wasnt that bad but I can see the negative consequenses years later.
---
And on the other hand, the change of difficulty to heroics. They were very easy, the only thing that made it fun more me back then was doing the achievements . That was awesome and in some cases very hard to do and it felt super rewarding getting that protodrake back then.
---
But yes. Making it harder in general could be a good idea.
---
But seriously.. rework tier 7? Discount Naxxramas ? Common. I was a passsionate pug raider back then. And I raided with a LOT of people who raided for the first time and it was super fun and unfun to keep dying and dying . Also that shit was probably super easy for the big guilds or coordinated guilds after some time. But it was the very best raid for players new to raiding. 
---
Just compare it to the first Cataclysm raids. I mean, I liked the challenge very much. All the rest players got kicked in the balls for the first raids. Shit was too hard to clear or even kill something.
---
Probably because of that dumb decision to make the first raids too hard developed Raidfinder. And everyone knows how super awesome that feels /s . 
---
For the raid changes, no. I liked going 10 man to 25 man. And changing heroic to normal in icc? lol. Are you crazy? Do you even know how awesome it was to be able to increase the difficulty while still having the option to clear that thing in a not raidfinder style matter?
---
Vehicles were not super back then. I agree. But it belongs to wrath and I still enjoyed hopping in them. Changing that doesnt sound correct to me. Some weird implementations are made to be remembered. 
---
That are my thoughts but I think your post was worth reading and thinking about :)
---
I want to be the villain
---
OP, multiply yourself by 100.000 and you will see why changing ain't good. One day people will realize that trying to make everyone happy, can ruin a game, but that day is not today.
---
The very definition of why these games shouldn't be changed lies in the fact that Joe's opinion is not in any way better than Jim's. 
---
So no, an old game is success to everyone that wants to play them simply because they exist. To be able to go back to them at any time. If you think you will divide Classic, TBC and WotLK into 3 different games that can grow to be a "success" then this will never happen. Success has to be a new thing, so that feedback is better suited to Retail.

Blizzard isn't some small company that will start tailoring 20 year old stuff to make it appealing to today standards. That's not how it works.
---
If someone re-releases the Godfather in 8k IMAX quality some day, i still expect to see Pacino in the leading role. And i also expect to see all the controversy that is barely allowed to happen today.
---
That is what Classic means, and this includes TBC and WotLK. Leave the damn games alone.
---
I do and I think we CAN but that doesn't make the posts about it less annoying :P
---
I suggest you take a look at Kargoz' field manual for hunters: [Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOcqrIfi0qI)
---
In the video he quickly comments over his presentation, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rgGI7d1yf4ZNHeiqanYiHjgTKHNG_nui4ujqQqGXK2I/edit)
---
It’s the ultimate extension to classic
---
Edit: hell, I run a 3.3.5 server from my cupboard.
---
It's not easy being green...
---
Make it, retroactively apply it to this reddit, then post the results to /r/dataisbeautiful (it'll get their minds off those Tinder graphs).
---
If the druid is healing then he is obviously entitled to healing gear.
---
Filter best overall, paladin, any server, any raid, and compare that to any other class. The best of the best paladins are doing 400-500 DPS, which is less than half of other classes. A rogue with 0 talents points would do more damage.
---
And a glowing computer that looks like it drains the power from 5 blocks.
---
I remember buying a 7600 gt and it did fine as well.
---
Using two prime keybinds so you can keyboard turn?
---
Warlocks den or something like that
---
Yeah, but given how common the fights are for this pre-bis stuff are (and all classes feel legitimated to roll on them) I've seen less hate on this specific one than a hybrid rolling on whichever piece (even if it's for their meme main spec) even if it's of their same armor type (like warriors blaming rets for their stuff).
---
The truth hurts so much...! :o)
---
Oomkin with only plus dmg items and 1.5k mana, good joke
---
Some do. Some offer character transfers from other servers and some do not. Either way it never affected the population of vanilla private servers (much).
---
Wait... maybe I had a 7800 gs.  I do remember being agp still.
---
So, what would need to happen to healing meters to make them a more realistic representation of healer performance?
---
Maybe something like (Actual healing done / Actual heal + Overheal) / Total mana spent on healing spells
---
Making it a ratio of healing to mana spent would factor in that those that are spamming fast inefficient heals, the meter would reward those that are doing a lot of effective healing and doing so efficiently.  Obviously I've just pulled this formula out of my ass, things probably need tweaking.
---
Mog is that you?
---
Weird autocorrect flex since I'm English.
---
Your loss!
---
Maybe this hasn't been posted enough, but what about the "have they announced the server names yet?", or the "when can we reserve names?".
---
In the previous stress test they had to close servers because the load was too small.
---
That's only anecdotal evidence..
---
Go spelladin pretty much.
---
Ok so why only 5 horde guilds on k3 kill Kel thuzad and not every single level 60. I killed him. It's clearly doable. but to say everyone will do it is laughable. Look how many fucking people here want to play Ret.
---
That was on purpose!!
---
Sunken Temple, Strat and Scholo. Loved these 3 dungeons.
---
BRD is massive, and by far, the best dungeon ever created in WoW. Can't wait to prepare for a BRD run that lasts longer than MC.
---
:(
---
Look at the dagger I found in Trisfal glades!!
---
I just found a shield!!
---
Where are the pumpkins?
---
It's the first day and someone already killed the XR flightmaster.....
---
From '05 to '09 I played a dwarf paladin (chose alliance because I wanted to play with my friends). Dabbled on a vanilla  p\*server around 2013 as a UD priest &amp; rogue + a TBC server as a UD warlock. Going to play UD warlock for vanilla this time around. Will miss the epic Alliance questlines from Westfall to Redrigde, but it ain't worth it having to look at male NE's all day.
---
You can get Pally buffs on Horde, Mind Control dude. If pally buffs are such a massive things doing the mind control trick should not be an issue.
---
You should really just create a character on retail and get those things ready to copy to your classic folder.

---
Rogues have a dodge tank spec which is actually quite good if given the right amount of effort from you and other people to try it out as a way to challenge yourself.
---
Not sure if I played too much WoW back in the day or this is a private server thing.  I originally played at launch and then rerolled twice during vanilla's timeline for fresh servers.  The only terrible thing I remember is the Loch Modan quest which I generally just skip because I cant get the clickies.  Otherwise I never really had a problem with a crowd or high levels ganking me.  I never went with a specific plan and I think I was in high school during vanilla so was at school a good chunk of the day and played maybe 6-7 hours max weekdays (all day weekends if no projects).  These were all on PvP servers.  Twice on alliance, once as horde (we were the underpopulated faction as well).
---
Alts however were generally a terrible leveling experience as far as ganking went.  Never really got camped though so no reason to bring my main over.
---
I guess you’re not interested in a debate at all sir.
---
Skinning and herbalism at first and then will swap skinning to alchemy once I’ve spent money on finishing the epic mount quest (cost about 500g if I remember correctly)
---
Yup it will be fine. Just keep settings low and you’ll easily get 60fps.
---
Ask before starting the run.
---
"Hey guys I am balance specc and thus need some cloth gear. Are you guys fine with that or should i/you look for another grp?"
---
You probably have an even better chance if you construct the grp yourself and basically say: "yo guys this is my group and my rules. If you don't like it go elsewhere pls, you have been warned."
---
Of course not. But Questing is much more Fun when u know the Background Stories ect. Just my Tipp for him.
---
Hmm. I mean I just raided through AQ40 on a private server and that was the issue we had and we did use a feral as an OT...didn’t hear about that pummeler item though. Why aren’t Druid’s main tanks then since the number 1 issue with speed runs is threat?
---
The big problem with discount naxxramas is that classic vanilla exists.
---
In real vanilla, most people never set a foot into Naxx, so it made sense to rerelease it in Wrath. It was a huge disappointment for anybody who raided the original naxx as the raid was a complete shadow of its former self and completely undertuned (I mean it was cleared 2 days after release and even my guild cleared it easily in 2 raids after we started raiding two weeks after release). But it was great that everybody could see Naxx. 
---
With classic wow, many more people will see and experience the original Naxx. This devalues wrath Naxx even further and I think it would definitely need to be replaced with something completely different. Yeah, cata release raids were overtuned.
---
I never liked the normal/heroic versions of raids. It dilutes everything so much. Implementing hard modes akin to Ulduar would be cool. I also didn't say heroic to normal icc, but something in between.
---
&gt; First is, that you simply don't need maximum dps from every raid member to beat the content.
---
Truer words have never been said. :)
---
Why can't you just let people play how they like?
---
*crosses off space on bingo card* just right more to go!
---
Alliance’s journey to SM
---
nothing, as they were just like classic. #nochanges :P
---
To spam shadowbolt instead of frostbolt. 
---
But seriously, Both are great damage dealers though mages edge it, both have great utility. I think warlocks edge it in pvp.
---
Warlock is probably the second easiest and quickest class to level after hunter. A good warlock can have close to zero down time.
---
&gt; A lot people also think that the naturally higher HPS of a priest makes it the better healer
---
But paladins have the highest HPS O_o
---
Prolly got old to me after the 15th toon
---
Nothing is better than power questing, at least not until the very select few classes that are AoE capable can do it efficiently. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Let's be real trying to outrun everyone early on is kind of dumb because it's all about long term dedication and who has the most problematic life hygiene anyway so you'll end up exactly where you need to sit. You could start a day or two later and still end up exactly where you would've been 2 weeks later.
---
You're probably right, but I'd still go with archmage for MC+BWL and bloodvine once zg is out
---
Autocorrect can do wonders.
---
Absolutely no changes are needed whatsoever for Classic to be a success.
---
Sounds like you should go mage. But I would roll a warlock 20981231 years before I roll a mage. Warlocks are spicy and have unique RPG abilities, such as soulstones and summons. And they make phat crits too. Mages are great in Vanilla/Classic, thankfully, but just what you'd expect from mages in RPGs... warlocks seem like a worthwhile (spicy) alternative. But maybe that's just me. Warlock is my 2nd class I'm going for in Classic, after Shaman (played Rogue and Priest in Vanilla).
---
Which reminds me. I LOVED playing priest in vanilla, but you sound like you wanna do damage, so...
---
If there's a balance druid and a mage in a party the mage gets cloth what's that so hard to understand. Same as a rogue vs a warrior or a rogue vs a hunter.
---
Tweet an Ion and post on the official forum. If there aren't RPPvP servers at launch, I'm betting you 100g there will never be any.
---
I expect quite a few players to quit before 40 because their nostalgia-hit wears off. Not everyone has the time to commit to an mmo anymore, so when the honeymoon period is over and the cold truth about the time commitment required hits you, some ppl will head for the door (maybe myself aswell)
---
Says in the promo, Subscription &amp; mount bundle offer valid through July 29, 2019.
---
The minute servers launch, the remaining readers will comprise of angry neckbeards complaining about minor issues and down voting the massive influx of low effort karma posts. I'll gladly be among the silent lurkers looking on in amusement and disdain.
---
Why would you ever write all that manually instead of making a script...
---
Yes, that's what I'm doing. As soon as you get enough hit to not need bloodvine you'll want to replace it with volatile power though.
---
Cuz warlocks have more personality. There I said it.
---
Depends, doesn't take much for a few guilds to blacklist you for leather/mail ninja on a few of their members.
---
Yes you need it
---
Damn it! I'm installing bt launcher at my workstation. I someone notice I may be screwed:P 
---
&lt;shadowmeld mode on&gt; :P
---
Yep I finally had fun again in 5mans during the cata launch, untill the majority had to spoil the fun again.
---
Wrath was good early on, lets say around the Ulduar patch.  No dungeon finder, no ToC garbage raid.
---
Personally I think BC was the best this game has ever been - but would still prefer to play classic simply because there's no flying mounts and no splitting of the world content into 'irrelevant' and 'relevant'.  One of the biggest reasons classic is so good is that the entire world is relevant content.
---
You can easily break away from the pack as early as level 6-7 if you are following a good route
---
That's how i used to save my pets world buffs in mc
---
( when dismiss wiped buffs on psrvz)
---
I mean, think what you want, but more than half of that shit happened after vanilla wow.
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal efficiency. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job done. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking survive, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the First War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara and Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! For the Horde!
---
But yea... Hitler right...
---
Is that 45 minute bit true?
---
I still have fond memories of when the beginning of Cata was like that, before 5-mans got nerfed back into faceroll territory.
---
Is this a critique on all the "TOP 5 this and that" videos that are constantly made?
---
Those mouthbreathers always existed, it's just that LFG forced us to okay with them unless you eighter queue'd up with a group or ran to the instance yourself.
---
Yeah, i dont doubt you. Just pointing out that there are multiple aspects of "stressing servers". As at least previously, they did have different servers for items, instances, login, both continents etc. So better test them all.
---
But maybe its different now.
---
Karma fishing gone wrong :PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
---
Even unique shit like warrior's rage resource has been homogenized into just another combo point system of generators and spenders.  Pretty much everything in retail now is just generators and spenders - basically the same on every class the only thing different being a couple of flavour abilities and the spell effects.
---
Why top post deleted tho
---
This comments is made to bring the comment count to 70, ruining the meme of having 69 comments.

---
Ok.
---
Gift = 3 free days but they expires on 29.07.2019
---
I activated them and they already added game time to my account. So now I have 3 days lol.
---
You are saying that points 1, 2 and 5 are some sort of objective truths that all new players should follow. I'm willing to bet that if you take a group of 100 people with your instructions and then another group of 100 people that do the opposite. The group that does the opposite to your instructions will play the game longer and more of them will reach level 60 and end-game.
---
Strath Undead and Dire Maul. Nuff said.
---
Don’t forgot the colour of the resource bar :O
---
I never played Cata, but I remember hearing from friends that a lot of people bitched about the dungeons being to hard.
---
It wont be as bad as private servers mainly because there's shit u cant say on blizz servers without being suspended/banned.  On private you can literally say whatever you want without that fear - also the accounts are free so no one would care about being banned anyway.  Also private servers are way too overpopulated meaning that you have a similar thing to cross-realm where you can be a dick and totally expect no repercussions because you'd likely never group with the same people again. 
---
On retail classic it'll be very different in all those aspects and so far less toxic imo.
---
Dungeons will remain relevant in classic because leveling will always be a huge part of the game.
---
Timed mythic+ dungeons were not an enjoyable experience. For me at least.
---
I worry that the game might not be quite how I remember it. It is going to be very interesting going back to classic now we have become used to so many quality of life improvements. I wonder if frustration will creep in at things like not being able to duel spec, LFG and instant dungeon summons, epic flying mounts, gear changers etc. I hope it doesn't but I suspect at some point I might think to myself 'you know what, it's not as good as you remember it but it's even more frustrating than I remember.'
---
I am going to try it out for sure though! I love the grind though so I am looking forward to that!
---
No, I hate it. I don’t like the long wait blizz just release it already, you’ll get more subs this way!
---
I mean. I saw it, but I don't do the shop. A sub is all they get from me! Unless I can get Murky in classic.
---
Engi+mining, then I’ll prob drop mining for alchemy for end game mats farming, especially ghost mushroom Mara solo farming.
---
Got a friend who will make tailoring items for me and I want the hit % from the T1 chest so not going for robe of the void
---
Is this usually a disc priest? Hybrid with some shadow dmg? Or full 21/30/0 holy
---
&gt; having tailoring give you 2% crit.
---
How does having tailoring give 2% crit? Is that some passive bonus that I'm not aware of? 
---
Plus, if I don't need it til phase for, I would just drop tailoring after RotAM then pick it up again a year later in phase 4 if I needed it.
---
Tailoring + Engineering
---
Funnily enough average definitely *should* work like this for intelligence because we're using a standard deviation to determine IQ values.
---
Bump
---
Well yeah that's one way to go
---
No no no ... we don't do that here :P
---
BiS is BiS, armor classes don't matter in the slightest. If a guild blacklists a fury warrior for rolling on leather/mail, they're not a guild worth playing with.
---
Knock-knock-knock
---
What would the Free Space be?
---
Pro tip need everything as a Hunter.
---
Hipster factor. Mages will be extremely popular. You will stand out as a Warlock.
---
Also: if you raid AQ/Naxx, Warlocks get scary. Mages have a strong baseline but Warlocks scale better with gear.
---
Usually the new players roll alliance because they wanna be «the good guys» and human normies. In retail tho they are Even more of a joke with a 12 year old as a king and furries
---
But than you're gonna waste half month not over a month :)
---
It's also cheaper than buying 6x1months, so if you plan to play Classic for at least 5 months, it's worth it, mount or not.
---
Get with a guild and have someone show you the ropes as far as class tips, loot stuff, and the basics. Otherwise, go hog wild and fun like others are saying. I almost envy you for being brand new and getting to experience the game for the first time.
---
Wow you have spent more money on your pc. That makes you really cool! Nice my friend I'm so impressed.
---
You won't likely get anything for most Twink greens for a while since BGs won't be a thing for months.
---
Given that you got links to full female preference statistics concerning games, including MMO (and other genres), I would have thought that you at least checked them.
---
Yeah, you actually had to pay attention to mechanics, could run out of mana while healing, had to use CC, etc...
---
Why wouldn’t they release this around the time of the name reservation? Surely that would incentivise people even more to buy it.
---
So a cloth shoulders drop that have int spirit and + damage and healing. Theres a mage a boomkin and a resto shaman and 2 melee in the group. 
---
Its an upgrade for all 3 crafters. Who does it go to?
---
ah, fake news. americans love that word. i don't have any interest in sourcing anything on your behalf. what you do to keep the rich being rich and the poor being poor is not up for debate. not to mention your prison and policing systems. get your head out your ass, if you don't see these as problems and want to have a civil debate, you are privileged as hell and okay with it.
---
you're just a fucking patriot acting subtle with your innocent demeanor. fuck you.
---
Poor Druid while shapeshifting... but you’re right on that ofc. Maybe the 97% is a bit too high.
---
Cheaper than normal 6 month subscription?
---
Guess ill buy this at the last day of july
---
Yea there is something there for sure hehe
---
TBC:
---
- No flying mounts.
---
- No welfare epics.
---
WotLK:
---
- No achievements.
---
- No Gearscore.
---
This is my biggest pet peeve, sometimes I'll be herbing/mining at 3am and the server will d/c and I'll just keep running around for 5-10 min before I realize I've been d/ced lmao
---
No I made a char on pserver (mage) and cleared naxx and loved it.
---
Absolutely buzzing to go opposite (alliance melee) on classic and start from scratch!
---
So in short, not *at all*
---
Never played Horde, have well over 100 days of playtime in Vanilla on Alliance. Always regretted never having seen the "other" side. Definitely switching now. Keep your eyes out for this suboptimal min/min Undead Warrior. Easy gank target for my old Alliance friends. :)
---
I was thinking of going this route but isn’t engineering pretty expensive while leveling, especially without mining?
---
Well said lad
---
Tauren have biggest muscles!!!
---
Its actually 2,7*10^15 ns until 27th August 12am CET from this moment.
---
Pom poly scorch would cause them to die to fall damage
---
16 min nefarian pog
---
My method is to not tell the pack what I am going to be doing....
---
On a serious note though. I'm only going to be playing casual, I'm not fussed about the pack.
---
If you plan to switch to shadow at 40 you might as well start as shadow
---

---
Just Purge everything, whenever Frost Shock is on cooldown.
---
You wouldn’t want to be intentionally crit to proc it though right? All it does is recupe some of the damage taken, no dps buff.
---
Don’t limit yourself to just swords. Maces are just as effective while leveling, if not more so. You can find a complete list of Rogue leveling weapons, ranked by effectiveness from bracket to bracket here:
---
https://shadowpanther.net/twinkweapons.htm
---
And tauren aren't a furry race??
---
As a mage you can earn way more than 50g/hr just from farming regular mobs in the world and selling their vendor trash.
---
:D
---
It's all good, thanks for the post
---
Yeah it's more of a meme build IMO, deep frost, PoM frost and elemental all are more effective (and more fun IMO)
---
Except on Odis
---
That warrior must have been salty
---
that place was a real test of my healing skills as well
---
I remember 10k+ on a certain pserver back in the day, definitely felt like too many people. Don’t get me wrong, I love wow when it’s crowded, but good luck mining/herbing with so many people online at once on a single server.
---
not healing related but executus gaming makes pretty high quality pvp videos, often playing ele shaman.
---
I am for sure. First character I ever rolled was a Tauren Shaman. Played Horde in TBC. In WotLK I went ally because of friends and always wanted to go back home but had too many friends and guildies to play with to switch. Now, a lot of them aren’t interested in classic (don’t know why) and will probably be playing solo. So I’m going back home. 
---
Blood and thunder.
---
I still don't understand why retail, in battle for Azeroth, didn't have relevant world quests scattered throughout Kalimdor and EK. Would have made sense and gotten those zones used again. Such a missed opportunity
---
Getting the sub ready for general chat?
---
Talk about 'tough love'...
---
I had to get my mate to do my Shattrath business for me, because It was like a fucking slideshow in there on my PC.
---
Nope. Troll &gt; orc
---
You don't have to use any crowd control in vanilla dungeons, they're faceroll easy. 
---
The only 5man content I recall cc being required to get through was tbc and early cataclysm heroics. I haven't played any expansion past cata though.
---
They did. Everyone was on Outland, hence, Classic was dead.
---
how am i subtle? i think in these areas, my country is way better. nowhere am i saying my country is perfect nor do i love my country (which is what defines a patriot). stop thinking of people as solely numbers and ways they are useful. it's cold and offputting. make your own research or look for a debate sub if you wanna debate how many americans have their life ruined by a simple "criminal" charge or lack of health insurance.
---
Still the biggest pve nerd shouldnt go troll, there's some fights where you can resist stuns and hardiness helps
---
Do NOT look at guides, min maxing strats or anything of the sort. Pick a class that interests you, go in the game blind, play the game your way and get lost in the magic! The Classic game offers an amazing experience you will really appreciate!
---
People are telling you to go in blind, but you can atleast lookup different classes &amp; try to figure out wich one appeals to you. Thats it though.
---
You seem surprised.
---
Are you me? Exactly the same situation
---
they would need to make it seperate from classic, cause i have no motivation to play those expansions again. If they haven't brought retail back on track by the time classic nears its end, i'll be looking for something else, doubt re-living the past is going to keep its charm, even all the way through classics content phases.  
---
Need a new game, that's actually good, not overflowing with microtransactions and paytowin bullshit.
---
It's the bloodvine set bonus, it only activates if you have tailoring maxed out
---
Great suggestions.
---
These specs actually _do_ have talent benefits (such as Critical Mass for fire mages and even Nature's Grace for druids). However, it's not exposed or toggle-able yet. I plan to add support for customizing talents in the future, but there's a _lot_ of work that goes into all this :). Mana usage and spell rotation/priority are also great suggestions.
---
Thanks for the detailed analysis/interest -- it really helps.
---
P.S. You're also correct about on-use items (trinkets, etc) -- they haven't been coded yet.
---
I guess that's why everyone is trying to leave the US, it's because it's a nightmare to live there...
---
Wait...
---
Perhaps people emigrate to the US it's because that's one of the best countries in the world to live in ? Where if you're poor, you have one of the largest chance to not remain poor ? And I say that from Switzerland, not from the US. Freedom does not guarantee you that other people will pay for your mistakes or bad luck. Saying you have a right to free stuff (being education, housing, or healthcare) basically means you own other people's labor, and that's called slavery.
---
Thanks, noted!
---
How frequently should I expect two other people not running to the instance to summon? How do I ensure that doesn’t happen?
---
Private server groupthink mentality. Of course there will be people who still think this way, but there will be plenty who don't. Gravitate towards those that don't.

20-40 go full shadow. literally no point in putting points into disc. respec full shadow at 40, put the next 20 points into disc. respec Holy @ 58
---
Might work if you die in EK then rez in Kalimdor
---
not just that but also when ur doing like BRD n shit at level 50+ you are totally getting endgame pre-bis gear long before you're 60.
---
If this is your first time I have to aggree. Dont ruin your fun by searching every detail on the Internet. Because if you do you will quit after lvl 20.
---
I just want the "i wana go fast, I wana go fast, I wana go fast"
---
attitude to go away....
---
go slow, use CC, wait for healer mana
---
Why does it matter where it comes from?  I thought BiS meant best in slot, not limited to only quest and dungeon loot.
---
I actually had more luck farming Krol Blade for my rogue than getting dal rend from UBRS.
---
You forgot the square that makes fun of you. The people that spend waaaay too much time on a sub and shit on the people just genuinely try to have a discussion about something they like. You forgot that square.
---
No, it was starting to get to shit, with lfg tool and multiple difficulty raids.
---
Watching rogues and warriors take Venomstrike from hunters. Can't wait.
---
&gt; I'm not gona spend money on wc3, if e rework is on it,s way
---
IIRC you get a free copy of the original if you buy the rework so your point kinda makes no sense.
---
Disability is probably covered by insurance in the States. If you happen to have a good one that is. 
---
It’s been awhile since I was in the USA. 8 years. Spent tons of money and was treated as a prince. Absolutely amazing feeling how everyone licked me ass as I spent money. In Norway you are not treated anything special if you have money. My GF was impressed by the whole thing as I payed for it all. It kinda nailed in the relationship with her. I married her. So I can partly thank USA for making me look like a king in the eyes of my also Norwegian wife.
---
Hope it works for you man. I couldn't do it. Alliance races look so dull in any gear.
---
i agree, if they would have pushed it out, when people are waiting for classic. The game would sell, now maybe
---
For me it is Classic+ or bust.
---
I have zero appeal for TBC and I simply hate Wrath. Will stop paying and playing WoW if Classic+ is not announced. Or WoW2. Or Diablo 4 MMORPg.
---
But TBC is hard stop for me.
---
Why would the set bonus require tailoring, that is not my understanding at all, gotta a source? 
---
Plus you would then be giving up 2 other BiS slots for that too, which would be awful.
---
No, Paladins are the BEST single target healers in end game raiding.
---
Priests are the best raid healers.
---
Didn't knew that.
---
Do you need me to spell out the names of the mobs?
---
Both very reliable choices for raiding. There are more  mages, but  also more DPS Slots. You can go by preference.
---
For PvP Undead is a great choice. For PvE Troll is prob the best.
---
I'd LOVE fucking mom maxers, like really curvy moms with dem female curves to knock you off your feet. Maxed moms.
---
Suuuure buddy.
---
I think I played through the end of wrath. Why is it that I can't remember what any of these places are, but I can remember all of the vanilla dungeons? Is anyone else like that, or is it just me? Is the vanilla content that much more compelling? Or was I just getting old enough that my memory started failing?
---
I took screenshots, but I'm a reddit noob and have no clue how to upload them here.
---
How bored must one be to discuss games to be *potentially* released in 2-3 years...
---
Defcamp&amp;MelderonTV may be worth checking out.
---
Most of that gold comes from providers, that hack accounts, disenchant the gear and sell it to you on the auction house.
---
By buying gold 
---
- you encourage hacking
---
- you help destroying the server economy
---
- you pay twice (you buy gold with which you buy things from the ah from the same providers). It's basically like giving someone a b******b after you got a******d by the same person.
---
And accounts got banned for buying gold.
---
90% of posters here won't ever hit level 60.
---
Out of those who will *and* will still be playing by Naxx release, most will clear it.
---
Well done, starting out in machimina is an uphill battle and some of the transitions are very good. Try not to zoom the background without zooming the foreground though. I like how the blurry effect on the background removed the need for shadows quite so much, but perhaps it will still be a good addition.
---
yep pets being bugged puts me off hunter and warlock which are my first 2 choice classes. Reeeeeeeee.
---
Curves though..
---
Does the math.
---
Never gets in raids because he once needed cloth hat as level 23 to fill empty slot. 
---
That mage is now officer in best raiding guild.
---
[Sure - here's the reference.](https://imgur.com/a/JZAIBSI) If you lack WC3 and think about playing Reforged one day it would make sense to buy it in pre-purchase so you can enjoy the original at least pre-WoW. I have the original on battle.net so I will buy Reforged once it's out, probably middle next year.
---
We wait too long. Thats the problem. The euphoric posts from the beginning turned to a bunch of reposts. I can‘t think about a single topic not discussed in this subreddit. Release has to come fast
---
It still has the old models on it, when you look up 'orc male', there will be a 'hd' option and one without, which is the classic model.
---
my guild of mouthbreathers were 8/14 in Naxx when tbc dropped, if we can do it, anyone can xD
---
It's in the middle of orgrimmar
---
This is classic not retail.  
---
There is no stat boost when you wear only leather as a druid, rogue etc.  
---
As a fury warrior I will wear leather and mail too and for sure I will roll on my mail BiS gear.
---
We're mostly talking about instances though and not the outside world, the original argument was about m+ and raids. In high level mythics and mythic raid they do hit hard and are generally harder. Once again, I'm not putting down people who dislike the QoL, just saying that it's disingenuous to say that it's harder in any way to retail. You said things like putting together 40 people raids, people leaving and stuff like that. I don't see how that makes it harder as in skillwise and not just time consuming.
---
^ what they said
---
Do you know any horde guide?
---
lmao. I think a proper gm ticket should have handled things.
---
Any opinions for a casual player who might be able to play 15-20 hours a week whether or not I’ll be able to play as enhanc in raids/pvp?
---
Pets have been bugged on retail since legion come out, thats 2.5 years and still not fixed. Since there using a legion client backported, dont expect a fix.
---
Absolutely not in the same way as a wolf hahah
---
Haha this info could actually be interesting. Same guy rolling need 5 times for the same trinket so he can rotate between them.
---
Or maybe people could like, list themselves as Lfg and form groups without having to sit in town and constantly spam chat channels
---
I love pets (pserver ones that are fluid). If you dont like pets then dont even think about warlock...
---
I did not even enjoyed WoW at release (probably because I was too young), but I was hyped just like I'm hype today. The difference is I may actually be able to enjoy it this time.
---
No it wasn't
---
Tether to 4G
---
I played hunter on vanilla, bfa and the last stress test. It's really not that bad.
---
A 17 old remastered rts is definitely on the bottom of priority list and for a good reason. There won't be a big audience for it. That genre is not doing well for a long time.
---
The fact that the daytime and nighttime are in real time make a big difference imo. All others mmo I played don't work like that.
---
Since when is that? Every time I saw those posts it was 12am being 12:00 because 11 am is 11:00, and 11pm being 23:00 so it only makes sense that 12pm is 0:00. Am I confusing things now or you? My brain hurts.
---
Anyways I could confirm that it's 0:00 no matter what am/pm is right due to the official countdown timer that I did not expect to exist.
---
I was just wondering that. It would scratch the itch!
---
So when you said
---
&gt;you aren't guaranteed the drop
---
you were referring to what exactly?
---
Lok'tar ogar
---
Here you go, buddy: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States
---
This would make absolutely no sense. I really wonder if it's correct.
---
Bro I love you for that
---
As soon as you get sword specialisation in the combat tree, swords will be better than any other weapon type. Unless of course the mace is just significantly better than the sword.
---
There would be a bigger audience for between now and August 26th than there will be after.
---
PoM and arcane power is the standard pve build for mages so yea lots of people are gonna go that spec unless they respec to farming spec or PvP spec
---
I'm not sure, played horde for 14 years, I did play a gnome lock back in 2005, but only just reached 60 before I rolled horde and been there ever since. 
---
I don't remember a single alliance quest, would be fun to do them for once, and remembering them, instead of the horde ones which I've done 50 plus times. 
---
But you can't abandon the horde. But this post made me realise how brutal and corrupt the alliance is, which kinda turned me on a bit, and if I go horde it's stuck with ud lock, or maybe orc lock for a change.. but they are so big... but everyone will be undead... and the raid spots. Bah
---
Guess they are waiting for blizzcon so they can have one more announcement to fill in the gaps.
---
No one have said that attack power doesn't increase melee dmg, except for you with "" for some reason.
---
The coefficient of Arcane Shot is only like 42% as well, so it doesn't even get all of that spell damage.
---
Classic+ is a shot in the dark, it would require tons of resources and there’s no indication that it would be 10x more successful than tbc, it’s even unclear if it will be popular at all.
---
And get kicked for rolling dps gear.
---
Not really. Because that is what most people will do. So you won't break out of the pack this early.
---
Tested this on fresh private servers and the stress test. 
---
But ofc a handful of people will get lucky and get ahead on these early levels.
---
Roll Demonic Sacrifce spec. Never worry about pets again. Gain free +10% shadow dmg for those sweet Shadow bolt crits!
---
 [https://www.npl.co.uk/](https://www.npl.co.uk/)  Got an answer to my question, even if it's not fullfilling. 12am/pm has no set definition but is conventionally used as you guys did
---
What bis? The whole set is bis for phase 4
---
Every paladin skill but ranged attacks like hunter #nochangesexceptremovehunterandpaladin
---
Anyone trying to decide between mage and warlock should choose mage.  That way us warlocks will continue to enjoy lower loot competition :)
---
I'd love to, if I could buy it.
---
GET A JOB"GRAND MARSHALL!
---
It depends on from what perspective you look at it. To please the oldschool audience yeah u would probably have to provide it exactly how it was because they are hardcore "no changes". But its the actual gameplay that keeps people locked and draws new player in. The same reason why absolutely nobody is screaming for anything past lfr introduction because they know an original version of cataclysm is no fun,  it doesnt provide a close to perfect mmo experience.
---
I did not say ninja your gear. I mean WORK for your gear, by healing. That way you don't have to get carried.
---
You can just take gear others don't need, or make it known upfront that you will roll on spell dmg gear. Or do both. Also, mages and locks aint gonna roll on any leather with spell dmg.
---
I would love being able to play through the Reforged campaigns right about now. I may not feel llike playing it while knee-deep in Classic.
---
shaman tanking ...
---
If you are going for fantasy or RPG vibes, then definitely go Druid or warlock! 
---
The quest chains regarding your abilities are interesting and (for me on my warlock) it made me kinda build a connection to my pets! 
---
Mages are definitely fun and good as well but as the other comment said, Mages in a fantasy game are often more plain.
---
All three of those are good or relevant as you called it. 
---
Paladins (alliance only) are also alright on their fantasy and they are great if you prioritize ease of access more.
---
Take that with a grain of salt though as this is the warlock thread so most people suggesting u something here probably main warlock :P. (And my other char is a Druid.)
---
Yea, but that will manifest into "please changes" over time. I don't really see a difference, just a platform for the same drama.
---
&gt;  Is it unreasonable that a quest-hub that was added to vanilla in the same patch as a major raid (containing catchup gear) be availible in classic at the same phase as the corresponding raid?
---
Catch up gear?  For low levels?  I don't think that's the right term you're looking for.  It's just a new quest hub.  And yes, I would say unless they specifically stated that it was going to be gated it is a little out there to assume it is.  They have stated numerous times about there plan on gating things and if they haven't mentioned it yet, then that's should be your sign.
---
There would be no reason for them NOT to mention it in any of these instances.
---
Obligatory
---
By how much? I doubt many turbo nerds want to replay fancier Warcraft before Classic. It's not like you can't play the old Warcraft unlike Vanilla right now.
---
Current games and games in development are more important and valuable then remastered rts from 17 years ago. That's just the reality.
---
Epic mount quest doesnt come until phase 2 remember.  With alch+herb in phase 1 you could stand to make your 1000g for a normal epic mount quite quickly.
---
The problem was 4HM. You needed 8 tanks (so 8 warriors :P) and most of them should have 4 items from T3 (+hit for taunt). 
---
You needed to rotate the tanks so often (and thus taunting so much) and a failed taunt usually lead to a wipe (you could recover once / twice with challenging shout and hope the 2nd taunt hits, but well...). 
---
And this was a situation that most guilds weren't prepared for. Basically no one had that many (geared) tanks. 
---
So top guilds "recruited" geared tanks from lesser guilds with the promise of clearing Naxx. Those lesser guilds just lost their geared tanks and thus 4HM and thus clearing Naxx became even more distant. Especially with TBC around the corner. 
---
My guild only managed to clear Naxx, because we joined raids with another top guild on our server so we had enough geared tanks. It was good enough for the few IDs before TBC was released, but basically having 2 full hardcore raid rosters and only one raid was not something that could've been sustained for much longer.
---
Metin2 - the irony is that my mother didn't allow me to play WoW because it costs so much money.
---
Man I pumped hundreds of Euros into Metin2.
---
I always used the felhound with dark pact, fairly sure the felhound has a better mana pool?
---
Locks don't counter Spriest I'm sorry to tell you.  With SL/SL its basically a wash.  With shadow protection they do so little damage to you all you have to do is survive and oom them and you win.
---
How does troll with berserking factor in with common raid mainhand buffs like windfury.
---
The extra attack speed should proceed WF far more frequently giving a further edge to trolls.
---
Tailor + skinning while leveling.  I am gonna swap skinning for eng @ 60.
---
I come to this sub to hear people complain about other people not complaining correctly
---
Thank you for your answer mate!
---
It’s funny, because I unknowingly totally ruled out other roles (which shows you really read and understood my question, you’re such an absolute bro for that!). 
---
I guess what I’m looking for is a class that’s able to... become a main? Something that’s not too heavily focused on one thing, so I won’t be like “ah... but that class has that and ughh...” if you know what I mean.
---
I feel like I’m just rambling at this point and I’m sorry for that. I guess I’m just desperately trying to find a class, lol :(
---
Exactly! I can play 1-2 hours regularly. Nearly every day. However I can’t block off whole nights during the week. Or make a commitment to weekends cause things just come up. I wana mostly PvP and slowly acquire decent gear.
---
&gt; The group that does the opposite to your instructions will play the game longer and more of them will reach level 60 and end-game.
---
I would not count on that. Just because most of you are 100% endgame focused does not mean there aren't people thoroughly enjoying the moderate way to 60. Instead of criticising my opinion, which I already said was my \*\*opinion\*\* and no universal truth to all the mysteries of the universe, you could just make a comment to OP (if you haven't yet) with your own opinion and the golden rules that you think are important and let OP and others just make up their minds by scanning through all the comments.
---
Lol which pve fight with stuns?
---
Hardiness is almost exclusively a PvP racial.
---
Let's pray the announcement isn't "on mobil phones only" 😂
---
Probably a field where math is already heavily involved or a bored white collar worker.
---
You missed.. all of it? There's too much to really go over in 1 post if you've bee living under a rock for the last 2 years.
---
Right now Blizz is quiet because there really isn't alot to talk about. Beta is over and everything has been discussed at length. I assume the next post we get from Blizzard on the subject will be a date with the final stress test and then something with final preparations for launch.
---
"We're home boys"

---
Its not a burst spec. You have enough mana to outlast 1 person. Then you are oom, but they are dead.
---
r/theydidthemonstermath
---
Around 10-20% for the six months following its availability sounds right. Not accounting for a long tail and dropping playerbase.
---
When given more time to complete/carry, and more of the non-raiders drop subscription the number will naturally inflate.
---
Pretty much all the time, even when you're the last to join the party and on the other side of the world. People are lazy and entitled.
---
Hahaha shit, this is some wild west shit.
---
Well didn't knew that, i only managed to kill shazzrah in mc. Well i was 13 years old then
---
Druids last long, but they dont outlast because they still are the ones dying in the end.
---
As much as this seems deliberate, I highly doubt this is anything other than a coincidence.
---
They are much more worried about getting a proper stress test done and wouldn't go out of their way to screw the devs over and the time they have to finish the game over this.
---
Nice meme!
---
I have a similiar experience. I wanted to play Classic. I asked my brother because he played it when I was smol so I couldn't play with him. He wants to play out of Nostalgia, for me it's kinda both (TBC/Wotlk baby), Nostalgia + new Experience (better than BfA at least). My brother only played Horde back then.
---
Afterwards asked my Cousins and some friends. Friends don't care about Horde/Alliance (just like me, I like both), but my brother sticks to Horde.
---
Cousins are hyped, totally wanted to play anyways, just had not decided on anything yet. Some of their friends want to play, too (by now I know a few, not known most of them before). Some want Alliance, some Horde, some don't care.
---
Good thing for me is, that I like the Horde Races more and I don't have to decide anymore, as I'm set with my bro. It can be really tricky for people to decide.But I'm certain we'll go all the Horde way and slap some Humans.
---
Thesaurus.com gettin some views today.
---
500? I sold that for a cool 900g back in vanilla. That was a good day.
---
Your copypasta isn't funny.
---
I'm looking forward to his part 3 update on shaman kill speed with proper rotation an for elemental and enhance, not spamming useless totems while grinding.
---
His math on weapon enhancements is excellent though.
---
No, you made a personal attack. Nice try.
---
Interesting, because [this site](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/) only would include the Vest for Phase 4 BiS. If you were to wear the 3 peice, what all would you change from that site and would it be better in the end?
---
DS is 15%. You're probably thinking of shadow mastery, which is 10%.
---
&gt;It was definitely more popular within the community. Stop being a try hard
---
Why would you skip the starter zone quests and miss out on all the fun and rep of the starter zone chaos? Isn't that part of the experience? It will never happen again. I'd enjoy the ride.
---
If you really want to skip *playing* during the top chaos, log in at release, get your addons and UI right quit, go to sleep and log in again in the early morning.
---
In the early morning, most people that have played through the night will have gone to bed, die-hards no-sleepers will be out of the starter zones and you can level in peace. Up till the mass wakes up again of course.
---
Once you go shaman....you never go back.  I played one at high levels from TBC on, and now I am going back to righting my wrong.  I regret not playing shaman in Vanilla.
---
NOW IS MY TIME TO RISE AS THE ALL POWER WINDFURY TOTEM SLUT...err I mean shaman. :)
---
Robes of the Archmage.
---
That site is not really accurate
---
Tailor, do the craft, reroll engineer.
---
Bugged in what way? I've mained a warlock since cata and I haven't noticed them being bugged. Nit saying they aren't just that I didn't know
---
Start 3-4 hours after Release and do a 24h Session could be the key to a smooth start.
---
Maybe redditors will have a higher % indeed. But generally, 90% is my guess, even among "proper" players who genuinely want to play Classic, not taking 3-hours retail tourists into account.
---
60fps isn't peasantry. Don't misuse pcmr terms.
---
BiS is a goal, not a requirement.  Only greater potection potions are needed.  This is MC on patch 1.12, not patch 1.3.  This is content with 300 guide videos.  The likelihood that people who reach 60 in two weeks and are attuned have raided MC many times before is quite high.  Clearing Molten Core will be a complete joke.
---
Hey guys i'll be playing wow classic with 2 friends and was about to play warlock. However they both want to play warlock as well so i'm considering other classes. I'm attracted to shaman (elementalist and enhancement) and balance druid. How are these classes doing in a raid environment and PvP (BG and open) ? It looks like balance druid is garbage and i don't want to be forced to respec heal, is it true ? How about Shaman ?
---
Finished WC2 expansion to scratch the itch. Better for a nostalgia fix. But anyways, if you want a nostalgia fix with WC3 play the original. No point playing the new one, no feelings attached there.
---
Alliance has better leveling zones come at me
---
&gt;If you want to fight over tags and low drop rate items for several hours, you do you. Have fun. I'll be over here doing my thing, tho.
---
I can't be really bothered by it. It's a one time thing that may never come back... Part of the experience. Maybe it will become annoying after a while, but then you can always go the fed-ex route.
---
They promised a beta for spring '19 at Blizzcon... haven't heard from it again since.
---
PvE or PvP server?  If the latter, do you plan on partaking in some wPvP shenanigans?  If so, you might want to go Shadow for those levels.  The utility of MF, Silence, longer SW:P, even the +hit really helps.
---
If its PvE, go with the play style you prefer.
---
I think you complete the blue set at rank 10, and from what I understand it's fairly easy to get. The longest part of that grind will be waiting for the honor system and BG's to release.
---
They thought we'd think we did, but we didn't think they thought we did think we did.
---
The extra skill points built into Mace Spec will certainly help, especially against higher level mobs and also when your weapon skill has not yet maxed out for your level. Leveling those last few skill points at each level can take a while, so having the extra weapon skill built into the talent is definitely useful.
---
You insulted me. " Haha you're insecure. I called you stupid. What? That's not an insult!"
---
Yeah but you get the doggo much later than the succ and succ has more dps I think
---
Very nice! And yeah It's going to be very interesting to see the final product, can't wait!
---
yeah Just finished a lock recently on a private server and even if you're the farthest away, or last to join the group - the assumption is that "well you HAVE to get to the dungeon to do it and so does the rest of the group... so when they all get there they can just summon me" well when everyone assumes this, guess what - no one goes to the dungeon. I usually just get one of the other members of the group to be firm and say we are not summoning so drop if youre not gonna head over yourself. Now once we all head there maybe one person in good faith was making their way over and we can summon, or if i am close or dont mind a lazy run ill go out of my way and say if 2 more come we can summon (and usually makes people like and remember you). just find a good mix between the two and you'll be fine. that being said, lock in vanilla is a bit annoying in that you ALWAYS need to have shards (and give up bag space for shards). It's not necessarily as big of a nuisance as you might think, but there are times when you definitely do notice it
---
I would be real into a remastered version of Warcraft II, but that’s because it was the first Warcraft game I ever played. That orchestral soundtrack is the stuuuuff.
---
Bandages were probably the biggest change from Vanilla to a privateserver. I went through atleast a stack each raid in Vanilla(warlock though), a stack on a pserver lasted months for me. 
---
I think Firemaw was the only point where I ever needed to bandage.
---
What do you mean, "Do the craft"?
---
At three seconds, that's a pretty situational.  95-98% of the time you stun a mob you'll be happy with the result.  Worst comes to worst, if you are pulling a specific mob you simply can't risk stunning, that's what Smite/wands are for.
---
Just throwing numbers out, 20% will clear AQ40 and 10% will clear Naxx.
---
As Alliance the group run to SFK + SM on a PvP server made you a damn team before you even started the dungeons.
---
This is what annoys me more than anything else. I'm not personally interested in World of Warcraft 3 with uncanny valley art style yet, they have been consistently screwing with WC3 and it's caused huge problems. Everything from literally fucking up the registry for some PCs to garbage like this. It's so incredibly obnoxious that they're screwing around with WC3 and keep breaking it.
---
Not respected in Raiding, right? I'm not sure how much Raiding I plan to actually do.
---
I heard that too, have any better sources to share for mages?
---
To build on some issues with that site, Some items from patch 1.5 are listed as BiS in phase 2 but I think it's tough to say what phase 1.5 gear will be in. Although Kazzak and Azuregos were added in 1.3, their loot tables, along with MC, were added to in 1.5. So I wonder if 1.5 gear will be in phase 2 or 3.
---
Haha that has been my vision leading up to launch. Maybe I'll put Shaman as a bank mule and level him up eventually.
---
Attention people who make meme bingo cards: the middle space in bingo is a free space. Stop doing this.
---
Wrong, Judgement set is the best looking set Vanilla had to offer and it’s alliance only
---
Like some have mentioned already, Robes of the Archmage (tailoring BoP) are BiS for you, at least until phase 4, when they get replaced with Bloodvine Vest (which is also tailoring, but BoE).
---
If you volunteer to be your guild’s tailor, you could probably get help with cloth.

Happy cake day

The logic here doesn't make much sense to me, as far as I'm aware pve has prio over pvp and since I'd be using the weapon in pve it's just a happenstance that it works for pvp too
---
I'll probably not play in a guild full of min maxers, which wouldn't even allow 2h fury in any case so that's just kind of irrelevant
---
Druids CAN find things in a 15 year old layering!
---
I'm confused here as well... possible trolling?
---
Just don’t play a meme spec and you’ll get all the friends you need
---
Don’t try it
---
If you've never played before, go in blind!!!
---
You will never get that opportunity again, don't waste it by looking at resources.
---
It's all been convoluted with private server statistics. I want to hold out hope and say killing mobs can be decent, especially implementing some mining/skinning routes in there.
---
Your honesty is appreciated!
---
Everyone is entitled to their own wrong opinions.
---
See you at red ridge and the wet lands, I guess lul
---
Different strokes, different folks I say. Reputation was a fascinating part of the community during vanilla. Can't wait to hop back in.
---
Alliance main here always have been always will be, or so I thought, fast forward nearly 15 years and I’ve got a new circle of friends and they are all rolling horde. So my choice is now, roll horde and play with all my friends or roll alliance and play alone. Needless to say I’m excited to experience the barrens for the first time, but I’m devastated I don’t get to chill in SW and IF.
---
its BIS over t1/t2/t3? 
---
So basically, I should run tailoring and mining. Level everything up, once i do the craft tailoring offers drop it for eng and use what I mined on engineering.
---
Factual, alliance need to be reminded.
---
I think any of the Scarlet Monastery dungeons are decent farms if I remember right.
---
When you say "playing with others" do you mean a group?  It does look like "normal" Dungeon clearing might be a thing in classic.  The mob XP was higher in Beta than it is on Classic servers, so while you may have heard all the talk of Cleaving through dungeons, I think just efficiently running them with a group might also be a net leveling increase....espeically if zones are really crowded early.  
---
So running RFC from 12-16, do some quests in the Barrens and get all your WC quests, then do that from like 19-23, then switch to SFK, then switch to BFD, etc. might be faster than leveling shadow.
---
Hope TBC doesn't launch at all lol
---
Ignore any raid ideas after Ulduar, None of this 10/25 man, 2 modes, and especially the limited tries on ICC, release Halion with ToC not after ICC.
---
And remove the Oculus. Fuck that. I still to this day haven't seen a dungeon where people insta-leave if it's picked.
---
Make Wotlk Naxx also require 8 warrior tanks for pure banter.
---
I leveled both factions to end game, and certain alliance zones stick out to me but overall the vast desert quality of kalimdor really draws me in. Duskwood is the shit, though. One of the best zones imo.
---
RWF?
---
Plenty of US companies have vacation days. Most companies start our with 10 days when you first come on. Some companies you earn additional days off every month you are employed. For example, when I started at this software company I earned 10 days per year. Every month I was employed I earned something a faction of a day off. So the first month of employment I earned .8 days off or something. A few years in i'm earning 1.7 days off per month. It will cap at 2 days paid vacation earned per month and it rolls over year to year so if I wanted to take a month off during the summer its entirely possible. 
---
tldr: learn in demand skills, find better companies and negotiate your contracts better.
---
I love the Sealab 2021 reference at 13:54
---
ZG classe trinket won't be out until phase 4, and by then better gear will be out.
---
No, it does not. There is No difference between kiting at the 9yard Radius and kiting at a 4yard Radius except you Need More space. 
---
For Every Hit, you run barely Into the given range, and Run Out B4 the Monsters can Hit you a Second time.
---
Leeway is the same distance for you and the Mob. It doesnt affect your runspeed EG the ability to get Out of range after you hit.
---
Ive tried this before and arms dmg is just ass, just find a guild thatll be okay with you being arms when the raid is on farm. Arms takes a debuff and does like a quarter of the dps. Also if your horde 2handers should be defaulted to the full time furys, especially bre because its their bis till cthun
---
Yes, as a priest or Druid that doesn’t really need to use cloth on bandages, you might as well craft bags and also cloth gear for enchanting.  Offer to make bags in exchange for cloth to skill up fast, most people will take that deal on a fresh server, and you can ask for more cloth than the recipe requires.
---
Wierd, I would make the opposite conclusion... If you will respect anyway, why not play with holy spells a bit?
---
Yo bro beat down, slam, downtempo, deathcore. You name it I'm into that shit, still on ally though but not like religiously, still play horde half the time.
---
&gt; Its not about the keybinds
---
&gt;Frees 2 very very good keybinding keys
---
If you do research and/or follow level guides, you will be one of the 10% that actually does so and be ahead pretty fast. Most people will go in more or less blind. Blind in the sense that they will have gobbled up all the youtube content on classic and read all the guides, but once they're in, they forget about all that, completionist disorder sets in, bag full=return to vendor routines sets in, talking to other players becomes a thing and before you know it, you will be ahead if you stick to the plan ;-)
---
Haven't found much priest specific content myself, Ooze and Kala come to mind, let me know if you know anyone else.
---
Even better!
---
3 to 4 less weeks
---
Lol no, the crafting charge won’t even come close to the price of leveling from 1-300.
---
As long as your willing to farm gnomer non stop feral is pretty acceptable dps, atleast compared to the other meme specs
---
Victory or Death !
---
No way to ever play the kid's faction.
---
Hehe I like you thinking. I play both because I like the variation tbh. Why stick to one faction. I only put this flair on because that will be my main when classic rolls out
---
Just wait until addons that mimic Dungeon Finder come out. Personally, I can't wait because I have very specific goals, but some players are going to be so mad!
---
IT'S JUST A JOKE, CHILL OUT.
---
God this reddit is filled with edgy min-maxers who actually never top DPS and are just pretentious AF.
---
It gets a little less annoying in my mind when you consider that everyone who is posting is likely just really excited for this game.
---
My sincere hope is they went back to the drawing board on reforged and are overhauling their graphics 'overhaul'.  I did not like what I saw at blizzcon.
---
It will prob take me until Phase II to get to 60 realistically.
---
This is so true. For over a year I was raiding 5-6 nights a week. I would come home from work, eat something, raid, go to bed, go to work.
---
Did you not have a priest channel where you guys talked about what rank healing/gheal to cast or something?  I know we did so I assumed most people would (although it wouldn't surprise me if some priests in my guild still didn't downrank).
---
Ryan used me as an object!
---
You don't even need to be on at release day. All you need to do is play \*more\* than the zerg. It's why I took a couple of weeks off. Sure, I will be in the zerg on day 1,2 and 3, but as more people have to go back to work again, I will start running ahead.
---
You can't enjoy playing Classic unless you hate the opposing faction.
---
It's like a rule.
---
Yeah that makes sense, I was planning on rolling horde but all my friends are going ally, and same as dont really like humans and spent most if my time on retail as a gnome, so dwarf it is.
---
You cannot reduce a target's resistance below zero, but there are creatures whose base resistance to a specific school is negative, thus they take bonus vulnerability damage. For example the Tar Lords in Un'Goro Crater.
---
I mean the bovine connotations were pretty passé, but being called ugly on top... that's an excruciating humiliation and where the line is drawn.
---
Bitch, I'm fabulous. Now go roll something that amoeba on Saturn would find dull.
---
Everytime someone asks if Classic should see some changes, some Gonk loving morons jumps on his high Loa and preaches how WoW vanilla/TBC/Wrath was perfect and no improvements are needed. News flash. The game was no where near prefect. It had a ton of problems. And I would one would love to see Classic come out as a better version of it self, with some much needed improvements.
---
The stun effect only comes into play when going for maces specialization though. So either way, you will be limiting yourself to either weapon type.
---
It is a trade-off, you have a 1-5% chance for additional damage or for a stun that will reduce the damage to you. So what type is better for leveling probably mostly depends on what weapons are available during leveling and how their attributes compare. But I cannot comment on what way would be better (with identical weapon stats) as I have never played a mace rogue.
---
But since you asked me personally: I would rather have the chance for extra damage.
---
I wouldnt say that, itll be dependent on what char I'm playing. If im rolling my main then sure death to all horde, if I'm rolling a horde alt then death to alliance. PVP all the way bro.
---
To me horse zones are just sand and grass.. boring
---
Retail world first
---
most peeps will have quest addons ;-)
---
Ah, early game you get ridden by rogues, hunters and warriors.
---
For all expansions:
---
* Remove the immediate power spike of gear. (i.e. raid epics replaced by level \~62)
---
   * This reduces the future need of ilevel/power reduction.
---
* Reduce the power creep/ilevel at max level by reducing raid difficulties/size. (Mostly a WotLK)
---
   * As a hard core raider in WotLK, I got burned out by having a main and alt raid for 10H, 25N, 25H. It was a pain during ICC. Really preffered the Ulduar raid model with only one locout for difficulty, although still had multiple raids to due size.
---
Feral is condidered viable now on pservers thanks to salad bakers
---
COMMUNITY.
---
You fucking knew the dickheads on your server, you knew the nice guys, the boosters, the gankers, who enchants stuff, who is a top guild, you constantly found people you saw leveling days ago with you. People talked. 
---
Want to go to SFK as Alliance? be sure to enjoy your 30 minutes of banter while you run (and die to horde). 1 of that group is bad? Teach them instead of flame and kick because GL finding a replacement quickly, groups and guilds feel better due to the NEED of having to group, even for quests. 
---
Being forced into a situation where you need to work together inherently makes the game less toxic, unless you ninja loot, because unlike other team games (LoL, RL, CSGO etc) once the group/game ends these people will still be around and people quickly learn. It's great.
---
You want engineering.
---
Yeah I was gonna say, harder to find a BS that can make what you want than it is to afford the fee :P
---
Nothing says immersion like getting smacked by Mor'ladim
---
My favorite zones are Thousand Needles and Azshara, sand and grass for me.
---
You don't farm world drops, that's an exercise in futility. Unless you mean farming the hundreds of gold for it, in that case you're better off buying the slightly worse Sword of Zeal which usually goes for under 80g, and save the remaining gold for your epic mount and Devilsaur set.
---
Oh wow didn't know anyone cared any more.
---
I don't think I would call Vael a tank and spank (maybe not even broodlord).  Both of those fights have multiple tanks and transitioning from tank to tank without a DPS getting aggro was usually the problem. I think most of MC would qualify as better "tank and spank" with the exception of maybe the drakes (which were tank and spanks with an occasional OT taunting on a timer).
---
Speed run lists? What would be the point of that?
---
I don't think most folks do
---
You should watch Madseasonshow’s video on Nostalgia:
---
https://youtu.be/bLXwtkl6CnQ
---
I check the Bnet every other day, waiting for WC3 Reforged to hit before Classic, so I can at least have something to do until August 27th.
---
By now, my hopes are dead. I will play WC3 Reforged in Winter probably, because I don't see it being launched before Blizzcon.
---
Dual-Spec in Classic for sure. I don't have time to grind money anymore just to respec each time I jump from Raiding to PvP.
---
You have the option of going Tailoring to get the chest and then simply dropping it and grinding alchemy.  
---
The thing is, in neither scenario you're presented do you have herbalism, which means you'll have to buy your way up both alchemy and engineering. Which is fine if you make enough money but given that you don't have enough time to raid I doubt it.  
---
If you do have enough money, dropping tailoring won't be even the slightest problem since it won't make any difference at all to how quickly you level alch/engi.
---
IIRC Rag's knockback reduces the threat of the targets hit by 50%. Of course the tank can just taunt when he gets back so its not really a problem.
---
Alchemy really doesn't need to be on your main.
---
Skinning is the only prof without significant delays to 60 to level. Herb is second least delaying, and makes best cash of the gathering profs.
---
Mine will be Mage or Rogue, Mage is more fun in Bg's but honestly we all have thought about being a good for nothing rogue ganking lowbies of the enemy faction. In a way, people like Redridge boss bring people together and create stories of players which is huge part of Vanilla.
---
Just don't pick Horde.
---
You reckon it’s a subcontious thing?
---
Go and google the 1.5 patch notes, thats when they made it impossible to outrange Rag's knockback and still be able to hit him even if you're tauren.
---
The game was designed for a 3k concurrency so they'll have to offer multiple servers
---
I’m looking forward to activating me three free days this weekend for some fun. Been ages since I logged into WoW.
---
Any class quests, especially mount ones. 
---
Oh and Westfall Chicken.
---
They are using classic as a free increase in subs to look back at investors and say SEE PEOPLE STILL PLAY YOU SEE wink wink nudge nudge $$$$$$$$$$$$$is all that matters
---
I sure hope not, that's 259156 years
---
Vael: Tank and spank, make sure you're below secondary tank in threat as DPS. Run away when you get Burning Adrenaline (only mechanic).
---
Broodlord: Tank and spank plus the suppression room. Hits tank very hard.
---
Firemaw: Tank and spank. Move out of his LoS when his fire damage taken debuff stacks too high (anywhere between 5-10, depending on what your healers feel they can deal with).
---
Ebonroc: Tank and spank. Taunt when first tank gets Shadow of Ebonroc.
---
Flamegor: Tranq when he does fire AoE.
---
Broodlord: Tank needs to keep their back to the wall to help mitigate knockbacks.
---
Nefarian is a tank and spank with adds. Kill adds at start, tank and spank, deal with warlock class call, deal with adds at 20%, finish the fight.
---
You can lifetap--&gt;hellfire to death and not take durability damage
---
You missed the "wanted to roll a hunter, but..." posts
---
This sub is literally boredom so I'm not sure why you are surprised.
---
&gt; It's not like you can't play the old Warcraft 
---
You can't buy it currently, which annoys me to no end. A friend gave it to me as a kid and I've been wanting to replay it. Don't care for fancy new graphics, I want the original experience.
---
The only place that still sells it are shady sites like G2A, but prefer to not shop from there.
---
Every raid has that guy
---
The guy who has a reason/excuse for everything, and HAS to describe it to you
---
"Sorry I was having a sneezing fit" nobody gives a shit get in position
---
"I'm gonna try I was continuously stunned" are you fucking kidding me I hope your push to talk button isn't impeding your attempt to battle rez somebody
---
I can’t belive so many people loved Wrath.  I think WoW peaked in TBC.  TBC was insanely fun.  I quit shortly into Wrath.  Can’t remember exactly what it was that killed it.  Dailies?
---
I take your question.
---
Hmm okay thanks for your thoughts.
---
Maybe I will go skinning/mining and save the ore. Then drop skinning for engi after 40, and then eventually drop mining for tailoring? I figure as a higher level mage low level cloth will be easy to AoE farm
---
Dude what a cool idea! Definitely going to look into this!
---
I miss dungeons actually being challenging. I miss having to use CC and strategy.
---
In retail, every dungeon is a cakewalk outside of the Mythic+ mode (which I find incredibly boring and dull. The scaling damage/health is not a fun/exciting way to increase difficulty).
---
1% drop though though :(
---
if you dont think the barrens is the best zone in the game in any expansion u wont be missed. go deliver some love letters for grandma or some of the other ally quests.
---
Not easy to get, takes 100 runs or more ..
---
This tool looks incredible! I'm planning on playing with my dad and he's not great on maths but absolutely loves to plan his character out and to look at every piece of gear he's going to get and I can see it being really useful.
---
Obviously you have a lot of plans for it but I was wondering if you plan to have a way of adding item suffixes? For example in phase one, some really good items are things like the drakestone of frozen wrath or shadow wrath for mage and warlock respectively. Also there are a lot of green shadow wrath pieces that compete for BIS too.
---
Regardless, your efforts are much appreciated!
---
The TBC and Wrath fans deserve to keep their games preserved just as much as we deserve to keep vanilla preserved.
---
I have a theory that they delayed it to have it coincide pretty closely with the name reserve date on August 12/13.
---
They'll have far more people subbed at that point to really do a good stress test.
---
I've tried both factions now and I have to say Alliance questing is more stream lined and planned and Alliance cities have better design and detail (under city is pretty darn good) 
---
The only good thing about the horde is their loyalty to the faction and their angry bias against the alliance drives them to play harder in PvP. 
---
If you want top notch PVE go alliance. If you want top notch PVP go horde.
---
Gnome is without a doubt the master race and the most immersive race in vanilla
---
Herbalism/Tailoring
---
Robe of the Void at 60
---
Idk what after that. I'd like to think I'll take up engineering.
---
Guild Banks.
---
Paying is always cheaper
---
Guild banks
---
Nalnip
---
They outsourced the art to China. There’s no vision.
---
Build Ganks.
---
Because it isn't finished?
---
Horde.. maybe WF beats out druids for horde. And yeah I’m aware of the pros and cons for both but I always thought in terms of threat warriors always won significantly. In a 30 second fight a druid generates more threat than a warrior?! Our guild was min maxing super overly tryhard ha so if we could have killed bosses faster we almost certainly would have let the Druid tank.
---
agreed
---
reforged is ugly and redundant since wc3 still plays and looks good. why couldn't they have tackled wc2 instead?
---
Subscribe.
---
Well you are probably right. 
---
But it wouldn’t make sense to push the stress test as close to the launch as possible would it?
---
I mean I agree with you about getting to know numbers before announcing servers etc.
---
But if the test provides several problems that needs a good fix before launch a time frame of 3 weeks prior would actually make more sense. In that time they might fix the issues, but if they do it one week prior to launch they wouldn’t have the time to fix stuff.
---
Sincerely the guy not on the dev team.
---
Yeah retail has no 'staying' power with community and player actions. As a healer in Classic you lived on reputation and skill, in retail it's just do what ever the fuck you want when you want. Most 5 mans I'm #2 in dps as a holy priest though, so the average player is barely awake while playing retail (something I think is impossible in Classic).
---
In retail if I have life stuff come up and I have to leave in a hurry It's not problem,  'hey guys sorry gotta run have fun' and leave without thinking. I would never have imagined doing that in classic, the time commitment alone. I remember multiple times if I had to leave a dungeon early I would spend 10-20 minutes looking for a replacement healer before I left them.
---
Is this a new copypasta?
---
not op, but warlocks have next to zero downtime and are considered one of the best levelers.  probably #2 to hunter.  I'm not 100% on biggest counter, but I would guess rogue for stunlocking or warriors for their fear protection ability.  I believe warlocks are considered one of the best dueling classes at 60 so can definitely hold their own 1v1.  PVP wise one of the catches will just be having the right pet out for the right encounter and, like any class, not getting caught when low on health/mana from doing PVE stuff already.
---
Heyyyy thats what i was going to say!
---
lvl 4
---
Blood Fury has already been tested on Classic and it works the same as pservers.
---
Physical DPS multipliers, both positive and negative (hit, crit, glancing blows, target's armor...) do not change the relative percentual DPS increase caused by additional attack power - the only thing that changes this is baseline DPS from additive stats (attack power) or non-physical sources (poisons, oils, sappers...).
---
There are three posssible scenarios where the gap between orc and forsaken could be different than on pservers:
---
1)Attack power gained from other sources than strength and agility (so pure +AP from items and buffs) is significantly higher than on pservers.
---
2)Non-physical sources of rogue DPS provide a significantly higher percentage of your total DPS than on pservers.
---
3)Attack power doesn't increase physical damage on Classic.
---
Which is it?
---
New copypasta boys.
---
If you are not usually the smartest person in the room about priest and wow in general you can forget about being shadow. One shadow priest per raid even when they are viable and odds are it won’t be you. Don’t go priest unless you will have fun healing or don’t trust me and be stuck healing at 60 lol
---
Pretty much anyone can clear naxx if they stay interested in the game. But whether or not they will is impossible to say. One of the big reasons naxx wasn't cleared/progressed by many, is because TBC was announced early and few had any real motivations to grind out naxx.
---
Skarm is going druid phase 1 to tank because they are superior in every manner at that gear level and they dont take much loot from MC.  Easier to gear a bear than the 4-6 tank warriors initially.
---
Troll scales worse with raid buffs
---
If forced I would really like Mythic + Dungeons, and I do NOT want Titanforging or Warforging or better gear at the end of them, I would like them as purely a way to time yourself through a dungeon with a group. Maybe some sort of reward for +5, 10 15 whatever  but probably cosmetic if that ... 
---
To me they were the best addition to retail in a long time for the PvE scene and just the comps, strats and enjoyment out of essentially a speedrun was a great pace change from raids for PvE'rs.
---
Great breakdown on your edit, I really appreciate the info and the link.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
 + the fee of a few keyboard if you plan on lava runs
---
Not sure if it's a typo or not but you'll need herbalism instead of alchemy to farm mats
---
Unfortunately me too :(
---
Not just the travel to a dungeon but the fighting to get to the entrance that needs to happen a lot.  I forget, can you zone in with aggro?  I am remembering that you cannot.
---
I remember that my raid frames took about twice the space of the video OP posted (4 groups on the left, 4 groups on the right), a recount healing meter and scrolling combat text in the middle. Basically the entire screen was full of stuff, it was a clusterfuck and I loved it :)
---
OP asked which robes to get in place of robe of the archmage.  
---
Vslice linked the 2nd-bis pre-raid robes. A discussion about whether tailoring was needed for the robes and the epic robes supposedly being pricy followed thereafter. Vslice stated they aren't that pricy and that the materials are easy to farm.
---
I then stated that 50-100g is not a lot of gold for a mage, nor is it a big time investment and you then stated the following: 
---
&gt;running a dungeon more than likely takes longer too and you aren't guaranteed the drop
---
That's what lead me to inquire about what you said, and since then you haven't really given me a straight answer.
---
Are you seriously trying to rush it out?  
---
Why would you do that? Let it be out when its finished.
---
Ganks Build
---
True, I saw that, but even Skarm said that while most bosses can be tanked by a feral, a warrior is better for most. So as I want to play a hybrid, I'm happy to let a warrior do the main tanking, unless It's a fight where the feral is better.
---
What about spell penetration?
---
Taking 50 days of in game time to hit 60.
---
It's actually 83 dps...
---
We could always go back to talking about layering.
---
Vaulty is a low effort clickbait channel to say the least.
---
1. Always carry 25 soul shards on you and replenish while grouping. One healthstone --&gt; one soulshard for everyone in your 5-man, 10-man.
---
2. Until DeathCoil (instant-cast, 3-second horror effect) you're a sitting duck while leveling. Take **engineering** or buy swiftness/free action potions. The stun from bombs, rocket boots, Swiftness Potions, anything really, will help you deal with open-world pvp.
---
3. At 60, you'll use your **imp** 75+% of the time in groups for the Health Buff. (It stacks with Priest Fortitude.) 5-man groups might be a bit disappointed if you  say you can't because of your demonology spec.
---
4. You an solo basically **anything** if it can be feared. Also, once you get Curse of Exhaustion, you can kite basically any elite as long as they don't leash   
---
back to their spawn point.
---
5. Once you get your epic mount quest, the parts to summon the final quest in Dire Maul are worth \~250g or more. You can charge warlocks for you to start the quest event in Dire Maul, which saves them gold.
---
6. Curse of Recklessness reduces enemy armor, but it ALSO makes them fear immune. You **can semi-safely fear enemies in dungeons** if you pay close attention and put CoR on them when they get to close to other mobs. Right before the mob comes back to kill you, put another curse on it and Fear will resume.
---
7. Tailors can make level \~40 shadow damage gear called Shadoweave. At about level \~50 there's a Felcloth set.
---
8. If you put Curse of Tongues on an NPC that /yells (like a boss fight or something scripted) he will speak in Demonic gibberish.
---
9. Soulfire is a hilarious ability that does a lot of damage in PVP if you can actually cast it.
---
10. Engineering again. If you plan to PVP, definitely get it. The parachute capes let you jump off buildings/cliffs in AB/WSG. The Net gun is OP etc etc
---
11. You would be shocked what demons you can cast Enslave Demon on. (Always use Curse of Shadows first to weaken them). I've enslaved 40-man outdoor raid mobs near Lord Kazzak.
---
12. Once you're in blues you can solo the "back door" of DM east. Some people complete a portion of the Warlock epic quest this way. Most of the packs of 3-4 are demons or elementals so you can banish--&gt;enslave an elite--&gt;kill the 3rd one.  
---
13. First Aid is particularly powerful since you regularly convert HP --&gt; Mana
---
Seems like you forgot the part about custom games which made wc3 more popular than WoW ever was
---
As a healer that just came back to WoW recently it's not entirely the case. I'll often let people know if it's my first time in an instance and if I know the mechanics or not. I'd say 50/40/10 I get no response from the whole group/super helpful group that walks me through it/player just says scrub and starts a vote kick (I get kicked from these like 1/10 times, most of the time the person who said scrub will get kicked).
---
Seriously, racials make nearly no difference. Just pick the Race that looks the best.
---
It's a joke. That you didn't understand and got offended.
---
Then.... don’t?
---
Your spec is a meaningful decision, one of classics strongest points is your decisions matter.
---
Please don’t advocate for the removal of meaningful player decisions in classic.
---
Ty
---
Who says, you must play my version? I'm merely listing what changes I would like to see and to me discount naxxramas must go. Especially if original naxxramas is seen by more people in classic.
---
The real killer in wrath for me however is the 10/25 man raid system.
---
Bit worried US guilds may get WF on a lot of early raids due to them being 1 day clears and having a reset earlier, they should be going with time since available over whoever get's it down first really. But like you said we have private server guilds going hard but I wouldn't be surprised if Method absorbed a top guild because even if you lose your guild name, being under the Method banner while playing WoW is a huge boost into the public eye.
---
It is now.
---
Only when you res at a spirit healer
---
95% of them are yes. Some features are taken off like Focus but most addons should work in retail. The addons I used on the Stress Test all work on Retail except for quest addons.
---
They are accurate as far as I know. If you find mistakes you can mail the author.
---
Also beta doesn't really mean shit, they stated they were trying stuff for later phases as well.
---
Back in my guild in retail vanilla, healers were a small and tight community - one of the first rules that we all obey is that gear prio between healer classes is kept to a minimum. No one has prio of a certain gear over someone of the same class, and if different classes clash for armor type issues (like Robes of Guardian Saint wanted by all healers), we talk about it.
---
The reason behind this is we are fighting to get gear prio in the whole guild kept to an acceptable minimum so we really can't afford to be divided, or hypocritical among ourselves.
---
There are certainly some exceptions. That druid preparing to be a bear tank does get prio over other druids for Ghoul Skin Tunic because how important tanks are, but other than that, not much prio is heard of between other healers.
---
Missing something about ret or prot paladin. 😂
---
My reasoning is if you're going shadow why not start as shadow?
---
If you don’t choose either weapon spec while leveling, then pick the better weapon based on damage and stats, not the weapon type.
---
But if you do pick one of those two specs while leveling, my point is that you can either benefit from one attack of extra damage from Sword Spec or several attacks of free, uncontested damage from Mace Spec over 3 seconds. Leveling speed is not solely determined by how fast you kill but also how much time is spent recovering from damage received.
---
My BC/WoTLK friends that won’t play classic =*(
---
That's the problem with going back and trying to "fix" old games.  Everyone has a different version.  Wrath was a fun game even with its flaws.
---
Well it's not what is best for the game but what do you enjoy really.
---
I brought up the question of faction choice to my friends, and while most of them and myself would be fine with going Alliance this time (I mean, honestly, it's literally another half of the game we all love), we have one friend who will absolutely not roll any Alliance character ever. As in, if we all played Alliance, he would still just go play on Horde by himself. And, to a point, I get it. 
---
There's something special about waiting for AV to start and having a bunch of strangers all yelling "FOR THE HORDE!"  "BLOOD AND THUNDER!" "LOK'TAR OGAR!" that gets your utterly fucking pumped that absolutely nothing on the Alliance side can match. "For the Alliance!" sounds like something an Accountant would shout at the office team-building paintball outing (that he takes way too seriously because he did it a couple times in high school) for the three person group he "recruited" and gave a name to. 
---
Man...my friend is right, how the hell could I ever think anything but Horde was a good idea?
---
Yeah except when you've played alliance all your life and finally get an excuse to switch sides without losing everything
---
Not a bad one indeed.
---
I very much doubt WC3 player base at any time is even comparable to 12 million subscribers in 2010 that WoW had.
---
Starcraft 2 has the exact modding system within its custom games and I don't see it being more popular. Same goes to the original WC3.
---
I really enjoy humor, don't you ? :P
---
In regards to your private server experience, dedicated tanks and healers tend to be a more hardcore section of the playerbase, so many of them would be the type of people playing on private servers. On the subject of dps slots, there are 3 per 5 man, and like 20+ in raids, so by the math the game can easily support an overabundance of dps players. The dps player waiting an hour to run WC or SM is an exaggeration, I never struggled to get into groups on my rogue.
---
yikes
---
Ok, here we go... 
---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
I agree with pretty much every comment you made in this thread. We need more wow players that are kind to each other even when speaking anonymously online.
---
Class homogenization.
---
Smart. all-nighters will be way ahead in level and people that played till 2-4am will still be in bed.
---
Supply for DPS too low ?? I realy doubt that.
---
Because they needed to invest heavily in Starcraft the Cartoon or whatever. You know, the thing everyone so desperately wanted...
---
So it's okay to give jobs to people based on skin color instead of talent?
---
Cheers bro! Warmed my heart there &lt;3
---
That’s okay, we shall play BIN
---
If you are any sort of physical DPS on the Horde, do the elite troll quest in Hinterlands if it's available.  The +20AP +Hit is so huge early on when good trinkets are in short supply.
---
flying
---
Yeah I just played it recently and there was a mission in the Night Elf Campaign where I didn't have any inventory for Tyrande. It was the mission where you sneak around the Doom Guards so I thought "Eh, maybe you're not supposed to have one for this mission since you're just sneaking." Then I started finding items and realized it was bugged lol.
---
It's all relative I should have worded it differently because it's not objectively trash but it is the worst system relative to the others available (loot council and soft res). 
---
It encourages collusion in order to get top items that are shared among classes and it leads to drama when people want to argue on whether something is an upgrade or not.
---
*Fortunate Son playing*
---
Alright we're moving out gang let's turn these quests in
---
*Tree starts moving*
---
*Rogue stealth noises*
---
Run!
---
True, but as I said, this thread is about what you would need to see changed and that's what I'd need. I realize, those are very big changes which very likely will not happen. As a result, I likely won't play classic wrath, if it ever happens. But if you enjoyed it the way it was, then by all rights, have fun.
---
Though I also feel the no changes cries are a bit over the top. I certainly would fix glaring small problems. E.g. for tbc the leatherworking drum problem and the seal of blood imbalance are very easy to fix and only serve to improve the game.
---
Stupid dailies and useless rep grinding.
---
I didn't play in vanilla buy when I did start I rolled alliance. I'm rolling a shaman and I'm kinda sad about not hanging out in Ironforge
---
I mean whats there to miss? lmao, honestly cant think of a single thing thats better in retail.
---
Oh so you are one of those undead corpses I always see "parked" in the dust, good to know
---
Which means absolutely nothing at all as they had, how long?, to get their BiS for that level.  This won't happen.
---
Gear turnaround. Combine -forging and the faster pace of content, and it never feels like gear is worth chasing.
---
Someone stop her before she spends all of my inheritance.
---
Yeah scholomance used to be cc almost every pull. Then 1.12 hit and it became aoe pulls that stress the healer. As I bunker I was always asking to use my trap but the tanks just wanted to get it done.
---
What can you really say as a healer.
---
Oh look I'm pulling another idiot's balls out of a vice.
---
Check out how many cleaves this DPS warrior is eating.
---
Oh no, the rogue is at 5% hp... again... 
---
/cast PW:S 
---
/cast Rene.... no wait...  
---
/cast downranked:renew
---
So guys, me and my druid friend joined a group with this warrior who thinks he's going to dual wield tank the instance, but what's actually going to happen is secretly only cast rank one heal on him until he dies.  Every pull, while we pretend to panic, and then Druid friend will save the day with his great big furry ass, and we will finish the pull, and res the warrior.
---
 Rinse Repeat...
---
If the warrior rage quits and hearths before his gear breaks, I Owe druid friend 1 gold.  Otherwise He owes me 1gold.
---
ok so yea apparently I can see deeply in to the collective healer consciousness, maybe it would be fun to watch after all.
---
Ye Tauren rogue is clearly superior, I mean have you ever spotted one? Their invisibility level is nuts!
---
You missed a good opportunity of having a pocket healer.
---
did they say 2019 or just 19 because they could be aiming at 2119
---
I'm happy about all of the attention the game is getting due to the overhaul - it's one of my all-time favorite games and more people will get to experience it for the first time.
---
But I also really don't like the way it looks. The environments and buildings look terrific, but the character models and animations look like they were taken out of a very different era of Warcraft/WoW and it turns me off.  I'm personally very content with the re-optimized version of the original game which was patched over the last couple years, runs like a dream now in native widescreen :)
---
&gt; If you don’t choose either weapon spec while leveling, then pick the better weapon based on damage and stats, not the weapon type.
---
Yeah, that would work. I always felt like you would have too many talent points in combat with a weapon spec anyways.
---
&gt; But if you do pick one of those two specs while leveling, my point is that you can either benefit from one attack of extra damage from Sword Spec or several attacks of free, uncontested damage from Mace Spec over 3 seconds. Leveling speed is not solely determined by how fast you kill but also how much time is spent recovering from damage received.
---
I understood your point. If you like, I can be more clear about my answer: I do not know which of the two would be better for leveling, both have their advantages. Personally, I prefer going with swords.
---
Also: You'll have 5/5 sword spec at earliest by level 39 and you can get two really great swords with level 40/42 through the SM and RD dungeon quests. The only comparable mace is Wirt's Third Leg, which is a random drop, at level 40. There are very few maces after that with useful stats or effects afterwards, until the late 50s at least. So considering all this, it seems like swords trump (not the president) maces, even if the stun effect might be better.
---
pretty sure that was the announced date, think it says that in the launcher as well
---
I just decided to roll horde for the first time in retail and wow, horde players just seem so much more fun to me. On alliance I was always the idiot saying stupid shit in chat. Maybe one or two people reacted, the rest were busy talking to their spouses and/or friends in their parties or whatever.
---
Switch to horde, say the same outrageous shit in chat and I am greeted with the same stupidity. Sometimes get a tell or two with people playing along with my bullshit. 
---
I joined a group to kill some sort of elite for a quest and the dudes in the group actually stayed in group after the elite was killed. We ended up doing other quests in the area together. This NEVER happened on any of my alliance toons. It was such a refreshing experience.I think I finally found my WoW home,  I am 100% gonna go with horde when classic comes out.
---
Jesus, you’re a condescending douche
---
Pretty sure it's 0.4 or 0.04 around that, it's def not 1%
---
But yeah it can take 50-100 plus runs to get
---
Forced? Well, as many pointed out, that would be Guild Banks.
---
could just read up on some lore
---
Sadly, we would still all be Alliance IRL, if the real Orcish Horde would attack, unless they would accept Human turnovers from Alliance.
---
Reforged is supposed to have much better tools for custom maps and things like that, which is what I'm most looking forward to.
---
Most kids want to be monsters not normal guys
---
When you get the Sunken Temple quest at 51(?), make sure you get the trinket reward. The staff is nice, but the trinket will be useful forever.
---
BRD was/is a baaaaad place for lots of fighting and rogues, that aren't there.  I remember, when I played a rogue and used distract on people so they would turn and run off of the side into the lava.   Fun times.
---
Top played? I very much doubt it. It's doing fine and has healthy esports scene but it doesn't change the fact that rts became a niche genre.
---
And if Starcraft 2 is doing as good as you claim then WC3 will be trumped by it just like HotS got trumped by other established mobas.
---
If they create a new layer only when all others are full, then there will be one underpopulated one (the last one). If they just divide players equally, they will all be the same.
---
Omg shut the fuck up
---
Does the bottom right corner need to be exact?
---
In my experience the alliance are just a bunch of boring mary sues. Anything that deviates from that is an edge lord to them. It is basically summed up as:
---
Alliance: Normal boring folk  
---
Horde: The internet
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
This is reddit, outlandish hyperbole is the standard.
---
I mean everyone loves hating on vaulty,  but this guy thinks melee hunter is NOT a joke spec.
---
I mean I thought it would be obvious to people I was being sarcastic, LFR is aids and the worst PvE addition EVER in the game and Flying was cool when announced but slowly made the game worse.
---
Oh they are updating the old version as well?  That's pretty neat.
---
But they specifically stated that anything in beta was non conclusive regarding phases, there were also bgs and PvP rewards in beta and we know those won't be out phase 1.
---
Just remember guys, if wow classics sucks, we will always be welcoming over at r/2007scape :)
---
I know I know.. I'll be a big fish soon. :P
---
Don't try what?
---
Well they're calling them kids to offend them,  not to say they ARE kids.  And they consider horde manly because they're beasts and whatnot.  As I've said I'm horde myself and most people I know are fine with whatever you play.  But some people like to trash talk for no reason...
---
I got wow from my uncle for christmas. Mum saw it and told me: „you won‘t play a game with the word WAR in it!“ ofc I did. She just didn‘t know anything about it
---
Great, thx!
---
You haven't enjoyed a single piece of content from TBC onwards?
---
Once Classic gets out, I am aiming for a RP server, go Alliance and I will find fellow adventurers who wants to travel with me to Shadowfang Keep to defeat Archmage Arugal.
---
You fucking madman, that was hilarious. I'm at work and almost put myself in an awkward situation trying to channel all this laughter through my nose. Holy shit hahaha
---
The superior spec balancing but not the shitty new talent system.
---
The worst thing about vanilla are the meme specs being so bad
---
Because you love grinding +hit gear
---
&gt;From my classic pserver experience, it seems the supply for dps was TOO LOW in this one and as a dps I would just get invited instantly anytime I want to do a dungeon
---
Wuuuut 
---
Can't reflect on this at all.
---
Better question is for WC4
---
You need to come prepared to do all the dps you are capable of, and have full confidence in what you are able to do. Prepared with mana pots, spell damage pots,consumes, buffs etc. Make sure your Warlocks have CoS on your target for the buff to arcane damage. Since it also helps boost shadow damage, they will probably support the idea unless your raid leader wants some other curse. Do your research. A lazy Mage will probably out-dps you most of the time, unless you out-gear them by a good amount.
---
Finding a guild willing to have a Boomkin will go a long way, because you probably already know how short sighted and closed-minded people can be about meme specs, even in 5-man groups. Most people will assume you don't know anything because you are not in the "correct" spec for your class, in their minds.
---
Nothing that I would bring back for Classic, not a damn thing. Flying, LFG, LFR, level scaling, class homo, you name it, they all ruined the game.
---
Not OP but:
---
Ironforge and Stormwind are close to Blackrock Mountain and STV so you spend a lot less time traveling to the blackrock mountain dungeons and raid instances. You're also closer to 3/5 world bosses as alliance and you don't need to set your hearthstone to a location equivalent to Kargath in the Badlands like horde does. Shorter queue times for PvP which is always great. And it's just way more comfortable to raid as alliance since you have paladins.
---
So you just level tailoring to 60 just to make a robe of the archmage, equip it and drop tailoring? or I am wrong?
---
Absolutely. I remember pumping out ludicrous dps on my frost dk alt that wasn't even well geared. It was just an ae speed-fest
---
Did you heal heroics during pre nerf Cata? Because healing was completely fucked. It wasnt just interrupt every now and then, healing was really hard.
---
The room itself wouldn't be soloable with this spec? Kill a mob, vanish? Would likely take forever but seems doable.
---
I believe theres only NA and EU servers so check out EU first would be my guess
---
Remember when Athene was the best paladin in the world? He set the bar super low.
---
I think this is an accurate prediction of what's to come. Just think about the river of salt that's gonna flow through this sub during Phase 2!
---
Only way to make MC interesting.
---
Yea it’s impossible to tell sarcasm from dumb from just reading
---
I thought about going Alliance over Horde this time but I simply prefer everything Horde over Alliance that isn’t night elfs. Literally night elfs are the only thing I like on Alliance and Duskwood while I like all of the horde stuff.
---
 I also have been playing Alliance in retail since WoD so I think I’m ready to get back to that Horde life in classic.
---
Yeah true...
---
I mean it is very meaningful don't get me wrong. But it is something your are almost always free to change. I guess it also has to do with how you define meaningful - or I'm just defining it wrong in my head :D
---
Yeah - all just thoughts anyway so no Point in discussing it really..
---
Have a nice weekend
---
I've seen my share of his videos and i can say that old ones were even decent. However later down the line 90% of them turned to click bait and ripped off some lists of "top x of y in wow" from internet or other content creators. 
---
I don't hate or shame him, just don't watch him anymore.
---
Do horde routes exist?
---
Mining/Skinning while leveling. Sell leather, send mining mats to bank alt for 60.
---
At 60, go engineering/enchanting. Solo 5 man's and disenchant blues that vendor for less than their d/e value. Don't really need to level enchanting unless you want to rep grind for enchants.
---
Eventually you should drop enchanting for tailoring. Get bloodvine and another mooncloth cool down.
---
Do you haven't enjoyed a BG, Arena, Dungeon or Raid at all? A zone, a questline, a single boss, a mailbox in another area of a capital.
---
We didn’t begin become aware of downranking as a viable strategy until mid-2016. Until that point, we used rotations to allow us to spam flash heal throughout the encounter. This impacted our gearing choices - Spirit was amazing because you’d regen faster while off-rotation.
---
Casual REEEEEEE
---
Haha I still love the Horde motivation speech.
---
This guy paladins.   
---
F
---
Yeah that is basically the problem with retail in general. Role playing takes a backseat to convenience. It is nice to be able to share items between characters, but it takes away from the role playing aspect where an alt is a new character completely unrelated to your main.
---
Shared mounts is something that I do like but I would gladly go without it if it helps make the game feel more like an RPG.
---
I guess another thing I would like to keep from retail are the updated models, but apparently that is also controversial among classic enthusiasts. I really hope the final version gives us a toggle that also includes different animations depending on which model you chose.
---
I feel like OP is playing on a server thats well past the need for constant 5 mans so yeah people arent lining up to spam them when naxx is out
---
Have fun PvPing against premades with paladins...and getting wrecked in AV.  :)
---
No. This sub rose like a rocket then has hardly had any momentum since june. It's a 15 year old game with minor graphical updates. 
---
I doubt droves of younger kdis want to play and the number of gamers over 25 isn't huge in the grand scheme. We're just lucky to get it. 
---
btw this is also why i think we wont get any *fresh* content, because it costs money to have people manage, draw, develop, theorycraft new stuff. It's much easier to just have a project manager and some devs just porting the old code.
---
It's worth their time to increase revenue a bit and make this for us, but that's it.
---
One cannot simply, as alliance, walk into the heart of Orgrimmar......  lol.    Yeah, it is not just in Org, but deep in the middle in the Cleft of Shadows.  Good luck though, would be fun to try it.
---
Nope you can't solo the boss, he pulls the whole room full of elites, same deal as an Cath...
---
I believe WF resets the swing timer, so if it procs at a bad time couldn't that actually hamper a Troll?
---
If I know I'm going to change later, and there's little difference between the two options, it helps stave away boredom by mixing it up.  If it doesn't matter speed-wise, make it count subconsciously
---
The quest add-ons that work on pservers (and used to work in vanilla in my recollection) all have pointers on the map and a direction arrow UI element.
---
On the pserver I play I use pfQuest which create dots on the map for every single spawn point of quest mobs, basically acting like a track. Not sure if stuff like that works in classic tho.
---
I live in Poland and have no idea what are you talking about. Counter Strike was incredibly popular when I was a kid. I know for sure there are still great teams with people around the globe for fps games so your claim is just false unless you can back it up with valid sources. I have little to no knowledge about BR games so I'm not going to comment on that one.
---
rts games are not popular in EU/NA. I do like that genre a lot and that's why I can tell you that with full confidence. Give me some popular rts game so we can check the player count. There's no doubt in my mind it's very small in EU/NA when compared to a more popular genre like fps or mmos
---
In a lot of ways, it was a perfect dungeon. Variety of enemies, the progress through it is noticeable like you said, pacing is great, I just love it. The loot is badass too.
---
They first had the stress test more than 30 day out of launch... To force another sub...  
---
But in hind sight I think they wanted to wait a week and won't mind people subbing to get a good feel for how many people want to play launch.
---
Yeah but he’s talking about restealthing without using vanish tho
---
&gt;and this subs content to improve
---
It will be 80% streamer clips like all the other gaming subs
---
Robe of what? Isn't some MC drop better? And MC you can pug quickly and easily.
---
Alchemy isn't even good moneymaker compared to what mages can do with DME flowers.
---
I feel like people underplay this. 
---
Casually playing means it's going to take maybe 6 months for someone to hit 60. That's 6 months of paying a subscription. That alone probably will cause people to tap out and stop.
---
Polymorph is a top-tier form of CC. Additionally, Mage is a solid Ranged DPS class who provides an Int buff, food &amp; water vending machine, frost nova is nice if packs get loose from the tank, and the AoE is decent. But I wouldn't go so far as requiring a Mage, it's more that the player will be effective at a relatively low skill level. If the player has good dungeon skills, then the Mage will be that much better.
---
It's incredible how consistently these proposed builds leave out the best talent in each tree they progress through in order to make a "hybrid spec".
---
tell her to play the paladin a you play the hunter, contrary to popular belief hunters are complex but paladins are easy and she can top healing meters on a paladin.
---
It really depends what gear we are talking about here, yes it would be possible to solo the room but it would take forever since youll be waiting for CDs, the problem is soloing dagran and princess at the same time, youd have to kill the princess first while tanking both of them.
---
UD offers absolutely nothing to PvE, so people looking to minx/max ignore UD entirely. Combined with Orc being arguably better in PvP AND having a PvE Buff? Nah. Orc all the way my man.
---
Guys wtf.... it's obvious that all the Money they currently invest is going straight into Diablo Mobile.... I mean everybody has a phone right? So why would you be mad? 
---
fml... Blizzard/Activision Need to get their priorities right...
---
Even if you were able to pass the Golem and clear the room, Moira heals him and you won't be able to out-dps her heal.
---
Pre nerf cata had so much promise.
---
I'm into it. Never hit 60 in 2005 though lol
---
We'll see.
---
I'd really love to have achievements in place, which gives you some side goals to accomplish. (just leave out the ones that can be used as raid req). 
---
Duo spec also nice, especially for druids.
---
Ok, I will post some screens in this thread after the launch me wrecking in AV and wrecking some pallies with my rogue.
---
I dont mind a toggle for people that like the new models, personally I find most of them to be dreadful. They lack personality and look way too goofy. Warcraft has always been cartoony, but theres a stark contrast between the tauren in Wc3 and the updated retail model.   
---
Also I hate the (most of them) new animations for spells and attacks, looks really gamey and cheap. Some spells look pretty cool, but nearly all updated melee skills look janky as fuck.
---
Bugs were a part but there is also bugs that weren't and they have to fix those.
---
Why Keep the beta running when most bugs have been found already?
---
Beta was mostly dead in the end anyway because nobody keeps playing Level 40 for 3 month on end.
---
No one is delaying anything - hell do you even have the right subreddit or what are you talking about? This is the WOW Reddit my m8
---
I could dig achievements but I wouldn't want titles or rewards or anything just literally a way of saying "I did this" of course some raids could have that problem of having killed a boss to get invited ... but for stuff like quests or getting your mount, or honourable kills ... cool why not. Hell infact I wouldn't mind taking the stats tab which showed that stuff along with things like gold looted and that, without being able to see others that would be kinda neat.
---
You're right, blast wave then, that'll work
---
In Vanilla I was in a semi-casual raiding guild (serious effort during raids, but skill level, organization and time commitment was only good enough through BWL/AQ20), and they let me gear my feral druid for tanking (got me the armor cloak from MC, which was great for feral due to bear armor multiplier, etc), and sometimes when they had me main tank it seemed as if the healers could keep my bear up more easily than the warriors. For example, I think the first time we killed Vaelestrasz in  BWL I was the tank on my Druid. I'm not saying Druid &gt; Warrior or anything, just saying it didn't seem bad in a semi-serious guild that wasn't pushing new content but did take its raids seriously.
---
Don’t have a a browser open where you google anything. Stay in the game and use chat as your google.
---
I mean you are a fool if you think classic 5mans won't be a joke.
---
You will definitely not be using cc on regular pulls and everything will pretty much melt.
---
\+ Messy cables running all over the place.  Plastic $40 walmart table for a desk.
---
We'll see if they can do it but Blizzard has stated they intend to ban/break those kind of add-ons.
---
Well, in theory. I don't know of any ret paladins or cat druids who raided as such in vanilla and I doubt the number of people who did so was very high. I also have no idea how much dps they actually did, if they existed. These numbers are what the spec is capable of.
---
Spelladin and power shifting are both pserver inventions, but powershifting is a lot older, so under that perspective cat druid was ahead for quite some time.
---
That's not odd. These are perfectly normal occurrences in any game's development cycle.
---
I dont want to be the reason, he will ruin his social life at an age, where all the yummy things are being discovered
---
Don't fucking tell me or anyone else how to enjoy the game please and ty.
---
The vast majority of gold comes from hacked accounts. Blizzard usually restore people's hacked accounts which means the gold that player had is doubled.
---
AH, but you're mistaken. Classic wasn't as hard as today retail version of pve raid content or mythic+.
---
The only obstacles that made classic difficult were as follows
---
1. Players had terrible PCs.
---
2. Players had terrible internet connection.
---
3. Players had very little experience playing games or mmorpgs particularly.
---
4. 40 man raid groups meant you had more carries.
---
On the other end, you have people who think things like making leveling take longer, slower mob respawn rates, less health recovery, less mana recovery, makes the game more difficulty. Which is not true, it just makes it the game more tedious and time consuming. Not difficult.
---
Of course those heavily invested into classic nostalgia aren't likely to agree, because it's more about being a fan of the product, than living in reality.
---
Yes its another nice perk but not the reason why i say that you are at a disadvantage. Keybinds can be whatever you want. you can use whichever ones you like, If you find enough comfortable keybinds and dont find the need to use Q and E thats great. However those
---
&gt;If you strafe by pressing turn+the mousebutton you are using 2 keys to do something i do woth one just so you can keep an useless feature that is keyboard turning, no big deal right? Except that i can select specific targets while strafing and you can not, i can look around while strafing while you can not. You cant do anything with your mouse while strafing while i can do everything that you do with your mouse while strafing.
---
Are facts and the reson why your method is objectively worse
---
I've been playing Blizzard games for the last 20 years and I'm extremely excited for Diablo Immortal. I currently love BFA and I am tanking mythic+'s daily. I never felt any type of "hit in the face" feeling from revealing D:I. I am happy they are creating more newer games for our enjoyment. I'd much rather be playing Diablo Immortal on my phone right now than arguing with some entitled dumbass on reddit as I'm doing on my phone right now.
---
I know I've said one but as a priest. Life Grip ... because it's funny as hell.
---
Hello fellow silverhand alum! My first ever character was on this server NE hunter Nickets I had no idea what the hell I was doing at the time. But my best Wow memories were made on that server before switching to Horde to join some friends of mine
---
Original dual spec was a 1 time 1000 gold fee that let you switch between 2 talent specs. Lets say your a rogue specced for combat swords, your other spec could be cold blood prep spec. If you wanted to change your combat spec to combat daggers, you'd have to pay 50g to respec that spec still.
---
Sure keep saying that while the signs are all over the wall with their "hunter might not be fixed on release" and scrapping the final stress test.
---
We're almost in August and we haven't heard anything Reforged.
---
"game's development cycle" on fucking titles they released over a decade ago LOL.
---
The only thing you fear as a holy pally in pvp is your target walking away from you at a mild but brisk pace.
---
Interesting topic.
---
 I don't remember BRD at all but I like this kind of discussion. 
---
I remember a pull in SM Arm about halfway through, you have to go up a narrow set of stairs and then there are a couple mobs extremely close to the top and very easy to body aggro.  Definitely had wipes in several different groups from people charging up the stairs and body pulling -&gt; wiping the group.  
---
EZ to deal with just let the tank pull down the stairs =P
---
Yes, did I forget to mention that? :o)
---
I'll be teamviewering into my PC from work to queue for the game or if I can do some crafting and other minor things in game
---
It's only been 9 days since they posted about delaying the stress test. I wouldn't call that radio silence.
---
I feel like many who quit will not be hyped about Warcraft at all by that time.
---
In the video one rogue is like "We might have to vanish I just pulled aggro even though I was feinting!". Oh brother lol :)
---
You **should** look **every** possible detail up. Download a leveling guide and practice it on a private server so you remember everything by heart. 
---
After just a hundred hours of boring mindless leveling, the **real game** begins. Look up your BiS list, start grinding dungeons. You want to reserve the items from the list, to make things more efficient and avoid as much communication as possible (talking is the worst part of an MMO).
---
This way, by the time you have the preraid BiS, the game is **too fun and enjoyable** to continue. Quit it before you die from overdose of **pure fun**.
---
SL/SL is a TBC spec. A regular SL lock will win for 2 simple reasons:
---
1) He takes 30% less damage
---
2) He can chain fear
---
There's nothing you can do really, he simply doesn't die and doesn't go oom as fast. Don't believe me? Watch the duel tourney from a couple weeks ago.
---
This is gold, so funny coz true
---
What part of buying gold or buying a boost is rng? They show you how much gold you're going to get when you post a token, and the level of the boost is known..
---
Okay that does actually make sense. Was not thinking of it that way.
---
Some sort of 1 off fee though 1000g would be pretty steep for classic
---
I love how you are asking if exploits are going to be available. Sounds like you have experience in bannable offences. Play the game to have fun not annoy the shit out of other players.
---
It isn't forced but practically every employee offers paid time off and holidays.
---
Are you insane? +1% hit is insanely valuable, way better dps than you'll get with inventors focal and the AV offhand.
---
Look at how long it's taken Classic to come out, which has zero new art and a similar amount of under the hood code work to do. For WC3 they have to remake literally every single art asset. Your expectations are unrealistic.
---
Yeah, tier 3 is borderline game breaking but people didn’t realize in Vanilla, because TBC came so quickly and barely anyone had tier 3.  The drama and crying caused by PvP’rs in tier 3 is going to be hilarious, and I’ll have quit by then for a TBC Pserver if it isn’t out officially yet.
---
Right, my bad on the wanding. I'm so used to playing a hunter on that fight that the fear wasn't really a thing I had to worry about, haha.
---
Aesthetics tho.
---
'Cause they can't get it to work right. And they're adding layering to it.
---
Not true. There were certainly classes that excelled in classic pvp compared to others.
---
Warriors, Mages, Holy Priests are particularly useful in group pvp. Druid if you really care about running flags.
---
Shadow Priest and Mage with gear are very deadly in 1v1 pvp.
---
It's pretty obvious that you should be a warrior/mage/priest, if you want to be top tier pvp class.
---
Yes, the Immortal announcement sucked, but nobody is being "forced" to play it. I have absolutely no problem with Blizzard dipping their toes in the mobile market. The development was outsourced so it had literally no effect on the development of their PC titles. I'm saying this as a lifelong Diablo fan. If the delay for D4 is to make sure it wasn't a disappointment like D3 then I'm completely fine with that.
---
Well that seems fair then lol
---
I have never experienced dps supply being too low in any iteration of wow.  Lfg channdl is absolutely full of "lf2m just need tank and heals and ready to go!".
---
Horde side is particularly short on tanks as only 2 classes can do it, one is a notoriously slow leveler and the other is the least popular class and can only do it with the right spec.
---
&gt;Any guides, websites, forums I should look into?
---
No. Ignore this shit and do things at your own pace. You will naturally find guides that will interest you but don't let anyone tell you how to play the game.
---
&gt;Are facts and the reson why your method is objectively worse
---
Which doesn't a actually matter because it's vanilla WoW and the game isn't mechanically intensive enough for it to make any difference.
---
And render yourself useless in Pvp
---
Mace spec talent points don’t affect hit - or are you referring to the human specific racial?
---
God... Everyone that doesn't live in the US knows that some things can be improved just like in any other Country in the world. 
---
No Country is perfect. 
---
The only real issue I have with the US is the healthcare is not free. People do sometimes get screwed by that right? I might toally be wrong actually just curious.
---
And vacation days are awesome to have but having them mandatory would help too - just like some rights for the People that are working so they aren't totally taken Advantage of. 
---
In Germany for example we have 20 days of paid Holiday as a Minimum. I get 30 where I work. This is simply amazing but I'm sure that americans get some Kind of compensations for that having the Minimum. Probably more Money or whatever so it probably all evens out in the end. 
---
You just have to be Aware of different things in different countries so you can't get screwed :p
---
Very nice.
---
What are random enchantments?
---
There are two more things on my wishlist though: 
---
* support for talent bonuses (percentage dmg modifiers, crit &amp; hit chance bonuses)
---
* support for dmg/heal of certain spells. E.g. fireball with the talents and spelldmg I have would deal x to y damage.
---
At this point there should also be a square for “posts &amp; buzzwords that summarize what r/classicwow is full of”
---
Druid played well requires keeping up with a lot of stuff and utilizing your whole toolkit, especially in PvP
---
Yikes. You seem mad bro. Who hurt you?
---
Imagine being a multi-million dollar company because of the original franchises and games the old devs created, and thinking somehow they always get their priorities straight when announcing garbage such as Diablo Immortal and when implementing years and years of terrible changes to current WoW tanking your subscription base down to 1 million Lmfao.
---
Hello friend, it's actually spelled "rite" of passage in this instance. Rite being synonymous with "ritual" or "event". Not looking to be demeaning, just hopefully helpful =).
---
Luckily we have a fresh start so all our friends can be on the same server so need need for xrealm.
---
 This is a good resource with a section on downranking: had to remove link bc it includes the name of a pserver in it...google "basic holy priest guide what the light will tell you".
---
To answer your qs:
---
1. You'll use multiple ranks of your heal spells with casting time - there is no right answer for which to use. It depends on a combination of your gear and the incoming damage - that being said there are some base recommendations on that link that'll help you wrap your mind around this. The point is you don't want to cast max rank stuff unless you need to - if not use cheaper stuff. It rarely (almost never) makes sense to use downranked Renew or PwS bc you're only using those when you cannot stand still and cast but still desperately need healing throughput.
---
2. Downranking will still be effective/required if you want to be good at priesting.
---
wait wait, we can't get our dreadsteeds until phase 2?
---
No way it dies off by Christmas if they release AV with snowballs
---
Just accept that as a lock one thing you bring to the table is instance summons, and it's naturally your role to manage that. You get to start heading for the instance asap and cajole the current group members to start heading out as well. Sometimes when you get there first you can even find other players hanging around the zone and thus start summoning before anybody from your group even gets there. Don't let people rely on this, but be aware it's a good reason to start heading to zone immediately. And as much as it sucks to always be the guy heading  to zone first, just revel in the fact that you'll never have to experience the pain of waiting for the 5th person to come all the way from town.
---
As someone who did a couple bosses in vanilla while the guild killed KT, and have done it on Private servers at this point it isnt impressive as it is more of a time commitment than skill now.
---
You have to remember people have been doing this for over 13 years. And every single private server is far from " Blizz like " as they state they are, a good example is the whole DW tanking he talks about in many of his videos with the update on how parry works it will be highly unlikely we will be DW tanking hard hitting mobs like we do on private servers.
---
I’m out of the loop here; do people think Skarm is a bad player?
---
That's amazing! Yeah, in Classic it will feel as if you're actually going to a place, and then going in there. You fight your way to the instance, sometimes running inside to get away from elites and hostile players. Very different feeling from current WoW. Enjoy.
---
So you disagreed, ranted a bit and agreed with me? What
---
Yup. In the earlier patches you generated more threat going fury/prot but once shield slam got buffed it blew everything else out of the water, not even a naxx BiS geared fury warrior could out-threat the tanks in the world first guilds. Threat became a non issue at that point.
---
Everything
---
I mean youre still together for a while because you clear all the raids. And after week 100 of MC youre gunna wanna get out of there quick
---
I'M REALLY FUCKIN BUMMED ABOUT ALLIANCE RACIALS EVERY DAY I CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT WHAT CLASS TO PLAY AND STARE LONGINGLY AT 25% STUN RESIST, FEAR IMMUNITY, OR HASTE BUFF ALL I GET IS GOD DAMNED SPECIALIZATION FOR WEAPONS I DON'T EVEN USE I HAVE A WET NOODLE OF A STAT STICK WITH EXTRA HIT % AND IT DOESN'T MEAN SHIT BECAUSE I PROMISED MY FRIEND I'D PLAY ALLIANCE WITH HIM EVERY TIME AN ORC RESISTS MY IRON GRENADE I WILL WEEP
---
PRIVATE SERVERS ARE SO FUCKING WRONG IT'S LAUGHABLE THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE EVEN CLOSE TO THE REAL THING!
---
You also forgot shaman tanking guides
---
Yes, free voidwalker summon. Put it on stay, run away, and collect a free shard.
---
You can't have roids and assay on at the same time
---
Nah, there will be multiple stages of dropoff.
---
The early quitters who realize they don't actually have the time to commit like they used to and will stop playing at around 30.
---
Then there will be the other crowd that once they hit 60 they will be content and simply quit as well because the journey to 60 was all they were really after.  Though this group might not quit en masse but they will be the group that hits max level and then immediately rolls up an alt.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
I’m twisting myself into knots? Ok. Suuuure.
---
Really seems like you are the one getting twisted cause facts don’t support your retorts so you’re getting pretty bent and insulting about it.
---
I know it sucks to be wrong, but you’ll be ok man. Opportunity for you to grow.
---
Good stuff. Wowhead recently launched similar tool but yours seem to be much more advanced
---
Can you link or give me google phrase to help me search dota playerbase. At this point I'm more curious then anything. 
---
And if you're talking about the dota 2 player base count then fuck you.
---
Depending on servers being placed in different counties you should try to find one that's based in southern europe.
---
They said the remodeled everything based on original concept art. But I agree, the new models look so much more different than the old models and it just looks bad.
---
Azerite-anything
---
Orc massive shoulders are BiS for military press. 25% stun resist is absolutely delicious. Too many undeads anyway. Pick the lovely green bois and girls.
---
Larger Backpack. It's a minor, near negligible change that makes things a little more convenient for everyone (especially new players at lower levels), but shouldn't have a significant impact on gold farming strategies or any other metas.
---
I played Vanilla with a 16:10 LCD 🤷
---
ALL I WANTED WAS MY GOT DAMNED IVORY RAPTOR. I PUT ALL THIS WORK INTO PLAYING A STUPID LOOKING TROLL WITH THEIR DUMB HUNCHED BACK AND STUPID FEET. I LEARNED ROUTES FOR THE VALLEY OF TRIALS WHICH IS DUMB AND THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH IMPS. I FIGURED OUT OPTIMAL LEVELING SPECS AND WROTE A GUIDE FOR MYSELF. THEN BLIZZ JUST MOONWALKS OVER AND GOES "NO ARMORED MOUNTS LOL" AND GIVES LIKE THE WORST REASON EVER AND NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE. GAH!
---
No. I know for a fact I'm going back to a version of the game that I actually really loved and enjoyed. I played wow for years but quit because of life had been sapped from the game. I can't wait to go back to what I loved.
---
I figured with free mounts there will be money to burn.  I'm not a pro though, so I could be sadly mistaken.
---
WHY DO GNOMES GET WARRIORS ANYWAY BUT TAURENS DON'T GET ROGUES?  DON'T TELL ME THAT "EVERY RACE GETS WARRIOR" BECAUSE EVERY RACE *EXCEPT* TAURENS GET ROGUES!  YES, TAUREN ROGUES DON'T MAKE MUCH SENSE, BUT NEITHER TO GNOME WARRIORS!  I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT I'M MAD ABOUT.
---
Along with the definition of “Popular”, look up the definition of “Straw man”. You’ll be surprised to learn they both don’t mean what you think you do.
---
Dude, DW tanking happened in vanilla, it was rare, but it happened.
---
Frostbite isn't that worth to spend points before you have enough level and points for picking 5/5 shatter.
---
I like how you tried to quantify this.
---
So many parrots seem to think that all raids will be bringing 1-3 meme specs max in MC and you can't beat it without.
---
When in reality it'll be a snoozefest compared to heroic/mythic level retail raids.
---
Frostbite isn't that worth to spend points till you had enough level and points for picking 5/5 shatter.
---
Yes. One easy way around that is too level with mining, and save everything. Then at 60 drop it for engineering.
---
Week 100? You're not spending 2 fucking years in MC. At the very most you'll be there for 4-5 months before it's time to move on to BWL. Did you even play vanilla?
---
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT THEY BOTH MIGHT BE CORRECT?
---
The demand for shadow priests in pve is almost none. You can heal dungeons while leveling, but at 60 people aren't going to put up with it since it will likely fail. Especially without gear. Shadow priest doesn't bring anything extra to a party except stam buff if your healer isn't a priest, and res if you have a druid healer. Except mages and locks aren't going to want to compete against a meme spec for gear, so you will get denied from a lot of groups just for that. 
---
Some raids will bring one shadow priest just to buff the warlocks, but your priority will be incredibly low since you provide the same buff as a fresh level 60 or one with gear, and you'll never be able to compete on damage because of mana issues. 
---
If you want to have a useful endgame, go healing as a priest. If you want to deal damage, I'd strongly suggest picking something other than a shadow priest unless your only focus is pvp.
---
&gt; The existence of, and use of a silly mechanic like nightfall is not an excuse to pretend melee hunter is viable.
---
Yes it is! The existence of Shadow Priest as a one-off in 40-mans purely to provide a single debuff on the boss (Shadow Weaving) means that Shadow Priest is not only viable, but optimal. If the top people do the math and determine that throwing a single Hunter into melee with Nightfall equipped will be worth the raid slot, then it becomes not just viable, but optimal. Now, if you're suggesting that Shadow Priest isn't viable due to its low personal dps and rarity in raids, then that's another conversation.
---
No. Put 5 points in wand spec and the rest into shadow for sure
---
Lol. That's your goto comback? Nice one old man, now go away and you enjoy the game your way and I enjoy it my way, ok?
---
This was posted awhile back, hope it helps.

This a million times. During a stress test I succesfully organised a queue for Sarkoth in the orc/troll starting zone. I convinced like 30 people to stand in a line and group up with each other to save time. We managed to get 30 people through the quest in only 10 minutes or so.
---
Before I showed up, they were all huddled around the spawn trying to get the first tag. It felt so good to unite a little piece of the community.
---
You had those hurdles. Other people did not. If you want to recreate your own personal experience, I'm sure you can figure out how get a slower computer and bad internet.
---
I absolutely *love* it when people think their opinion is true fact and how everyone else with a differing thought on the matter is truly wrong.
---
This post is going to age like fine wine later, I'm sure.
---
I'VE KNOWN EXACTLY WHICH RACE/CLASS I'M GOING TO PLAY WITH NO SECOND GUESSES FOR MONTHS. IT RAGES ME OUT THAT PEOPLE ARE SO INDECISIVE!
---
AV offhand not being available makes the harvester even better. Just because your not hit capped doesn't mean hit isn't still the single best lock dps stat. 
---
Meanwhile, the shard is useless. It's not exactly hard to take down a mob with your imp at which point you're off and running. Besides the stats, the Harvester is one of the single most iconic looking weapons in the game. If there was another scyth model somewhere else I'd entertain the notion of the shard, but the harvester is bis through Tax for your "around town" outfit.
---
This shows you never raided in vanilla. The hardest part of raiding in a casual guild is getting 40 players every night.
---
They'll take the meme spec because it's better than adding randoms.
---
Who brought up balance druids? How does a terrible non-popular spec have anything to do with my argument? You're right, it's false equivalency AND straw man.
---
Who would win? 
---
20 hours worth of mathematical theorycrafted minmaxing with formally edited post including methods and results.
---
or 
---
1 hardi boi
---
Nice
---
Fair enough, but unless i'm way off i recall blizzard not being able to crit?
---
I'm only wondering about druid because every time I see a druid post I see some dickhead saying "druids are completely unusable"
---
EU servers should be fine. We had a guild mate from Israel who played on EU servers and he had decent ping. Should be similar from the neighbour country.
---
DPS/Heal probably hast probably the biggest demand in raiding, while tanks and maybe heals will be rare in dungeons
---
Looks like Texas Roadhouse
---
Trolls don't wear shoes. I don't see that taken into account.
---
If you strafe with Q and E thats fine (although not reason to not use A and D as keybinds then).
---
What i was talking about is about people who dont bind strafe at all. Look at the comments on this thread and look how many people don't have strafe bound to anything and strafe by holding keyboard turn+right mousebutton. But you are right that my reply didn't really apply to the post i was replying too.
---
Wait really? Well shoot, I coulda sworn they were blue even before BC... well TIL then
---
Random enchantments are referring to items with random suffixes like "of the Bear", "of Fire Resistance", etc. I've been considering changing the wording on this to something like "random stat bonuses". There have been a couple comments around this.
---
I do want to add in things like talents and buffs to get a more complete stat calculation, it just hasn't made it to the top of my list yet.
---
I'll put some thought into the spell stuff. Thanks for the suggestions!
---
Is the druid in the kitchen ?
---
Thank you! I'll be sure to give it a read!
---
Adding a dungeon finder right now wouldn't be as bad as current dungeon finder for 1 seemingly unrelated reason, difficulty.  Making dungeons so easy killed the social aspect.  Why?  Lets look at things when dungeons were challenging.  If you had a good group what do you do?  You friend everyone and make sure you can run it back with good people.
---
Now?  No need to keep track who you are running it with.  Every group just rolls through the place, it doesn't matter.
---
I THINK YOU GUYS ARE OKAY I DON'T WANT TO SHIT TALK ANYONE I'M A GOOD LAD I SWEAR
---
I just hope My friends dont quit the game before we reach lvl 15. Had happened a few times before.
---
Had first planed for mining+skinning into tailoring+engineering later on. Now I think I will go herbalism+skinning into tailoring+engineering instead. 
---
 I think mining will be pretty good early on a new server, lots of people will want mats to level up engineering and arcane crystals are needed for lots of stuff. However if I have herbalism it would go well with a lvl 35 bank alt that has alchemy. Not going to rush leveling up that alt but will create it right away to get rested exp bonus. Figured as well that I could get engineering mats by just selling herbs instead of mining the bars myself.
---
 Will go tailoring when ZG is released and engineering I will get even later than that probably. Prefer to just focus on getting a good income. Engineering feels more like a luxury you can focus on when you have a lot of gold and it's less punishing not having a gathering profession.
---
I was wondering what those do. Are they just waypoints then or can you summon people with them?
---
Yeah, but you need to gear alts, new members, some people like to farm sulfuras, hydraxian rep, youre gunna be in Mc forever my dude
---
Back to normal? Don't get it...
---
YOU ARE WRONG I AM RIGHT BLIZZARD CANT FUCKING SAVE THIS GAME BECAUSE ITS 15 YEAR OLD!  
---
Just like imod3 mental age.
---
I meant on Retail, but thats not a bad idea
---
I’ll definitely focus on jump shooting for the early levels. Thank you!
---
They'd do it if they make more money doing it. Just gotta wait and see how much money they get from Classic.
---
Transmog.
---
No hunters dont have a job 🙃
---
We have Tauren Monk doing backflip and rotationnal high kick in retail so.... (I never understood why the fuck they did it)
---
Thanks for the kind words.
---
I've though about random affixes, but haven't gotten around to figuring out the best way to add them yet.
---
Personally speaking, I'd like to have the LFG system (not the LFD system that automatically groups you up). Making grouping up easier without making it automatic would be amazing. You could even limit it to only be usable in capital cities if you wanted to restrict it somehow.
---
(((goblins)))
---
Thank you for this. I hadn’t really thought about that, I just wanted to be prepared in case she asks about when to use skills and whatnot, what pets she should have (she wants a vulture, no questions asked!), pet training... but that is very good advice.
---
OP you're an absolute turbo nerd, and I mean that as a compliment.
---
I always used Imp. Imp opens with Firebolt to get agroo, then load up that target with dots and then dot up a 2nd mob and you dps that one while your imp keeps dpsing the first one. Usually both mobs die around the same time. Lifetap and go do it again. If I'm worried about life I use drain life. Might have to eat food every once in a while, but I like making sure to have food with buffs so it's usually worth it to reup those 15 min buffs anyway. 
---
The only issue with this is if you get jumped on a PvP server you're probably screwed cause you usually have 2 mobs on you at all times and your imp won't help you much against any PvP attacks. Also with lifetap you're hardly ever at full health. But it makes leveling fast and it's fun to ping pong agroo with my imp and burn things down.
---
and mana drain the pala.  even if he cleanses it, he is wasting a global and some mana
---
I thought priest's fear can't be dispelled tho?
---
This doesn't answer your question, but it just occurred to me and I had not seen it talked about much on this sub is the "Fresh Start" aspect of classic. I think it's more powerful than the nostalgia aspect. Here's an example from a different game: I used to play Ark Beta on Xbox and the servers were a couple years old. Everyone had asserted dominance and there was no way anything was changing that. It was stale and the game was dying. They reset the servers for a retail release a couple years ago and fully invigorated the game. All of the sudden, anyone could build up and become king of the server. It breathed life into the game and prolonged it another couple years. I think a lot of players are looking for that sort of experience. They want to level fast, down Rag and be king of the WOW server because right now in retail, there is just no way that's going to happen.
---
Getting a group and just keep question with efficiency for 24 hours
---
He retard don't lose your time mate
---
Hunter excited her the most, as she wanted to have actual, useful pets, particularly a vulture. I don’t want to steal any enthusiasm she has by making her heal!
---
It is going to be big despite the lack of marketing. Which will make Blizzard eat their own poop for not marketing it in the first place.
---
Well yea, because they ran out of players to crash the servers
---
Sale problem here
---
Seems to be some confusion in this thread. People saying they'd never take an Arms warrior. Okay, sure, maybe not if you're in a world first raiding guild racing for world first, and even then you could probably bring one, if they were a great player. But let's face it, most of you aren't going to be in those type of guilds. Arms warriors can pull top dps numbers in raid encounters in your average progression raid group. Know how I know? Because I played classic.  I raided as Arms. I also raided as a mage, and a shadow priest. Saying you'd never taken an arms warrior to a raid is like admitting you're a newbie.
---
From memory there are different tabs of the healing numbers. The information is there and it makes no sense for other classes to break that down so detailed.
---
So you get a lot of "wow look at healer x' from raid leaders but everyone in the healer channel understands well that paladin is MT spamming with 47% over healing of course they will be on top. I can't remember realistic numbers on what overhealing was like.
---
Well, my mobile data device is tethered to my PC, which then shares it's connection to a router. House has a few people using the internet. My mbps varies a ton, like I can't get an average, yesterday it was around 5mbps, in fact i'm at 5 right now aswell. But when you then strain that through a PC into a router wirelessly 2 rooms over, yeaaaaa, sometimes the pictures don't load either. I can't wait to move out of this place...
---
That was the only race she really wanted to play, so we’re in the clear on this one. Thank you!
---
Barrage tends to have a very graphic, long animations that just really drives home who done fucked up. Side winders was similar. Also the absences. The pets are mellee so you notice them missing. "Where's the hunters pet? Alright stop, big INC." Mage and Lock pets is/tend to be ranged so you don't really have view of it much so it can sneak back to its player without you noticing it ever disappeared. There's no question to it. Unless the targets are separated, you don't know what the fuck the rogue is doing or who they're hitting with all the commotion around em.
---
I can't count the number of times I've accidentally tab targetted wrongly. But as a spriest my spells have such modest animations it's really hard to notice, even if the targets are spread, that it was me who did it. So I did to not ever really get blamed ( though I usually say "my bad" and own up). It's really hard to not notice a million arrows flying at the wrong mob.
---
What the fuck? In Europe FPS is king ever since gaming exists
---
Thaat kargoz video is sick, watch it entirely and you will be left with no questions :D
---
&gt;Are you supposed to find an instance portal you've never seen, or do groups just instantly disband
---
i think it just puts you back at the start of the instance, i don't think there is a corpse run at all any more.
---
Last Raid as always 2-5% of Raiders - this only includes Clear runs
---
Yeah details is great for all roles. Sadly a lot of people don't look any deeper than dps/dmg done.
---
Apologies, it looks like I introduced a bug on Safari with the Do Not Track check. Looking into it now.
---
BUT WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING ALLIANCE, EVERY TIME YOU SET FOOT IN THE GLORIOUS CITY OF STORMWIND OR THE BREATHTAKING STRONGHOLD THAT IS IRONFORGE, YOU GET TO REMEMBER THAT THOSE ORCS ARE LIVING IN MUDHUTS AND STICKS.
---
The problem is it makes them immune to fear for 5sec, and if they have a PVP trinket then they can break fear again after that (depending on class). It seems REALLY hard to beat a decent player that is undead if you’re an ally lock.
---
Also, from the stats I’ve seen, undead has classically been rolled by 40-50% of the horde population
---
girls come and go, epics are soulbound
---
It's not about new generation. It never was. It is about MMORPGs being shit.
---
The new generation would play MMORPGs if they were good.
---
Too bad that most people alive (Blizzard included) believes that MMORPGs are dead because the new generation doesn't like MMORPGs, and not because everyone is making shit MMORPGs, which is the truth.
---
I was so desperate I just setup a private server for myself (can be done in 10 minutes without any informatic skills) and I'm testing some shit for the sake of it.
---
ret paladins
---
Ok well you're still wrong. You're sitting here saying it's objectively bad to not have strafe keybound yet one of the top PvP players of all time didn't have ANY movement keys keybound.... lol
---
This one is new because it's images of the images.
---
Gets to end of dungeon: mage gets twice the gear for doing twice the dps...NOPE! Doesn’t work that way. You can do dps as a balance druid and you can need on gear that boosts your damage-I wouldn’t be mad at you.
---
Still triggered that they don't offer a discount for us that have wc3+ft on bnet..
---
Legion had a big resurgence in player base and launch happened seamlessly. 
---
BFA was a simultaneous worldwide launch, so you’re still talking big numbers even with less subs.
---
With experience and sub data there’s no reason they can’t know what to prepare for. We aren’t going to be looking at millions of players trying to log in
---
I didn't actually think about this but you are totally right! Everyone will be on the same playing field with no 1000's of gold or abundance of heirlooms. Basically the only thing some will have advantage on is skill and time.
---
Fat chance getting a tank if you reserve the HoJ/Ironfoe

---
Maybe because the expected release date is something like december 2019 ever since W3 Reforged is on the launcher ?
---
super nostalgic for me because I too was a priest with benediction / t1 robe / t2 shoulders during nef kill only difference was I was  NE.  I also lagged a ton so this was extremely accurate lol.  During many bossfights I would face my camera down at the floor or to a wall so my fps would drop enough to heal effectively.
---
Just bind your auto-attack to tag mobs early on as a caster it will be much easier. This immolate thing is not going to work very well on a crowded starting zone.
---
For Destruction I agree but for a spec like SL you'd probably still win 75% of your fights with defensive and autocast. If you started actually manually controlling your pet you'd be at &gt;90%, if you start using macros you're probably at 99% lol.
---
So yea it depends on your definition of properly but you can easily do well with a SL spec and hardly any petcontrol.
---
Youre not wrong, thats why I never reserve personally.
---
i love seeing these, it's like watching history in motion
---
I CANNOT FIND A CASUAL PVE FRIENDLY OCEANIC GUILD THAT WANTS TO ENJOY CONTENT AND NOT JUST ZERG RUSH EACH RAID
---
First off, deadmines has a special place in my heart, and always will.  One of the things I plan to do in Classic is level multiple rogues just so I can gear them from deadmines and then forget about them.  (Which takes at least 4 runs if I get every drop I need off VC).  I'd run it literally thousands of times back in the day, and hundreds of times on private servers, and I still smile when I hear "you there, check out that noise!"
---
With that said, the one thing I would say makes deadmines not perfect, is it has the unfortunate condition of being a quite linear dungeon.  When you compare it to something like BRD or Sunken Temple, it's hard to say that deadmines is perfect.
---

---
Sorry this is wow classic not FFXI classic :)
---
My alt was a gnome rogue. I got into groups just fine, and escape artist is helpful in pvp. The unspoken part is that alot of players dont tab target in bgs, and as a gnome you gain that size advantage when everyone is clicking the bigger targets and not you.
---
Depends if the 6month +mount is cheaper than 6months when offer ends, if you're saving £10-£15 by buying before end of 29th then it dosent really matter about the month waste (unless you play retail)
---
I received brain damage reading this.
---
This post will age perfectly like fine wine. Don't worry, I have my other post from 70 days ago saying "the next 100 days leading up to classic will be the most exciting part of classic" and "not even 100 days into release, people will be shitting all over classic with pitch forks in hand ready to stomp on Blizzard's doorstep."
---
THIS ENTIRE SUB IS COMPRISED OF 80% TOTAL FUCKING IDIOTS THAT CAN'T BE BOTHERED SPENDING TWO MINUTES READING THE RULES, OR SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN 500 TIMES THAT WEEK, OR THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT A TRULY GENIUS UNIQUE IDEA ABOUT HOW AND WHY BLIZZARD SHOULD REPLACE LAYERING, AND THEN IT TURNS OUT THEIR "SOLUTION" IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL PROBLEMS LAYERING IS HERE TO FIX. OH, AND THEY ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU TO PLAY THE GAME YOUR WAY BUT ALSO NOT TO MIN/MAX BECAUSE THAT RUINS YOUR EXPERIENCE.
---
THE REST OF YOU ARE PRETTY OK THOUGH
---
No. He’s not. Are you in his discord? Skarms playing warrior.
---
This should be fixed now.
---
Not really, I think your biggest problems will be with high sustain classes like Holy pallies &amp; Resto druids that might be able to survive your burst &amp; drag the fight out to the point you run OOM.
---
Please don't talk in one word sentences like Donald Trump, it's really hard to tell if you're saying "Shame on Blizzard" or "It's a shame they haven't finished it yet." One of those accepts the realities of game development, and software development in general, that you can never really know how long something will take. The other is insulting Blizzard for not being able to release the game at a time which would generate the most revenue. Which would be a weird thing to do because I thought the community was still upset that Blizzard only ever does things based on what will make them the most money in the short term.
---
I see retail as a game that is completely different. I don't want to play that game. But Guild Bank is something i will accept.
---
That said, you also need a gun pointed at my head, otherwise no.
---
Just to add, a resto druid brings Innervate, BRes and FF also. And heals.
---
Not disagreeing that feral isn't useful, I raided MC/BWL on Lights Hope as Feral but people forget that resto also have the same beneficial spells as feral.
---
Agree, except that back then it was plagued with bugs, as well as the impossibility to be 100% sure someone wouldn't resist your traps (because spellpen didn't work with traps). But the class design was so satisfying ! That's basically at that time I fell in love with hunter gameplay.
---
pservers dont matter. its a different game.
---
Let me spell it out for you:
---
1. Uses straw man of “there are a few videos of the spec” to “prove” point
---
2. Calls same logic “straw man” when used to point out how silly his point is
---
Stop being silly
---
As far as I'm concerned they're welcome to play either spec, so that's on them
---
My top 5 favorite non-raid instances are:
---
5. Zul'Farrak
---
4. Shadowfang Keep
---
3. Dire Maul: North
---
2. Uldaman
---
1.  Dire Maul: West
---
I totally get what you mean. I saw that whole ancient protector thing as so cool back when I was younger. Now I'm into other tropes like um... uhhh well actually I dunno right now but I get you lmao
---
The tank will never get back enough threat to save the wipe, brez is useless outside dungeons.
---
To you, Alliance scum and traitors of the Horde: 
---
If you're choosing Alliance because your vanity is more important than your community, then you've chosen wisely to stay on the opposite side of the world from me. 
---
"Ugh. The Horde live in huts and swamps. Their capital cities are so ugly. Ew."
---
For The Horde
---
Eh, not really unless you're dueling somebody and know what their build is.  A good mage is going to see when you use the reflector and just wait the 5 seconds.  Nobody is wasting time on potions for BGs or WPVP unless it's a premade.
---
even so putting you respec up a notch that early is bad juju
---
I'm going druid anyway. Planning to go a hybrid feral dps/tank so I can offtank adds, then DPS the bosses
---
I'd say they tested the waters with SC remastered and because of its good standing with the SC people they decided to do WC3.
---
Having the Undead capital be above ground as the ruins of Lordaeron would have been really cool.
---
If you had read what I said then you would see my argument once again is based around you can ban gold farmers. Which they were all the time. Let’s also not forget that tokens sell for more then the gold farmers sell so it’s cheaper to go with a gold farmer if you’re buying gold. Tokens would barely drop a already low buying rate. So no blizz wouldn’t control it, it would just make the game worse
---
I sorta like the utility of micro-managing your pet. Getting a strong mob in a triangle aggro swapping pattern and watching it slowly corrupt to death is just.... shivery goodness. Unlike Hunters you have a pet for EVERYTHING, not a catch-all DPS or Tank pet, you just summon what you want for the job. 
---
Best of all....The vanilla Doomguard summon lottery. I could sit in IF for hours and do that.
---
That'll help with Pre-Bis but I was wanting a lot more. The Mage one I linked has Stages, leveling builds, a list of when you learn your spells, and tons of other stuff. I might just have to make my own.
---
Ni!
---
This isn't your meme is it? Just a repost, right?
---
Not asking you to play retail I'm asking 1 aspect tiny like a fireball model, to huge like a whole raid you'd like for fun. ITS FOR FUN.
---
Absolutely, pets bring so much to the class. I hate watching vanilla lock pvp videos where the pet is just sitting there passively by the warlock doing nothing, huge lack of skill on the part of the warlock
---
Berzerking only lasts 10 seconds btw
---
You could always use 'of (suffix)'
---
Raiding isnt the only aspect of the game tho, for example destro is crazy good in PVP
---
Sure, until every other AAA studio breaks that mantra because they want to advertise their pre-order early access.
---
The thing is: Blizzard doesn't NEED to advertise.  Almost everyone that is going to play Classic has already heard of it. (I say almost everyone because of course there are going to be people that just don't follow gaming news anymore due to IRL commitments)  Anyone else that would play Classic is going to hear of it by word of mouth, or by streamers.
---
I'm very excited to actually use some skill to tank.
---
I'm not excited for all the retail people to immediately dps like crazy while I'm trying to get aggro.
---
Lol this is exactly what people are talking about, nobody wants their hand held, it's a social game, so be a little pro-social and help a brother out ffs
---
Is this on Safari/iOS? Same after a refresh?
---
Yes it does. Mace spec gives you 1 skill point, so 5 points is the same as the human racial (but for maces, not swords obviously).
---
I'd participate, but I mapped the Capslock key to Ctrl like any non-heathen.
---
They are decent in PVP
---
Alliance from start of TBC until start of BFA.
---
Lok'tar ogar, bitches.
---
Although I made my own spreadsheet, I really like your site and intend to port everything over to it. Thanks, and keep up the good work!
---
Starcraft Cartooned was the work of one person and has nothing to do with the WC Reforged team.
---
The community. Despite the fact people know more about the game than ever, there are still players coming back who have ill conceived notions about the game that they formed in the past. Things like 'I'd never take an arms warrior to a raid.' Hate to break it to you guys, but arms warriors are great, one of the best guilds I was in during classic brought 2-3 arms warriors to every raid through AQ40 content. It wasn't a problem at all. If you're not a cutting edge guild min-maxing isn't necessary. Stop being pretenders.
---
This.
---
I can understand the lure of the VW, but in classic you won't use one for solo leveling all taht much. 90% of the time I have the imp out for that extra stam. HP = Mana.
---
How are you?
---
Drain tank with Succ is the way to go for Solo leveling IMO. VW doesn’t hold Agro as good as it does in the Pserver.
---
the tbc data is the same format as vanilla, the only difficulty with classic was translating the data do the modern framework could handle it. The hard work has already been done
---
Not I
---
Nothing like doing a full brd run and everyone deciding to have a snack break, by the end of the run you almost always had those guys added to friends and set to run more things together another day.
---
The earlier patches were much more challenging, not just threat wise but a lot of things changed between 1.1 and 1.12. The early content was piss easy to begin with but doing it at 1.12 makes it almost trivial.
---
The reason we got 1.12 is because the private server community quite aggressively chanted "1.12 #nochanges" for over a year. Those of us who actually was there 14 years ago and advocated a more authentic approach was lost in a sea of morons so Blizzard could barely hear us.
---
Not worth it because of shamans and undeads. If you wanna play a lock in pvp you should be Horde.
---
&gt; loot boxes for retail 
---
They already have those.  They're called Mythic + weekly chests.
---
Honnestly, I disklike everything in retail. From PvP to animations to quest designs to raids to zone design to QoL to ginds to crafting...
---
Will continue to be sad about no RP-PVP.
---
Don’t worry part 2 with a 5x5 is gonna come tomorrow
---
It results in characters looking straight up ridiculous. Class fantasy? Nah.
---
None of these arguments are correct. 
---
Blizz set a low price for tokens which makes sellers HAVE to undercut them. Why on earth would anyone ever by from a seller if it was MORE expensive than the option that won’t get you banned?
---
Gold sellers hack accounts. Lots of them. Ban one and three more pop up. They will always, always be there. Anybody who played vanilla knows this. 
---
Look man, you’ve spent your time trying to take cheap jabs at me rather than engaging with the argument. It’s okay to not like tokens. I don’t either. It’s okay to decide that you’d rather have gold sellers effecting the game than seeing a flashy annoying WoW token ad when you hit escape. That’s fine.
---
But don’t make up facts.
---
He kept people away because of lag and because they were, frankly, terrible players. He's a *very* lenient DPS check, and that's about it. You get about two minutes to do 300k damage, 200k of which are an execute phase, where warriors utterly *murder* him.
---
He's mechanically more simple than Baron Geddon.
---

---
This is what I’m using up to 40. 
---
Get hit for decreased resists vs up to +2 mobs. 
---
Then max out frost bolt for max dps on it. 
---
Next get permafrost. If you wanted to do frostbite you could get that here instead of permafrost but frostbite is RNG and permafrost affects every single frost spell you can cast, for each and every cast (100% of casts not 15% chance). 
---
Next get piercing ice because it’s more dmg per talent point than working on shatter combo right now. 
---
Imp nova because required for shatter later. Could sneak a pt or here for cold snap and/or 3/3 precision, but still have to get nova finished later for shatter. 
---
The frost channeling (15% mana reduction) is one of the best in the tree so you work on that as soon as possible at 25 to increase efficiency. 
---
At 26 get one in arctic reach because new rank of frost bolt at 26 and this is max cast time for frost bolt going forward. Up til now with 1/2 permafrost you can get off 4 frost bolts from max range. With 3/3 permafrost you can still get off 4 but only from razors edge max range and sometimes with lag, terrain, whatever not always the case. One pt in arctic reach fixes everything. Then continue with frost channeling. 
---
This puts us near 30 at level 29. You could respec here and go for full shatter combo but the whole point of planning a build, pt by pt and level by level is to avoid respecs. At this point I get ice snap and then ice block for pvp and general utility for instance groups/elites. 
---
Now I work on the shatter combo until 40. Each point here is a big single target dps and damage increase since we got all the other things early. 
---
Get barrier at 40 for more utility for both pvp and general elites/instances. It can save your ass. 
---
I stopped the build here because by now you can decide what you want to go for: AoE (3/3 imp blizzard) because now you have barrier and a mount (for easier rounding up of pulls); continue with the single target route. You can also go for clearcasting in arcane if you want even more efficiency with mana due to clearcasting (it’s RNG but overall is another 10% mana cost reduction on top of frost channeling). 
---
I’m not sure what I’m going to do at 40. But by 60 I want to have this final build for both AoE farming for epic mount and instances: https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?c=mage&amp;t=JBJCpxq6zazbzcpRrgrhpNsRsSpPq7pOy~rerfq5p_pQs4s5s6s7pWrxwawbp9pXrmpZsqsrpYrirjrkrlwcy-JDpTq8q9I8pUI7JE
---
I get the armor talents to increase the efficiency of I e barrier/mana shield for AoE farming. You can spend those three pts in something else like imp cone of cold. 
---
Can respec later for arcane/frost for raiding once geared or another spec for pvp that would have imp CS and frostbite.
---
What's wrong with Blood Elves?
---
I'm convinced the lack of hype is proof they're delaying the game.
---
Specs being only viable in PvP is not good.
---
Retail does it better. Thats my point.
---
Inb4 someone points out imbalances in retail. You arent getting it. I understand vengeance dh is trash. But for the most part retail has way more viable specs
---
Ah you’re correct.
---
You mean, like how they announced they will come Aug 13?
---
NO OPEN BETA.... AAAAAAHHHHHHH. ME NEED PLAY CLASSIC NOW!!!!!!!!!
---
**Deadmines**
---
1. There are patrols that spawn after each of the first three bosses is killed.  **No private server I have tried has gotten these right.**  They spawn near the dungeon entrance and will come up behind you if you're not paying attention.
---
2. You have more time to recover from Smite's stun if you tank him far away from his chest.
---
3. Gilnid has an absurd aggro radius.  Be very careful.  If you do aggro him, you can jump on the wheel to evade bug everything.
---
**Wailing Caverns**
---
Not specifically a pull, but a tip.  Always go left.  Any time you can go left, right, (or even straight), go left first.
---
* When clearing the top looking for Lady Anacondria, go left first.  She has more spawn points in this direction, and you need to clear it for the escort later.
---
* When choosing which side to do first, do the left side first (to your left when you enter the dungeon).  It's shorter, simpler, and has easier pulls.
---
* When you're clearing the right side, whenever you reach a fork, go left.  You will go the long way for a couple of routes, but you will also hit every boss along the way.
---
**Zul'Farrak**
---
When fighting the hydra at the end, he does a massive knockup.  The majority of the damage he deals is falling damage.  If you position yourself under the arch, you won't be able to fall as far and will take significantly less damage.
---
How did you have a horde vs horde BG?
---
I've done it on private servers where I had to be sneaky and couldn't do /follow otherwise I would be noticed and reported. My method was to play my main character primarily with my 15 button mouse and the other character is controlled with a keyboard hooked up to my second computer. In the case of having a warlock it is simple to make some assist macros to send in pet, dot and start wanding. This assumes you're going to be using two computers instead of running two instances of the game at once on one computer.
---
One thing that I got out of reading John Staats' "The Wow Diary" was this:
---
***NEVER MAKE AN MMO***
---
Oh man if that's the case I have a feeling the massive warlock numbers we see in polls here (but not necessarily on the beta) will come down
---
Did, /u/CommaHorror make, a new, account?
---
Bindings will get your tanks there every week.  You're never going to leave MC.  Onslaught Girdle from Rag is BiS for warriors, Band of Accuria BiS until Naxx for a lot of people, Striker's Mark for melee, Talisman for casters.  You might not get mains there every week, but you can fill out an alt/PUG MC every week for the above items to mains.  Rag hammers for the memes.
---
BWL, you run it every week for Drake Fang Talisman, Chromatic boots, Nef head, Nelth Tear, etc.
---
AQ basically C'Thun drops still viable in Naxx.
---
What about duo with a feral druid?
---
No they are not
---
Bro, they need to re-release that WoW Toyota commercial.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u15HmEMp2Qc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u15HmEMp2Qc)
---
Or that a green BoE wand is forever BiS for fire mages and healers (the + healing/fire damage wands)
---
&gt;I see some dickhead saying
---
Looks like you already identified the worth of these people's opinions, so I'd say you're good to go :).
---
They didn't fix going out of bounds under stormwind or in WSG so I can't possibly see them having changed this either.
---
You literally just said it in your first little paragraph there gold farmers undercut. People don’t need to go to blizz when once again the gold famers are making themselves cheaper. You say they’re cheap little jabs and I’m making up facts but you know just as well as I do hat I am completely correct. Gold cutters will always undercut the blizz coins because blizz can only make them so cheap. And the coins ruin the integrity of the game. They have no place in classic and I’m tired of people trying to ruin a game that we literally spent years begging for to have in its original state. No tokens.
---
&gt;	They outsourced the art to China. There’s no vision.
---
Come on, they have smaller eyes in China but that does not mean they have worse vision.
---
WHY THE FUCK IS IT NOT OUT YET I LITERALLY CAN'T PLAY ANY OTHER GAME NOTHING IS FUN AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH
---
Multiboxing should bem banner IMO...
---
I'd say a lot of the quality of life menu and interface options. They've already added some, like the retail raid frame options and more customizable windows, but the things that most people get addons for anyway - auto-dismount, loot window on mouse cursor, mass mailing(was this in beta?), better zoom options in map window, etc etc.
---
Stuff that is nice, doesn't change gameplay, and most people get addons to do anyway.
---
M+ in Legion and BFA is way more difficult than any dungeon from classic-WoD
---
if you go against the classic circlejerk you get downvoted, simple as that
---
DON'T WORRY, I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK AND EFFORT.  YOU DO A GOOD JOB.
---
Pretty sure hunters keep it up better than a prot spec warrior as warrior has to generate rage to hamstring
---
&gt; I'm not talking about max level content, but about the dungeons you do while leveling.
---
You didn't say that in your inital comment
---
Druids with pets. I wanna be able to be a cat with pet cat with a vanity pet cat with a cat mount.
---
[Ridiculous you say :p](https://www.wowhead.com/outfit=132753/vanilla-naxx-warrior-bis#screenshots:id=737410)
---
How can you enjoy BFA? Teach me
---
Man I miss the old dw shadowfrost spec. It was deserving of the nerf it got but it was quite fun.
---
And mages.. and shamans..
---
I expect I might be able to play 5-8 hours per week, yeah, filthy casual, i know. With 6-10 days /played, I doubt I'll be 60 before 4-5 month (took me 6 month in vanilla but I probably had more /played, but also more time to play).
---
Running 2-4 lvl 60 instances per week will take weeks to get geared up to raid. 
---
Clearing MC, clearing BWL, clearing AQ, that shit will take months each. 
---
I expect a lot of the non die hard players won't be able to start naxx until a minimum of 1 year into classic, more likely more. Makes me wonder how long people expect each content unlock and the overall life of wow classic to be.
---
Even 10% of guilds clearing naxx requires naxx to be there for a loooong time, which it definitely wasn't in vanilla.
---
I killed him on my 60 on PS on the way to ZG and was surprised how tanky he was for a lvl 30
---
Watching it now.
---
Damn Auto-dismount when taking a flightpath would be fine, this is what i'm looking for, not the obvious things everyone seems to keep saying.
---
I mean enjoy going oom
---
I rolled mining for coin and tailoring for gear and rp purposes in og Vanilla but I'm thinking this time I'll do the enchanting &amp; tailoring combo. While the coin from mining was nice I doubt it will be profitable early in the release phase where low level chants and wands will be sought after for a while.
---
&gt; I'm very excited to actually use some skill to tank.
---
Yeah sure, what's the highest m+ key you tanked?
---
Holy shit! Classic is 259155.92662963549316603247082699 years away?  
---
I thought it was a little over a month from now...
---
I doubt. Devs have nothing to do with bluepost and press releases. This is not a garage company.
---
I never said anything that contradicts my enjoyment for BFA. It's not the best xpac ever but I still love the game.
---
I really think they are missing out on sales by not releasing before classic..
---
I will after the initial rush.  Too much congestion in the beginning.
---
I actually like that dude, he also tells some lore about the weps and so on. But seriously, fuck Vaulty. God damn Sid from ice age lookalike.
---
Other game genres IPs =/= MMOs
---
Nothing wrong with targeting mobs that drop the item you're looking for that also drop something else you need like cloth.  I've played since 2004 and farmed plenty of world drops this way.  I'd rather farm mobs out in the world than run the same boring instance over n over with nothing to show for it.
---
Also, back then Krol Blade was much better than SoZ for hemo builds because of the 2.8 speed.

I have played almost exclusively alliance from vanilla to present day. However, one of my first characters on my uncles account as a kid was in vanilla and an orc warlock. I am recreating that orc.

I REALLY WANT THE NEXT THING AFTER WOW CLASSIC TO BE THE BURNING CRUSADE EXPANSION, BUT WITH TUNING THE ITEMS, DAMAGE, SKILLS, BOSSES AND PRICES TO STAY IN LINE WITH THE IMBALANCED PHILOSOPHY OF CLASSIC. THIS WOULD BE THE KIND OF WOW WE COULD CONTINUE TO ENJOY!
---
And i said Guild banks.
---
I strongly support Shryne's sentiment, once you have played gnome you don't want to play any other warlock race. Now this is of course spec dependent - I am more of a SM/Ruin kind of guy myself, but in SM/ruin spec the escape artist is absolutely outstanding. You can start kiting warriors after intercepts, get away from rogues when they have wasted their cooldowns.
---
The 1 min cooldown snare removal is absolutely outstanding for warlocks who play with CoEX. Now if you are more of a destro "burst em or get bursted" kind of player horde races might be better, and it is definitely so if you want to play low damage, no out SL spec. But for the quintessential vanilla warlock spec SM/Ruin and those who prefer to play in small groups there is no better option than gnome.
---
Don't let everybody stop you! Experiment and fail with honor knowing you did something that you thought was interesting and worthwhile. Find a mage and a healer (druid). I assume you want to obtain ironfoe? HoJ too, but that's a little.. Uh.. Easier to obtain.
---
I don't get it why video games, specifically computer video games, need a big budget ad spot on the TV or youtube.  
---
The best example is Apex Legends, which threw FN off its throne for a few weeks.  They had no advertisement outside of paid to play promotions on [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv).  There might be a commercial or two the week before August 27th, but usually Blizzard doesn't ever advertise any of its games until the 1-2 weeks directly before release.
---
You say the hard work has already been done, but they said that one engineer solo figured out how to translate the data to the modern framework within weeks. However, it's been years since then, so if that were the entirety of the "hard work" they needed to do, they would've released in 2017. If they've been working through nothin but bugs for the past few years, well, they still have (according to them) "hundreds of bugs" left over. Getting those bugs fixed takes time and money for the employer. And while I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of coding between all the pre-Cata expansions was very similar, we don't know for sure because none of us have seen it. I'll believe it's easy to do TBC if the guys at Blizz say it's easy.
---
I HIT MAX LEVEL ON MY PALADIN IN FFXIV LAST NIGHT . THAT GANE IS A LOT OF FUN BUT MY SUB EXPIRES 1 DAY BEFORE CLASSIC AND I CANT WAIT.
---
Them not fixing those jumps is really weird because I saw a talk that said wall jumping wouldn't be possible because we were on a newer client.  Strange that it's all still there.
---
Ramen.
---
the launch is to late in the EU, so im not i might get some breakfast in the morning thou
---
Mages get a pet?
---
Gonna roll a warlock as I played one from Vanilla to BFA (not that I've subbed since BfA has been out). Love warlock. Love the class fantasy. Love the mechanics. Love the utility. Definitely love the free mount. Looking forward to raiding the content I missed as I didn't hit max level before TBC. I started on my own account late into Vanilla. Also make sure when you hit 31 pick up the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe quest. It's one of the best leveling pieces you get as a warlock.
---
Great tips!
---
In classic they are like a looking for group tool you click on them either solo to hopefully find a group or click as a group leader to see if anyone is queing up looking for a group
---
I don't like it cos its impossible to tell what someone is actually wearing.
---
Of course it isn’t, ret pallies are completely useless and are never brought. Hunters wing clip spam with Nightfall and is the best class for this weapon.
---
This is cool, ty.
---
Played mage in vanilla and it was pretty sweet honestly. PVP is a little bit annoying becuase of how much of a glass cannon you are but PVE is great fun. You bring utility with cc, you bring food/drinks, and you are ranged and so you definitely have a leg up over other DPS classes, which means finding dungeon/raid groups is fairly easy.
---
If I didn't play it in Vanilla (swapped to horde and shaman at some point but still), I'd definitely play it in classic. 
---
I'd really love to play hunter for some of the PVP aspects but also PVE and the epic quest. Just worried about not beeing able to find dungeon groups ...
---
I've got a panini press that works great for grilled chicken breasts. I'm going to slice a few breasts in half and marinade them in ziploc bags. Then just pull them out and slap them on the panini press for 6mins and they're delicious. Maybe some microwaveable steambag veggies too.
---
Here is a typical 40 man raid setup for hardcore/progression guilds in the first few phases:
---
15-20 Warriors/rogues (tanks+dps)
---
@5-6 priests (holy)
---
@5 shaman/pally (healing)(maybe 1 enhance)
---
1-2 druids (resto)
---
2 hunters
---
6-8 ranged dps (mage/warlock)
---
No ret pallies, no boomkin or ferals, no shadow priests, no elemental shamans
---
The above list will be different for different guilds. Casual guilds especially will have a more of a mix.
---
Your shadow priest will be a great pvp player but could have a hard time finding a raid spot as shadow in the early phases. Meaning getting 40 man upgrades will mean respeccing into holy and EVENTUALLY hoping to get a chance at the dps drops.
---
I would start looking RIGHT NOW for more casual guilds who advertise an opening for a SPriest and get on board early. Make friends, be super helpful, and be the SPriest they are looking for.
---
Lolol classic nerdgasm
---
Well the last time I did this I was eating off brand pizza rolls and drinking Natural Light beer, popping Prozac like a mofo.
---
This time, I'm thinking fiber bars and wheat grass smoothies, for regularity, and maybe a silver one-a-day so my prostate doesn't explode.
---
Just waypoints/visuals really, each dungeon does have a summoning stone though at those locations where you could summon people like days of old if you don't want to use the LFR.
---
They are usually pretty cool to check out, even if Blizz knows most people don't enter through an instance portal those areas are generally packed with cool details and visuals. If you are into raiding I think it's cool to take your time and see every entrance at least once, it provides a lot of flare/backstory to the instances.

Didn’t someone test leeway on pservers and beta and found that both work the same?
---
I miss the WotLK dungeon and raid content. Frozen Halls will forever have a special place in my heart.
---
I am one of the guys who does alot of 1-10 speedruns, and theres still alot of people keeping up the pace between 1-10. The handful of people that break from the pack are the ones getting lucky tags, drops etc. Basically rng, which you can't master.
---
Nowadays there's alot of people looking to speedrun the early levels. If you tried the stress test at all. You would know that there is alot of competition. So saying it's easy to break from the pack within 6-7 levels is something I don't believe at all in.
---
But if you are certain you can break from the pack that early. Gj :) I'm fairly certain that I won't.
---
What?  Vaulty makes poorly thought out clickbait content?  Color me shocked.
---
Alright thanks I couldn't remember.
---
People don’t seem to get that the nature of game marketing has changed quite a bit since wow was at its peak.  
---
The notion that anybody at blizzard wants this to fail is just absurd.
---
I mean that’s a fair point lol. I guess my definition of Health is relative. It’s healthier than Doritos and Mountain Dew.
---
Peanut butter sandwiches aren’t inherently unhealthy, and there are a ton of healthy pre-made microwave meals.
---
some people like math.
---
Don't yuck someone else's yum.
---
A friend and I rolled some starter characters on BFA and the dungeons were such a joke I was amazed. I was playing a tank monk and my friend a priest and I really was just running basically non-stop through DeadMines. Pull 5-8 mobs and before half of them die I'm already starting my next pull of 5-8. Keeping aggro on that many targets was damn near trivial and my priest friend found it impossible to go oom.
---
In RFC there's a big worm boss now and after pulling it I was literally pulling additional trash packs mid encounter so that we could use more aoe during the boss.
---
It's basically third person Diablo now.
---
Using IPhone. I've restarted my phone and tried clicking link, and it still comes up as a  grey, blank screen.
---
&gt;LOL
---
Why "LOL"?
---
That doesn’t mean that it will be.
---
Ayyy, that's what I'm doing :)
---
Flexibility is fun. Farming for cat consumes is not :(
---
Yep. No Ret Pally has ever been brought to a successful raid. I forgot that.
---
But it kinda is. Did you ever wonder why every decades, the "older" generation ALWAYS says: Music back in my days was good, now its all shit. Its litterally been going like this forever.   
---
I mean humans have had the same ears for 100.000´s of years. In a matter of 100 years, our ears goes from liking jazz, then beatles, then rock, then rap, then pop, then trance or whatever. Your ears didnt change, so what made a huge population change taste in music? I dont know, but i know the reason you love the music you USED to listen to, aka the old music. And its party nostalgia.
---
he would kinda look like one of those 400-pound american
---
Feels like there is an imperative for the Classic team to do and say nothing that could be a distraction until the retail world first race for EP is done. That would explain the deferral of the stress test without a new date, which they’re probably in truth fully ready for if the comment about being on track for launch is accurate.
---
My guess as soon as Azshara dies the next day we get magically new date for the stress test, and they also announce “surprise” the test servers will remain up for all active subs until the early access name res date. But they aren’t allowed to let anything out that would bring that much hype until it won’t piss in retail’s WF pool.
---
ret has bad uptime with nightfall
---
Thanks. I love the character names really helped me follow the action.
---
Just as an FYI bnet balance isn’t going to be super useful to a Classic player.
---
Druids CAN....get one shot by every other class!
---
Since no one responded. Yes. Buying gold was perm banned. But the websites had ways to protect the buyer from this. Such as "you pay me $100 PayPal and then list a single linen cloth for 1000g on the AuctionHouse, we will buy that and you'll get your gold in the mail in 1 hr."
---
I doubt you can, unless you can get on his PC and add it via his own account.
---
That’s good to know! What would be more helpful?
---
DON'T LISTEN TO THESE DIRTY HORDE. FRIENDS = ALLIES. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT.
---
You know what's worse. 285 enchanting and blood of the mountain for the BiS trinket :)
---
No it doesn't.  They spawn...but they spawn late and they spawn in the wrong spot.  I've been in groups that have gone back for the pat (to get it out of the way) and they're not there.  But then when we get ready to pull the next cave, the pats spawn right on top of us.
---
In future groups, I've suggested to wait, and usually about a minute after the kill, the pat will spawn right where we killed the ogre.
---
Sometimes we get multiple pats from the same boss.
---
There are plenty of issues that server has with deadmines, and out of every server I've played, it's been the best at doing deadmines.  (The other big issue it has is they think ALL Goblins in the Goblin Foundry should summon mechanical golems, instead of just the engineers, which makes that room so much harder).
---
Agreed
---
T3+ sl was laughable
---
6500HP, with hellstone and smug resuction from Void and desthcoil was like 16k HP effective
---
basic repacks have the patrols working wtf?
---
Dam bang bang 😂😂
---
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT! LOUD NOISES!
---
U r 2 smart 4 me.
---
It depends on your guild.  Some guilds won't want to touch lower tier raids after they move past them, other guilds will want to raid as much as possible, so adding a self imposed challenge gives some difficulty to the lower tier raids.
---
There’s not really anything you can do to help him with Classic short of playing. I have no idea what any of his interests are so I couldn’t really tell you alternatives.
---
Ah ok fair enough I never checked their spawn location, I just know I always end up clearing the pats.
---
But if they spawn when you defeat bosses, how could you be killing the boss and checking their spawn location? Or are you saying they come from a random area that is not where they should be coming from, if they respawned in the proper location?
---
I've got I couple of friends I've managed to wrangle into playing with me the 27th.
---
All of them will almost certainly do this.
---
I'm one of those that returned with every single expansion to try it out, only to quit soon after (not counting BC and Wrath, I played them a lot)
---
I have no idea what, where or how anymore. It's like 7 games are built on top of a game, which technically is correct. 15 years of change in a direction I'm not at all familiar with. That's something I won't miss.

---
Looks about right to me. Hunter is a terrible class and also pathetic
---
STAY OUT OF THIS, ALLIANCE SCUM
---
Yeah and you go back every week to get bindings.
---
Next week: Low effort bingo memes as the free spot. Zzzzzzzz what is this content you guys upvote?
---
Tell me about it. I took a 6 year break and coming back I was completely lost and basically just spent 90% of my time in BGs where at least there is some social interaction.
---
Sir, you need to calm down.
---
Are there still game time cards available anywhere?
---
It's only 265 enchanting needed which actually isn't too bad to farm up, Cat consumes are just so painful because you need MCP/Mana Consumes/Melee Consumes, by far the most amount of consumes especially if you are also doing hybrid tank.
---
I just listened to the Countdown to Classic episode where they were talking about Ret using NF. I guess I should take it with a grain of salt since they were pro-ret.
---
Ok, thank you so much for your insight! I don’t know anything about classic wow I just know he’s so excited for it to come out. I really appreciate your help though bc there’s no use in me doing something that wouldn’t even be helpful to him! I’ll just do a wow inspired card instead or something :)
---
You can buy blizzard balance cards on Amazon. They can be used to purchase subscription time for classic.
---
I meant just SL I just have been playing TBC servers so it’s burned in my mind lol.
---
1. Shadow priests can dispel SL.  
---
2. That’s why you try to oom them and SL doesn’t effect mana burn.  Heal yourself and mana burn them and they are fucked.  
---
3. Fear has DRs just heal yourself up from the minimal damage they deal to you while feared.
---
4. Shadow priests have an INSANE amount of shadow resist, with one shadow resist piece almost everything gets resisted.
---
5. Are you.... are you fucking really comparing pvp to a level 40 duel tournament?  You’re actually joking right?
---
1. No issue. Every raid needs rogues and rogues are NOT overpopulated. All of the private server data and census data here indicates they will be 4-5 most popular.
---
2. 0 disadvantage race barely matters. In fact gnome is arguably the best pvp race anyways.
---
Ramen, and well since I won't have money or gear from a main. I'm imagining I'll be eating alot of dirt too before even lvl 10
---
Game Card ? its like a giftcard with 1-month subscription
---
Yeah, everything needs to revolve around your narrow view of how thing work.
---
Every server will be high pop at the start. They arn't releasing many servers.
---
It's why I'm planning to go heavy fishing for gold, then once I got my trinket go herb/alchemy
---
Seems like a bit of hyperbole to me.
---
Classic WoW raiding is going to be pretty easy.
---
I am calm
---
Because the first boss is so close, we can go back to the first couple of rooms real quick, and they're not there.  And then a minute later, they suddenly spawn (as in, materialize out of thin air) in the wrong location.
---
get a druid to tank ?
---
I assume he was more talking about the 3 mage 1 lock 1 priest pull the entire instance with eye of kilrogg and aoe them down groups when people were leveling 30-40.
---
That's still in 30 BiS, but CC really won't be needed for 90% of content.
---
WC2 doesn't hold up.
---
This is a very well written site. I was able to create a new character and populate it with all the gear of my old, dead feenix/ED character, in a matter of minutes. I was then able to link it to a friend of mine in a couple of clicks. The gear ranking system seems powerful. Great work!
---
Remember, PvP Ranking doesn't start until Ph 2. My guess is that while there will be some ganking going on, all-out war on PvP servers won't start until then because people will be focusing on gearing up beforehand.
---
If Phase 1 lasts say, 4-6 months, you have plenty of time to level all of those skills, bank a ton of cash, and be 300/Engi/Alchy with the Robes from tailoring on day 1 of Ph 2.
---
Level up with Skinning and Herb. Send all your cloth drops &amp; herbs to an alt. Sell skins for cash.
---
At 60 or before phase 2, drop skinning for tailoring and level it up to get the Robe. Make sure to save enough skins/cloth that will be needed for Engi. Sell bags for profit during this.
---
Drop Tailoring for mining and spend a couple of days mining all the ore you need to level Engi. Also keep gathering any herbs you see out in the world or that you collect while farming gold.
---
Drop Mining and level up Engineering before Ph 2.
---
Drop Herb and level up Alchemy. Alternately, level an alt to 35 and have them be your Alchemy bot. That way you can keep herbalism for making gold.
---
So now when Ph 2 starts you have all the Engineering goodies as well as herb/alch or both.
---
They only announced like 9 months ago? There are a SHIT ton of assets in the game. And they have to make sure custom games work.

I'm intending to make a video for some of the weird stuff I've done in brd/brs when I hit 60 that apparently other people never realized or never became popular. One of the most odd ones was splitting the wolf bosses and their pups in lbrs. I'm not even quite sure why it worked to this day, but I would use sooth on a bunch of pups, then pull the closest one with proximity from within their room, and thus be able to split the pull. This combined with hibernating one of the wolves lets you basically 2 man the encounter early with a rogue/druid setup which was good for farming boots iirc. Similarly taking out the quartermaster has a great belt, you can solo mother smolderweb, you can res across the initial gap to save some time and skip some areas.
---
One of the trickier pulls I think they changed by 1.12, with 5 of the mobs in the room past the dogs. Stealthing past the ones on the bridges was also a bit awkward.
---
Oh and it only skips one or two pulls, but when doing the reverse order for bosses you can skip some things by skirting around the outside of some buildings.
---
In my opinion, yes
---
Yeah, the funny thing is this is exactly what got me hooked with WoW in the first place. Being lost, everything new and not knowing what, how, when. It was interesting.
---
It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is but I think it's several reasons combined. The difference was that your character was grounded to the world. A vast open world with social interactions. For me, it's too much of a streamlined min-max culture now, where everything has to blow your mind constantly.
---
Feel the same way! Every game I'm interested in comes out after Classic. Right now, there's absolutely nothing that interests me
---
Within the last 6 months.
---
I’ll yuck w/e I want with their cum
---
That's even worse, a feral druid would want HoJ for cat form dps (just as a warrior wants it for Fury), and on top of that you also share armor  type.
---
Yeah, but difficulty of MC/BWL helps people not burn through content. I wish they'd take a good hard look at resist mechanics. If dps don't need FR gear for Rag, he's gonna get dropped insanely quickly. If you move to resist and raid mechanics where people not wearing 3ish pieces of crafted FR gear are getting one shot by fireballs, then now guilds are in a position where they have to work through the content over time to work together to gear up.

Wife is out of town on launch day so I'm gonna dual boot hers and my character on the first day atleast else I have to wait for her which isn't an option to me
---
You can use it in higher levels with mage armor instead of frost but i'd strongly advise against using it in lowlvl pulls if you go for aoe grinding, you just don't have the utility spells to compensate for not properly leashed mobs. A single resist or unlucky frostbite proc is easily going to kill you. Butif you go for a questing/solo build its an amazing talent to have. I personally am going singletarget build till like 22 or 24 and then switch to aoe without frostbite if aoe grinding is possible.

---
Of course not. That would be stupid. Please learn.
---
honestly, no. having a constant battle buddy, will definitely not be annoying, especially if you choose a complementary role or a role that doesn't contest him for gear. Definitely play something that sounds fun for you, but if you're down to try anything and they all seem fun to you, just talk to him about it, tell him you're interested in playing with him, and that you want to learn what you can. ask his opinion on what class you should play.
---
I definitely think you shouldn't wait though. the game doesn't have any downscaling mechanics, so if he gets several levels ahead of you, playing together isn't great until lvl 60. but if you start together you can do all your questing together, and relatively safe.
---
Yeah typo 👍 edited
---
You’re very entitled.
---
Yeah typo 👍
---
I feel like UC being so close to the plague lands is in favor of horde 50+. What's the alliance got going for themselves in that range?
---
That’s what I’m saying essentially.
---
Hey, I checked over your math.
---
Berserking 10 energy cost doesn't come into play.
---
You never cast Backstab or Evis without having at least +10 energy.
---
It'll come into play if you get dodged though.
---
Might have been easier to test had the level cap not been 40.
---
But then you don’t get to have as much fun with engineering
---
If you haven't gotten a thunderfury for your MT then yes, but you'd have to be the unluckirst bunch of people on the planet. Not a single one 8f the world 1st guilds lacked a MT with thunderfury when we went into BWL so while there is a risk you'll have to get him a TF after BWL is out the chances of that happening are so small you're more likely to win the lottery.
---
That's still better than im a gamer dad that works 40 hours a day and have 2 wifes and 8 kids so i can only spend 5 minutes each week playing what class should i pick that will let me full clear naxx get 3 legendaries and also rank 14.
---
It’s nice not looking at a disgustingly bright orange all of the time
---
I agree.  At the very least OP should know how a class plays at 60.  If OP wants to dps and raid at 60 then probably avoid shamans, paladins, maybe priests and druids too.  Just because OP is new doesn't mean he can't make some goals for endgame activity.  I'd hate to be stuck in some mid-tier raid guild that dissolves when they get stuck somewhere along the way, just because I blindly picked a hybrid class and don't get the same opportunities when I decide I don't like healing and want to dps.
---
Do explain how I'm entitled when I just said I'm all for pushing the release date to further polish the game lmao

If you want that for release I believe you can pre-load it

Going to be rather casual this time round - where will I get the higher damage?

You're treating reforged like its a marketing gimick for Classic. It's not. They're a notoriously slow studio.

"Wrath of Ragnaros - Melee Knockback25s cooldown. "Taste the Flames of Sulfuron!" .When this ability is used characters in melee range are sent flying, much like Garr's guardians when they die. This also reduces threat of the targets it does hit."
---
This was a description of Ragnaros' knockback spell, Wrath of Ragnaros, [found here.](
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Ragnaros_(tactics))
---
Although I originally stated the MT "loses all his threat" as hyperbole, in actuality it's just a threat reduction. However, it doesn't reapply "once they're in range again".

I don't think it's even that they don't need to so much as if they said something based on estimates or forecasts and it turned out to be wrong they'd see no end to complaints about it. The backlash from staying quiet is always going to be less than the backlash from being wrong. A great example being that thread about "Where is the remastered WC3" or all of the conspiracy theories about why the stress test got cancelled.
---
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO PICK A CLASS? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY? WHY CANT I JUST PICK A CLASS AND BE HAPPY? I WANT TO BE A SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE AND PICK A SHADOW PRIEST OR FERAL DRUID BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN RAIDS AT 60
---
i think it's kinda neat to see how other people do their setup. see their cool lights and color schemes. I know I'm proud of mine
---
I'm on the same boat, I'll be in Brasil until January. I figure I'll be raiding before I can return the US. I figure I'll just keep this little secret from my guild and hope they don't the ping/the fact I'm a Lenovo yoga touchpad/laptop. The question for you: Can I transfer my characters across realms through paid services? starting in europe but maybe you live in North America or Aisa? Does anyone have an answer for this?
---
There is a popular belief, also held at Blizzard, that Classic won't maintain a playerbase beyond a few months.
---
&gt; Your original point was that “As soon as you get sword specialisation in the combat tree, swords will be better than any other weapon type.
---
You obviously have not noticed that I have relaxed my stance (through our discussion) since that initial statement. But that's fine, I am used to people missing/ignoring things that are written here.
---
&gt; So, I’m pointing out that there are comparable, if not better, maces in the 40+ level range.
---
I'll repeat myself again: I never said that there aren't any, just very few compared to good sword options. (Now I have said it three times)
---
&gt; How is it not a better mainhand weapon?
---
Alright, point taken. It is better than the SM/RD swords. But considering that you'll realistically get it 5-10 levels later this slight improvement is to be expected and not all that significant. A more realistic comparison would be Thrash Blade, which is a lot better (and arguably easier to get).
---
Go mage if you are going casual. Warlock is a waiting game. We are going to be weakish for the first couple phases. You’ll be able to get more down on a casual basis as a mage.
---
Nah, we’d just get the best private server launch ever, with accurate data from the Beta and tens of thousands of people who’ve been waiting for this for months.
---
They care about what stockholders feel and care about.
---
That's it, the community and consumers can go fuck themselves. We'll buy their shit pretty much regardless, we don't matter whatsoever.
---
TBC heroics in two to two and a half years
---
don't get me wrong classic dungeons are all well and good and I'm sure we will see some raised eyebrows when retail babies see a 45 min timer popping up in strat UD runs. But they are a mere shadow compared to TBC/Cata release version heroics.
---
When CC was not just about ' well classes are lacking AoE threat and damage' but a result of 'things are actually dangerous'
---
Speedrunning the raids is what people did while wearing pserver goggles.
---
I think TBC/Cataclysm were the best from a mechanical standpoint. 
---
I think the standard for an amazing dungeon, is when mobs, or mob packs have a role and veteran players know exactly what each mobs abilities are. 
---
I'm always thinking "ok i need to jump to avoid damage" "the mage needs to spellsteal that buff" "I need to watch out for that pat" "we need to burst this fucker down immediately or we're going to wipe"
---
I am planning on running rogue for Vanilla, never have mained one. I don't think the challenge for getting two weapons is so bad. I'd rather do that than have to farm soulshards all the time. My toss up is between lock and rogue, so Im curious to hear more about your perspective as a rogue @60.
---
Then keep reading my critiques. They won't stop.
---
There is an advanced tactic called the imp triangle. That is all I can say. For it is dark magic.
---
I do like this idea, especially with everyone leveling soon. It would be an easy thing to support on non-60 characters. 
---
I would actually be set up well to show you the list of high ranking items that you gained access to with the level change as well.
---
Ok, I'm getting excited about some ideas here. You might see this quite soon :)
---
There isn't even a question about it. SS Prot Spec with Impale puts Fury/Prot to shame in Vanilla, and will do the same in Classic.
---
Pserver meta is just that : pserver meta. SS Prot builds will be the highest treat tanks in Classic. Fury/Prot, Feral tanks, they belong on pservers.
---
Classic will be all the way Prot Warriors.
---
Still, plenty of people on this sub daydream that Fury Prot and Bears generate more threat than Prot Warriors.
---
OMG really??? Such a unique idea! Nobody on the planet is trying to be a Classic WoW/YouTube star!
---
&gt;  theory craft to the point where the game is no longer fun 
---
Thats the fun part of RPGs for a lot of people. This sub and this "you can only enjoy classic wow if youre level slowly and play meme specs" circle jerk is annoying.
---
That was the irony of Wrath. Every single class got a really good CC but no one had to use it.
---
It’s important to realize warlocks are going to be kinda weak the first couple phases. At least the first 2. Locks don’t get great until we start getting hit gear. That doesn’t really happen until after mc.
---
Just because other people are doing it means I can't? I'm just trying to put myself out there man.
---
I saw DW tanks in vanilla. I doubt it won't be a thing in classic.
---
Yeah good luck with that. Sword of Zeal is also 2.8 and has higher top end damage.
---
You don't think that two week is enough time?  Or did you think that name reservation was only going to last one day?
---
Never done a mythic dungeon or normal/heroic/mythic raid?
---
I tried ISBoxer and it was super annoying for me. Gotta sign up for the account, get a free trial, go to a different website cuz it's managed through something else now. setup is a lot more involved too. I tried using it on a 1.12 pserver and never got it to work. Downloaded Hotkeynet and made a script and was up and running in about 5 mins. I'm dual boxing a warrior/priest and its going pretty good, im hoping newer macros like the spam wand will work on the classic cleint, i know theres some differences from 1.12 and classic macro syntax.
---
Another non sequitur...
---
Because in many places it wouldn't be considered healthy, it would be classified as regular food which it's the same as saying it unhealthy, but you probably don't want peanut butter sandwiches and microwave meals to be your main source of food.
---
Ignoring my argument because YOU have no other interest other blizz games is narrow minded.
---
Your reasoning behind having a second MMORPG invalidates the reason we are getting Vanilla. It's the same arguement a lot of players on the official forums use to complain about Classic servers. By your logic, everyone should be playing BFA just for the sake of not splitting people up. 
---
Players have different tastes and Blizz giving people different options is a win for everyone.
---
Deathcoil, is a horrify not a fear. So it can be cast even during wotf buff.
---
Many people will be shocked when they realize how easy Classic really is. You won’t be alone.
---
Leveling up a warrior and having a priest follow me around for heals and (early on) dps
---
Deathcoil is a horrify. So it can be cast during the wotf buff.
---
To me at least: Warlock is advanced mode, mage is simple mode, at least in Vanilla.
---
They didn't know what the hell the Warlock was, so they sort of threw every skill they could think of in your book. It lead to some huge frustrations, but also to some massively OP skills if used correctly. 
---
Most get turned off by the micro-management of the pets. Much moreso than Hunters due to the sheer number of Demons you can summon at any given moment. (yes..you DO have to do the Inferno and Doomguard questlines...)
---
If you can put up with the complexity, and have a decently OCD mindset you can be death incarnate. But....if not, you can still giggle yourself silly while watching that Melee slowly rot to death while chasing you with a curse of exhaustion on em, or at the spell locked mage wonding what to do now that you locked him out of every Ice skill s/he has.
---
I’m going the adderall route personally.
---
there's helping people out and then there's people just being lazy.  What do they think everyone else did their first time in there?  Just take the 10 seconds to read the boss summary and install DBM.
---
Yea this will be a great leveling tool for players who need an upgrade cause the outleveled their gear. Perhaps a small view for upcoming available upgrades in the next level  or few would be good too so we would know if buying a Boe is worth.
---
My wife is planning on playing with me, but I know she wont play as much as I want to, so I'm working the same angle to dual box her account and mine for all the times shes "tired because its 3am and we have work in the morning" excuses ;-)
---
Don't be a dick
---
To add onto this, and the faceroll elementary way dungeons are in WoW currently, the CC aspect.
---
I remember playing vanilla and not only would the communication between strangers playing together, regrouping, but just the fact that you needed to actually discuss a plan on certain fights or even large trash pulls. Marking a sap for a rogue with a circle, and a freeze for the hunter trap with a square, mage, you sheep the X (and so on) 
---
I came back to WoW 2 months ago now and its just a shame how dungeons are currently. Literally no time to even grab a quest before the group is already cleared the first three groups of trash, at the same time, by just gathering it all up and seeing how fast it can all be burned down with no consequences. Shame.
---
Okay that helps - how come Warlocks are weak in comparison for the first couple phases? Do they gradually start overtaking mages thereafter?
---
Of all the places to advertise being a streamer...
---
BRD was the best. HoJ trinket runs was a blast too.
---
You said they're not obligated to provide updates.
---
I said well then as long as they don't I'll continue to critique them.
---
Too complex to process?
---
Did you see the amount of bugs that were still in the game in beta? It still needed alot of work. I'm assuming they pushed it back because everyone is complaining about layering, they are making adjustments to it and this stress test will be the final go at testing it.
---
Yep, seems like everything is working fine now, thanks!
---
Ugh hum, dual+ monitors are a thing now
---
83 dps... only in one phase. Jesus, the amount of work for this is nuts.
---
Best race for horde warrior is Orc, the only time troll is better is for tanks who are getting thunderfury.  
---
Blood fury is better, and the axe skill is amazing.
---
Just go dagger spec and you won’t be at a disadvantage.
---
Fair point. Thank you for your input :)
---
It's not about not exploding, it's about smell after shit explodes.
---
Oh, and I hope "interact with target" is in classic as well, that will make things MUCH easier
---
I understand the benefits, it just doesn't seem fun to me.
---
Warlocks are very gear dependent. We need hit stat and a couple others. That gear doesn’t really come out until after Mc.
---
You mean afking outside and spamming world for players?
---
Id pay blizzard so much money to create a streamer free server.
---
Yeah, but how about VC?
---
The social interaction is what we all what. The /who and /w commands are all you need. If you're struggling, try talking to people.
---
Windfury baby or ur a casual
---
Paladins are behind the climate change hoax.
---
Repetitive content? We haven’t seen a “look what I found while cleaning my uncle’s mother in law nuclear shelter” post in at least 5 days!
---
That’s just an assumption. What happens when they allow server transfers?
---
You kinda have to go engineering like any other DPS for sappers and battle chicken. I went herb for money but you can farm DMT with a rogue if you get decent INT gear.
---
Ya that must be it...
---
I figured the classic crew would be welcoming. Just putting my best foot forward. Thanks for the comment.
---
Troll is considered the better pve race for rogues.
---
Far as I remember it was just a few knarly LoS pulls and the only issues occured when the healer couldn't keep up or the DPS decided to go out and tank adds alone.
---
Thank you, here's your mana burn.
---
Technically 5 mana pots (bottom left) but yeah we didn't use very many consumables prior to Naxx.
---
Ah shit. I'm in classic wow. Forgot that lol. My bad.
---
There are some good points, I take notes !
---
Yeah, that seems to be a popular opinion. Why is that? if you don't mind me asking. Just the lag and autism that comes along with popular streams?
---
That got patched toward the end of the beta, according to the patch notes (or whatever Blizz called it) anyway.
---
I think the slightly separate starting areas for troll/gnome are nice, feeds more into the lore of that specific race.
---
Yo dawg, I’m just telling you how it is. People like to tryhard and tryhard shit is competitive. Just the nature of the game. You’re server is gonna have “that guild” along with every other, just like in 2005
---
Shame!
---
{DING DING&gt;
---
They're for different things now.
---
Dungeons used to be entirely optional content you could explore with friends that'd give you some sweet loot.
---
Nowadays they're the easiest way to level and spamming them is just ez pz. And the dungeons can really randomly spike in difficulty without people complaining that a certain level range is annoying as shit.
---
Smaller than Private servers or smaller than original vanilla? This is how I leveled in vanilla so i'm not too worried about it. But I have been messing around on a Private server and when using the VW i'm surprised at how quickly his health goes down compared to my imp so if it's even worse in Classic then I really can't imagine using my VW for much 
---
Definitely will be switching between the two to see how things go with both but I don't really enjoy the VW tank strategy even if it's most efficient (which sounds unlikely). It's more fun to need to consider how agro works with my imp and when things go really well the imp pulls and I can pull agro and make the mob run to me before it hits my imp and by the time it gets to me my imp has drawn agro back (cause i've already moved onto the next target) so it runs to the imp. But by the time the first mob makes it back to my imp it's either dead or my DoTs have pulled agro back to me and it starts running to me and dies. That's the ideal I'm always trying to get, just ping ponging the mob back and forth so that it spends all it's time running between us rather than doing damage. I don't mind tanking the 2nd mob at all if I've just killed a mob that did no damage :)
---
I just added a certificate, it should be fine !
---
Tremor totem is ok, but it can be destroyed and the fear can run you out of its range. Wotf is ok until locks get deathcoil which is a horrify not a fear. So it can be cast during the wotf buff
---
 Voidwalker is nice for PvP servers. Sacrifice gives you the edge in a lot of gank matchups. 
---
On pve servers, do whatever you enjoy.
---
The drop into the pool is like a 'halfway' point really.  You have the purple and orange sides, then the fight above the waterfall then the jump into the waterfall.  You can do a quest to unlock the ability go straight into the water though, like you said.  Just don't miss out on orange and purple which are each unique and fun experiences!
---
I would go engineering, but honestly I just don't find it very fun hence why I'm sticking with herb/alchemy
---
Let people talk, what he said wasn't even that bad. Censorship of minor comments not even directed at a specific person like this is bullshit.
---
Can warlocks still compete with mages in either PvP or pve on release?
---
Great work! One issue: I get "Alliance only" quest rewards listed for my Horde character. Can this be filtered?
---
This is how you spent your afternoon.
---
It's not aging at all. You might think it looks bad now but it looks just as it did. So no it's not aging like milk your tastes have just changed.
---
Man, I don't even play Hunter but why are there so many major league assholes in this sub lately? What's the point of even posting this kind of stuff?
---
Sure you can get expensive microwave meals that are fine but that is not the same as saying all microwave meals are healthy, the waste majority are meant to used as a replacement for when you don't have the time to cook regular food, or are you going to argue that yumyum is a perfectly fine regular meal?
---
Warlocks are gear dependent. Until we get hit set gear which comes out in zul gurub. Its easy to get bullied if you aren’t carful
---
I for one would love if my wife wanted to play wow. However, I imagine that playing with her around release and for the first while after would annoy me at least. (because I want to level fast and play effectively) 
---
Another way to approach this would be to play next to him, but not with each other in the beginning. It would allow you to discover the magic that is world of warcraft and let him keep a hardcore pace if that is what he wants. You would not slow him down and he would not stress you thorough questing/leveling.
---
Then again, this is just me and my preferences I think it would be best to simply mention an interest in playing and discuss how you would want to go about it with your partner.
---
Yep, it looks good from my browser.
---
Healthy microwave meals? Care to share any actual examples? Or are you just another victim to marketing and think that "Lean Cuisine" and the sort is actually good for you?
---
That's the killer feature
---
Ah ok, my mistake. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Ah did they change it? Used to be 2.6.
---
Hey Booshies! Thanks for the words of encouragement! I appreciate it. Yeah I'm gonna try! I just hope to get a small community to interact with mostly. I don't really want to be huge lol. What's your youtube? I want to see it!
---
True true, i was thinking of the increased based agility too, thats why hunter was my first example :D
---
There is certainly an anti streamer mentality on this subreddit. But this is towards the established ones with a fan following, and the amount of disruption they can cause on a server. 
---
A bunch of streamers have truly toxic and entitled personalities, while others are actually likeable. Really depends. But expect to get ganked and camped constantly if you roll on a PVP server.
---
Blizzard was guilty of a lot of evils in TBC. Flying mounts, resilience, overpowered city guards, shared faction city, minimizing the value of professions, reducing rpg elements, streamlining dungeons, making enhancement shamans a DW class, etc., but the worst evil of all was none of those. It was blood elves and them being the only paladin horde race. Overnight the horde were overwhelmed with waves of alliance rerolling, horde numbers exploded hurting faction balance, and worst of all nearly 40% of all horde were now disgusting elves! TBC was basically the destruction of the horde and I place all my rage on blood elves.
---
At most grocery stores they sell Blizz account balance prepaid cards.

13th is name reservation.

&gt;It isn't forced but practically every employee offers paid time off and holidays.
---
lol not even close. Source:  
---
* 1 in 4 (25%!) of the country’s private-sector workers don’t get any time off at all. No paid vacation time or holidays. That's 28 million people btw.
---
* The average U.S. worker in the private sector receives 10 paid vacation days and six paid holidays.  Workers in the European Union are guaranteed at least 20 paid vacation days per year, while six European nations — Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Spain and Sweden — guarantee 25 vacation days with an additional 9 to 14 paid holidays.

Technically that's a 7% increase in DPS.  So, Idk.  That's not completely marginal.
---
5 Seconds of Google would've given you a result.
---
It's 15%.

This times a hundred my mans knows the true equation. BIG SHOULDERS + BIG PHALLIC WEAPON = REAL BIG DPS!!! ME AM TAUREN YOU GO SMUSH NOW!!!!
---
Yeah I've noticed, but I know the classic community is good at heart. I just figured I'd put myself out there and hopefully I end up with a couple of good people to interact with at launch!
---
Depending on the hooker, you can get both in one.
---
I just added a certificate !  
---
I love WowCartographe, it is really my inspiration but I try to make something more modern, with some different functionalities.
---
There's nothing wrong with requesting RPPVP server. In fact there's only one mega thread on the Classic Forums and they're keeping it respectful.
---
&gt; I find the arrogance of anyone who thinks someone wants to watch their ass play video games pretty off putting to begin with. But yeah people who follow streamers are different level of cringe.
---
It's very ironic that you use "cringe" to describe someone enjoying something that you do not.
---
I believe if they took the approach of changing item stats, specs, and ability values patch by patch I think we would be in a lot longer development period that 2ish years. 
---
It is a LOT of effort to go back through, especially since they only have the 1.12 data and figure out EVERYTHING that was changed in each patch. Sure I bet they have changelogs, but I'm guessing all of the values arent in those. 
---
I'm not a 1.12 #nochanges person, I'm more of a person.. Is this classicish? LET ME PLAY IT MEOW!
---
I personally thought the Beta was in good enough shape to release as a fully functional game and I would have been happy to start my actual classic journey then. Thats probably a very unpopular opinion though.
---
That's literally the only website that lists 15% you sure it's accurate?
---
Definitely one of the coolest conceptually.
---
I already agreed with you that i made a mistake in the post i chose to reply to
---
Make sure to properly sanitize the press afterwards. Leaking chicken juices can contain salmonella, which is able to survive without a host for weeks.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. BRD is a masterpiece. So much care and detail was put into one massive dungeon. When I think of an MMO dungeon, BRD is what pops into my head.
---
Bfd around lvl 24 or 25 for a quest drop from baron aquanis - very good for the level and guaranteed from 1 run
---
I think its good that some specs are only viable for certain tasks. Trying to make everything insanly balanced hurts the game, every class has a stun, every class has movement skill, every class has interupt / silence, every class has everything, thats where overbalancing leads to.
---
cuz blizzard fired all their pc devs long time ago
---
Unsure if it was them being dumb or just deliberate. Tbh they never liked the idea of classic and there are many things they could change for the better and make it more challenging/fun for everyone but they seem to have the mindset of well f@#k you guys then you can have it but we will make it the worse version possible.
---
Nice, I guess I should try my script in BFA and get all my macros setup using that client. Thank you!
---
I'm pretty sure daggers doesn't become good til AQ/naxx
---
This is what I’ve been wondering after reading through the comments on this thread! My Hope originally was to gift him an account balance so he could use it to pay for his wow subscription but I’m not sure if that would even work?
---
It disrupts and creates inorganic experiences in the world. Also, most of the people that follow streamers are toxic and will do anything for attention.
---
Say a streamer gets ganked or just dislikes another player in the game. Well it is likely that one of the thousands watching the stream will harass that single player, report the player to get them banned, ddos them, or straight up hack their account.
---
I don't really have anything against streamers, but if I had to choose I wouldn't want to be on a realm with them lol.
---
This thread’s comment section is living proof gamers in general want to put less ‘thought’ into games and feel more action and quick gratification. Question is if BfA and the design course of WoW and other games is the cause or an effect...
---
Really? I got rank 13 on a lock. You play vanilla at all? 
---
A geared SL lock with faceroll. How many people get aq/naxx gear? Hunters in pvp are VERY powerful. I can see you are inexperienced from your comments lol
---
I'll be on a pvp server unfortunately for that haha. But yeah, I know a lot of people will shit on me on here. But I figure if I end up with even 1 person from the subreddit it's worth all the hate I'll get. I just want a small stream to interact with. Thanks for the comment Gaskal!
---
If all they did was watch id give absolutely zero fucks.  But popular streamers attract a certain type of player.
---
You seem to be unaware that warlocks also have mana drain. And they have the same 60 shadow resist that you do (that's 15%, not 90% btw). Also since you seem to be playing TBC, let me tell that you can be realistically chain feared for 30 seconds even with DRs. 
---
Not sure what abilities you expect to gain at 60 that make this a cakewalk for a spriest.
---
What do you think Abduhl? Can you give me a number crunch real quick?
---
Gear homogenization. Can't speak for other people and i haven't played in while but i can't name a single item on one of my cjaracters. (besides the heartof azeroth)
---
Have like 10 Bis list for classic in my head and other items i want to have.
---
(Gnomish deathray, Robe of winternight, Tidal charm etc)
---
Make the groups yourself and it'll be a complete non-issue.
---
I dont understand how people are smart enough to make a reddit account to post but dont have the mental capacity to just google a simple question.
---
until the casuals started crying that its too hard LUL
---
IS THIS THE THREAD WHERE WE PRETEND TO BE BOOMERS
---
How the duck do you people not know how the token system works, yet you hate it.  Fucking amazing.
---
“Damn it sucks when people use their thinky brains to do thoughts - makes it so the rest of us might have to do the same :(“
---
Well you can always buy a piece of shit laptop and run on integrated graphics with a hundred chrome tabs open to emulate that old school feel.
---
I'll be cooking each meal or eating from prepped trays, because I'm not a fat slob.

Who is this? What’s your identification number?

All I know is I see tendies and must feed my 644 pound goodboy frame with healthy, delicious, nutritious tendies and dewey.
---
Warlock has utility like soulstones, healthstones, Mob running control (curse of reck), summons. They also have a lot of their damage come over time, which means on fast fights or raid bosses with limited debuff slots Warlocks simply don't do as much damage as a mage who is trying. 
---
Warlocks can get big shadow bolt numbers for sure, but if you want damage go mage. If you want Damage + some random fun utility traits that help but don't show up in the dps meters go warlock.
---
That's a fair and insightful comment, but I feel like that has a lot to do with the masses of people and less with the streamers. I guess streamers are just a way for those people to channel their... Pent up frustrations? I just want a couple of people to interact with. Not looking to cause a ruckus for anyone heh. Thanks for the comment!
---
They literally make a difference. Some people enjoy the competitive aspect of this game and games in general. Not everyone will look down on you if you ignore putting thought into the game like some like to, just don’t expect to run in the same guilds. Problem solved.
---
It's a pvp spec.  No
---
 This is the hard question, what spec to level with. I realize a lot of people who have played the beta are saying succubus and drain tanking is the way to go but the problem with that is as an Alliance warlock getting the succubus is a pain on a PvP server. Lots of travel time and then running through the barrens at level 20 getting attacked by a million people. Leveling with imp instead of succubus I can't imagine doing other than early game.
---
 I had planed to just go for Voidwalker but if it's as horrible as people are saying I guess I will regret it. 
---
For world PvP Voidwalker is pretty nice with sacrifice. I guess a succubus seduce would be good but seems way more unreliable than just being able to get an instant shield.
---
Man, I thought it was because they could hide in bushes..
---
totems were 100% fixed in PvP by making them non-target-able by macros or by giving them a % of player health instead of like 10 health.
---
Totem Stomping isn't a problem in retail anymore but will *likely by a problem in Classic (I think people are unsure if it will be possible, the devs made a statement that they don't like how automated totem stomping is).
---
I don't really remember the silverpine quest. Questing is one of the things I'm looking forward to the most. Classic wow had good lore. Not that the new stuff isn't good, but it feels like a disney movie or amusement park in the way that it comes at you.

That certainly good be one aspect of the situation. Another aspect is that any given change will be picked at by somebody, so in this situation they can just shrug and say "well that's what it was like" while totally ignoring that 1.12 balance and itemization + 1.1 content is a massive fucking change from actual vanilla, since that level of thinking seems to be beyond most of the population of this forum.
---
I'd recommend Failz for Ele PvP videos.
---
As a gnome player I can really relate lol
---
It doesnt necessarily have to lead to that. Balance druids are good at nothing. Just inch the numbers up simple as that. You are underestimating just how bad some of these specs are. Some have no areas of viability.
---
There's absolutely arrogance in believing that someone out there would enjoy watching you play wow.  Of course some people end up being correct,  but still arrogant nonetheless.
---
I don't think it is. I personally think not having dual spec is brilliant for the game. It forces you to choose, however if they were going to add it, they'd need to make it at least 5000g.
---
NO UNARMORED MOUNTS IS CATERING TO CASUAL FILTH AND THAT SAME MINDSET IS WHAT RUINED CURRENT WOW.
---
I would also say having a good plan is another advantage. The people that are going for a week one Rag kill are on a different level than pretty much everyone else with the amount of coordination that will be needed.
---
RNG stats on everything, Classes being the exact same, less generic spells thanks to the spec system, epics being the most common, and only relevant item tier
---
This is gold
---
It’s fun for me to read about. If you aren’t interested feel free to move along. 
---
But... see you at the bottom of the meters. You can turn the meters off too and then you’ll never know that others are outperforming you! In the long run it really doesn’t matter if you turn your mind off to it.
---
Yeah only killed mass pvp and made everyone play 2v2 classes.
---
Vanilla (or classic rather at this point) is a living organism, or like a free market economy. If a demand arises for a certain class rises to a certain point, it will often result in more people going that class if it ensures their chances to get into raids.
---
Hey, the post I linked is 4 years old while the video you shared is 3 years old. 
---
Smart move there, I have been exposed!
---
Thank you countdown to classic!
---
It seems like it used to a bit better and  more positive. I've noticed a surprising number of newer and low karma negative/troll accounts here that have a bizzare obsessive pattern like complaining about meme spec players in every post or a specific class over and over.
---
You could just grab the game time cards and put them in an adorable card or giant box filled with more smaller and smaller boxes.
---
There are very few arguments for anti-streamer that aren't also applicable to big organized guilds IMO.  
---
I'm in a guild right now that focuses mostly on wpvp. We fund our shenanigans by cornering late game mats on the AH and selling world buffs.  Some people hate us because when we show up in somewhere like redridge the horde come out and the whole zone becomes a shit show, but that's just part of the game.

Not having transmog means that you know exactly how geared someone is just by looking at them.

---
That wiki seems to be mostly copy-pasted TBC and wotlk articles judging by how often it mentions post-vanilla patch notes, profession levels, character levels, etc.
---
Here is also a comment from patch 1.9 that states otherwise.
---
"damage from devouring plague: shadow priest w/ darkness and shadowform:

                1143.56 damage/24 seconds

                (47.648 damage/second)

---
Just don't follow his builds to a T. They don't take into consideration that you might be leveling on a PvP server, so he skips talents like Improved Lightning Shield and Two-Handed Axes and Maces in his 1H and shield build even though both of those talents are mandatory for PvP. Skipping Two-Handed Axes and Maces is also pretty insane since you won't be able to fill a DPS slot in a dungeon group without it.
---
Some people approach their hobbies differently and are more theoretical and competitive than others. The only reason it bothers you is because you think they’re looking down on you when you you play much worse than them. It’s alright.
---
Isn't it also the most played race by far?
---
You're criticizing the metaphor and not his opinion.
---
\&gt; So no it's not aging like milk your tastes have just changed.
---
thats basically what the metaphor is implying: The graphics are not good enough to hold up to today's standards (while many old games do).
---
I mean, you won't be ganking me or anyone in my guild at all in the first place so it doesn't really apply to you :)
---
I would say it hasn’t always been the case. People with analytical minds love dissecting games and perfecting their way of approaching them. It’s human nature (for some). Games like WoW make that a possibility and it’s part of their beauty.
---
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU ARE SAYING!!!!!!
---
You don't really have a firm grasp on what that saying means, huh?
---
Made myself a PowerPoint for Rogue progression regarding gear, consumables, quests, professions etc. Can send it over if you want

Turn it into something fun and positive. Put together a posse to hunt down multiboxers. I used to hunt botters in Lineage 2. Had a blast.

So I thought you could, but then comments here made me thing you couldn't, so I did some searching. You cannot pay for a *subscription* with Bnet account balance, but you can pay for *game time* with it - https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time
---
He probably got ganked by one.
---
5 times an hour is plenty to "go fish".  Especially if you are with a group of 5 people helping you. Each person gets 5 resets essentially if they leave group. 25 chances in one hour?
---
Interesting to hear. I never played horde so I can't really compare myself.
---
Is this mostly in reference to PvP? As for what is considered the best PvP build for 1v1 what would you say it is?
---
It does. It’s only weapon on-hit procs that don’t work.
---
YIKES
---
true, should've worded it "only pve player"

They don't want to disturb their echo chamber that justifies their apathy and laziness. They are here to escape the harsh realities of their lives not examine them.

**Guild** : Ascension  
---
**Raid Times :** Tue/Thu 7-1030pm Central (Sundays on an as needed basis)  
---
**Loot System :** DKP Hybrid (you wont find a better system anywhere). More details in discord
---
**About us :** I was the GM / Raid lead of my guild during vanilla. We were the top guild on our server or vying for it throughout all of vanilla. I got talked into building the guild for Classic. I went PI mode and found 15-20 guildies from back then. We have a very strong core group. We plan to clear the raids in a day (might take a couple days the first week or so). The rest of our time will be spent stomping out horde and farming for raids. I don't like long winded posts. We are pretty much full on all classes. Im not a fan of long winded recruiting posts.
---
**Playstyle :** We arent going to no life the game. Been there done that. We will get shit done though. We will progress. We will progress at a decent clip. We arent "lololol hardcore" though. Vanilla/Classic isn't rocket science. We aren't requiring everyone to go engineering or be 60 in 3 days (i know, shush), but our priests wont be skinning/mining or anything like that.
---
**Currently Needs:**
---
We are sitting around 36-40 players right now.  We don't over recruit.  The most we will have is about 55
---
* Druids : 1-2
---
* Hunter : 2-3
---
* Paladin : 1 Retadin (yes we need 1 very active meme pally)
---
* Priest : 1-2 Shadow (will heal til they have gear enough to go shadow)
---
* Warlocks : 2-3
---
* Warrior : 2-3 (FURY ONLY)
---
Please join discord and DM me ( BDJosh#7103) if interested.  When you join, DM me for access to the WoW channels.
---
[https://discord.gg/nfq6ZMz](https://discord.gg/nfq6ZMz)
---
well obviously you wouldnt be trying to kill anyone solo as a holy pala.  so they'd have to get away from your dps warrior/whatever.
---
Its really the only solution i see just rolling the servers into BC servers would mean we no longer have classic servers. At least if they did separate servers i could stay in classic yes when BC launches guilds and th base would spit some but i would at least have the option of remaining in classic and working on Naxx exc. I do not want to be forced into BC until i have accomplished everything i want to do in classic.
---
The effect of vampiric embrace, I believe dev plague is 100% + vampiric embrace. It's a comment here.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19280/devouring-plague#comments
---
Forgot the “Blizzard is VASTLY underestimating how many people will play classic” without any info on how many people
---
Blizzard expects .
---
Can confirm will quit job and break up with gf on release. Priorities are properly alligned now.
---
Same boat here. Would like to try a new experience, and ironforge is a neat city, but it's difficult to accept something so aesthetically different from my preference.
---
I started with Orcs vs. Humans, but WCII was the one that was a huge hit on my campus.
---
Nah, I remember Pre-nerf Cata heroics holding a candle to BC heroics, actually. They weren’t *as* hard, but they made WotLK dungeons look like the jokes they were.
---
With all due respect, this subreddit is ran in a way that is *very* lenient towards self-promotion. However, you literally have no Classic-related content on any of your social media/streaming services, so I can't say this really is relevant to Classic. Feel free to repost when you have something Classic-related, and good luck.
---
I don‘t get why everyone wanna see marketing that much. I‘m happy there is not another game spaming infront of every website with ads
---
YOU CAN BE A DRUID AND RAID YOU FUCKING PUSSY
---
Yeah, streaming even with a significant delay in contested zones is like giving your opponents free maphacks. They might not necessarily even be anti streamer either. Just wanting easy honor kills and using Twitch to one's advantage.
---
Word to the wise - tone back on the "please send me a follow/YouTube sub/ like" as much as you can manage. If you aren't being outright paid by a sponsor to do it, no need to feel pressure to push your brand. It does get old quickly.
---
Thank you, I had no idea this existed!
---
This might be true for MC, Onixya and BWL. 
---
But AQ 40 and Naxx are actually hard raids. 
---
At least for those who have not been raiding private servers for the better of the last 15 years. 
---
If you did that, everything concerning WoW Classic PVE is going to be faceroll; you probably have over 1k Kel Thuzad kills and could tell everyone who abstained from PS the exact fart timer of every critter in MC. 
---
However, this post is about someone who has not raided any endgame boss beyond Garrosh HC in MOP and also a person who never played Vanilla. (We started WoW at the tail end of TBC).
---
I'd assume the heal effect can't partially resist on ticks and heals the full amount even if the dot tick deals reduced damage.
---
Good to see RP-PvP on there thank you for supporting the cause.
---
Don’t try and act all cool with me after being a dick. You can be a hardcore player without being so abrasive. I mean reread your messages.
---
Idk something tells me they are tweaking layering.... I know this is most likely just hope.  But I can't think of anything that would make sense otherwise.
---
FUCKING GRAVEYARD AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD
---
Yeah, wraths PVE content was designed pretty well. The aesthetics, layouts, and encounters were amazing. However, I’m in the #changes camp of they do Classic-WotLK. No LFD for 60-80 dungeons, make high value badges harder to get, and make the heroics hard (or add mythics to get the good badges).
---
Level 40 warlocks did very well in the last leg of the beta. One won the tipsout dueling tourny, mostly because priests dominated it and warlocks hard counter priests with drain mana. 
---
You have several spec options at 49 for a warlock as well, which can give your twink some variety over time.
---
Have you ever done any kind of professional software development? Or any software development at all?
---
Not that hard, no? Just zeppelin to Grom'gol and swim up the coast
---
Ret has the best uptime of all hybrids+hunters with nightfall.
---
I don't see why people make comments like this without actually trying to look themselves.  It's not a cut and dry thing, and there is false information when you start to look.
---
Just download it now?
---
=D make sure to link what your playing too!
---
God, sometimes the entitlement in this sub is out of control.
---
This guy has been runing around screaming about a 30% loss in crit in a number of threads. He writes these long winded posts based on false assumptions and him cherry-picking numbers that fit his narrative that prot warriors are the  best tanks for classic.
---
That's every class in the game though. Litterally every class once you stack gear is cheesy in that way. Ele shaman is widely accepted to have one of the highest skill caps in the game. Normally Ele shaman and, Warlock are considered to be the highest skill cap.
---
Outside of server information I’m not sure what else really needs to be communicated at this point.  They did a great job communicating throughout the beta.
---
My main is going to be a gnome warlock but i also plan on making a twink warlock down the road. What lvl bracket do you all believe a warlock would shine at? I was thinking 39 or 49 would work well
---
Oh boy.. people saying not to downrank renews. Lol.
---
Keep rank 3, 5, and max rank renew on your action bars. Rank 3 and 5 are for raid healing and max rank is for tanks.
---
Yeah, if Cata came after BC, people would be saying the heroics are easy. But Wrath really babied a lot of people. You could clear every Heroic with your feet on your keyboard and your mouse in your moob, while you eat pasta and watch Netflix.
---
You’re going to get a lot of people with little knowledge of leveling priests just telling you to go shadow, because duh it’s the dps spec. As you already know, before 40 you don’t get much out of the tree. I’m at work but when I get home later if I remember I’ll share the spec I’m planning to use for my priest pre 40.
---
"Why don't you just google?  Jeeez."
---
Maybe cause google is vague and wrong on the subject lol.  There's no clear answer on this really.
---
Can you be a hardcore player without talking down to other people?
---
Hmm, I guess that makes sense.  I believe all DoTs have their damage calculated at cast, so the healing would be calculated there but damage still has to check resistance and whatnot.
---
#changes for Wrath. Make heroics harder or add mythics to get the badge gear they used to give from the daily heroic.
---
Thank you SO MUCH for this! I’m so appreciative of the help since this is all so foreign to me! But I definitely won’t go that route now that I know it wouldn’t help him out very much
---
Um....the huts are very essential to maintaining the shamans natural habitat in being connected with forces of nature and thunder. Know ur lore and stay out of the hordes business. ZUG ZUG BITCHES
---
Same here, hype was massive, beta streamers, etc. Maybe we’d be over it and enjoy it less now, if it was released when that hype was at its high,,, but now, we will have a more natural entrance to the experience? So maybe its a good thing!
---
The 20% is vamparic embrace.
---
Devouring plague heals 1:1 damage caused, plus any shadow damage bonus from vamparic embrace, healing you more than the total damage caused.
---
Okay, then what is your point? You're just being rude for no reason because you know what he is trying to say. All your comment does is detract from the discussion.
---
The main character I have had since WoW first launched was a warrior, but I also used to play a Lock and its really hard to decide which one to play first.
---
I will wait for the pack to get ahead of me.
---
I DON’T KNOW WHAT WE ARE YELLING ABOUT!
---
I think there's a level cap to summons? Thought you had to be a slightly higher level to summon 50+, but I cant remember exactly.
---
Did you? Guilds farming Kel'Thuzad will still be doing 1-2 MC clears a week
---
Gotcha. Here you are: https://imgur.com/a/8wEtYSx?
---
I'd like to hope the reason for this silence and stress test delay is that they are reworking layering to some degree. They would want something like that used in the last stress test. It's an unlikely thing, but I can hope.
---
You should have marked this NSFW, tbh, and I really find it disturbing on many levels.
---
&gt;Oh I do, they rescheduled a stress test that even Kevin Jordan and Mark Kern agreed seemed bizarre, so you might as well throw your portfolio in the garbage.
---
Two people who haven't been involved with WoW in over a decade and have literally no knowledge about the modern version of the engine it's using said it's weird? Oh, well, that settle it then. Honestly, was that supposed to be a joke?
---
&gt;I'm not complaining, I'm critiquing them. You're complaining I'm critiquing them for their scrapped stress test and how we might have a bugged Hunter class at launch.
---
Nah, you were just complaining about something you don't have any understanding of.
---
Just be aware - as far as I understand from what I've read - level 60 mount is far from free it's like 400? From materials needed. And engineering is supposedly the most expensive prof to level so you'd just have to mine a hell of a lot of materials :)
---
Per boss.
---
I'm torn between warlock and rogue. I feel almost dependent on stealth whenever I've played a rogue. It lets you into so many areas or do things you can't do otherwise without being seen.  
---
But I love warlocks and the lore behind them and their utility is amazing. Either class I'm leaning toward orc, can't stand the undead character models.
---
It will come back a week before xD or when you can get your names
---
MC is a 2 hour run and BWL 3-4 hours at most. I’m confident that most people play far more than that on a weekly basis.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Retail you abandon the previous raids for the new ones, not in Vanilla. OMEGALUL 1-3 Thunderfury tanks by the time you go to BWL?!?!?! Most **servers** had 1-3 thunderfury tanks let alone the average guild dude you have no clue at all
---
i concede to the first couple paragraphs, i was rambling.
---
&gt;Man it must be nice to live in a country that gets to reap the benefits of the US medical research and development without having to pay a dime for it.
---
irrelevant. this comes down to tax structure, not medical research. how a simple case of bad luck like cancer can fuck over your entire savings and economic stability just like that.
---
&gt;"criminal"
---
the quotation marks were unnecessary, alright. i meant more the fact pretty much your whole prison system is privatized for profit and rehabilitation isn't even the goal. people can change if they are helped, incentivizing them to a cycle of crime is doing the opposite.
---
It’s not that bad.  It’s a lot less individual coding, and the videofx features are absolutely amazing for the amount of power it brings to your healing game.  If all you’re looking for is simple broadcasting, AHK or HKN will get you by in a pinch with minimal coding.
---
If you want to use clique on one of your alts to heal, but don’t want to swing your mouse across the screen or swap which window is maximized/focus, nothing compares to what ISboxer lets you do.
---
Too new to make it to the Bingo card.
---
But it's getting there:D
---
Mana drain is absolute trash compared to mana burn.  If the warlock is mana draining a priest who is mana burning you’re losing that fight everytime.
---
As for resistances, you mind telling me just exactly how warlocks have just as much as a priest with shadow protection?  If you’re assuming a warlock is going to have this buff 100% of the time you are so sadly mistaken my friend, not to even mention priests can spam dispel and there it’s gone.  Poof. 
---
And I never said that gives you 15% I said you COULD reach it through gear and your buffs if you really wanted to.
---
Oh you think you’re actually going to cc for 30 seconds without breaking those fears?  Let me know what that’s going to accomplish.  
---
Level 40 health and mana plays a huge role not to mention the damage of your abilities competitively to the health.  Not to mention, there are these really cool things called talents that give you a massive change in pace to the game.  Like maybe you didnt know this but with talents shadow priests get a half second taken off mana burn, IF, larger health pools, etc that they didn’t get at level 40.  The fact alone that you think a level 40 duel shows anything about what the real pvp meta is going to be like just sort of puts a giant red flag above your name that should read “IM NEW TO PVP”.
---
It’s quite clear you don’t understand how any of this ACTUALLY works and you’re probably just a forum parrot, which is fine.  If you actually want learn go look at videos of shadow priest vs warlock it’s nothing like what you are explaining it is.
---
Here a little clip of one of the best warlocks on pservers running from one with a caption of what I’m talking about
---
https://youtu.be/VRS8dRDW7wg?t=590
---
Just to clarify, I’m not suggesting shadow priests win 100% of the time.  I’m saying quite honestly it’s either a wash based on skill level, or with the priest having the advantage.  The 31 points SL locks spend into getting that sweet 30% reduction is literally just taken away in an instant and they are left with lack luster damage on the only class that has a huge amount of shadow resist by default.  And don’t even get me started on if they are a dwarf or an undead, you’re pretty much super fucked then.
---
I'll extend the offer as well.  Planning on doing quite a bit of gearing up via stealth runs and would invite a boomkin 100%.  Have no interest in playing boomkin myself, so another adding another player to the group that isn't direct gear competition would be perfect.
---
No. The pallys ARE the pornhub.
---
M+ 4 minimum. And then its really just about knowing how to chain your pulls while maxmizing AOE damage and interrupting/CC'ing the worst parts. 
---
Halls of Reflection and even Pit of Saron were challenging even in Argent Tournament gear. Been a long time since a mid-expansion series of dungeons was that much of a speedbump. 
---
Although the new Mechagon dungeon is perhaps a shift in strategy by Blizz...
---
Lol you're such a fucking liar. It's like you think people can't read what you wrote haha. Blocked.
---
My point was to let them now they were using the metaphor wrong so they could say something that makes sense next time.  You didn't need to reply you could have minimized my initial comment and moves on. Instead you decided this was more interesting to discuss.
---
Water fasting.
---
Nope. Just you.
---
&gt;I think the last time a dungeon really felt like a challenge was in WotLK.
---
REALLY?
---
It seems that for most people the hype died down during the beta.
---
Honestly...  It had to have been nearly complete when they put out the Stratholm demo.  I figure we'll get it as an x-mas present hopefully.  It looks amazing.
---
Honestly... Dungeons turning into a giant AOE zerg ruined it the game for me. Dungeons are some of the most fun I've ever had in this game and just blitzing through them was not fun.
---
I miss CC and focusing down healers/casters, etc.
---
But has far more added utility than a Hunter.

Just watch a couple of guides and you’ll be fine. Also get the right Addons, UI setup, and macros because this does matter a lot for healers. 
---
Dwarf Priest is a god tier combo in Classic and I think you will like it very much.
---
You prob haven’t lost interest, there’s just been a lack of news or gameplay coming out for a little while so there’s nothing to hype about
---
Yeah but it takes you twice as long to hit the button and by then a rogue could have already upvoted a couple posts. Why would I take a druid to a karma farm when warriors and rogues are in the game?
---
Hey, Mom! The meatloaf! We want it now! The meatloaf! What is she doing? I never know what she's doing back there.

Logging in to do the daily check list

Yeah if post Naxx plans aren't out by that point then I'm out. Naxx gear is basically a level cap increase.

No, that's wasis

HoTs came out way late to the Moba scene and was mostly dead on arrival.  It survived until they started adding overwatch heros which upset a large portion of the player base. The final nail was blizzard killing the competitive league.  
---
WC3 is very different from SC2 and many players will go back to a new version of the game. Hell even right now wc3 rivals sc2 on twitch viewership. If anything WC:R will kill SC2.
---
Although I agree it has become a dead genre for the younger generations. The evolution has been RTS&gt;MOBA&gt;Autobattler. Zennials dont want to micro manage control groups or manage building resources, building bases takes too long for action to pick up, memorizing and practicing build orders is tedious, etc. While many older gamers enjoy these gameplay elements it very much does not fit new school gaming.
---
I'd place Pandaria and WoD Challenge Modes on M+10ish difficulty level.
---
I love biig muskles.
---
Which they'll never look at since it's all in the game as well as their memory. Good virginity shield, though.
---
Cleared naxx in retail on hunter and nobody did that.
---
Hunters are tier 1 dps in mc and bwl. And also are tier 1 on many bosses in aq and naxx like twin emps or 4 horsemen.
---
Druids are trash with mc gear vs warrior in might. Absolute garbage.
---
&gt;It's not so bad if it just finds a group for you. You still have to venture out to the dungeon yourself.
---
you'll see more hoj than ironfoes
---
1.11 &lt; 1.12 so yes?
---
&gt; think the last time a dungeon really felt like a challenge was in WotLK.
---
Clearly have never done a M+ appropriate for your gear level. Or challenge mode in WoD.
---
He was 31+ prot after the patch and seemed pretty good at the time.
---
I'm not saying I had to take my hands off the keyboard like I did before the buff, just that I still had to have Omen open and pay attention to it.
---
Gary
---
Not a bad premise. I'm leaning toward rogue because it's what I know the best. Warlock has always tempted me, and what better time to start something new then when everyone is at lvl 1.
---
Ok so the actual real reason why gnomes and trolls have no capital city and starting zone of their own is because they weren't planned at the begining and only added later on.
---
This also kind of explains why the early female trolls were so horrendeous.
---
This is actually funny.
---
can you make these for existing dungeons?

Here in Norway we get 5 weeks holiday. We have 23 payed sick days. We have 10 days stay home with sick kids, also payed. And if your son has asthma or something that might make them more at home you get 10 days extra payed sick leave. Parents get together 1 year payed leave when a baby is born. Doctors appointments is also payed. All in all if you have a bit of health issue and same with kids you can basically end up close to half a year out of work. All payed fully.

How do I get flair?
---
They arent smart enough to grasp the concepts of economy. They can only think in terms of wow that had the economy permanently destroyed by garrisons printing gold.
---
While I don't want to get into the min/max debate, I'll agree with most people saying "go in blind."
---
*However*, I will say that end-game raids (large 40 person dungeons) have a hangup: If you decide to play a Druid, Shaman, Priest, or Paladin, you are *probably* going to be expected to heal. If you like healing or aren't concerned about raids, play whatever you want, it's going to be fun no matter what. If you really don't want to heal, but still want to experience the raid content, I would avoid those four classes.
---
Of course, there are exceptions, and there will be guilds that are happy to take a Retribution Paladin, or Elemental Shaman, but the odds aren't in your favor. Just something to keep in mind if you're trying to decide between a Paladin/Warrior, or between a Shaman/Mage, etc.

&gt; US might be a great and rewarding opportunity for the young, able body and progressive population. But for the rest it must be a living nightmare.
---
Nah the US is for rich old dudes who know how to control and manipulate.
---
It’s annoying, but Death Coil can help a lot since it eats up part of the immunity period WotF grants. Rogues were the biggest problem, because they can stunlock you from stealth and warlocks don’t have any mobility abilities in classic.
---
Original link please
---
Faps cover those, very common in speed running to have everyone fap when relevant.
---
Is that not the same for you?
---
Classic is 31 days away
---
HEATHEN !!!
---
how does the second wow window pick up the hotkeys when the first is in focus?
---
The orcs were mostly savage warriors recovering from blood corruption when they built org. It’s a makeshift place built by simple creatures and it shows.
---
If that was your point you should have said it. You came off quite confrontational and unhelpful. If that wasn't your intent then you should make it clearer. I didn't move on because I don't like when people are being attacked for no reason.
---
GIVE THE SOURCE FOR YOUR FUCKING 80% !!!
---
BASED ON MY OWN CALCULATIONS, IT IS PRECISELY 91.043% IDIOTS !
---
I had moderate success with a low value(0.1) for forcing plate for my warrior.
---
That's absurd. I've had trouble taking 2 separate weeks off during the summer for vacation because they were too close together (not quite a month apart)
---
Also, warlock is very much wand heavy during levelling and farming!
---
classic has the exact same syntax as retail wow for macros
---
Nope
---
I like how u left one guy with the green quest hit shoulders.
---
Completely disagree with the 75% of the time you’ll be using an imp in groups. A warlock who knows how to manually control their succubus is much more useful for groups, because Seduce is a very powerful CC ability. Turn off the auto-cast and macro it to a hotkey and manage the duration and cast time and you’ll be about as useful as mages are with polymorph.
---
You mean like atlas loot?
---
10 avocados and bananas, peeled and stored in the freezer along with store bought bag of frozen mixed berries, mango and pineapple
---
Mix all the above with flax seed, oatmeal and one raw egg to make a smoothie. 
---
Loaf of breed with whole foods in store made peanute butter and some locally made jam for pb&amp;j sandwhiches.
---
Then I'll meal prep like 5-10 serving of basic chicken breast/rice/veggies that I'll put in Tupperware. Put a few in the fridge for first two days and freeze the rest.
---
I'll supplement all that with uber eats whenever I want something else.
---
This is what happens when you get wrapped up in hype culture. You get yourself all wrapped up in it, then you find yourself losing interest because you eat, shit, sleep the subject of the hype.
---
Yeah I pre ordered the moment it was announced. Still ZERO word or news about it, which is kind of odd. Probably won't give a shit about it when it does come out since it looks like Classic is coming out first.
---
Vanilla WoW was great because people didn't care all that much about those things.  We just picked the class and race that most appealed to us.  You're already ruining it with this shit
---
It's just a game lmfao
---
There is no amount of in-game gold to make me play Alliance. Except maybe creating a Human Female and visit Goldshire when Pornhub is down.
---
"Bad player" is a bit of an exaggeration. Some people simply question whether his extensive Private Server experience makes him an expert on Classic WoW with regard to his claims about the viability of Druid and Dual Wield Fury Warrior raid tanking. 
---
There seems to be little middleground between people thinking that Skarm is a tanking god and people claiming that Skarm is full of shit.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
I AM PREPARING MYSELF ON PSERVES AND I CANT STOP DYING. WHY DOES IT FEELS SO GOOD ?!!
---
MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, RON
---
Depression or other mental illness.
---
I don't know what to tell you. Blizzard's cartooney art style just ages well. Looks fine to me even 17 years later.
---
If you’ve never played a warlock before I’d go with that one! The problem for me is I’ve mained each class at one point in my life so there’s no complete new class, if there was I’d chose that In a heartbeat!
---
Usually offtank warriors would do it when they weren’t actively tanking anything, since their dps in mitigation gear would be bad anyway, and they can spam hamstring.
---
Level them both to 20 then decide which one you prefer and roll with it!
---
I'm playing Alliance lock for non-gameplay reasons: friends and I have been Horde since Cata, want to get the full nostalgia with Alliance. If there's one thing I've come to learn about WoW, it's that you're going to have the most fun playing a class with gameplay that interests you. If you ask me, the occasional WOTF fear break in BGs is not worth giving up the type of gameplay you are looking for. I totally understand people not wanting to play something that's not viable (I love feral but I'm not touching that shit in Classic), but IMO Alliance lock is still very viable in BGs. I mean, of all the undead you try to fear, how many are gonna have WOTF up and be ready to cast it instantly? From my (limited) pserver Lock PvP, only like 50-75% of the time I fear and undead do they WOTF.  
---
tl;dr Alliance locks are still viable, so if it's the type of gameplay you desire the most, giving it up just because of the occasional WOTF is not worth at all.
---
There should be 1 more stress test. I'll have to make a rogue and just Manuel test it
---
Kelthuzad represent! Bellum Aeternus here
---
This sounds like a great idea healthy boy
---
Lol well definitely for those too.
---
He only kills maybe 6 people if you drag out the fight as long as possible. A farm kill he might kill 2-3 and an extreamly geared group should be able to do it with 0-1
---
I mean... there were also elemental invasions prior to cataclysm... my bad lol
---
Military press isn't even an IPF lift bro obviously it's their thicc quads that actually matter.
---
If you want to make it to top 50 best dps in the world, you do have to pick the best race. You know that human warriors/rogues will always be in this top 50, because in late game there are more swords than axes in Naxx, and +5 swords do make a difference.
---
Considering that the ratio of hardcore players / casuals on a private server is much higher than the one in Classic, I would put the numbers at 1-3% of the launch numbers to clear Naxx, and 15-20% of the remaining ones to clear it after Naxx launches.
---
Lol elemental invasions were added early on in Vanilla's life cycle.
---
&gt; irrelevant. this comes down to tax structure
---
The US spent over 170 billion dollars on medial research and development in 2016, over 40% of your countries entire GDP. You get the benefit of the money we spend on R&amp;D absolutely for free. The US has developed nearly every major medical advancement in modern history.
---
If you really think that this has no affect on how much money our healthcare costs compared to yours or overall quality of your healthcare, your sadly mistaken. Norway absolutely gets a massive benefit in the cost and quality of their healthcare based on US research and development and it doesn't cost you a dime. 
---
&gt; whole prison system is privatized for profit and rehabilitation isn't even the goal.
---
The system is simple. X felony has a punishment of Y years. I wan't criminals off the street. Maybe the system isn't perfect, but we have over 330 million people here. In the end it's pretty simple: Don't commit a felony and you wont go to prison. Seems fair enough to me. 
---
Our prisoners are fed, clothed, they get time outside. It could certainly be a whole lot worse. 
---
We are going to have to agree to disagree that prison system is a major issue in the US. Everything can be better, but the idea that this is a massive problem is widely overblown IMO.
---
So you're saying I shouldn't be a Night Elf Warrior Tank?
---
no transmogs in classic, correct?  
---
I totally get holding onto it for like RP or something though!
---
Should yes, but I disagree during Mc. Tier one for mages is better than tier 1 for locks. That’s not to say some locks will crush. But in my experience warlocks are harder to master than mages. So that’s why I think it’s 60/40 in the early days
---
Should have been the freebie middle space
---
Other way around due to tremor totem but sure thing, buckaroo.
---
I'm just confused about why you can't seem to understand that part of enjoying each others company is pushing a challenge as a group, and you're acting like the only thing guilds can do to be social and enjoy each others company is to slowly pace through MC for no actual reason
---
We're talking about content that's going on 15 years old.  Once Naxx is out, Classic is static on content with nothing new until TBC comes out.  Even if TBC: Classic comes out, that's going to be optional to move over to that  WoW: Classic is going to be frozen in time.  Once you clear Naxx, all there is to do is get more gear and perfectly min/max and clear stuff as fast as possible.
---
&gt; There's no challenge in running trivial content so once you had most the gear you wanted you moved on to the next tier. 
---
It's a different type of challenge to go for min/max speed clears.  It's a whole other challenge to try and defeat content with half a raid size.  It's a challenge to pull multiple bosses.  Go find me a strategy that's laid out for the triple pull I described?
---
We get  it, you're all high and mighty and press on once you clear a raid tier.  That's good for you, but some people will move on and never go to lower tiers, others will do everything, some won't do any raids at all.  That's WoW: Classic (really any MMO) for you.
---
I've never been in an elite hardcore guild but have had a few hardcore periods/guild experiences in my life. In my experience HoTs aren't effective raid healing tools in most encounters bc other healers will just top the raid off before your ticks go through so most of the renew just turns into overhealing. I mean if you heal with a group of disciplined healers on Alliance that put the raid over healing meters and consider HoT ticks then you're right. If you roll with Horde that discipline doesn't even matter bc any raid worth its salt will have 4-8 resto shamans pushing auto/'smart' targetting chain heals through the raid.
---
&gt;Elemental Invasions
---
It was an event during patch 1.4, it lasted for about 2 weeks.
---
True I guess. Hoping that there's a buzz and people are starting to gather I guess.
---
Mining and skinning.  I would rather do skinning and LW while leveling for the gear and armor kits, but it’s not worth still doing cardio past 40.  I’ll probably drop mining and pick up LW post mount.
---
Haha play what you want man, just need some edge masters gloves, or stack a ton of +hit items.
---
I know that your first wand will do just as much, if not more, damage as Shadowbolt. Makes more sense to save mana/health since the damage is roughly the same.
---
I am not sure how this goes at higher levels though. I have only tested this at \~lvl10.
---
You need to be engineering to use them, think you're missing up gnomish/goblin. Goblin can craft but both can use them.
---
These haters can get bent. Keep doing what you are doing, we need people like you.
---
They are usually BiS unless you get the whirlwind axe right at 30.
---
Karnor's Castle!
---
Yea I'm in the tech industry which is a pretty good one to be in.
---
Got 38 degrees (Celsius) currently in my attic-apartment... damn heat wave. I'm already looking forward to the weekend, when things cool off...
---
Lol it’s not that serious. Literally nothing is at stake
---
Play with him, it will be a great gift for him and an unexpected one for you! ;)
---
no crimson felt hat ?  wtf this mage frost EP thing... ill use classic gear planner on wowhead, thx
---
Warriors dont need  Will of the Forsaken, we can already break fears + there is a Blacksmith trinket. So it beeing "Awesome" no not really, not as a warrior.
---
Honestly yes, but I’m going by the damage meta. SM/DS ruin don’t spec soul link. And I believe most 60 locks will be speccing with them.
---
I've always felt that the relationship between Hunter and pet is a teamwork/buddy buddy type thing, where your pet is like your family. But when I play Warlock I like to think of my demon as my slave. They don't want to be there or take my commands but I'm the master. The relationship is extremely toxic. Something I like about BFA is that it really builds on that, example: voidwalkers always utter "Send me back", or "I don't like this place" whenever I summon one. Another tidbit is that in BFA the demon's names will change, signifying that it's a different demon every time, so you're just enslaving some random voidwalker/imp/etc  to do your bidding until it dies. For some reason thinking about it this way helps the class fantasy
---
Your comment should not be down voted. It's a good question!
---
Not as important because you don't have glancing blows, but definitely still nice for the hit.
---
No you got your feelings hurt and couldn't see anything because of it.
---
Come back again when we use single digits for days left until launch. and tell us again if your hype will still be at 5.
---
You are referring to the Elemental Unrest, which was a copy of the Elemental Invasions of Vanilla in Cataclysm. Similar to how the Scourge Invasion occurred during both Vanilla and Wrath of the Lich King.
---
If you've played Warcraft and know its lore, Orcs make sense.  But if you want to be evil, or an anti-hero, what's better than an undead demon summoner?
---
&gt; There should be 1 more stress test. I'll have to make a rogue and just Manuel test it
---
You mean Juan more stress test?
---
WONT SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN
---
I had a foreign language teacher that just could not pronounce one student's name...  It made me think of something cool so I just went with it.
---
For the first course, we will have a nice hamachi crudo with thinly sliced jalapeños finished with a yuzu vinaigrette. 
---
Our second course will be seared bay scallops with olive oil, salt, pepper and garnished with freshly chopped chives. 
---
Our third course will be a lightly fried soft shell crab served with organic lemon wedges. 
---
Our fourth course will be a lovely steamed lobster served with a spicy lobster marinara sauce over homemade linguine. 
---
For dessert we have Jacque Torres chocolate chip cookies and chocolates, Magnolia Bakery banana pudding and cupcakes, and espresso. 
---
We will also be serving Williams Seylem Pinot noir from the Russian river valley, along with an unoaked 50th anniversary Chardonnay. 
---
RVSP by August 19th 2019.
---
A meme that is genuinely funny!
---
Tertius, it's the name of my business. Latin for three :)
---
..Except as a lock you just macro totem stomp totems..
---
And looks AMAZING on humans
---
Correct, you get the originals when you preorder. Used them recently to play MooMoo GX :P
---
The most annoying thing about raid healing is the consumes.  I know everyone should be bringing some but something like mana pots are much more important to a healer than health pots to a rogue etc.
---
Meh when I made a warlock alt in vanilla I used a vw to tank the entire way and it worked. Just because you can't go balls to the wall in classic like on pservers doesn't mean it wont be fine.
---
dual = two
---
duel = SLAP TO THE FACE
---
Yeah that’s like the healer being the only one who has to run back after a wipe, while everyone else AFKs for bio and snacks. I want snacks too!
---
Not wanting meme specs in raids is one thing, but 5 mans are faceroll easy, you just need warm bodies.
---
I love it, but to each their own.
---
You EU? You’d be welcome with us if so. Small collection of fellas (about 8) that I’ve befriended from various games. Some I know well, others less so, some know the others, others no one. Gonna sit on discord and chat, play together if things are working. Probably on horde but still deciding.
---
Seriously. People really exaggerate this issue. Most of the worst beta issues have been resolved.
---
announced it, but it has been in the work wayyy longer. There was even a guy doing a sc2 mod for it..
---
Thats great, good job mate!
---
Both. Aggro isn't the problem anymore, but surviving and playing the mechanics correctly.
---
In classic dungeons don't get harder. As a fresh lvl 60 they are tough and that's it. With better gear they become easier and easier and at some point they are an absolute cakewalk.
---
In M+ the ceiling of difficulty is what's mathematically impossible. At some point the absolute best players with the absolute best titanforged BiS gear will hit a wall where they simply can't complete a M+ in time and get a higher keystone. They would either need to make incredibly conservative pulls and simply be too slow, or they make normal pulls but simply wouldn't survive the incoming damage or respectively dps simply can't kill the mobs fast enough. 
---
In retail, no matter how good your gear is and how skilled the players are everyone will find challenging dungeons if they want to. That's not the case in classic.
---
Kind of weird there's no news on it when it should be coming soon.  Makes me wonder if it's canceled completely.
---
Only the first two pets? Casual.
---
YO YOU FUCKIN GODDAMN ASOCIAL MAN, HORDE'S GREAT FOR OUTCASTS LIKE YOU AND ME
---
YOU'LL FIT IN JUST FINE
---
If the encounter is actually different in terms of mechanics, extra adds, layout, boss model etc (preferably many of these at once, not just one) then it can be okey. The dullness is when the epic ness is lost and it’s just “do the same boss except he has 30% more health and 20% more damage so you can’t do this till you’ve got another 20 item lvl)
---
I need the next stress test to decide between male and female forsaken warrior.
---
I care alot about animations. As far as I remember, male forsaken animations are generally better than the female ones .At the same time, what could be more badass than a girl with a rotten body and a pretty face delivering death....with a charge?
---
Coffee mostly, might make bacon and eggs by mid day
---
It's unfortunate it seems directed at you, but it's mostly just a ClassicWoW trend.
---
"You have two options for trolls, male or female." (no shit)"What makes you prefer one over the other?"
---
Maybe
---
"Which troll gender do you prefer, and why?"
---
I'm still debating if troll is better or not. Tbh I feel they are fairly equal.
---
Simple solution to that.  Don't do it.   Your primary role is offtank.  No one expects you to top the meters.
---
What peer we were you on? Lol this is vanilla
---
For the Alliance
---
Never played horde so I can't really comment on that. I was answering whether you downrank renew or not, and at least on alliance you definitely do. Alliance doesn't have chain healing shammies.
---
that idiot is a fking troll 100%. Might as well stop trying to argue with him. Just a clown.
---
Why?
---
I think so too, tanks and healers will still run things like strath for orbs to sell since they have a harder time farming out in the world.
---
How much time will I be losing if I don’t want to use the wand? I don’t really care about super maximizing my xp/hour but I obviously wouldn’t want to destroy my leveling pace by using spells if it’s wildly inefficient. IMO wanding is much more boring and less fulfilling compared to using spells. 
---
I guess I’d choose my caster based on which class utilizes wands the least, so which would that be?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/LezacmX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/LezacmX.jpg)
---
Why do hunters have the bets uptime?
---
You can have too many mages, adding more than 4-5 won't make ignite roll any harder
---
Yes I am definatly leaning towards the horde! I always loved the undead look, sounds and animations. I have fond memories of being ganked by many on al'akir EU. Nox and Grim.
---
Join him straight away and love the journey together
---
Assuming you can get all those 2.5 pieces before the DPS warriors.
---
Interesting. Do healing consumables usually get provided by a guild or are we expected to fund those?
---
5% MORE INTELLECT IS BASICALLY USELESS. AS A SHAMAN, I CAN TELL YOU THAT IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT THERE AREN'T REALLY ANY OTHER OPTIONS FOR TALENTS, NOBODY WOULD PICK THE 5% MANA TALENT IN THE ENHANCEMENT TREE. LIKE IF YOU HAVE TIER 3 MAGE SET AND YOU GET 2600 MANA FROM THE SET, OH BOY THAT GNOME RACIAL WILL LET YOU CAST MAYBE ONE MORE FROSTBOLT OH BOY BIG DEAL AMIRITE, AND IT'S EVEN MORE POINTLESS WHEN LEVELLING UP OR IF YOU'RE NOT A TIER 3 MINMAXING PERSIAN GOD AMONGST MEN
---
&gt; but the visuals were praised unanimously across the board world wide.
---
Definitely was not unanimous, lmao.
---
Damn really? That seems so odd to me. I’m not a huge fan of wanding, seems super boring to me. I like using an arsenal of spells. Which class would that be?
---
lmao typical redditard spending hours doing something wrong and then pretending its right, while the other redditards believe it and then parrot the misinformation as fact. gg noobs
---
I play hunter so Im going female troll because I HATE SIDEWAY BOW ANIMATION!
---
Heavy fishing?
---
UD warriors look pretty awesome. Enjoy!
---
Yeah have fun being OT with 0 dps, it's about contributing to the raid.
---
20 devs at 100k/yr is 2m/year.
---
you'd need only ~12k people paying sub to keep up with those costs.
---
Yeah but I didn't even say it like that..
---
Sexy dance fighting
---
also he was a guild leader in EQ poached by blizzard to help with wow development
---
Lots of pvp focused guilds will run raids for fear,. Pvp guilds will take shadow priests to hear them for that. Not every guild is tryhard pve that need that extra 20seconds taking a mage shaves off.
---
Going for Orc just because the way the shoulders look.
---
Get him a nice poop-sock
---
Hell no.
---
That woosh you heard was me on my flying mount, honest.
---
Like fishing a lot, planning to sell fish for income
---
I'm playing alliance on a PVE server with my guild so I'll get a deviate delight formula, fish some deviate fish and make bank
---
Have two characters. One for just playing with him and one for playing alone. Might help keep him/her around if you stick with him/her utterly.
---
WC3's visuals are part of its charm.  Having played it at Blizzcon, I'd say much of that charm is gone with Reforged.
---
The Warlock in the vanilla cinematic was an undead, which sells it for me. Just like Dwarf hunters
---
Make an alt on one server to play with friends, and your true calling on another for when they're not around.
---
You're right.  I made it somewhat coherent instead of verbal vomit.  What the fuck was even the point of that one lone comma?  A fat fingered mistake?
---
I mean, troll is legit better by a lot.
---
WoTF is huge. Canninalism is situationally good. Plague is so so. Touch is a one cast one application (melee only?)
---
Shadowguard procs everything good for you and bad for them, Synergizes well with Improved Shield.  Beserking OP. You can spam R1 Hex in BGs and get 20% heal reduction out for little mana.. full rank small fights for the damage reduction.
---
Also.. the dance. 
---
There is way more upsides to troll.
---
For both aspects of play.
---
If you NEED WoTF and can deal with the rest being medicre, your call. Keeo in mind with bs you can get fear immunity from a trinket... which you will have the slot free cause hit in talents.
---
All the educated spriests will likely urge you troll.
---
She will give everyone gold and platinum before she realizes it doesn't do anything.
---
Are you alright?
---
Don’t listen to him. It’s all about that sick rp baby. Aesthetics and feel of your character is actually the most important thing because it will dictate how long you play your character and how much enjoyment you get.
---
OH SHUT UP YOU ALLIANCE MAILBOX DANCING COW-WHORE, LIKE IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE CONTENT PHASES WHERE NAXXRAMAS ISNT AVAILABLE TILL A YEAR AFTER LAUNCH, THEN WHY CANT WE HAVE OUR UNARMORED MOUNTS? THEY'RE TRYING TO SIMULATE THE CONTENT FLOW OF VANILLA, NOT HAVE LITERALLY EVERYTHING BE 1.12 THIS, 1.12 THAT
---
^^^also ^^^please ^^^don't ^^^take ^^^the ^^^insults ^^^too ^^^seriously
---
Peachy.
---
You don’t have to just wand, you can use drain life which is mana neutral if you don’t get interrupted due to the HP you get back. Check out https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
wingclip rank 1 costs 40 mana and is instant, a hunter can spam it all day if he wants to
---
There are a few bosses with fear mechanics and a racial that doesn't share a cooldown with a trinket would help with those.
---
You're right - it's around 70 silver. If you're lucky with the random greens you can sell those to get 2-5 gold.
---
I think the hardest part at the beginning for you will be to tell whether you screwed up or someone else did, when you're healing. Because they'll ALWAYS blame you first, if they die ;)
---
Berserking doesn't do anything for spriests really, it only effects mind flay
---
If I said I don't enjoy offering some gnomer runs for free at 60 just so i could slaughter a bunch i'd be a liar. Glad to find common ground.
---
Oh did it also giv u cold weather flying for free in it?
---
Let's address some of these points:
---
Mana drain burns 680 mana, restores 680 mana and costs 310 mana for a total difference of 1050 mana or 210 mps. Mana burn burns 760 mana and costs 270 mana for a total difference of 490 mana or 196 mps.
---
The buff I'm referring to is Master Demonologist, which gives 60 resistance to all with a felhunter out. It cannot be dispelled.
---
Soul link can be dispelled, but it can also be reapplied with no cooldown.
---
If you fear somebody for longer than 6 seconds you can sit down and drink. A non-dr fear, even with dots running, can realistically last 12-15 seconds.
---
Lastly, the video you posted shows neither a SL lock nor a shadowpriest. Here's a better one of a duelling tourney:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-THDdQepm-A
---
Note that SL was banned in this tournament. You want to guess why?
---
Good idea. Im not sure how many of my friends are going to return, but I can have an alt ready for them.
---
Booooo
---
Haha yeah it's the easiest route forward. Blame the healer! Surely can't be the mage
---
IT'S OKAY MATE, I'M SORRY FOR CALLING YOU A FILTHY ALLIANCE NELF MAILBOX DANCER, I JUST REALLY WANT AN IVORY RAPTOR OKAY
---
And they walk like they have constipation, very nice.
---
Wonderful story! I too love writing RP stories for my characters and in a game where every class is appealing it certainly helps me decide. 
---
Please blizzard please we just need rp pvp servers.
---
Male Trolls were always my favorite for the Horde. Cool hair, cool animations, a lot of class choice and the best mounts on Horde side.
---
Blizzard: Due to customer feedback we are delaying the release of World of Warcraft: Classic to 2 months after Warcraft 3: Reforged.  See you all in February 2020!
---
No, vanilla priest is basically the same as bc, minus mass dispell.
---
And also that we don't need layering.
---
Male troll, so I can accurate represent my posture IRL and #relaxmon.
---
Nono, didn't you get the memo? Activision/Blizzard are greedy, except when it comes to classic. They start hating money.
---
I once joined a premade on a private server of all warlocks. Was pretty funny looking at the debuffs on everyone.
---
Play on PvE  
---
ggez
---
This is what made me want to go the route of healing. Spamming frostbolt just doesn't sound satisfying. That being said, I'm hoping I am able to learn how to effectively heal sooner rather than later
---
A mana pot was consumed!
---
I'm pretty sure Trolls only have the possibility to surpass Warriors once they hit Gresil and The Hungering Cold. Orcs having access to axes as warriors means their weapon skill actually comes into play. Trolls needs to use Edge Master's to get that weapon skill meaning they are sacrificing that armor slot worth of stats.
---
Once both classes have Gresil they're on completely even footing gear wise and I believe Berserking is viewed as even or marginally stronger.
---
There used to be a site called mapwow.com back in Vanilla, but it went offline and I never heard if they picked back up again somewhere else.
---
Did you calculate in the energy cost for Troll berserking?
---
I know summer and all but damn so much lost time that could be used on classic or wc3
---
Streamers bad, madseason good, upvotes to the left

Thanks! I do have the ability to flag items as horde or alliance only in my data and have them properly filtered. Hopefully most are correct, but there are definitely still some data issues here and there that need cleaning up. If you can tell me specific items that seem wrong, I can get them fixed.

The hardest part about healing for me will be knowing when to downrank. I understand it isnt good to use max rank spells at 60; but what rank spells is the most ideal? Another thing that comes into play is your +healing stat. When that gets high enough you can use lower ranked spells I think to save even more mana.
---
I suppose  the answer to this issue is trial and error
---
I can tell you what I'll be eating until launch: my girlfriend's ass, so she leaves me alone when it's time to.
---
Shhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
My gamer tag has always been my cats name and all my alts have an feminine affix on the end like -ana or -yra. I was 12 when I decided on that naming scheme and stuck with it ever since.
---
If you click the filter button in the top right corner of that item selection panel, you can uncheck "2H". I've got some plans to make this a bit more obvious soon.
---
I also have some plans around choosing default filters for a set, so you could do things like say you're only interested in 1H swords for your fury set.
---
SUDDENLY IM PISSED EVERY RACE CAN BE ROGUE EXCEPT TAUREN. I COMPLETELY FORGOT BUT BACK IN VANILLA I USED TO DREAM OF A MACE SPEC TAUREN ROGUE BECAUSE THE STUNS WOULD BE ENDLESS. FUCK YOU BLIZZARD OF THE PAST.
---
Why would anyone buy that?  Wouldn't stonescale be better?
---
I'd recommend rolling a Holy Paladin as a first-time healer. Unlike Priest, downranking isn't an absolute necessity. Some people downrank Flash of Light when they get over a certain +healing threshhold, but you won't be using multiple ranks of every healing spell like a Priest. You also have more way to deal with healing aggro (not to mention higher armor) than a Priest. Holy Paladin is just a much more forgiving class overall than Priest in Classic.
---
WTF YOU NEVER CALLED ME THAT WOW HOW RUDE.
---
Wanna hop on a server and do a duel?
---
Man dude, you really have no idea how to play this game. MCP is a 10% DPS increase, that's it. Powershifting is one button. But I guess that's out of the realm of your playskill so I can get why you are averse to it.
---
Have fun explaining to your RL that you don't want to provide any DPS because you are just bad at pressing a button.
---
SFK also holds a special place in my heart. My first run off it a blue dagger called the Assassin's Blade dropped and luckily a buddy I was with told me to sell it instead of equip it (was a rogue) turns out it had like a .1% drop rate and was a really good twink weapon. Sold it for a ton of gold and felt like I won the lottery!
---
The orcs were pretty well received, but anything related to the humans was a complete shitshow. Their idea of a warcraft art style did not work in live action at all.
---
For low levels, they're quite good. Selling at 5-10 gold a stack, or 10-20 gold on the alliance AH
---
well healing back than was a team effort. u would have phases of regenerating your mana and phases of healing. The goal was not to heal as much as possible, but to keep the tank alive and maintain mana amongst the healers.  So there was a lot of teamplay , adjustment and fine tuning involved, as u can see from all the messages in the healer chat channel in the vid. There is a healer team stepping in, going down to 3 k mana, stepping out to regenerate, other team steps in. the hot-druid and the Paladins doing the baseline noise- healing, priests are flashing in when needed. other druid is stopcasting big healing touches. It was a very finetuned teameffort, to conserve mana and produce very little overheal. 
---
Remember, there were like 6 to 8 healers for one tank in this fight.
---
the priest in the vid specifically went all out whenever the druids had their class call, and stayed out of fear range to be ready when other healers with less range were getting feared. That was the pov priests assignments.
---
I hope this is sarcasm.
---
That's why I said *more* than MC and BWL.
---
And Prayer of Mending.
---
Glad you've been enjoying it! Definitely still some data to clean up, but I should be able to iron that out over time. Any reports of specific items being wrong are helpful so I can fix them.
---
yeah, I completely agree with you. I guess just more the whole concept of blowing up the world and advancing the timeline had so much promise. Mechanically and design-wise it was pretty shitty from day 1.
---
Ofc. A good warrior will always do that. 
---
But if you play a forsaken you got one extra panic button.
---
MY INTEREST IN CLASSIC WOW WAS REVITALIZED ONE WEEK AGO AND I STILL FEEL LIKE THE WAIT IS ENDLESS.
---
I doubt there will be any marketing. Acti Blizz doesnt even consider this as a major release. According to their investor docs, they have no major releases in 2019. This makes sense as the game only exists because they want to take advantage of the sub money they have been loosing to pservers over the years. They are probably expecting Classic to be a minor cash cow for a little bit to fuel future projects.
---
I know some people do it so they can take advantage of thirsty morons bending over backwards to give them free shit
---
Agreed! Wait a bit and he will be so happy to play with you. Especially since it WAS your intuition/instinct though!
---
How does this work? Is it completely random?
---
🤤
---
Carry around a stack of arrows of appropriate level in your bags, so when she forgets to refill her ammo, you have her back.
---
And it def. is. Reforged is ugly from what we've seen so far, I hope they're trying to fix that.
---
Don't recommend leveling as Holy.  You can level as shadow/disc as a better combo.  If you plan to solo at all, Shadow/Disc will be better (since holy doesn't add anything to damage) and Disc has plenty of mana regen and utility talents.  You can still heal dungeons in that spec just fine (since there wont be much +dmg or +healing gear until later in the game and even then, you can just put that gear on and go).
---
you'll figure a lot of it out as you go honestly but downranking and watching your threat will be your main issues (and watching your mana bar).  Otherwise, just enjoy it :)
---
IM PLAYING EUROPA UNIVERSALIS 4 BECAUSE ITS THE TIME-SINKIEST GAME I HAVE!
---
Exactly. Retail will never have the feeling of getting an upgrade that ALSO looks really cool. Even if it looks weird, you associate it with the upgrade and imo feels way better than looking like a god all the time regardless of power level.
---
Giving a fuck what anyone thinks you should or shouldn't do seems kinda unmanly to me. People play what they want, and it doesn't matter.
---
I assume you are an expert on the subject, what exactly is it that makes it gay?
---
[This tweet](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641) is the best we have to go on for how patches line up with phases, so that's why 1.4 is phase 2. If we find out otherwise, I'll update as needed.
---
There's not a good way to filter on armor type when selecting items right now. I have some improvements planned around those filters that should let you do it properly soon.
---
I just played that too. They broke a freaking 20 year old game. hilarious
---
"H-hey guys im just pretending im a cute girl in a video games but theres nothing to do with my sexuality..."

Yeap... thats kinda strange to me.

Because animations  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
The gator is the hardest one before you get enough gear to burst it down. Hunter or lock?
---
ANGER MARSH MAKE ME ANGER.
---
That is private server mentality. They have had the same content for 10 years. Of course a new meta would develop.
---
Yeah but I'm trying to avoid a boring rotation and I keep hearing holy paladin is quite ...unenamoring? 
---
Also, end goal would be pretty sweet to get some pvp gear for shadow
---
they want it to be a title that comes later instead of piling all their upcoming stuff 1-2 months away from each other, too many people will be consuming Classic for a couple months
---
Thats a interesting idea. That level 1 run through stv would be crazy.
---
WHY ARE DAYS 24 HOURS, WE NEED CLASSIC NOW.
---
Thanks! I was just curious because I couldn't find it on the official phase website.
---
Hmmm I think your right. Troll probably is better then
---
Go for it, find a good group that will roll through 5 mans with you while you learn the ropes.  You might run into some elitist tryhards frustrated that this is your first Strat run instead of your 500th, but ignore them and do your thing
---
Most of john staats work was huge
---
I guess practice really does come into play. I'm fully expecting a lot of failure
---
Again, my experience is limited to low levels (didn't want to play pserver too much and spoil my experience in Classic), but pet management isnt bad at all. I was hesitant on picking a pet class too but one or two macros makes it pretty engaging. I have a macro that has my pet attack or recall. I send the pet in, move to the side, and start dotting/attacking (Look up triangle trapping to see what I am talking about). If the pet gets low on health, i recall to have it avoid some damage.
---
For skill management, I would just put imp firebolt/VW taunt on autocast. The taunt is probably better used off of autocast just in case you pull other mobs accidentally, but I did not run into any issues with it.
---
Also, Imp gets invis book at lvl12 (?) so you wont have to worry about it accidentally pulling mobs.
---
Eye of Paleth
---
I'm afraid not, but that's a good point, I probably should add that along with the forgot password functionality. If you wanted to send me your email address in a private message I could find it for you manually. Otherwise, you'll have to hang tight until I get that functionality built.
---
Is it poaching when you arent even in the company?
---
Apparently you don't even have to pretend in a lot of cases, you just don't correct them when they assume you're a girl.
---
Lol! As a Horde player I feel you have the true spirit of the Horde.

Looking forward to seeing you on the battlefield maggot.

Ill never forget playing on one of the biggest servers the the world for BC launch and having the intire server horde and ally shoved in 1 zone. There was another player at arms reach covering the whole zone, and it was very funny nobody was fighting, tho it was a pvp server. One of my top 3 moments in wow ill never forget
---
WC3 is easily the worst aged game for BLizzard visually. 
---
I wouldnt say its bad, especially considering age. But it isnt good, especially compared to windowed D2:Lod, 1.12 WoW, SCBW. All three of those held up over time better than WC3.
---
Being afraid to roll a female avatar in game because one feels it makes them gay tells me that someone has some insecurity issues with themselves.
---
Id like them to remake the WC2 campaign in WC3R
---
If I talent shadow, I'm not going to buy any unnecessary ranks of holy and vice versa. There is no "use one but talent the other". 
---
To me, it's not much different from  what many will do; put 5 pts into wand, respec at 40 to get shadowform, then put the next 5 back into wand.
---
Join us next time for "Everyone better roll a human!"
---
Most of the circle jerkers prob play so casually or not at all. Retail is a great game but a shit RPG. Its an action game at its core now with too many RNG loot opportunities.
---
Not a terrible idea for a shaman to have it, warriors are better for hamstring spam but a shaman will at least have fun with it. I played a fury war/OT and I would probably not have taken on that job tbh.
---
Are there any extensive and informative leveling/raiding/pvp guide for classic warlocks?? And if so could you link them?? Thank you!! I am interested in a warlock because me and my friends are getting a decent group together and there are already 2 mages but I know nothing about warlocks!!
---
Balance druids are awesome in PVP:
---
https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4
---
Yeah I’m talking about levelling/farming in the most optimal way.  You can use whatever spells you want, you’ve gotta enjoy the game/class that’s the bottom line. 
---
Generally it is quicker to use wand though!
---
I had a unique first run... I gave up on WoW during BC, and ended up giving away my Priest account.  The friend I gave it to played on, and I needed a new account so I rolled a druid to Bear Tank deeper into BC, and as WotLK came out I quit again.   So I will be rolling Priest again first, maybe a Drood for PvP, and probably a Prot/Fury War eventually.
---
I appreciate the discourse.
---
TAKE A PICTURE OF THE SCREEN AND EMAIL IT TO ME
---
For real, hes like the "casual" elitist LUL
---
I'm imagining the first guy to pop stealth getting gangbanged by the others.
---
They were being unnecessarily confrontational.
---
Suffers from the same problems of Heroes of the Storm, too much going on in what are supposed to be very small units. They need to simplify. It's almost like their artists have lost touch with the functional needs of RTS design.
---
gays don't enjoy looking at women so its opposite
---
Instead of character being saved locally, it would be even better if stuff could be perma-linked I think.
---
You are intentionally not getting it. 
---
You can also find rogues melting people unarmed.
---
Doesnt mean unarmed rogues are awesome
---
People always find a way to make something look good.
---
But its not good. Balance druid is trash. If there were pro pvp teams in classic, zero of them would be balance druid. They are trash.
---
This is you looking up the username and changing the password I assume, not that you're keeping passwords in clear text?
---
Yeah I get the same vibes from the above comment; to which point I thought it was a joke at first.
---
I'm a game designer and a programmer and I would *never* dive this deep into a game's math - unless it was a project I'm working on maybe. I am analytical and love a good problem to solve but dissecting something like this just seems utterly pedantic.
---
At the end of the day choosing between Orc and Troll Rogue is not going to change the outcome of any raid. There are too many other persons involved and too many variables in a raid to actually consider something as minute as a 7% increase in damage for one rogue. I totally understand minmaxing but *Jesus*. The effort OP put in is admirable, but I would never, ever expect someone to do this much work. Nor would I ever consider someone lesser than me because they didn't do the math.
---
Sometimes I wonder if these players are even having any fun, or if they truly think of WoW as a job. Who am I to judge, though. Enjoy WoW however you want, I don't care. None of my guildies will be expected to do the math though. I'll be avoiding elitists to the fullest extent so it doesn't affect me much.
---
If you haven't seen his legendary rant he posted about EQ on the forums, its absolutely hilarious.

"Whoever came up with this sheer fisting of an encounter can go fuck themselves. Do me a favor so I don't waste my guild's time on this kind of jackass shit-fest again, send me an email at tigole@legacyofsteel.net when you decide to A) Implement an encounter that wasn't designed by a retarded chimp chained to a cubicle A.)Get a Quality Assuarance Department C) Actually beta test the fucking thing and D) Patch it live. And please for god's sake -- do it in the order I laid out for you. Don't worry, I won't charge you a consulting fee on that one. And for good luck you might as well E) Pull your heads out of your asses. While you're at it rename the game to BetaQuest since you've used up you're alotted false advertising karma on the Bazaar and user interface scam of '01.Fix the Emperor encounter. Fix Seru. Rethink your time-sink bullshit. Fix all the buggy motherfucking ring encounters (I suggest you let whoever made the Burrower one do this since that dude apparently laid off the crack the rest of you were smoking). Fix the VT key quest. Fix VT (just guessing it's fucked up considering your track record). Don't have the resources to fix this stuff? Move the ENTIRE Planes of Power team over to fixing Shadows of Luclin AND DO IT NOW. If you don't fix Luclin, you jackassess will be the only ones playing the Planes of Power."

Kinda a waste of an inner focus imo.
---
To each is own. If youwant to waste a powerful cd and a gcd..

Also yes! Hasted mc I actually didn't think about! Portal troll is actually fun AND effective
---
Not wrong about what? His opinion?
---
In essence, yeah.
---
Hell even a hemo rogue that could use Ashkandi would be busted as hell. Add in WF weapon and purge and suddenly its god mode with 2 skills added. Mail armor and lightning spells are just icing on the "op as fuck" cake.
---
I 100% expected (and hoped0 the plan was to have Reforged come out so people could play it and be hyped for Classic when it comes out. 
---
In other words, in my mind Reforged should have been out a while ago so people could do the campaign and shit, then continue our story in Classic.
---
especially if I could like, mod Classic to have more modern graphics so they're both a reforged experience ;p Altho I get that last point won't be as loved.
---
Lol i thought i was the only one. Im not all that hyped to play this game hardcore. Not even sure if im gonna lvl to 60. Im actually already trying to figure out what race/class combo will be op and most fun while leveling and ganking other levelers. Thinking of enhance shammy atm.
---
&gt; Maybe some new pc-equipment like a new gaming mouse/monitor/chair etc.
---
In my experience, getting gifts from my SO for my PC never really works out. The ideas of what I want in my head and what my SO thinks I would like are usually wildly different.
---
You should go for! Tank is usually a very in demand role for dungeon groups both at 60 and while leveling. Communicate with your groups, as there should be people willing to share knowledge. 
---
Kiting means keeping an enemy chasing you while outside of its attack range. Some warriors use hamstring kiting to reduce downtime by taking less damage. This works because enemies have faster attack speed. You hit them with a big 2h, then kite until your swing timer come back up, get in range and exchange blows, then kite more. You do not have to do this.
---
Wanding is actually more fun than casting shadowbolt after shadowbolt! As someone who has leveled a lot of locks, I usually hit them with a shadowbolt and then wand them as they get closer to me because they cant pushback your wand hits. Wanding is super versitile and fun to get a few wands in when you can. It just adds even more dynamic play to the lock class.
---
maladath and edge ? or Obsidian Edged Blade as 2h fury ? that wont change thing either ?
---
Huel is like Soylent, except you can get an unsweetened and unflavored powder version that is pretty tasteless, but is pretty healthy. There’s no sugar, so you could throw a banana in there and blend it up and it’s pretty decent. The unsweetened one comes with actually no sweetener too, no sugar alcohols or alternative sweeteners that can give some people (like me), uh, undesirable side effects.
---
Well, now that I know you're against it.....
---
I'm definitely gonna do it!
---
Mage, Druid and paladin. Funnily enough, you managed the 3 classes I’m most excited for! I want to go horde, so that (unfortunately) eliminates paladins. Mages seem way easier than druids.... I might actually come to a conclusion for once!!
---
The fuck this have to do with Classic?
---
Mate thank you so much for your hard work. I would have loved a tool like this in the old vanilla days.
---
If you are in need of help for extra development let this mass of geeks know :)
---
It all comes down to preference tbh..
---
It's just on paper and in practice trolls man.. trolls..
---
I have had a way better time as a troll. Mained sp retail 1.12 and a few pservers through progression.
---
Alliance tends to be a much easier experience. They are sve basically every advantage. Horde is the hard mode of the game. Longer flights, harder questing, and a bit more rewarding.
---
With a threatmeter I found it very easy to level with a VW early on but I also specced into improved VW after I got improved drain soul.  I wasn't totally nuking the mob, but would usually immolate-corruption-COA and then wand and I'd never pull aggro, plus the mob dies pretty quick, you get a few 5-second tics, and the VW only takes a handful of hits before the mob dies so you can chain pull for quite awhile.
---
Well it was planned that Gnomes would get Gnomeregan was Capital, but since Trolls had no Capital they decided to change Gnomeregan into a Dungeon.
---
Seriously strange how you focus on this. I play male and female characters because I try to avoid having two of the same anything. Troll male priest. Troll female warrior. Human male paladin. Human female rogue. Dwarf female priest. Gnome male warlock. That's just a partial list of characters I play. Sexual preference has zero to do with it, and why do you care again?
---
Wit.
---
If you don’t pretend you’re a real girl who cares lol
---
Like a mouse yelling at a train
---
4800. Phone mistyped.
---
Male UD hold 2 handed weapons oddly. Just sayin.
---
Seriously? This is really fucking pathetic.
---
TROLLS DO NOT WEAR SHORS. Holy shit did I learn this the hard way when leveling up as trolls with my girlfriend, who is actually great at wow, but who focuses on aesthetics more than I do. Luckily she was a cloth wearer who could hide those fucking stumps of toes bulging from the base of a trolls legs.
---
Just something to think about.
---
Yep. It is very real thing especially in this sub.
---
LOUD NOISES!
---
You'll be fine, for your first few times tanking I'd recommend you be the same level or slightly overleveled as that helps your efficiency quite a bit.  Like doing RFC at 17/18 or doing WC at 21/22.  You'll still get plenty of XP and will have a little buffer if you mess up a bit.
---
OP just throwed salt into the wound, a lot of closeted dudes in the comments lmao
---
lol the amount of times he says "world first guild" or "world first tank" is so cringe. and then he talks about sitting around in discord RPing with is friends. lol hes a clown.
---
I enjoy the pwnzorship of playing a Dwarf Paladin, but for everything else I generally prefer horde. Sorry, can't point to a particular reason why.
---
My friends and I are choosing alliance because Ironforge and Stormwind are so much more enjoyable to be in relaxing and working on professions. Personally I enjoy a lot of the alliance only questing zones as well.
---
I've never played WC3 (or 1 &amp; 2, which I assume exist but have never heard anyone mention).  I only see the $30 pre-purchase of reforged on their website.  Can you play the original somewhere?  Ideally for free.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=18499 This is why Undead is considered the least useful Warrior race. You do not need Undead's Will of the Forsaken to break fears when you have a 30 sec cooldown that does the same thing + extra rage. If all you care about it looks then go Undead but if you get bumped as Main Tank from your guilds raiding group for a diff race War, do not get upset.
---
Ya so he stood in one place and hit flash of light. I remember the fight well I just never healed it. Shockingly easy.
---
Thank you, the reward will be worth it! An heirloom that stayed in my family for generations! It's an object you will most certainly vendor due to lack of stats but not to worry I will find it then buy it back, before proceeding to lose my wife yet again.

Layering: it's so servers don't crash at launch, hopefully it goes away soon.
---
Why we NEED RP-PVP servers: meh
---
Druids CAN: ok
---
What is your tip for a new player?: gear &gt; spec, if you play a warrior, keep a 1h + shield on you, if you are a hybrid, keep some mp5/spellpower gear on you. Switch when it makes sense. Also, keep food/water on you always.
---
Look what I found in a 15 year old folder!: I'm on my work laptop and have nothing, enjoy my favorite pvp video instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4QPuJCt2ig dat chain lightning off the random play to destealth the rogue tho!
---
Classic+ or TBC?: Why not both?

My battlestation is ready: yes

It's only 8172741302192184912484 nano-seconds to Classic!: https://www.epochconverter.com/countdown?q=1566856800
---
Sure, why wait the whole stunlock combo to kill someone when you can just cheap shot into a 2h sword windfury and kill them instantly! lol
---
MC can be cleared with 20 of a 40 man raid afk at the door. The content is already trivial. Who cares if a guild wants to spend a hour before raid getting world buffs  to make the raid go faster?  If you don't want to do it, there will be dozens if not hundreds of guilds not requiring world buffs.
---
First time I played WoW I was 10 years old. I stayed up all night to level to 10 on my night elf warrior. I miss the night elf staring zone music. Instant chills!!! Wish I could get into this game like I used to.
---
To expand on that, coming from a long time healer-
---
The party will find new and inventive ways to try to get everyone killed. When that happens, they will try and most likely blame you. Don’t be too timid to let the tank or whoever is doing the pull that you’re still drinking for mana and don’t engage yet. 
---
I’ve literally sat down after a fight to start drinking as I was oom, announced that to the group, and the tank charges in pulling the next round of trash mobs and, of course, a pat. We wipe and I was kicked from the group and whispered “trash heals” lol. There will be times where ya, it’s your fault. Apologize and move on. But MAN do groups love to blame heals when they screw up.
---
Yes, ISBoxer makes the addon, a quote about it: "When you Export to Inner Space, the ISBoxer Addon for WoW is created, which will set up the in-game macros for each Character."
---
I use hotkeynet (used mostly before) and autohotkey (using now since I came up with how I can change what the same hotkey does for dungeons, pvp or grinding and other fun functionality).
---
Only tried ISBoxer for a while, I had a weird bug with it and I couldn't be bothered to remake my functionality from hotkeynet so I stopped using it.
---
Everyone else really likes ISBoxer though and it has build in FTL, best mouse support and its VideoFX functionality (I found OnTopReplica as a replacement for ISBoxer VideoFX).
---
I have a 2017 MacBook Air and it runs wow on private servers great and I can run retail on it (not that I would want to).
---
Idk if it was discussed in this thread, but many priests put 5pts into wand spec very early, then respec at exactly 40 so that they can get that DPS increase from Shadowform at 40 instead of 45. Assuming that you will be respeccing at exactly 40 for that dps increase and that dps between holy and shadow before lvl 40 is comparable, it makes sense TO ME that there is positive benefit (reduction of boredom, no slowdown of leveling speed) to playing holy early.
---
Op would hate meeting me in game on a RP server.
---
Haha just sounds very familiar is all 😁

Infernals

Man people need to start listing that as a con when discussing locks! Hunters get to name their pets!

Tich is not for you

Once you get a hang of ISboxer multiboxing will be easier than ever. I’m gonna 5-box myself, using ISboxer ofc. Possibilities are endless with this software.
---
Yeah you just figured out.  Why are you telling us to hold other people's hands through it?  Just figure it out it's easy.  I don't get you at all and I hope I don't play with you when you simultaneously want your hand held yet want to figure it out yourself.

The idea is not that companies don't offer additional time off, plenty of countries with mandatory time off have additional day. The discussion was about mandating this from the start which the US lacks.
---
Yeah I’m not really a fan of wotf either. Do you know what % of the horde plays undead? I know most casters will be undead which isn’t ideal. How crucial is fear as CC in world pvp? And is death coil a legit substitute?
---
Epeen

Not at all i dont care how many will play the same class as me, i will put in the extra work and secure my spot.

Most Shaman are going to have a very rude awakening in a couple months.

There was 31 degrees in my town in Sweden today, it's not supposed to be so hot here... and the weather report i am looking at atm says it will be around 28 this weekend, it's still to hot for me!

On live, they can help doing one-way account transfers between us and eu (I think? It was normal at least until legion-ish, not sure how it's done now).
---
For inter-region transfers, I'm gonna go with no, at least not at launch. In your case, SA servers should still be a part of the NA realmlist (live has a set of tabs on the bottom of the realm list, but they're all treated as part of the NA... cluster?)
---
Doesn't mean all or even a majority of them do and they aren't forced to do so, unlike every other country, basically.
---
My name, it's an alternative swedish translation of "Consequences". And you spell it "You'llhaveproblemsifyoustealmyname"

How many monitors does he have in his current setup?
---
Totally not calling out of work on Monday in hopes that they’ll release it then. Nope...
---
Its not loading for me :(
---
Easy my friend make her play warlock
---
Maybe night school will pay off for you one day.  Maybe.
---
I know! I thought the exact same thing. It's also kinda weird to me that there is not going to be co-op support for the campaign (like Archon Mode or something).
---
Awesome tool, I've been browsing on it the whole evening, it feels really good.
---
Is there a possibility to export to and import in the wowhead dressing room / do you plan to create your own dressing room?
---
It's not "in-game", though. Classic and Retail are two completely separate games. Both available on the same subscription, but still different individual games.
---
The model train set from the Dalaran toy shop.
---
I'm sorry your life sucks so much you spend your free time getting angry people's grammar online..
---
Devilsaur set is fantastic. Not be rude, but can't you just look at a BIS list and decide for yourslef?
---
I wish I could upvote you 1000 times
---
Interesting.  One of the main elements that I miss about classic wow is the real feeling of progress when you get another piece of gear as you will hit much harder. I’ve only ever had a hunter and a death knight at max level since I played during TBC and WOTLK, how impactful is the step up from one wand to the next? Also sort of a noob question but do wands crit?
---
I did, and that's the issue I'm having.
---
No BiS list I've seen mentions these leatherworking items, yet I've seen it mentioned in random threads that LW produces some feral druid BiS
---
Original versions gonna be better anyway.
---
Im hyped af. its just you
---
Make him a „voucher-card“ with things like „pull an allnighter without me being mad“ ...
---
You are probably right, might be a bit early still. But i need a valid reason to stay indoors atm otherwise i feel bad
---
You lost any money so far!
---
I was hoping they would release it before classic for something to play whilst I wait. It will obviously now launch after classic which leaves me wondering if I'll still be interested in buying it when I'll be deep into classic. Although I'm not sure I can pass up on the opportunity to play TD custom games. I've been craving playing a proper TD since the WC3 days.
---
Ok I feel you. I know priests are wand heavy for sure, so I’ll lean towards mage or lock
---
Male. I like their posture and voice lines more. Female casting animations are preferred but I didn't see dragon ball until I was already a man so I don't associate the male casting animations with anything. Both have forsaken shoes so that's good either way.
---
People worry about some dumb shit. They act like there is only one server with only one guild that if they don’t lower level to 60 before everyone else they will be locked out of end game content forever and never get to play. This is dumb and I expect that when classic drops, people actually think for themselves for a second and play to enjoy themselves.
---
I think I had a stroke, but I’m leaving it :P
---
You have provided such a perfect answer, it's so dumb but it's so great and amazing and it's not even game breaking. Great one!
---
I don't think there's anything worthwhile in LW which you can have someone else craft for you anyway. I guess if you plan on tanking ragnaros or firemaw there's a few items in there you need but I'm not sure those are BoP anyway
---
Druid bear has always interested me, all the shifting makes for interesting play, but don't really remember them too well in vanilla. I'm hoping to do the benediction quest again.
---
I love it! :D
---
Roll troll.
---
This was fixed towards the end of beta. I encountered a wild, angry stitches, and he nearly killed me.
---
Yeah, it's funny how people suddenly don't want the actual vanilla experience when it's within reach.
---
A thick, hard bone. So yes.
---
Sounds pretty tame, I could handle that. Thanks.
---
I prefer those UD models
---
I prefer alliance because of the male character models, cities and quest zones.
---
However all of my friends and girlfriend prefer the Horde. I detest the hunchback male model, huge shoulders and don't even get me started on the cluster fuck that is the Barrens leveling.
---
Since I'm the one that will most likely stick with classic the longest I want to roll alliance but I also want my friends to be enticed to play. Not sure what to do but will need to make some decisions by Aug 12/13
---
Total war isn't even close to being an RTS.  It has turn-based overworld and pause-based combat.
---
So much math and your fails start with the first sentence. Each skill - AR, BF has to be used on separate gcd. Fail two is in agi totem. In 2 years of my private server experience I have not seen a single dagger rogue focused group with a shaman to drop agi totem, you will be having WF, period. Fail three - berserking takes 10 energy. Honestly such next level calculations are pointless and overall the damage discrepancy will be absolutely minimal. Pick whichever race you like more. PvE dps difference between troll and orc is sub 1%.
---
NO ONE WANTS YOUR FUCKING 2 VIDEO GUIDES A DAY TAKING APART THE WHOLE GAME AND TALKING ABOUT NONSENSE. STOP MAKING 10:07 MINUTE VIDEOS WITH 2 MINUTES OF CONTENT YOU GREEDY YOUTUBERS
---
It's a good question that highlights how much theory crafting is still in WoW.
---
Those people can chill lol.
---
Smoothies and takeout Chinese
---
Don't underestimate the value of WotF. And it's not like you'll be shadow spec the majority of the time while you're doing PvP, unless you plan on only running around BRM doing 3v1s against random PvE players.
---
No not really.
---
I don't play retail, not since Legion and that was to purely kill Argus and get the level. Just said I am horde. Keep trying.
---
Learn an instrument ;)
---
I'm planning on Warrior/Mage for Main/Primary-Alt as well!
---
Thanks :)
---
On a fresh server when everyone is saving for their mounts?
---
I play Warrior, Hunter and Druid, in that order.  No real desire to play anything else.  If I can't accomplish what I want to in this game with one of those, I might as well find something else to play.  Maybe Minesweeper.
---
I know a guy who makes custom leather pieces. I had him make me a leatherbound book cover for my notebook. He can make anything though, wallets and gun holsters and more. He put WoW stuff on it. https://imgur.com/a/5Jxealw/ this is how it turned out, I love it! Not overly pricey at all. Let me know if you want the contact info!
---
I like it. I don't usually write my character backgrounds out as a story like that, though; more of a rough outline.
---
My Forsaken priest (name TBD) was an acolyte at the Temple of Lordaeron and a devout follower of the Light while alive. After regaining his free will he underwent a crisis of faith, belieiving it had abandoned him and all his countrymen to the ravages of the Scourge.
---
For several weeks after joining the Forsaken he'd teetered on the edge of insanity, nearly giving into the depravity of the Apothecaries - until he met a tauren who came to Lordaeron as part of a diplomatic envoy from the Horde. This tauren saw the goodness in him as well as the desperation of his situation and invited him to return to Kalimdor with them, to Mulgore, where he may find some measure of peace.
---
So he went, forsaking (heh) his "people" and the darkness he saw consuming so many of them. He settled in Bloodhoof Village, trading his temple vestments for more simple garb, learning to work with his hands, finding satisfaction in cultivating herbs and applying some of the knowledge he'd gained from the apothecaries to helping his new neighbors with the concoctions he created rather than unleashing them on innocent farmers in Tirisfal.
---
Eventually he even began once again wielding the energies he'd learned to harness as an acolyte at the temple. He's still not sure whether he believes in the Light, nor does he know where his healing magic is coming from. Perhaps from the Light, perhaps from the Earth Mother granting her blessings in a way more familiar to him, or perhaps from something else altogether. Ultimately, he doesn't much care so long as he can use them to help his new family.
---
After some time in Mulgore it became apparent the Horde had need of capable individuals to step up and help out with some of the more extraordinary tasks and threats facing them. Feeling he owes the preservation of both life and soul to the generosity of those who took him in, he once again donned his priestly robes and made for Red Cloud Mesa to report for duty.
---
FUCK FLYING MOUNTS
---
FUCK THE NEW WORLD SHITTING ON THE OLD WORLD
---
AND FUCK THE HORDE AND ALLIANCE GETTING PALLIES AND SHAMANS
---
Not really.  You basically drain to level and life tap for mana.  
---
Corruption, [whatever curse], send vw to tank, maybe shadowbolt, drain life if it starts punching you or if you're low, then drain soul once it's low.  If you're below 50% mana life tap up and move on. 
---
I don't think there's actually much wanding involved past the very early wands.
---
Tanking is a great way to challenge yourself and learn how wow works in more depth. Its a convenient way to gear up in dungeons, and if you don't enjoy it or get a spot in raids you have the consolation prize of being the best dps in the game.
---
Play warcraft 3 plus tft if you have the chance before classic launches, it will give you good oberview of the lore.
---
Tauren warrior gonna be my first, but I will miss getting to eat the corpses of my fallen enemies. My first character way back in TBC was an undead rogue so I want to change it up.
---
VANILLA IS THE BEST VERSION OF WOW TO FIND FRIENDS ON. JUST LEVEL UP AND MEET PEOPLE WHILE YOU QUEST AND EVENTUALLY YOU WILL MAKE FRIENDS
---
People playing more casually under level 40 often use deviate delight, or at least more than expected. I never played official vanilla, but on pservers under 40s will casually buy them for the cosmetic change.
---
If not, I will just sell them later on at higher levels. I'm still planning to level fishing anyway, as it generally becomes more lucrative with the release of every raid as fish will be needed for certain alchemy recipes
---
Nope. I dont care a whit about what anyone else chooses to play. I’m just here for the party and the more the merrier afaic.
---
WoW Classic (1.12 quests/mechanics using the 8.0 engine) has never been released.
---
WoW Vanilla (1.12 quests/mechanics using a 1.12 engine) is not possible these days as they want to integrate it with Blizzard's infrastructure from 2019 as the 2004 infrastructure no longer exists.
---
doom.
---
Roll undead
---
yeah the whole "do what's fun" idea really doesn't hold up when you're 4 months or so in, you have a guild full of people you don't really know, you don't have a clue what to do, and then you end up quitting.
---
Who the fuck wants to play horde
---
literal mudhut savages eating stones in their designated savage mud huts in the middle of every zone (complete with every vendor, more quests then alliance and FP ofc oh and sometimes there is even a zeppelin or free transport thrown in) while chimping on anything that moves in numbers only despite rolling for pvp racials but never actually 1v1ing to use them
---
then porting into their literal mudhut savage mud city called "orgrimmar" more like ogreshit lol blizzard literally took some tribal shithole town and copy pasted it into wow to give that authentic tribal feel to the faction le monster races br0 check out these NO SHOES so whacky better name myself something fucking retarded like boogerbones to fit in btw get owned kid totally bg queued out of that 1v1 close one
---
you want a sick capital city to afk in br0? take your pick :
---
- literal sewer shithole with aids and feces everywhere
---
- some fucking retarded canyon thing where you fall off and die
---
- literal designated mud hut city
---
NO
---
SHOES
---
NO SHOES

N O S H O E S

FUCK YOU HORDE SHOELETS
---
Just adding to the list of annoying behaviors I see on here.
---
As a follow-up, I also provided his username through email to ensure he owned it. I take this all seriously.
---
What about "LF4M and ready to go"
---
I LITERALLY ROLLED THE DICE OR FLIPPED A COIN ON THIS TOPIC WHEN CLASSIC WAS ANNOUNCED AND HAVE NO REASON TO CHANGE MY MIND. LET RANDOMNESS DECIDE YOUR FATE, EVERYONE!
---
Yup, I am gonna play and hyped ... I am not worried about the mechanics as I am about graphics.  Even retain WoW looks like ass still IMO by current standards, so who knows.  Regardless gonna play and see how it goes.  What I missed most was the interactions and social aspect of old WoW, I tried current retail a while ago and I can honestly say current game hold nothing for me ... its all this rushing around carp not talking to people weird game.
---
&gt;you are wasting a warlocks abilities if you just pull one at a time.
---
I agree, and it seems like a lot of guides out there, including staysafe's, are focused on how to kill 1 mob as efficiently as possible so that they can move onto the next one fast and with mana/health. I just can't imagine that's faster than pulling 2 or 3 at a time and using your dots to their full potential rather than having things die halfway through the dot's duration. Everyone talks about Mage AOE farming but I always had a much easier time as a warlock because my pet would tank one, I could tank one, I can have one or more feared all while they're taking full damage from my DoTs. 
---
I'd rather kill 2-4 things and have to eat food once in a while between pulls than kill 1 thing at a time over and over again doing the same rotation every single time.
---
Would you go Human or Orc? Not sure which I like more tbh.
---
not if you're contracting.  yay zero paid holidays and no pto!
---
There will be one megaserver. This has been the norm for WoW since 2003. Can’t see why it would change now.
---
No, I will play what I enjoy even if its fulled with them.
---
Barrens chat is reason enough to role horde. Downside is the sexiest horde model is a bag of rotting, floppy meat and bones in a bikini. So...yeah go ally.
---
The only thing I disliked in the old dungeon mechanisms was the people with short attention span / group disbanding after first setbacks. I can't remember how long it originally was, but one run in LBRS was something between 5 and 7 hours, no joke.
---
If only there were actually good guns. Bow in MC and Crossbow past that. RIP dwarves. If you want to pvp tho the grand marshal gun is the same stats as everything else so I guess thats something :)
---
&gt;  all druid group that was actually pretty balanced.
---
I see what you did there.
---
I KNOW RIGHT FKING ROGUES ABOUT THE DAGGERS BRO, FOR REAL BRO
---
Horde has better racials generally for PvP at least for the classes I want to play but I Alliance has ST and IF and better quest zones. Also I have more nostalgia for Alliance and they are more core fantasy.
---
Honestly I’m not sure why I’m spilling the beans today. But oh well lol. Story time though. I saw a mage at the last caldron in Eastern plaguelands pool the entire seed patch and aoe frost the fuck out of like 10 mobs.
---
Healing in Classic is nothing compared to Retail WoW, you'll be in for a chill experience albeit, slightly boring at times.
---
That’s a strange way of describing an orc
---

---
As a paladin tank it's particularly brutal. If you give me literally 2 or 3 seconds with consecrate on, I won't lose aggro from anyone the whole fight. But you go in and instantly start cleaving shit, then we'll all get tired of it and let you die again and again.
---
WEAR IT IN SILENCE, OR I'LL HONOR YOU AGAIN!
---
Theres a surplus of dps, healers are not tough to find, tanks are very in demand.
---
I'm not under valueing it. I'm not telling anybody too.. there is just a way to circumvent it through a prof and miles more upside the rest of your racials.
---
Also at any gear state, assuming you are only utility healing or self healing.. you stay shadow a lot. 
---
It's preference whichever way they go.
---
I have a theory that we didn't run out of content near the end of each expansion, we just get to a point where we're waiting for the next one.  I can't say for sure in Vanilla (because I was level 52 when TBC hit), but I can say that for TBC, I didn't lose interest in raiding until WotLK was announced, and I switched into "better get ready for WotLK" mode.  In WotLK, I didn't get bored of ICC until Cataclysm was announced, and I switched into "better get ready for Cata" mode.
---
The problem is, we can't do anything at this point.  People can't level more alts to 40.  People can't test new things in the beta.  People can't farm as much gold as they can.  People can't level professions in preparation for the launch.  People can't stock up on completed quests in order to boost 25% of a level on turn-ins.  People can't stock up on Blasted Lands materials that will boost their Death Knight from 58 to 59 on the way to Outland.  People can't farm up all of the minerals they'll need to level JC or all the herbs for Inscription.
---
Instead, we've got nothing to do.  And so with nothing to do to scratch that itch, that itch is just waiting until there's something to scratch.
---
It's a result of the game. The game relies on a lot more communication between players, and as a result people have to get along or other people ignore them, don't group with them, etc.
---
I WANT TO GET A THUNDERFURY BUT I DONT HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE LINED UP FOR A GUILD RAID GROUP. I HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER 20 PEOPLE AND TELL THEM THAT I GET THE FANCY GLOWLY SWORD FIRST.
---
You'll have to heal 5 mans before you heal a raid, mainly to get the gear you'll need, but also to get the practice you'll need.
---
In that vein, heal 5 mans when you out level, out gear the place. That is,
---
* Heal Deadmines at level 30, when you're in level 25+ healing gear, as that's a level 20 place.
---
* Heal Gnomergan at level 40, when you're in level 35+ healing gear, as that's a level 30 place.
---
* Heal Maraudon at level 50, when you're in level 45+ healing gear, as that's a level 40 place.
---
You get the picture. You want to out level, out gear the place, to make your life easier, while you're learning how to heal. Plus bring consumables, like mana pots, drinks, even separate regen gear too (having a separate healing weapon and a mana regen weapon is very common) in order to make your life easier.
---
They should have released it on July 3rd to hold true to original release
---
Good thing you're not OP then, since I'm clearly talking to him and not to you.
---
YEAH THATS THE PLAN, BUT I HAVE TO CONVINCE THE OTHER TANKS THAT I GET IT FIRST, LET ALONE FIND TANKS THAT ARE WILLING TO WAIT.
---
No, they aren't. Usually they are at gamescom with a very large booth but they cancelled their presence this year.
---
HoTs was fun until they started to add overwatch and kill off the cool maps like blackhearts bay and hallowed mines. Also when they fucked up the MM system.
---
Gnome
---
This attitude is why developers push projects out way faster than they should be. Fans cry about anything when they don't get it in what they think is a reasonable time. I would 100% of the time prefer a polished, finished product over a kind of complete work-in-progress that's going to be broken on release, patched and hotfixed for the first year, and a completely different game by the time it works because fans criticized it and bashed an incomplete game while it was released but still being developed.
---
Chill and let them finish the game. It will be a way more enjoyable and rewarding experience when it is complete.
---
Super helpful saving this
---
Great advice. Dungeons are so fun I wouldn't miss them for the world
---
Go on...
---
My mistake. I saw it under our convo and didn't bother tracing the line up.

Still relevant.

We deserve the loot.

The mods of this subreddit. Look at how you're presenting this topic to disguise genuine concerns and make people voicing them appear irrational. Let's use capslock and dicking around to blur out real issues caused by Activision's influence over Blizzard. Oh, and straight up censorship, let's not pretend you don't do that. I think you've started to give yourself a little bit too much power. A moderator has a duty to remain neutral, remember that.
---
&gt; Honestly, this is probably the main problem. If you grew up in the age of Doom being new then you kind of also were in the age of awkward and bizarre control schemes that are not good. But once you get used to arrow keys for turning it's hard to to change. You can still turn with the mouse in auto run either way, but maybe play a bit of CSGO anyway. Worse case is you play a great game for free while waiting for classic, best case is you move better in addition.
---
I transitioned to KB+M during the D3D/Quake I era like everyone else. I like being able to use the keyboard to turn when I'm just traveling from point A to point B ('driving'). When there is action, I'm already right-clicking while moving around so I don't see the difference. The two extra hot keys is a nice bonus, but I can do that anyway.
---
I can hellfire myself to death and dont need to worry about my gear. I guess *you* can repeatedly jump off a balcony or whatever the lessers do
---
87.3% of all statistics are made up.
---
That's less about scaling and more to do with game mechanics (threat, Life Tap, Mages needing to play Frost in early tiers instead of Fire, etc)
---
When I see a Naxx geared Mage in PvP, it's just another Mage. When I see a Naxx geared Warlock though, it's almost like a completely different class than a blue Warlock.
---
The Horde does no approve of this. Still, nice piece.
---
How foolish if me. You're right.
---
Yes. Theres only so much preparation one can make, it also takes experience to learn from mistakes!
---
And on every private server + class stats from actual Vanilla, Mage was miles above Warlock.
---
I prefer female troll caster and male troll for noncaster, I mained a male troll priest from 80-100 and just never liked the way the hunched over posture made robes look, I still can’t stand to log in that toon, 
---
Female is better in a robe if you can stand the shuffle run.
---
Yeh, same. Guess I won't be reserving names day one when available, as I first need to see server list and get a feel for which international RP server will actually be English and not the unofficial Spanish server.
---
Hoping that retail wow forum Argent Dawn will make some posts regarding Classic.
---
I intend to sub in early August to sell my rare items for WoW tokens (heard that was a thing), as I haven't played since WotLK and probably still have characters with early Vanilla items and BC items, which might be worth a lot today. Could pay a few months of subs perhaps.
---
THAT'S THE PLAN.
---
ALSO WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS, I PURPOSELY WENT DAGGERS TO FREE UP DEMAND ON VISHKAG I FEEL BETRAYED
---
Possibly, but the infinite resources thing fixes the common problem with many meme specs. Unfortunately it's usually better to actually just switch out a caster for a melee, regardless of spec. A feral druid will most likely out dps any caster unless you can pop shields the entire duration.
---
Also, a good warrior dps might beat a feral, but if he pulls aggro and cleaves the raid then I'd rather take a feral with a bit less dps.
---
well yea thats why i said pirated
---
Monk.
---
I’d be the only one.
---
Just two hours ago, i said to my wife that i was torn picking between mage and warlock. Since this was 5000th time i was asking same question, she went berserk and suggested to flip coin for it. I agreed (never say no to your wife when you zee the flame in her eyes). She and the coin decided my fate. At the moment i was doing my routine: smoking at the balcony while reading the reddit. I saw your post and shocked. Karma is an exclusive bitch!:)
---
WoW Vanilla as you put it would have been perfectly possible. The problem is that the client no longer is up to par with today's standards. Anti-Cheat has been developed much further than back with the 1.12 engine and just so many other back-end improvements would have made it silly to just have released it as it was.
---
I'm so afraid that, due to 1.12 talents, itemization, and 14 years of experience, that we will be stomping dungeons. Am I misguided? Are we still gonna need to slow dungeon crawls and proper CC? Please show me that my fears are unwarranted.
---
I have to disagree. They need to be as faithful to retail WotLK as possible. I want it just like it was
---
Absolutely agree about overwatch heros which I why I mentioned that. It was a huge mistake to add them. If you wanted to play overwatch heros in a battle arena...then just play overwatch. HoTs was cool because you got to play classic blizzard heros that in many cases were not actually playable. Overwatch heros had too much utility and competitively killed many other heros that filled a similar role (genji vs illidan, tracer vs val, lucio vs bwing). This is because they were created explicitly for the genre.
---
Follow your heart my friend. In wow and life as a whole.
---
They had free high-&gt; low pop Crees and paid any server transfer I believe in 1.10.  A guild xfered to my server and sniped the aq40 Mount.
---
That's probably the number 1 thing that's going to irk me (and I'll be on a mage to start with) - people not going into classic understanding how threat works is going to be a hurdle for sure.
---
That’s because streamers are bored of it and don’t give a shit about content that has no current traction. You just wait and buckle up buddy, because when Classic launches, this sub is gonna fucking implode with streamer posts, as well as forums.
---
There's been no announcement after they cancelled it, so we have no idea...
---
Cant transfer to pvp servers
---
Oh jeez..that’s funny. I forgot about fem-orc. My vanilla main was a fem-orc lock. I kinda put that outta my mind since I want to do something totally different this time around.
---
“Please do muthaf@&amp;/&amp;!”
---
SPEAK UP SONNY WE CAN'T HEAR YOU
---
As a guild MT I usually have a hunter alt on Pservers for farming, my hunter has more /played than my warrior.
---
Good lord.
---
absolutely, people might think it's not worth doing, but it's a very big step towards being a better player. You get so much more mobility, which may not be super important in vanilla wow pve, you will eventually need it for pvp.
---
Ruin gives 100% crit ratio. Improved shadowbolt gives a boost to Shadow damage. Once your warlocks are all stacking crit, the debuff has a high uptime. 
---
We aren't limited by mana like other casters, but we are limited by threat. Once your tanks get geared, warlocks really start to shine.
---
Random things together. I don't really care about it
---
I’m not. If I was a Blizzard shareholder, I would not want current subscribers to switch to classic where there are no in game transactions.
---
You must be the life of parties dude let’s hang out 🤙🏾
---
Every class should havr engi tho,orc stun resist works on nades :)
---
Well they seem to have taken the old Warcraft off their store so i'm not sure how to play it
---
Uh what? It was arms prot, not fury. Blood thirst wasn't spammable until the same patch that made shield slam good. Nef world first kill is evidence, the tank is mortal striking.
---
Apparently Joana is working on an addon.
---
A new fully geared guy would appear on the server and you'd all make fun of him in trade can call him a guild ninja.
---

He died so no opportunity for him to pull more hahaha.  But was hilarious everyone was complaining while a pack of adds were just wrecking me.  Healer problems.

Leveling cooking, fishing and first aid isn't hard

&gt;what could be a better troll to every zealot than an undead rocking the armor of those who have sworn to destroy the Forsaken?

Get the full Imperial Plate set for some top level trolling

Do you realize how many bugs were found in the beta test? Insane amounts, and it was only up to level 40. There will be many more bugs with raids and 40-60 content. The game will launch next month with many, many bugs, some meta/game changing or breaking ones too.
---
Just kick em your the tank after all :)
---
I wrote a fair bit of lore where one of the characters that i like was named Targus Greathelm, he was a powerful warrior and part of the nnavy and saved a whole crew from giants
---
anywho, turns out Targus was the name of my laptop carrying bag.  I gave Targus some brothers, they were the Greathelms. My warrior will be named Greathelm
---
Lemme guess, your tank had thunder fury.
---
15 pieces of flair is the minimum, now Bryan over there....
---
I have done all 3 roles from BC to BFA. Tanking is by far the easiest. You will be fine, it's just that your performance will be felt the most, unlike DPS, which is a harder role to play, but there is more of them, so low performance isn't felt as much (although much easier to measure).
---
It's basically the prequel to classic WoW. It explains a ton of the lore of classic.
---
Because Daggers is Warrior BiS if you don’t have Orc/Human racial.
---
He's said it won't be out by release.  He's going to work getting to 60 and finishing the edits to 40-60 guide first.
---
I would just contact blizz and ask how you can add funds to his account.It may be as simple you creating a free account and using the gift function.
---
For sure, sounds good. Thanks
---
Don't get too intimidated by downranking.  It might seem daunting when you first look into it and see tons of tables and calculations and such,  but the reality is that it is something that you develop a feeling for over time and before long it becomes second nature and you don't even think about it.
---
THATS FINE ILL TANK LVL 60 DUNGEONS AS LONG AS YOU LET ME GO DPS IN RAIDS BECAUSE I CANT COMMIT TO BEING A MAIN TANK
---
I’ll check it out, thanks man
---
Horde cause zeppelins make traveling as horde much better imo. Extra base in stv is a nice thing to have. Racials are better in balance for pvp/pve.
---
Real life preparation(drinks/easy meals/snacks) or wow classic merchandise, there are no microtransactions in wow classic and it's one of the many reasons people are going back to it.
---
In vanilla raids could not afford a shadow priest with 8 debuff slots, when 16 slots became available adding shadowweaving buffs warlocks considerably.  
---
On private servers and in classic warlocks will have shadowweaving from the beginning, but they likely won't have enough crit to keep up imp shadowbolt all the time, or enough hit to raw compete with mages who get 6% hit for free and some bonus crit and damage by going arcane/frost.  
---
Minor consideration warlocks cannot oom because of lifetap, but every lifetap is wasted global away from DPS.  Lifetap scales with spell power, but your rate of mana usages does not.  As a result the rate of spell taps you do basically halfs between MC and naxx.
---
Here, have my downvote :)
---
Technically, they didn't snipe it.  Once someone rings the gong, anyone who rings it within something like 7 or 10 days with the scepter will get the mount.
---
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
---
STILL FEEL BETRAYED THO
---
No, because im a 100% warrior autist.
---
I thought we were past that. And they absolutely can. Last time the threat was enough. They own your character not you. They can do what they want with it.
---
Is 400-500 hours from 13-14 actually realistic? That sounds a bit dramatic to be honest.
---
Your experience is exactly what you make it and nobody can tell you why you are feeling what you are feeling
---
One issue I noticed might be related to quest items not being treated as "pseudo-unique". I was able to equip two [Blood of the Martyr](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17045#reward-of) which is a quest reward item.
---
Maybe some extra logic may need to be implemented in order to not allow duplicates of quest rewards.
---
It’s sad that “layering” has become normalized against the rest of these...
---
It’s not going to go away, killing the entire experience.
---
The best utility and support class in classic wow is the warlock.
---
MAGE
---
Horde because I always was in vanilla. My friends want to play horde. I also want to recreate my character. I do enjoy some of the PvP racials since i pvp mainly. I will not lie, i enjoy the alliance cities and leveling more. The human area is easily my favorite
---
Dont like gnome tbqh
---
No. At least no cheesier than lock, rogue, warrior, hunter, mage, shadow priest, paladin, those other priests.  
---
Druid has no cheese, ofc.
---
The main rationale is that holy has some significant talents in every tier (crit chance, **interruption protection, reduced cast time**, % damage, **nova**), whereas shadow's 2nd-4th tiers aside from Imp-SWP are pretty meh. 
---
While shadow might have better base damage values, they don't get changed much by talents, whereas holy has worse base damage, but the talents are significant and I argue that they bring holy spells **at least** up to par with shadow up until 40 respec.
---
Also, lv.40 with r3 Holy Nova is probably enough to solo RFC and WC, which IMO is great for starting up tailor+enchanting, and getting that early money.
---
Some of the more complex UI packs like ElvUI feature font replacement and frame coloring options. Something like that may deliver what you're looking for.
---
Horde.  Pretty mmo races are boring give me orcs and undead.  Stormwind is only prettier than ogrimmar if you have no appreciation for a primitive aesthetic.
---
In retail, I intentionally pull all the troggs when I jump. Not hard to tank and good exp. I also pull the other side of the long tunnel at the end of the instance. It’s nearly impossible to die tanking in retail lol.
---
Yea the hit is big, considering your first epic ranged wep will be a bow, sucks for dwarfs lol.
---
enjoy farming those soul shards before every raid then!
---
Gonna make a whole box of pasta with broccoli rabe, cannellini beans, garlic, and olive oil.
---
Oh yeah those Myrmidons were nasty when they enraged.  Didn't matter if you had a good set of tank gear you still got CHUNKED.  Disarm was perfect when I leveled through there on my warr.  There was one pull especially where it was only three myrmidons.  Trouble!
---
I once knew an undead warlock in vanilla who RPed wanting to transition into a demon because their character saw that as the "lesser evil" relative to being undead. The Metamorphosis spell always made me think of them.
---
The release date is 2019, the year is barely half over lol. I can't wait for it either but chill bro
---
Soo.. ret pally? :P
---
Thanks, I'll check it out.
---
after years of healing, it is better to have raid/party unit frames in the bottom center of your screen rather than the sides. you have more peripheral visibility of the screen where your character is standing. where the party frames are by default removes most of your left eye from seeing the screen.
---
While I don’t agree with some of the comments that “tanking isn’t hard”, because I feel it is generally the most difficult role in many aspects, freaking go for it man. 
---
You only learn by trying and plenty of people are going to complain to you but take the feedback as you can and keep trucking. You’ll fail some groups but as long as you’re not a rage quitter and willing to show some curiosity you won’t end up on anyone’s blacklist.
---
If you do a drain tanking build you'll never wand, otherwise you'll wand a ton early on.  Still, wand beats drain life until I think the third or fourth rank, unless you do not keep up to date on wands.
---
That cannot compare to the Scarlet set, including tabard.
---
well all the other horde races have humps, not much better
---
Not too bad, treat it as another skill you have basically.
---
i really like how armor looks on female orcs
---
I think you're hitting the nail on the head in concept, at least. I think it's a good idea to have multiple items of similar BiS power-level drop from different dungeons, so that there's always at least something useful from a dungeon. More importantly than that, Vanilla needs wacky items that provide more than just stats. 
---
That Druid idol would go a long way toward making Boomkins viable, and actually contribute to a useful raid identity; when they get lucky with extra procs, they can buff the rest of the raid. 
---
The psuedo-self-innervating helmet is a really interesting idea. Obviously, its most practical application is fixing Shadow Priests, Elemental Shamans, and Boomkins, but it actually opens up gear choices for other classes. A real helmet gives you slightly more power if you know that you aren't going to run out of mana in an encounter, but it might be worth a small loss of power to have better through-put on important raid encounters.
---

---
Warlock is balls before 42 though, death coil really helps for your survivability.
---
&gt; This fight is not soloable.
---
Unless you're a hunter :)
---
Going alliance this time around. I was horde when I was 12 on up. But 12-13 in vanilla. Very special time I can’t mess with. Horde vanilla stays a memory
---
To me at least wanding feels much better than spamming 2.5s shadowbolts that surely deal less damage than an up to date wand especially counting push back on casting. Also, wands can crit but the dmg range is pretty wide so sometimes your hits are almost as big as crits. Wanding while lvling affli surely is more efficient than shadowbolts plus the instant cast bolts are a fun finisher / extra dmg addition when you get Nightfall. 5/5 would recommend warlock and trying out wanding. One good lvling spec will be drain tanking where you will wand a bit less than "normal" and vw affli spec, check out Dive's guide at https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
---
Thats why i usually play human!
---
You're the kind of person I wouldnt summon.
---
I never mained rogue, but what is really confusing to me on this is that I thought it was already known that troll was better then orc for pve rogue longterm.
---
Even if the racial were identical in raw damage output troll would still be clearly surperior as it gets better then lower your hp is, whereas orc will literally get you killed on any fight with aoe, and there is a lot of melee aoe cleave in vanilla so that signficantly reduces its usefulness and massively buffs troll.
---
Generally on a pvp server drain tanking is stronger because if you get jumped you have a better pet, and stronger survival tools.
---
Props for the well designed site.  Very easy to use, looks good.
---
Yup. With the crappy crit rate on MB you're better off using IF for the most mana costly spells. 
---
Mained SP from 1.07 to TBC. Know how many troll SP's I saw? Very few. 
---
I don't understand how people think this shit wasn't already theorycrafted to death 15 years ago and are somehow coming up with new info... If trolls were that great, I would have seen FAR more troll priests, especially R14 ones.    
---
R1 touch is spammable and procs every time rather than "every few seconds" like shadowguard does.  So in terms of proccing blackout, it's superior to shadowguard against classes you really need the stun most against. Melee.
---
I like how the picking a class one is basically the free space
---
I remember healing at near zero mana so many times. It's rather nuts how often it happens that you just have to go with it, pop a mana pot, and do your best.
---
No. According to a number of the poles it doesn't even look like the classes are going to be that vastly different from each other percentage-wise
---
&gt; They are just move fun, and the ease of access to dungeons is icing on the cake.
---
But Alliance have easier access to blackrock mountain.  Not a small deal IMO for access
---
Its a big deal for rogue, but if you can deathcoil then you can reset with a fear.  The challenge is living to that point if they jump you.
---
&gt;Edit: as for my argument to go Tauren, they just look badass in plate.
---
I took a look at all races in all tier sets. Imo, the warrior tier sets looks best on female orc and male forsaken. 
---
The leveling / pre raid stuff looks best on male Tauren. 
---
But yeah, it's a matter of individual taste.
---
there are no female orcs, just varying masculinity of male orc.
---
Not really interested in any of that. When you say community driven projects my first thought is orchestrating some RP event like a big battle or having a PuG raid day the community does with the help of a few guilds or something. Don't really understand why leaderboards and rankings are such a big deal nowadays. 
---
It's cool when people get together and do that on their own, but the mmo community is so gods damned stupid and malleable that whenever someone "pro" does or says something they immediately believe that that's the only way to play or do something in game and it spreads like wildfire. Shit is really, really stupid, and that's basically my only concern when these types of things get brought up.
---
Tremor pulses once every 5 seconds.  You can easily time a fear, and then kill the totem in between pulses.  Or just set your pet to eat the totem, since it has no hp.
---
Matchup dependent.
---
I wonder if it partly also has to do with it just being summer and there's lots of stuff to do outside for the time being

you couldn't even play it online with a pirated copy

My first character was a priest, going paladin for classic:
---
Priest as first healer is fine.  It is honestly probably better to learn on as you have a tool in your kit for every situation.  It might take a tiny bit longer to learn all of those tools, but you'll never get pigeonholed into trying to use a square peg to fit a round hole in pve.
---
Example,  Palaidn has no aoe healing can only spam flash of lights.  Paladin has no PWS when trying to heal a mage doing aoe flash of light might be too low hps, but holy light might take so long to cast the mage will die.  You do have other tools like BoP, but thats on a cooldown, and you might have 4-5 consecutive aoe pulls.  
---
That being said, I am going palaidn over priest because pvp healing, and in my group we have someone else interested in priest.
---
everyone wants to do it the first day to make sure they can be Legolas instead of Légolás
---
That's part of the sour taste I have with wrath.  After such a brilliant organic difficulty system, we got.. Trial of the crusader.
---
STOP SHOUTING!!! IM NOT DEAF!!!!
---
Healing is kinda boring until things go wrong or your party/raid is being pushed to the extent of its ability.
---
Main things I wold recommend are to learn to use the full range of your abilities.  Priest healing is not spamming flash heal! Correct us of GH/Heal (stutter step/cancel casting), renew-ing the raid, using PoH,  down-ranking where applicable, adding DPS with wand/holy nova where not under pressure or during add phases, are all examples of good priest skills. On top of that is choosing the right spec.  Priest can either go deep Holy for SoR and Lightwell or hybrid Holy/Disc (which I actually prefer).
---
This is pretty cool
---
Make a Roger, got it
---
Yes, wands are great. Both LMW and GMW completely change your playstyle. The problem is taking a break from leveling to make the wand. 
---
The easiest way is to use tailoring to make items to DE. This will take you around 3 stacks of linen cloth (probably a bit less, just generalized). Level a bit, farm the cloth, run to capitol, learning tailoring, make stuff, learn enchanting, de stuff, make wand. You probably will not save enough time having the wand to make up for the time spent crafting it.
---
SAYS THE WARLOCK
---
... They have 12 hours once the gong is rung.
---
Source: I was on one of the servers that got snipe-rung. My scepter sits in the bank because I was at work on a 12 hour shift when the prick who had AGREED with the rest of us, rung it when nobody was around, so he could be the 'elite' who got it.
---
How is that at all relevant?
---
Only if you use it and summon the VW often at endgame.  And if you do, so what?  Shards are easy to get, especially any single shard in a 30min window.  Meanwhile you get a decent staff for the start of the game, with hit rating that lets you go out and fight people a little better.
---
The trinket is nice and unique but I don't think it's such a one-sided decision.
---
Just buy it. It’s not worth the hazzle if you don’t want to keep enchanting.
---
Auto hotkey, hotkey net, isboxer, etc

It all depends on how far down the protection tree you went.

Improved Shadow Bolt. They also don't get any hit chance to Shadow Bolt from their talents, meaning 100% of their hit needs to come from gear.

---
I leveled skinning and LW on my shaman and had enough for my mount. Of the three armor crafting professions, LW is probably at least as useful as tailoring, and definitely can be profitable even at lower levels.
---
SIDE SETS ON PURE DPS CLASSES COULD BE FUN FACTOR STUFF LIKE ROGUE BECOMING A RANGER OR BANDAGE HEALER, BATTLEMAGES AND IDK FIRE WARLOCKS.
---
Check out Luna Unit Frames and always drink when you get the chance, even if you only get to drink for 5-10 seconds (assuming you don't run out of water).
---
Make sure to buy a couple of stacks of water from a mage whenever you stop by town so you never run out of water.
---
Enhancer solid support with totems and more accepted by the players imo

Nothing really.  I wouldn’t play WoTLK but TBC was my favorite iteration of WoW by a mile.

Hey quick follow up, my bro is set on feral and wants to try bear tanking. I know mechanical crowd pummelers are really good for both feral dps and tanking but I know he’s gonna hate the idea of farming gnomergan over and over again. I was curious about whether it was strictly necessary to be an effective bear tank or if there were alternatives that didn’t require such farming. 
---
Also, is there a solid feral hybrid spec that he could use to both bear tank and be effective in PvP you would recommend? 
---
Thanks again in advance.
---
Never seen Troll spelled that way

Or a large butt plug
---
All of the hardcore guilds rolled Alliance on the last major vanilla private server because Paladins make raid progression so much easier with Blessing of Salvation. I suspect the Classic meta will move in that direction as well.
---
FYI: Play the original, not reforged. But buy reforged because their heart was in the right place, even if their art and VA weren't.
---
this is awesome. I would like to make a suggestion. Can you have in the filters a different check for "Bop Crafting". For example, I want the auto-fill button add crafted items but only if they are "BoE"... and exclude engineering stuff for example.
---
I made a similar post on wow addons and someone there provided me this link (I can't see it since I'm at work).  Was this it?
---
[https://solidice.com/downloads/world-of-warcraft/oqueue](https://solidice.com/downloads/world-of-warcraft/oqueue)
---
I considered making a LFG style tool, but the main problem I would face is addon communication.  Apparently there is a hidden channel addons can use to send/monitor events through various channels (party/group/raid/guild, etc..).  
---
LFG would have to be server wide which would be a problem.
---
Troll males look like troglodytes with kyphotic spine. UD males have the same problem but its not as bad as on male trolls imo.

---
for a laptop no, perhaps try used. if you're trying to build a PC here.
---
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4qsNfH
---
$285 and if you need a windows key, you can grab a windows 10 OEM key for around $30 so $315 total. if your friend needs a monitor and mouse/keyboard well yeah probably close to $400 with some cheap 1080p 60hz panel and a cheap mouse/keyboard combo.
---
now let me go over the build and explain why I chose what I chose :
---
cpu : at this price point there is no other choice, simple as that, you could go 20 bucks more and get a 3200g but if money is tight I advise against it, the 2200g overclocked is basically a 3200g stock.
---
gpu : the cpu's integrated graphics can handle wow bfa so of course it will run classic - watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqSad_LYRKs
---
case : the cheapest you can find, the one I chose is not the cheapest but it comes with 2 included fans - do NOT buy a case without any fans because then you will have to get at least 1 fan yourself
---
ram : give the price point we can squeeze in 8gb. you can go cheaper here but ryzen likes fast ram so 3200ram I feel is worth it, you don't save that much by going to a lower frequency ram. your friend can of course upgrade to 16gb but wow does not need it and given the other components it would be a waste.
---
storage : 240gb ssd( watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw_UB7r3D7w ). you can go cheaper with a 120gb but you are saving pennies at that point and windows+wow will already leave you with little space left.
---
psu : you can go cheaper but thermaltake is a known brand, it's 500w and bronze so you can rest assured it will last and work perfectly for many years to come.
---
motherboard : the cheapest you can find, but don't get a320 because you want to overclock the ryzen 2200g for maximal fps in wow.
---
this build absolutely smokes that laptop you found and is cheaper assuming you already have a spare monitor/keyboard/mouse
---
YOU LIE!!!!!!!

&gt;A pet has been added that will be available for players who pre-purchase Warcraft III: Reforged (PC Only)
---
This is from the upcoming 2.6.6 patch notes for Diablo 3 that is just hit the PTR. 
---
I would expect the announcement for the closed beta to happen sometime after Classic has launched and the hype has died down quite a bit. It might not happen until BlizzCon. I could see them creating show matches between famous Warcraft 3 players during the event to promote it. 
---
Warcraft 3 was an incredibly popular game, and they will want to make sure that they do it justice. There is HUGE potential for Warcraft 3. The Story, the eSport, and custom games, and just the Warcraft universe behind it will make it a force to reckon with.
---
Looking at the "Culling" mission that they have reworked for BlizzCon also shows that they are making significant changes to make the game more modern, and it wouldn't surprise me if they take things to a whole another level. I do think they said as much. Expanding on the story, rewriting some lines. Adding content that they wanted to add, but didn't make the cut. 
---
It's going to worth the wait guys. I'm so excited for it.
---
Give this man a Nobel Prize!

VERDAMMT ICH SPILLED MIEN STOUT LAGER

But they’re still getting an influx of new subscriptions, and there’s bound to be classic players who also start playing retail. More subscribers is never a bad thing
---
Certainly for a lot of gamers, yes, a game feels more meaningful when you put time and effort into it; you get out what you put in and all that. And yeah a lot of mainstream games today are "get in, get your dopamine, get out". It's a shame. We do still have some depth building studios out there still and I think they're coming back around. 
---
SDV certainly has the "love" for the game that's been feeling a little left behind by most developers recently. My opinion of the game however... eh. At the end of the day, it's fairly shallow with even shallower characters. It's the byproduct of a one man team, nothing to really be done about it.
---
pretty good for a 7 year old
---
Go ahead and try it! I myself am planning on playing a priest and try healing for the first time ever. I'm going to try and find a noob tank that I can practice with. We can kick anyone we want cause dps is so abundant. So that said, don't be afraid to try it and maybe you'll run into a healer that's learning the jig as well!
---
Nobody really knows. The only update we've gotten since Blizzcon are a couple of night elf models. I anticipate we'll get an announcement in the next month or so with either a release date or a delay announcement and apology.
---
Sold!

How am I lying? I even went back and read the entire conversation. Seems you have a memory or comprehension problem yourself and you sure do get agitated when wrong. I provided facts and you resort to insults.

---
Same, Tauren is just a bonus
---
It’s a meme private server that pretty much everyone has t3 gear and naxx weapons. So people do TONS of damage, and have relatively little health.
---
So specs like ele are extremely strong.
---
I agree that BFA is a mess, and Retail and Classic aren't really worth comparing. It just irks me to keep seeing the same comments repeated that just aren't really true. There is no unbiased way to come to the conclusion that Retail doesn't offer more challenging content than Classic. 
---
Whenever I ran dungeons on private servers, there was no communication required. You just pulled cautiously, and if there was a mage, rogue, etc, then they would throw down their CC before pull. The reason we used to have to communicate back in the day is because we were bad and everything needed to be spoken.
---
on targets with full health, too.
---
Or if you have more than 1 potential healer in the group. But as soon as druids get shred their DPS in leveling dungeons is insane. So you'd better heal as a shadow priest.
---
Oh this thing is awesome.
---
And VT, Shadow Mend, SW:D, Shadow Fiend, Binding Heal, Pain Suppression and Circle of Healing
---
not in the least.
---
i really really like this one. i seriously hope they take the osrs route after naxx
---
because theyre not gonna want competition between classic and reforged, its probably done just like diablo immortal is. all about the $$$
---
I am become Walter.

If he's going to go around being all "HEHE but private servers are bugged what you gonna do HEHE" he can at least stick to scenarios where it makes a difference, lol.
---
Is there an easier way to set hit caps/weapon types? Say as an orc warrior i don't want to use dwing, instead a 2h axe, well now my hitcap is 6% so it would need to gear around that but it seems really finnicky to get that to work with the current stat weights alone.

So do you take your hand off the mouse to use the keybinds on the right side? Confused

Dumbass who bought one of these reporting for duty sir!

ROFL youre naieve, this shits done already theyre just waiting for a good drop time.

Back in the spring I was CONVINCED that Blizzard would release WC3 Reforged exactly 2 months before Classic to build hype for it. It just made sense. Apparently now its coming after Classic? And it costs $30 or whatever? I feel like no one will play it...everyone will be hyped on Classic and $30 is a lot for a game that most of the people buying it will technically already own...
---
Lol, these comments against private server players are fucking hilarious.
---
*grrrglglglglglglll

There is a Kindle and .pdf version, apparently.  You can check out John's website at whenitsready.com
---
You will be bored AF if you do deadmines at level 30 with a full group. Even at level 20 most of the dungeon feels too easy. You'll be more than fine on level 20.
---
No they are panels that you can swap around to whatever side you want.

 Well it's a lot better than we usually do
---
If you play well and are reliable enough to show up for raids you are too valued commodity. You can get into at least mid level guilds without trying hard.
---
There are some actually decent microwave meals nowadays. For example my work buys some for us to eat and one of which is quinoa with grilled chicken, corn, and black beans, broccoli - and *not* covered in cheese/dairy sauce. Or another one is rice and quinoa, grilled chicken, black beans, kale, plantain, and something else I'm forgetting with a citrus dressing (also non dairy without cheese). Honestly both taste super good. And served in a biodegradable non-plastic bowl 👌
---
So yes most microwave meals suck, but some are alright!
---
Yeah, to be clear I didn't mean change the mechanics of the raid encounters to be modern-wow-like with the 1000 effects going off at once and what not, I just meant to buff the damage and hp #s a bit. Doesn't have to be to insane levels, just buff them some so that there is SOME resistance. As-is I don't think there will be any resistance, everything until late AQ and Naxx will be about as easy as wrath of the lich king heroics lol
---
I did some 10 Rogue RBGs back in the later expansions; not super viable but absolutely tons of fun
---
No it was a [three-hinged panel](https://puu.sh/DXMlF/b07277f2aa.png) that you couldn't move around, but you could take the insert out and pop in a new one for different games.

---
I do not think that you should tank.
---
You are saying that want to tank, and I believe you. You are saying you really like tanking, and I believe you. But life, and WoW, are not about what **you want**. They are about what **you are**. 
---
And you are a complete noob looking for glory and attention, in your own words. Even the reason you are posting here is just for us strangers on the internet to give your selfish wish validation. You want to be validated so bad.
---
I do not think that you **should** tank. I do not think you **have what it takes** to tank right now. I think you may potentially learn and develop as a person as you play the game and in the future, who knows what will become out of you. But right now, it is not the right thing for you.
---
How am I naive ? There’s a reason why they only showed 1 level at blizzcon and most of the shit they showed was incomplete
---
Oh ok.  I always thought you could swap it to either side. mb.
---
You can level up using pretty much any spec. Mainly you want Spirit Tap and Wand Specialization. That allows you a fairly efficient rotation where you regen mana while wanding. Keeping your wand upgraded is also important.
---
I don't really know, I bought it cause I was a moron and probably fell for the marketing.  I never really used the keys, but it was handy to know which regular keys did what, as far as opening party menus or my inventory when I was brand new to the game.
---
Set the rules first.
---
Otherwise you do this, everyone passes but the guy who actually needs it. He wins it. You're frantically glailing your arms around trying to explain you just wanted to make sure it'd go to someone who truly needed it, while they kick you and brand mark you a ninja in trade chat. ;)
---
I think later models were modular that you could swap around, with a more customized WASD section.  But the one I had was just a single insert.
---
Yeah, that!
---
I love going on absurd tangents just to see who gets easily offended or upset.
---
Agreed. the only thing that compares is 5 man tanking when you aren't cc'ing much and have to manage tanking 3-4+ mobs, especially mixed mob type pulls where you have a couple casters doing different things, maybe one fears, one heals, and they are humanoid so they are runners, etc.
---
too bad tanking in 25 mans is usually very boring compared to that.
---
I whole hearted agree, everyone needing on the item takes the ninja behavior out of the question. 
---
Also the gold from selling the item is almost always 100% more useful to everyone than the item itself.
---
Home cooked meals at the table/not at the computer. Plus lots of water. Gotta treat your body and mind right!

Yeah.. TBC and Wrath were great times for Priests :)

Don't even play WoW Classic man. It's just going to be a waste of time. Just stop playing all video-games all together. They're just a distraction from real life and hold you back from achieving all those goals you once had for yourself. As you got older, you've grown more comfortable with the idea of playing video-games mindlessly. Why is that? Because our culture, more specifically internet culture, glorifies video-games to a point we have become blind. That's what happens when you have massive groups of people all converging into one entity and those people become your 'peers'. Your society. It has become socially acceptable and just an excuse for us to continue wasting our precious life on. It's like staring at an hourglass as you watch the bottom fill up more and more, and mourning at the sight of it. Then you wonder what happened, why is your life this way? Why am I in this position in my life? It all leads back to that perfect distraction - **video-games**.
---
YEAH BUT THE MAJORITY OF MANA COMES FROM YOUR INTELLECT SO THE POINT STILL STANDS
---
Move the goal posts much?
---
Viable is a meaningless term in wow.
---
It's possible to play with no talents at all. 
---
I played some survival myself, Wyvern sting is the most hilarious, always available troll skills.  no cliffs or lava necessary. 
---
So what?  
---
That doesn't change the simple fact that it is one of the top 5 worst specs in the game.
---
Yea same gonna do everything right this time
---
How many times do you like to say you're giving them the last word before moving on?
---
Nice, Un Goro leather might be my primary gold grind anyway!

Lol thanks, got me at the start there
---
SL lock is gonna be very strong even in the first 2 phases
---
&gt;I heard it can be both a great dps and a good healer with similar/same gear. 
---
For leveling until mid 50s. After that this is not true.
---
I think we will be short tanks then dps. I am rather sure healers will be over populated.
---
&gt;Now there are a lot of speed levelers here and I *DO* expect them to make it in a few weeks.
---
The people racing to 60 will be there before the end of week 1.
---
Like a warden staff.
---
I don't think they're going to be that disappointed, since most people intent on leveling quickly in order to raid have already formed a community with others who will be doing the same thing.
---
Now, individual players planning to level quickly in the hopes that they will hit 60 and fall face first into a face roll raiding pug...they might be disappointed.
---
Word I was apparently speaking out of my ass, as you and others have shown! Whoops. I was just a scrub throwing out shadowbolts
---
There are 9 pages of original WoW alpha/beta screenshots here: https://www.scrollsoflore.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=46

---
Classic Reddit. You're acting like i'm arguing against it working in 1.12.
---
Did you even read my comment? I said it worked on beta, and then it was "fixed". I believe you that it worked in 1.12. dont need to keep repeating it
---
So the ultimate WoW Classic 1080P gaming PC is a $110 Dell Optiplex 7020 (these are everywhere on Ebay)  with a 4th gen i5, 8gb of ram, a cheap SSD, and a $70 GT 1030/ used gtx 1050 (PCIe power only) or similar. 
---
Boom. You now have a $200 WoW Classic 1080P High Settings Gaming PC.
---
I think the idea of not being 60 after months of time is just people playing like 2 hours a week, people have got it down to 3-4 days gameplay, also a lack of information of where to go and whatnot.
---
If people want to get to 60 they will get there in I estimate just over a months time with 2 hours a day. But I know I won't be rushing to 60 at all due to work and being a filthy retail player.
---
if blizzard is right that the vast majority of players quit in the first few weeks what you're left with is mostly hard core players who will mostly be 60 by 3 months.
---
He's going to respec resto anyways, thats how.
---
Yeah you don't heal 5 mans end game as shadow (its possible, but you'll need your friends.)
---
You didn't say anything about beta:
---
&gt; They fixed it so you can't do that anymore, because it benefited hunters and the only Bugs which can stay in the game are those which nerf Hunters. Like scatter+trap Dr for example But yeah. Chaincasting Eagle eye was fixed on beta.
---
Also, "fixed" means nothing to me.  It could mean that it was fixed so it works like it did in 1.12, or it was "fixed" because it was "considered a bug" and didn't want it like that anymore.

Careful talking like that devilsaur mafia might put a hit out on you!
---
I was using [x to level](https://willitclassic.com/view/2l8ngDGHBErqCQ1VbJN3) during the beta. It worked pretty well minus some small bugs.
---
Fixed so you can again, or fixed so you can't?  Yes, I missed the final sentence about beta.  Either way, if you can't do it on Classic, it needs to be reported so they correct it to match the reference client.
---
Barely scrolled down and this is the third Anchorman reference I've seen.

Third click for pushtotalk, 12 thumb buttons plus a wheel that can click left and right. I intuitively bind my pet stuff to my wheel so it feels very fluid.
---
Oh huh, since BFA i've always had a group wipe when that happens. I haven't done any in 8.2, but at least before then you get your butt kicked hard in dungeons. Especially Stratholme, THAT is one of the hardest leveling dungeons now
---
How much did one of these set you back when you got it? Defo worth the parental dis-ownment and social ostracization for that sweet emote hotkey and sizzling hot orc male background.
---
They also announced a beta would come in early 2019.
---
I'd like to play it, but I'd rather they spend time to have it ready for testing than to rush it.
---

always wanted this as a kid
---
Going into a dungeon I usually get the group to agree that if a BOE drops we will all roll on it. I don’t think it’s fair to just automatically give the BOE to the person it fits best when a lot of them can be sold for good money. Usually if you talk to everyone while running to the dungeon people are cool with that.
---
You're doing gods work. Thank you.
---
It heals for zero because anyone can dispell diseases. UD Priest abilities suck ass.
---
Back in vanilla if you said LFM &lt;insert dungeon here&gt; you’d immediately get 7-8 whispers from rogues, 4-5 from hunters, and a couple mages and warlocks. You’d be spamming for a long time looking for a healer and tank. There’s a metric ton of dps players, healers and tanks are always in short supply.
---
I'd roll warrior, but I indeed wanted to be more special so I'm going druid.
---
Not a lot. If I remember correctly it took about 4-5 months until more players were at 60 than below 60
---
HUMAN WARRIOR
---
Ehh most people back in the day didn't speak much either unless they felt like shooting the shit or we needed to discuss a workaround for something that went wrong. Once you did most dungeons at least once you knew what to do unless someone knew some other strat for something. The actual talking was done over vent with guildies or friends when you were cracking jokes and shit throughout the dungeons, which was part of the fun.
---
The communities of both retail and classic say the same dumb shit about each other over and over. Tis the nature of Reddit I guess.
---
There's no denying that modern WoW has harder mechanics than vanilla, anyone who says otherwise is pretty much just talking out their ass. Even TBC had harder mechanics than Vanilla. I'm looking forward to Classic a lot, but TBH I'd rather play TBC or WotLK because they're more in the middle-ground between slow, tactical play and faster-paced gameplay. That and the specializations were actually balanced properly lol.
---
BRD could possibly be the best mmo/role playing game dungeon of all time.  So much content/solid gear inside there!
---
Shield is your Oh Shit-button. It costs a lot of mana for the HP it gives and also stops Warrior and Bear tanks from getting rage from hits taken.
---
Renew should always be on the tank during combat (let him get a hit or 2 off before you cast it so you dont get agro), and is great for topping off DPS who took a hit or stood in the fire.
---
Always be aware of the [5 second rule](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Five_second_rule). If possible, cast a bunch of spells at once and then give your mana some time to recover if you got the time for it. In leveling 5 mans, this shouldnt be an issue and you should be fine with a combination of Renew, Heal/Greater Heal and some emergency Flash Heals.
---
Humarrior.

Oh. Haha haha. I’m slow hahhahahaa
---
This is better than 95% of the other ones i have seen.
---
Maybe room for a SINGLE feral and you can run 4 pallies without much issue (5 is fine) and you really do want 6-7 shamans, so you prob need to cut back on your number of priest for horde regardless (12 healers is high end for sure many) or bring 2 enh shamans.
---
That is for ideal raid comps. Look up videos on 1st horde kills and you'll see 7 shamans for a reason (rare 6).
---
I'll admit that the warden staff is a bit of a special case, since it is one of the few (the only) bis items in phase 6 that are BoE. But usually there are equivalent items that can be purchased on the AH for other classes.
---
I was gifted one from a childhood friend who knew I played hardcore in the day. Used a grand total of ONE time.
---
hell yeah, that's like one of the best aesthetic things in vanilla stv and ungoro, the rain effects are absolutely insane.
---
20% or so?  Just a wild guess though.
---
Ohh yes, we can dream!
---
Ut oh. Please don't put a devilsaur head in my bed.
---
Beauty
---
That is sad :( thanks for the heads up.
---
The sort of weenie that wants to raid in a raid spec???
---
Ohh my god. So my dad got married a little after the release of WoW. We had a wedding rehersal dinner. My dad bought everyone gifts, including me. What do you think I got? I front of 50 people...
---
It's not, but even as a someone rolling druid tank in Classic, if you need on other BoE epics, you can't expect ppl not to roll need on the warden staff either. 
---
What you can do though if youre in a group when it drops is instantly offer the guy winning the roll a private lapdance in a back alley from your "sisters" night elf female character.
---
I loved the shit show that was the entrance to sm.
---
Unless everyone has this idea and no one chooses anything...
---
IF they’re right.  I have a sneaking suspicion that their current low subs numbers are due to players having no connection to what is happening in BFA because they quit for a few years and got so far behind content wise there’s a “why bother?” mentality.  Classic though?  It doesn’t matter why you quit retail.  All are welcome, and everyone starts on the same footing.  
---
I’m not going to be surprised if the demand for classic is HUGE.
---
It's always been a min/max question based on potential value/expense, you ideally want to spend a greater % of your time doing things you want to do, not doing things you're forced to do. The 'flask' thing is more a query for you to do the math as to whether you're being sold a lie with the guild loot system (and flasks require you to get Black Lotus via some mechanism). Actually write-up a budget/balance sheet type document, factoring in weekly income and expenditure and tally it out.
---
Mining would help you (off the top of my head) with Thorium Bullets/Arrows, but since you don't care so much for the Hunter that's probably not all that important, of course the faster you kill things on your Hunter the faster DM:T runs (which, are pretty much exclusively based on your damage) you'd figure out if it's worth 'spending money to make money in this instance. I believe (haven't looked this up) the next arrows down from Thorium Arrows are the ones from AV (vendor), and I cannot remember what is below that.
---
Fundamentally if you'd just make a 4th character (or more) we wouldn't be stuck having this discussion anyway. I think it's 50 character in Classic, 10 per server you have potential access to.
---
Whilst consumables 'can' make a difference to the outcome of a fight, that only holds true for as long as your collective raid didn't have the gear required in the first place to clear the fight (mathematically impossible type concern). In fights without an 'enrage timer' it's all execution based, which nominally is just a question about how long your healers can keep  it up. Just try not to get suckered into a recurring raiding scenario where your expenditure is such an insane amount that it would literally have been cheaper to pay another guild to carry you for loot drops. Raiding (especially since your progression goal isn't a full clear of nax) is a vehicle to help you get loot that you find desirable. If classic replicates even a fraction of Vanilla's success it won't be very long before there are 'pug: free-roll' weekly clears of the various raids without consumable demands. By your own admission your PvP expenditures will likely far exceed your PvE expenditure but your goal under those circumstances is the 'PvP experience' which is readily tangible and benefits yourself immediately and clearly, unlike PvE which is a gold sink that even with a point system (more likely than not) loot will not be coming your way for a long time.
---
It's just a shame, because the run just before that, I had a mage using his AoE the entire time. Never lost aggro. One trigger happy warrior... Dunno, maybe they were upset they couldn't tank so tried making a point?
---
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ABOUT CLASSIC RANT THE RULES SAY I HAVE TO AGREE, SO I DO.
---
#HUGE ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RULES, SO I CAN DISAGREE
---
Two F's and the ? on the same line? Yeah that's pretty weird.
---
THE RULES SAY I HAVE TO AGREE YOU.
---
HERE IT COMES:
---
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT YOU BEING BAD AT PVP TOO
---
Id disagree there, which is why its important to set the expectation up front and have everyone on the same page. Nb4G or FFA loot.
---
I'M WITH YOU - IF I'D PLAY ROGUE I'D PROBABLY HAVE CARPAL TUNNEL IN A FEW MONTHS
---
That's what life tap is for.
---
Horde.  I’ve always been Horde ever since WC II.
---
Do you know where astronaughts go to grab a drink?
---
The fact that its 2019 means 2 things 
---
- there will always be a playerbase in classic
---
- there are so many modern games that are worth putting time into INSTEAD of classic wow
---
The first 2 months will be the best classic wow, after that it's just filled with people that think bgs are fun and their epics are exclusive.
---
FOLLOW THE RULES OR I HAVE TO DISAGREE
---
There is already data from private servers which is 110% accurate. Which creates a deficit for 1.12 classic actually. Making classic only 90% accurate so why would you want that?
---
I WILL GET ONE TOO, LET'S NOT BE IN THE SAME GUILD
---
Correct.  Buying was absolutely bannable.  But they had a very hard time proving you bought back then.  Less ways to track your interactions and sales.
---
The main method was you actually sold a listing for an absurd price and the seller bought that listing. THis made it look legitimate instead of say someone trading you 1000g for nothing.
---
En français en plus!
---
What do you think of someone who only does the bare minimum?
---
LoW EfForT
---
My god, that looks.. awful.
---
in raids you just downrank to basically whatever lets you heal forever and just keep casting it. in dungeons you do the same thing, but you switch to flash heals when the scrubs screw up.
---
Hell no
---
Oui
---
Let’s say the going price is 100g on the AH. If the feral is interested in the then (and he should be), it is worth 100g to him, since that is the gold he saved by winning the roll.
---
For everyone else, the going price is 100g so that is the price the staff is worth if they win the roll.
---
It’s worth the same to the Druid as everyone else. But you could all roll and sell to the Druid at a discount if you win (AH fee saved, less effort, etc)z
---
FLYING OUT TO INSTANCES WAS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE, ESPECIALLY WHEN SOME ASSHOLE DECIDED TO DC HALFWAY IN, LVLING TOOK AGES AND  AT TIMES COULD FEEL EXHAUSTING AND BORING, GETTING GANKED COULD LITERALLY RUIN YOUR PRECIOUS GAMETIME. PARTS OF CLASSIC FUCKING SUCKED, IT AINT ALL RAINBOWS AND NOSTALGIA, ACCEPT THE FACT THAT OUR MINDS ARE BLURRING OUT THE BAD PARTS AND STOP ACTING LIKE THE ONLY THING WE EVER HAD AND WILL HAVE INGAME IS UNPRECENTED TIME FUCKING WARPING FUN.
---
You would roll on BOE gear that you wouldn’t use even if it was an upgrade for someone else in the group? You suck.  I bet you’re going to play a hunter.
---
It would have been cool if they kept the torch mechanic
---
Crap now I want one...
---
I remember wanting it so bad as a kid even though I heard about how bad it was and all the issues. But it was a fucking WoW keyboard and I wanted it! The mindset of a young teenager... lol
---
thousands (millions?) of players cleared all of the content 15 years ago without stacking world buffs.  It is no where in the realm of mandatory.   
---
Also "semi-mandatory" ? .... Stop making up words.
---
I suggest going disc early then going deep shadow after around 45 or so. Then you will have mp5 gear or healing gear or food / potions as needed.  Early on shadow doesn't do as much like disc can do.  Your wand will do more damage than mind flay.
---
That's true... the other thing I was thinking of is mana regen.  Dreadsteed being a spell cancels mana regen for 5 seconds.
---
That's a Goblin city.
---
Ok. Casual pleb
---
The keys in Vanilla are fun to collect! There’s a couple key guides out there! Definitely a fun addition to need the scarlet key before you can enter the other dungeons!
---
Holy shit Sal Bundry in our little corner of reddit. Who would'a thought. Thought you kept your trolling to the default subs.
---
you won't have agility totem up, you'll have windfury. don't expect shamans to twist. And even if they twist its not 100% uptime on agility totem
---
Good. Goooood.
---
Coming here after launch, will literally ruin the game for you. Trust me guys, you want to unsub the week before Classic comes out. Don't even check once for fun, this place is like a malignant cancer.
---
Oh man, I got one of these laying around the house somewhere. I'll have to go dig out! If I remember correctly it had like 2 or 3 hinges in it to fold for storage as it had a "regular" keyset you could put in instead. Although I only ever got 2 or 3 of the buttons to work properly, performing the function listed. I ended up spending the better part of a weekend when I was younger learning about macros and making a lot of custom keybinds to get some of them to kinda work, although my PC at the time didnt recognize about 90% of the buttons so I couldn't do much with it. I'd love to find that sucker and break it out for classic wow launch if I can get nearly fully functional lol. 
---
Thanks for the trip down memory lane by posting this :)
---
Open world PvP &gt; BGs
---
Healbot uses mouseover macros...
---
He never said you were lying, just that it worked in vanilla.
---
I don't remember what type of frames I used, but I always had mine to the right of the screen center. Felt more natural to be clicking stuff  there instead of crossing over all the way to the left side.
---
 Most people won't level nearly optimally enough to hit 60 in 3-4 days / played. Most people will do it in 7-10. That's 200+ hours, in 3 months that's 2h+ a day. Most people will probably play 5-10 hours / week. So, most people will probably hit 60 in 4-5 months.
---
Healers don't need to target to heal. The phase 1 healing you're probably referring to is actually hitting injured players. Check the combat log in the bottom right.
---
Yah eating food is for losers.
---
I agree. I'll be happy with Classic, but I'd much rather have a TBC server.
---
I'm with you on this one. The trinket doesn't seem that actually useful. Can you even cast your VW right away or do you have to wait 30s for the trinket to be ready? Plus it takes a bag slot if you have two trinkets already
---
You're in for constant tells asking you if you'd like to heal a dungeon. 
---
Hmm, I just realized I kinda miss that...
---
shadowgaurd does heal with vamp embrace.
---
I mean, he’s not wrong...you took this album that already existed and then took a picture on your phone of your monitor displaying each... that, or it’s a repost, in which case, just repost the original, less grainy album for all of our sakes
---
I believe you meant to say wise enough.
---
Thank you for taking the time to respect Do Not Track. Not everyone will care about it, but know it's very appreciated by me at the very least.
---
Man, I owned a Zboard just not the custom WoW one. God damn it was terrible, the keys were so damn cheap. I'm glad I have a proper mechanical keyboard now. 
---
But the nostalgia is still real.
---
Even after they made it so you could port in, for a while you had to do a quest first, which required you to go through BRD all the way to the MC entrance.
---
Have they confirmed a modern graphics option?
---
Saw your question when I was at work, wanted to wait till I got home to reply to you, so I could do it properly.  Vanilla Rogue wasn't bad, there was just a lot of little things about it that I have learned to not like over the years.
---
I played Rogue in Vanilla, but I didn't really *understand* Rogue until TBC came out.  I started on a new server with a new character and ran from 1-70 with a much better understanding of how my class worked, and had a lot more fun with it, especially since it was a PvP server.  I have the memory of respeccing from 31/0/30 to 30/0/31 as needed to take over Southshore and all the Alliance you came to it's defense.  The class fit me like a glove at level 70, and reverting back to it's level 60 form feels like I'd be missing out on a lot of what I learned to love.  That's entirely personal preference though, and not something that I would use as a reason for *you* to not give Rogue a go; just my own feelings on it.
---
As far as gearing goes, that was more frustration than anything.  Rogues were pretty popular so the loot always was a bit sparse compared to other classes in the raid, but RNG and DKP wasn't all of it. 
---
The only two dual-wield classes in Vanilla were Rogues and Warriors if they went Fury, which at least on my server, not a lot of people did (yes, Hunters *had* dual-wield but they don't count).   Because the class was built around having two decent weapons to do max DPS, you had one more item you needed to farm before you reached full potential.  Here's some pre-MC to MC gear upgrade comparisons:
---
An Arms Warrior going from the Blackhand Doomsaw to an Obsidian Edged Blade goes from 404 AP to 488 AP; a 20.8% increase from one slot.  
---
A Rogue going from a Scarlet Kriss / Bonescraper pair to a Gutgore Ripper / Scarlet Kriss pair goes from 350 AP to 320 AP; *down* 8.6% from a change in one slot.  If the Rogue got a Core Hound Tooth / Scarlett Kriss, the AP would be 340 AP, and a Perdition's Blade / Scarlet Kriss you're back to 320 AP.  (I'm realizing now all these MC daggers have no stats and are all proc based, so it looks like I'm trying to skew the stats to favor my argument, but I'm not, I promise.  Just picking common pre-MC and MC gear that players had)
---
Where I was going with that is when your damage comes from *one slot*, and you get *one upgrade*, you're all set.  When your damage comes from the combination of *two slots*, only getting one upgrade leaves you behind the curve; you have to go out and try and get a *second* drop to get the equivalent upgrade as someone who only has one weapon.  It always left me feeling behind the curve, especially considering how popular Rogues were back then, meaning the loot was thin in the first place.
---
Again, I'm not saying these are reasons not to play Rogue.  The class, when played well, was really good PvE damage for your raid.  It just bothered me back in the Vanilla days when it felt like I always needed to get twice the amount of weapon drops to get the same level of an upgrade at someone who got just one item.
---
hell yeah brother cheers from iraq
---
Get her WoW quick so she'll be unproductive but living cheap as fuck.
---
Ah yes the triple seduction Warlock combo.
---
You get 3 dates with a demoness and I get an HK.
---
The worse is that the buttons on the right are all already binded to like “c” for character (personnage).
---
yes, ABSOLUTELY. sure it's an upgrade for someone else, but it's BoE, which means that it is also an upgrade for me. because I can sell it for gold and use that gold to buy the BoE that I'm after that I haven't gotten yet. BoP, 100% agree, the people who can use it should get it. BoE, it's just as good for me turning into my item via the AH as it is for the person in the dungeon that can use it without conversion. why should they have a higher claim over it? we were both at the dungeon, we both are putting in the effort. just like if my BoE dropped and they rolled need and did the same thing, I wouldn't be upset. BoP = need &gt; greed. BoEs = Need and greed are the same thing.
---
Yea I haven’t played since lich and I won’t be getting a sub till like August 25th and that’s just so I can hopefully preload if possible.
---
While that's fair, warlock doesn't tend to have much mana problems, and unless you are mounting for short amount of time that it becomes a problem, I don't think it'd matter.  But if it's to your benefit, go for it.
---
Many of us don't really care about eeking out that tiny percentage more effectiveness, and would rather go through the cool quest and save a couple hundred gold on the epic mount in the meantime.  Don't forget that p2 will only be about 2 months after launch, max 4, and tons of people wont even hit 60 in that time period.
---
Sure go for it. The best tip I can give is very simple, PULLING means making the mobs come to you. The easiest way to die is to body charge into a group of mobs and get aggro on the next pack. So make the mobs come to you.
---
I didn't buy one, but I won one at Blizzcon back in the day (by doing a murloc impression lol) and used it exactly once before putting it on a shelf until earlier this year when I finally found it and donated it to Goodwill.
---
horde has the sexiest female races
---
You're right, we should totally waste it.
---
Bruh you wish, this is pristine.  Doesn't even have skin oils absorbed from the cheap ABS plastic.
---
I’ve been trying to rebuy one for years with no luck
---
Because Rogues do good raid DPS and kick ass in pvp and can stealth to be a dick making stun locking you while you fight mobs hilarious.
---
My Soulstone brings all the boys to the yard, and they're like its better than B-Rez.
---
There's a part of me that wants to
---
WHAT
---
I think they even made WotLK inserts for it, which is wild because I was sure they should have realized long before late 2008 that this thing wasn't where they should be investing marketing dollars, lol.
---
&gt; warlock so you can feed the warrior gear to make it more bearable. that's what i'm planning at least! Though I doubt I'll make it past 20 or so without dabbling on at least one alt. might as well get some rested started while i'm leveling!
---
Never understood this, you realise how long it takes to level one, let alone two characters to 60? Leveling a warlock to 60 just tog et gear to gimp into a warrior later to level back to 60 instead of leveling the warrior in the first place is always equally dumb. Unless, you were going to have both in the first place.
---
They obviously don't care.
---
Not true. See [this analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aPRHdLWkURv6EZ9yjHUApY9hDw4IJbJ6/view). Additionally, something that's not noted there or accounted for is that since DL is 5 seconds long, you can get 1 tick at the end of each cast.
---
See what happens the second you get rid of something?  If you got rid of it sooner, we might be playing Classic WoW already.  :P
---
There isn't a single addon you "must" have. Once you've  gone behing that threshold the question becomes what is QoL and what is convenient.
---
LazyPig as an addon allows you to accept quests faster, allows you to sell items faster. It doesn't let you group faster, clear faster, develop faster.
---
Hm, maybe I read that as 12 days and not hours on the guides.  That's crazy then, I thought you had a ~week to turn it in.
---
That said, you Frenchies and Wallonians must have got fked up fingers using that WASD layout.
---
Hey we have Hurricane too. It's lightning too, right!?
---
I had the TBC one!
---
at a certain attack power vs shield block bloodthirst out-threats shield slam. This high of ratio is only attainable with great gear and world buffs though
---
I had that one as well, as well a call of duty 2 one and a generic fps one.
---
It was total pants but anything to do with wow and I was sold :)
---
Had it, upgraded to the black widow chroma
---
I think you can still install the client and have it already to go now
---
Absolutely.
---
It's obvious with all the speculative, hypothetical, BS posts that we're in desperate need of something new to talk about!
---
Very interesting. I'm gonna have to dig that thing out. I know mine is the Wrath of the Lich King version of the keyboard lol.
---
Had one, sadly it got trashed when the roof leaked. Still, it was a SHIT keyboard. Worst typing experience ever. 
---
Wish I still had mine though.
---
Sure did, my old computer setup [https://i.imgur.com/gdLtCiK.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gdLtCiK.jpg)
---
Pog
---
I main a warrior because I like how the class plays (rage management, stance dancing, weapon swapping, etc.), I enjoy tanking, and I like the soldierly aesthetic they can have as they level. My largest complaint about warrior as a class is that the tier sets are all very edgy and goofy. If paladins didn't glow so damn much and had more than 2 buttons to press I'd probably go that route.
---
No one does
---
LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK WHAT I FOUND LOOK WHAT I MADE FOR MY BOYFRIEND I NEED VALIDATION FOR EVERYTHING I DO
---
Brother bought me one for Christmas best gift ever!
---
Well 3 of those classes can roll Dwarf, and the others can carry [Jungle Remedies](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2633) like anyone with half a brain would.  
---
Not saying you have half a brain, but now you know. Youre welcome.
---
There is only one T on this keyboard. You must be mistaking it with the Y key.
---
What is google? I only knows reddit and i alawaiz forget reddit has search funktion too
---
The amount of cloth you need to level to 30 tailoring will put you above level 5 if you farm mobs. More than likely you won't have it at 5, but somewhere between 7 and 9. That is unless you give the cloth from another character.
---
Preload? You can already install the game through the launcher! Also, you’re able to create 3 characters early if you’re subbed by August 13th. You’ll be able to login the moment servers are live.
---
MABY IT MATTERS FOR MEMESPECS CUZ SHAMM SUCKS ON DEPARTMENTS OTHER THAN CHH SPAM
---
I had the WotLK one and I loved it.
---
You still do.  That's called the MC attunement.
---
Prior you could only go in that way.
---
I'd recommend you look into pvp items and consumables a bit more before you start playing in August.
---
I would definitely say get him something else than game time. The hype and anticipation for this game is so high in many of us that, well i doubt the cost of playing has crossed my mind more than 1-2 times counting this post. Get him something like a wow poster (framed they can look amazing, especially in a nerd den), a snack and drink setup, and more than anything just let him know you understand that he'll want to spend a ton of time on the game, and that that's okey. It's like any other hobby, and the launch of this game is no different than taking a week off for fishing etc.
---
Bingo!
---
I like chain heal and chain lightning.
---
I like chains.
---
;)
---
Bought one did not keep.
---
Alright guess I’m subbing August 13th haha I’ll need the fix by then for sure. Thank you I didn’t know any of that.
---
it's not like everyone has consumes at all times though lol. DP saved my ass so many times in 1v1s
---
I thought they had removed the attunement at some point, and just anyone high enough level could get in.
---
Tried one of those mouses; kept accidentally pushing the buttons on it while trying to move my mouse around. Gave it away.
---
Now my G13, on the other hand...
---
mind control
---
Don’t waste third click on push to talk! It’s the best modifier key out there. Easiest modifier key is G600 3rd click then shift, then control, then alt. But I usually have enough bindings with 1234, QERF, ZXCV with shift and 3rd click (bound to Ctrl) as modifiers.
---
Dude gtfo sal I bet you didn't even get 5TDs1Game, I bet you got 1TD2Seasons  L.O.L. (Laugh only loudly)
---
SENT INTO BATTLE, CAME FROM THE SKY
---
I severed my thumb with a chainsaw when I was 23 and it was successfully reattached, but I have dulled sensation. Can’t do the multiple thumb buttons. I’ll never be leet.
---
That's what I figured but I'm not sure how that's relevant to this conversation.
---
Doing cool above your level stuff was always a great part of vanilla.
---
Damn dude. No wonder you were the fastest leveler, you leveled every class to 60.
---
The ol’ Azerothian standoff.
---
" Good! Use your aggressive feelings, boy. Let the hate flow through you. "
---
That's a great tip for WC that I was unaware of. I have done WC a few times, but it's always felt like a "mess". Will def try your route.
---
Main: play the class that you would enjoy most
---
Alt: play 2nd most desired class you would enjoy
---
Minmaxer scenario: there is no obvious answer which one is best, you should slam your head into the wall repeatedly
---
BOE drops are fungible, same as a cash drop
---
Yep. Nelf chicks man. Soooo sexy
---
The parentheses hurt my head.
---
Mages can't take your tier set pieces. And Some tailoring items are better than raid loot often enough. Like the bloodvine set and Robes of the void. Also as a lock you want shadow damage on your wand, only S priests want that too.
---
Warlocks have more than fear in their kits. Succubus seduction which often gets applied 3 times in a duel. Void walker sacrifice for a giant shield, locks often get that off twice.
---
Here's a warlock pvp guide posted in the warlock discord.

could you see who rolled what before everyone had rolled in vanilla? i don't recall anything popping up until everyone had rolled but maybe im wrong
---
Paladins- The masters of "You know what, fuck this, I'm out."
---
Kind of funny considering Classics existence itself will do more then split people's attention

3 AM local. My first real grind session after I finally figured out what to do.

I probably spent 2-3 hours creeping around. Klipsch 3.1 300W sound.

That immersion can’t ever be beat for me.

Fuckin degens from up north
---
I'm going to play a Troll Warrior and I don't like the Troll models or animation. I've got this one trick though, it's called zooming out so I can see more stuff.
---
Good catch, I had forgotten about that one. I'll add it to my list.
---
I did. Soon went back to a normal keyboard and ir got eBayed.
---
A random (3 different?) rare elite spawns in the ring outside DM and can drop some blues.  It's a free for all arena though so you can kill your own faction if they're trying to down him.

DJ KHALID, WE DA BEST MUSIC!
---
If you read carefully, you’ll realize he says he’s rolling need no matter what. The only reason he’s waiting is to hope for everyone else to roll greed so he can ninja the item.
---
How’s that different than if a similarly priced item dropped that the Druid could sell and use the money to buy the Warden Staff?
---
Just for this comment I'm going to roll a waifu elf.
---
Trolls are basically green supermodels with tiny tusks now. #RealTrollsHaveHuntches
---
You keep up the good fight, I am sure Blizz will listen to the outcry about world buffs.
---
Priest because I enjoy dominating little boys
---
Great stuff! Would LOVE an Elwynn variant :)
---
Doesn't mean that a layout where you need to hold down shift in order to type a period is a good idea.
---
Playing my old human warlock and having to avoid going to stormwind because my computer was so garbage if I were to go in my game would lock up and I wouldn’t be able to get back out.
---
If it’s done intentionally it’s easy to tank. If it’s a surprise, it’s gonna get ya!

Ganking too much in South shore and not lvling
---
How is this a necessity?
---
Do all the buttons on the right actually work, and are/were they useful?
---
BINGO!!!!

picture being so dense...
---
Bruh.
