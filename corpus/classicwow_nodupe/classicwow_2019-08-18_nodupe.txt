Yes

---
Haha it's on the list, we only just moved
---
As others have stated, druid. Easiest to get into pve groups: PUG Dungeons = Warrior tank, Raids = probably every specc that you'd normally take but with a better player behind the monitor. Seriously, if you made the right connections while leveling up and proved that you're a good player (and put in the effort) you'll never have trouble finding a raid spot, even as a rogue.

"Xo" and "Slow" on stalagg for retail gold pst
---
Haven’t seen this before. Mind sharing some knowledge?
---
Love the minimalist look! This is like the polar opposite of /r/NeckbeardNests
---
You can level with him, the run through Barrens will be slow, but you'll make it.
---
But if there's that big a queue so what?
---
I used to run all of my new undead characters to the Valley of Trials (orc/troll starter zone). I can't say with certainty that it is the same in Mulgore, but I would imagine you could do that.
---
I’ll be honest, I first read that as “Ass of Orgrimmar”
---
This is fucking relationship goals right here. Amazing setup, hope you guys have a good launch!
---
I remember when you first started putting episodes out Josh. Seems like forever ago. Getting to join you for a few calls was so exciting. You’ve helped build this community into a welcoming, awesome place. Thanks for all the hard work you put in and we will all be looking forward to hearing about your classic WoW endeavors in the future
---
Still a week out. Stalagg can easily become Full.
---
Indeed it does
---
But wont the layers make it so this wont happen? Or is there a limited number of layers?
---
Same. I got to 18 on the beta, but other than that I am a complete Ally noob. Cant wait. The advantage is, we know where all the horde questing area are/aren't.
---
too bad that Blizzard has introduced bugs into the WC3 campaign recently, and hasnt fixed it for months.
---
I always run my gnomes to Elwynn at lvl 5
---
Kinda defeats the purpose of having layers am i right?
---
Thanks for the answer. I am really looking forward to the classic experience since I started playing later on in the game
---
Achievements didn’t exist. This will not be in the game
---
Yeah I enjoyed it when I was played at 60 the last time. I had no idea what I was doing until we got to AQ, I guess that’s the upside of a 40 man raid haha
---
Thanks and LOVE the new site. Y’all really did such an amazing job and can’t wait to put it to the test.
---

He attacks 93 mobs during the scourge event.
---
Amount of Casts: 12
---
Amount of targets per Cast: 93
---
Clearcast Procs: 1
---
So it's just about the cast, number of mobs don't matter.
---
I was Alliance in Vanilla, with a Shaman alt Horde side. I will be playing Alliance again, because my SO played Horde and wants a new experience.
---
I might use addons this time around, just for quality of life.
---
Same. There are things I don’t like about it. One thing being time-based skilling instead of experience based.  Also the disconnectedness of space like you’re saying.
---
I agree with this
---
Hopefully there’s enough interest on Herod, otherwise R.I.P sleep schedule
---
I think there will be many disappointed copycats (probably a good thing).
---
Have you seen charge? Yikes
---
Horde then, rolling Horde now. I've played some alliance throughout the years but for classic I'm sticking with my Horde roots. As for the UI, at first I'll probably be running default just because I am really picky when I set up new ones and I don't want to invest the time into it just yet.
---
Sorry, why only 3 layers? Who gave you that information? There are hundreds upon hundreds of layers to ensure each area stays at a maximum number of players.
---
Server firsting doesn't mean anything.  I played on laughing skull and we were the 2nd guild behind Deus Vox.
---
[Here is Curse PW kill](https://youtu.be/Cd1ylt88LQ0), find me the warlocks.
---
Alliance warlocks fared a little better than horde.  Or if they were fed buffs like PI, Wisdom, etc to hit mid tier on your damage charts. If you were top 3 your guild had some really bad players.
---
Yes, but be careful. If you pick a class the tauren, you'll have a tuff time getting skills. You'd have to get the thunder bluff flight point and fly there to do it.
---
I guess you don't go to concerts?
---
I've always been horde except when I FIRST tested what waters as a night elf rogue. Right now I'm going to play an undead priest.
---
Yes, tested to confirm in the stress test even. I’d recommend getting naked for the run. You can actually speed it up by dying and spirit reading in the right places my best time was a little over 11 minutes.
---
british programming is so good
---
Absolutely. But only for Mage and Hunter!
---
Name doesn’t check out
---
How long do you think we will have to wait to finally log in without crashing
---
it's not too bad. I only spent a little bit of time leveling a priest on vanilla, but on a woltlk server, I leveled several and found I preferred specing disc early on and running a lot of dungeons. IMO shadow is good at later levels, but it doesn't seem to speed up leveling THAT much, especially if you focus on dungeons. but, I also prefer to be a stronger healer in dungeons. you CAN pull it off, but I feel a lot more comfortable if I have spec'd into healing talents early.  
---
spend some time looking at the talent tree: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest)
---
Play around with it a bit. You should get an idea of how much each talent helps. Honestly, even leveling as predominantly holy/disc isn't too bad. You definitely want to at least get spirit tap, but beyond that, I find the holy/disc talents more helpful. There are some holy/disc talents that help with survivability and dps, so it's definitely possible to level while holy/disc. 
---
priest is middle-of-the-road. a bit slow, if you're used to hunters/locks/druids, but not bad at all. good survivability, just gotta learn how to manage mana. focus on wands. but most importantly, play the way you want! if you want to focus on healing, do so! you'll probably have to respec once you hit 60 either way (if only to use the 5 spirit tap points to something more useful). hope this helped a bit, best of luck
---
Proper hunter rotation is actually among the most complex in classic. The "afk hunter" rotation is only true for the low-tier or casual players.
---
Thanks a lot, you too! Hope they haven't underestimated it too much :o
---
The glow filter was there in vanilla tho. Private server babies with their private server bullshit again.
---
I cant recall if you can do the immediate starting zone quests but I know 100% you can do the quests right after them (Brill, Razor Hill, Bloodhoof Village) as for running through the Barrens, yeah even sticking to the road you'll die a few times prior to lvl 10
---
how do you see this?
---
I remember this 3 man Onyxia @ Level 60 :D

Woah! I didn't expect people to be this friendly! Thank you so much! I'll definitely keep this in mind! :)
---
SHADOW MAGE
---
heh
---
the moment they allowed us to race change i changed my Male Orc warlock to a Female Orc Warlock and mained that for like 8 years
---
PvE realm is BIS and you have to min/max or you can't play classic wow
---
Good luck on your search, if you’re horde and on Herod I’m definitely looking for as many people as I can find with similar play schedules for dungeons/leveling
---
If you are getting ganked, just get invited by a friend to hop layers. Ez
---
Wouldn't it be smarter to run to Ogrimmar take the Zeppelin to Thunder Buff?
---
I'm not sure all quests in the start area meant for lvl 1 to 5 can be done by another race. I took my Troll to the Undead start area in Tirisfal (Deathknell) but most quests in it we re only for Undead.
---
You from UW?
---
What if i told you batches were on 400 ms windows
---
Sure am! But just general resources and Priest info for me!
---
No but I am now...
---
Was Horde, now Alliance, change of scenery, yes.
---
yeah but after queue is char screen
---
Why do you say its a myth? 
---
I think mostly what I am referring to is the RPG element of the game that all the newer expansions lack. Maybe my idea of Classic is a bit fantasized having seen the memes or stories of what the game used to be.
---
I'd probably laugh even harder
---
Game doesn’t check out
---
Imagine thinking that everyone who goes to pve is a noob. You must have the mentally of typical pvp retard who thinks he's somehow superior yet if I were to face you I'd have smoked your ass with my eyes close just like every other clown on ND
---
Oh wait there's no way I would face you. You're hiding in SM. My bad geez
---
Is retail really so watered down that people have to ask stuff like this? Can you select a starting zone or some stupid shit? 
---
Yes just get ready to board the shoelace express for at least a little jog.
---
As much potential use I could see with riposte, I'd honestly ditch it in favor of cold blood. It could be useful for oh shit situations, but this would give you an edge against casters since you won't be parrying them.
---
Yeah; there will be one or two quests that are race specific, but otherwise you'll be fine
---
Your opinion doesn't mean anything. It is happening. We are a little more than a week away. Plans are set. Phasing will be gone by phase 2. This is the end of it. It doesn't require anymore bitching and posts, its happening.
---
I have had a female orc warrior since wrath :(
---
Dude, relax. Nobody forces you to play on a pvp realm. Stay happy on your pve realm and miss the good stuff. Nobody wants a crybaby like you on pvp anyway, win win.
---
Why is that? I’ll be rolling a gnome
---
alliance nightelf huntard.
---
fuck i miss that OG toon.
---
does some other game have a legit shadow mage?  idk
---
You can find the horde one's at your local flea market.
---
Yeah it's the BBC, so their research teams are actually pretty good, even if they get the odd minor detail wrong. The BBC covering the issue surely gave Blizzard an added jolt to get things fixed, or risk looking even worse.
---
Imagine hopping layers to escape a gank only to be plopped next to 2 rogues just standing there. What a time to be alive.
---
Yeah that’s the dream, feel free to give me a shout for any dungeons/leveling (horde Herod)
---
I feel like they probably have and the initial launch might be a little messy, but they’re usually pretty good at cleaning up their mistakes fast, I’m planning a LAN party for the weekend after launch so that they have time to sort things out before we get together.
---
Hopefully not. German Servers are full since like 30 minutes after Name Reservation started and nobody at Blizz gives a damn.
---
Unless you're a warrior
---
Nelf Hunters in stealth, Brown Bear just wandering around...
---
How do you see that wonderful background? I only see a white one...
---
Classic is the only game other games arnt real.

Classicwow.live

All the info you’ll ever need
---
I cant wait to see how dead the servers are in 6 months, I have been looking forward to this for quite some time.
---
My balls.
---
I took a week off work mid September, hope to be mid 20s by then playing a few hours a night. To those who used their vacation time for launch week: Godspeed and good luck!
---
was alliance still alliance
---
If you want to ride another race's mount then you can make a point to do ALL quests that give reputation with that race. Once your a few levels after 40 you'll be half way through revered.
---
you're asking if there are going to be douches on the internet?
---
So you manage to move away in the 1-2 frames that it takes to cast the trap after FD is cast?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IJVpfOV6os Here are some examples of feign death freeze trap at both 100 and at ~30 ping. You will be facing off against players as low as 5-10 ping in a real server. 1:07 for the first example of 30 ping FD+trap. If you can perfectly space at all times and react in a few milliseconds (and happen to also have incredibly low ping so that your reaction is properly counted by the server), then props to you, but most people can't.
---
I commented this earlier. Use old reddit. You can permanently switch.

---
I am starting a masters this fall and this is 100% why I'm leveling up fishing.
---
That's cool! I'll take that advice either way. It's been too long since I've played.
---
Me personally would prefer a hybrid of both ele and enh but really i could just accept tables of them both.  Enh is reallt just rogue gear with warrior weapons anyway
---
but orc stun resist still better than tauren. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Youll see once you get opened up by a rogue
---
Their armor and health are LOWER than most mobs which makes them great for melee to grind.
---
Yeah, it's a problem if you have to type in a fuckin' console command to disable a shitty feature.
---
The one you do when reading retail wow players comment on a thread about vanilla mechanics and gameplay
---
This is the high quality shitpost I was looking for.
---
Being able to 1v3 a warrior as a frost mage
---
Never played PServers I'm going off my Vanilla knowledge/experience.
---
you might want skull of impending doom
---
The first night is going to be the worst, and also make sure you don't get d/c'd or log off during prime hours in the first few nights. I think short of the few servers that Blizz has already mentioned it'll be a little rough at first but fine after a few days.
---
Mr. Bigglesworth
---
I remember I was about 10-11 years old when I first started during classic. I got lost in the stonetalon mountains at around level 12 and kept dying to higher level mobs. A female Tauren hunter named “Heffer” around level 30-40 came around and saved me and allowed me to follow them out of stonetalon back to the barrens. She then invited me to her guild and helped me learn the game. I’ll always remember her kindness
---
Yes truly a fine example
---
Never log off
---
You should man! It’s so relaxing.
---
Just like you had to do in vanilla.
---
It makes me sad that I'm rolling Alliance. I might pop in a different server for a bit to roll an undead just for it. A lot of nights I'll just throw on the Tirisfal music just for some nice nighttime ambiance.
---
This image is high in artifact power.
---
Maybe in the future I can, but I’m not promising anything haha
---
Definitely weird, and it’ll be really interesting to see how pervasive these private server metas are when the throngs of people start to step foot into raiding.  Min/maxing is a huge thing on live, but vanilla raiding is a relative cake walk.  Why min/max if you could do most of the raids with half the players?
---
Your opinion is wrong.
---
Good, deserving post. I can honestly say that over the course of the several months we've been waiting for Classic, Josh has become a friend to me. Every time he asks me to be on the show, I almost always say yes if I'm free and able, because I respect his content and outright just enjoy hanging out and talking about WoW Classic. Because of him, I've met new friends, reunited with old friends, interviewed an original developer of my favorite game of all time, and had a platform to express my passion for this great game. I owe him a lot of thanks which I don't shy away from expressing every time I'm on the show. I hope you all have an amazing time in Classic, and thanks again Josh. Best of luck to you and all your endeavors moving forward, and if you ever want me on the show again, just let me know!

They still run Laws? I remember running with a similar group back in '06.

*shrug* enjoy your queue I guess.
---
This is exactly what I've been doing, except instead of answering questions I make bad puns.
---
It's not even remotely just a 1 DPS increase and it also won't cost 500 gold but if you really insist on gimping yourself for no reason as some way to "stick it" to the hardcore players then be my guest.
---
Josh’s Countdown to Classic has definitely become one of the best, informative and relevant WoW podcasts. The format is great; drawing info and opinions from a wide variety of people in the community and not putting it all on himself. 
---
I honestly love listening to it, so keep it going Josh!
---
Definitely read that as, “That’s an oddly specific way of saying 40 people in the queue. I didn’t know partial people could be in it, and why was there a queue for only 40 people? Oh wait...”
---
Tbh i didn't even think people would think this would stir controversy, i just thought it was funny the farming/boosting services are already making some ads
---
The question isn't how much we have in each layer, the question is how many you have on the server when you collapse all layers into one!
---
It's the Icon of Courage, which is suppose to represent courage and tenacity of humanity. While the shield bears the symbol of Lordaeron, the hammer has a golden lion's head to represent Stormwind.
---
What about Blasted land buff? :(
---
My level 39 ret paladin with BiS gear in battlegrounds. That char was a sticky wreckingball that you couldn't get away from.
---
Is this a bait?
---
what? are you telling me hunters in retail can run arround with a fucking chromaggus pet? god thats sad
---
Vanilla had an option for that. But it got removed in one of the expansions. Plus **the glow wasn't that extreme**
---
Josh has invited me on about 10 times now, and it gas been a great experience each and every time. The podcast is well designed, informative and most importantly. The guests Josh gets are always knowledgeable about their topics, be the topic be about high level theory crafting, ex-wow developers, content creation or even diaper use while leveling. The podcast is able to skate the line between being serious and funny perfectly and this is obviously due to the effort and time put in by it's creator.
---
Thank you for all the time and effort you have put into creating not only a great warcraft podcast Josh, but for creating my favorite podcast.
---
Now if only you could stop kicking puppies.
---
The hilarious thing is that this person is guaranteed to call others snowflakes.
---
I very much so enjoyed reading this. I hope to hear more of this stuff once classic launches :) enjoy your gold.
---
I’m pretty sure wow was going to be scrapped but Mark fought hard for it. So technically he is the reason it’s around, but obviously the man didn’t build the game from the ground up single-handedly.
---
He also hand delivered the vanilla wow petition to Mike Morhaim after Nostalrius was shut down and convinced Mike Morhaim to bring vanilla back.
---
Wow, did not know that.  Is that actually confirmed?  I thought people in the new beta said there were available quests in Hinterlands when they checked.
---
This. Already using a few animated wow wallpapers
---
That's not a bad idea. It will burn a little, but at least it will be fast.
---
Other than rune of the guard captain there isn't really anything worthwhile.  Maybe nifty stopwatch?
---
Yes this is what I use, it was the default on starting actually. If you look in the image though you will see that he isn't using that as he has a second window besides wow on the right of it on the same monitor.
---
yes, entitlement. sort of like thinking that despite a realm being full, you have friends there so you should play there anyway regardless and other people should leave? like that?
---
Willey, clearly, is the chaddest name.
---
He is actually updating it again for Classic.
---
Already got my name reserved on Herod. I'll just wait a month or so and then roll an alt on the opposite faction of my main once the server pop levels out.
---
I still don’t get why they gave Taurens extra range. Night Elf’s are big too and have much longer arms and a bigger reach and yet they don’t get any extra range benefit. Gnomes have tiny arms and a very short reach yet their attack range is normal. There’s just no logical reason for Taurens to have extra range on their abilities.
---
that's a consumable not so much a worldbuff.
---
What's wrong with RP-PVP servers? I haven't played since WOTLK and I was planning on rolling RP-PVP...
---
Just gonna take a wild guess here: Blizzard’s network engineers are smarter than you.
---
Van cleef
---
Ofc.
---
I can tell you're a wholesome person, Moon, so I have to step in as an internet elder and tell you you're being trolled, lol.
---
No, because then people will know that in addition to being a troll that I am also a troll.
---
I would recommend sticking to 1 class.

Dwarf Paladin in full T2 comes to gank us 1v5.

He kills some but we manage to kill him as well.

He keeps coming back, over and over.
---
We kill him every time, each battle more epic than the last.
---
Dude, that pc has an i5-2400, it's probably hard these days to get a laptop that doesn't have a better cpu.
---
Is this based on documented evidence of real retail vanilla guilds doing it that way?
---
Or are you assuming that because it worked that way on a pirate server it will work that way in Classic?
---
Omg however you get your maternity leave that is so cool! But I'll totally send you the discord invite once I get home! Welcome!

Attack the right target, do your rotation, watch threat, and be ready with Evasion and health stone/pot to ease stress on your healers.

---
destined to die the day it was made, very sad reality
---
I mean, how dare Blizzard for listening to the community and opening up another EST PvP server so people can play the game they have been waiting years for and not have to sit through a 4 hour queue :\
---
People actually that dead set on Herod? It's shaping up to be a dumpster fire and I wouldn't blame anyone for wanting to get as far away as possible from there.
---
But you do you homie.
---
It reminds me of the slashdot post about the ipod.

https://m.slashdot.org/story/21026
---
&gt;No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame.
---
Just saw you can actually grab both hemo and sword spec.. You could actually try and do both as you level to 60, food for thought..  
---
I would say it's not optimal compared to other rogue builds but you are still going to out DPS other classes sometimes.
---
Awesome thx heaps.
---
Simple and to the point, well put together guide.

I'd much rather a Druid or Paladin tank in 5-mans.  They hold aoe aggro so much easier.

Wwelcome to WoW then xD
---
P.S For the Horde!
---
"classic bars/display for the real feel" isn't very accurate since people used GUI addons in Vanilla as well.
---
I was alliance, but now I'm rolling horde. Sticking with the same class though, and choosing my race for similar reasons. I'm using mods, but using ones from back in the day whenever I can (like Z-perl which I hope is like x-perl.)
---
Lootlag hasn't been a thing in wow in a very long time.
---
I get the chills and I know whats coming, can't wait!
---
He’s just making up numbers in his own head.  Where did he get any of them from?
---
While your not wrong, Sub is just as bad with its reliance on cooldowns. At least combat has the highest white dmg of all the rogue specs, so youll still hit harder then everyone else.
---
Ya. 4 years ago when I started playing pservers. Updating the list though.
---
An abusive cheating husband and narcissist Riot Lyte was behind the new automated punishment system which quickly goes from a chat restrict to perma ban in 3 punishments if you don't "REFORM" it doesn't take into account any context nor does it ignore multiple reports from duos or parties all going against the one loner.
---
This replaced the beloved Tribunal system which was a well respected jury system that if multiple neutral parties (instead of players who feel slighted because you played bad in the game that you both lost together) vote against you on multiple occasions you may be punished.  This punishment was very rare to reach permaban and had many more measured levels such as 24hour ban or 72hour bans and you could get the same type of punishment instead of an exponential increase in your ban just because you didn't "reform" a month from your last bad day.
---
Anyways Riot Lyte was fired being extremely toxic toward the community, was cheating on his wife, and emotionally abused her.  And that's the guy who invented our punishment system which hasn't been reverted despite the irony of who made it years now after the fact.
---
You underestimate that 2400. Its only 20% slower than i5 7400 from 2 years ago. It can play wow classic any day of the week at any settings even at 4k. Because the higher the resolution, the less the cpu matters.
---
I am just happy that we will finally have defined classes. For me homogenization of WOW is what made me quit. The let every class do everything is such a crappy way to design a game.
---
What's the last bad launch wow had? Cata? Mists?
---
I tend to accumulate bookmarks as I go. If I need a page I don't have, I'll just run a quick search, then save whatever I find. Simple but effective.
---
Work, work...
---
Orc stun resist is still luck dependant, as Tauren you have a fairly reliable stun yourself. Not saying it is better, but a tradeoff.
---
Yoyo! Sending you a message when I get home!
---
Phase 1 does not give any honor. 100%
---
However, I thought I read dishonorable kills WILL transition to Phase 2.
---
I may be completely wrong about that though.
---
For those not in tune with present day Blizzard games, Classic effictively came as a result from community outcry, timing which they couldnt really control.
---
Competitive WC3 has seen a recent and very gradual rise in popularity in the last 3 years, so much so they started making major patches the last year and a half.
---
HotS however has seen declining fortunes since early after its launch.
---
It seems to be no coincidense that they announced they were winding down HotS production shortly after WC3 reforged was released.
---
Seems like they were waiting for resources to be freed up from HotS in order to work on WC3, which was already after they were well into WoW development.
---
I'm a fan of leatherworking and I think it's useful for a rogue, especially at first. Even statless, homemade leather armor and Medium Armor Kits will give you an edge when you're level 5-10.
---
lol that is some Littlefinger scheming
---

This will disrupt any high level thinking that you may as well just play all out. Fishing and something simple on Netflix is more realistic...
---
Not Vanilla related, but in TBC I was brought in to heal BT as a 68 paladin because one of our main healers was out. It was really what got me hooked me on healing because they geared my ass well that night.

---
fixed it for ya
---
Nice catch but I decided not to add those because I consider them consumables. I did not want to have to include all those types of items like Rumsey Rum Black Label, Blasted lands consumes, Jujus, or other items like that. Maybe I will make a video for all those other consumes.
---
lmao. You are definitely right
---
Yes! Thank you!
---
That should work great wow in general, but especially classic, isnt very dependent on high tec
---
Innervate and battle rez beg to differ
---
Reminded me of the scene from Benjaman Button with the clock

i can run 4 retail accounts on a 980
---
any potato should do
---
if you want to check download retail its free to 20
---
if you can run retail classic wont be an issue
---
All those Orc druids OP.
---
I'm talking about the one he uses to track dots in the target, how does he see the DoTs below the HP bars?
---
I'm also interested in the rest of addons but that one is the most important, if anyone can help.
---
😂
---
Definitely the alliance

link pserver screenshot and act as if you played vanilla. good job

PvE vs. PvP though, you know some people are all about that raid min-maxing (I do both so I might lean towards Orc Shammy).

You can't kill what's already dead :^]
---
But yeah I hope it all evens out when people jump ship instead of waiting in queues.
---
This will definitely run classic, but where did you find that for $100? Is it a sale where there are more?
---
Thaddius
---
Well it’s a 1 in 4 chance, so against a rogue you’ll resist 1 stun per fight on average. The real beauty of Orc is when you resist 2-3 stuns in a row and the rogue just goes afk.
---
Thank you for the update!
---
Thanks Josh mate. I love the podcast!
---
The A-team of my PvP group never once lost an Arathi Basin.  One time we were up against our most heated rivals who had consistently been giving us a run for our money since WSG, they were in the lead early and it looked like our win streak was sure to end.  Then as we basically hit the point of being all but mathematically eliminated we capped 2 flags and contested the 3rd giving us a 4-0 hold over the spots as we slide into a 2000-19990 victory.
---
Not really.
---
He gets a lot of interesting people to talk about their experiences, expectations, and theorycraft among other topics.  Some such celebrities John Staats vanilla dev and author of WoW Diary, Madseason a fantastic youtube content creator and streamer, our friend and legendary troll shaman Thex, and so many more.

Mh, should be running relativly good on low settings, maybe even with medium settings good performance should be no Problem.
---
this was pretty much the exact experience we are all chasing by playing classic...cuz id say for the majority of players this was their first mmo and we ALL got hooked. i dont think you will be dissapointed
---
To be real, as soon as people have x hour queue times they're going to start rolling on stalagg
---
Hope we get more PvP servers
---
TBF I play PoE and I know alot of players just want them to add an acts system. Going through the story on every alt each league gets old, would love if you had to do it once per league, then you could just maps / delve an alt to cap.
---
What's the other one you listen to?  I feel I need to add another podcast because I consume Josh's so immediately.
---
A good Hunter shreds bgs and can top 3 most raids.  It's about being above average at your rotation, and not asleep at the wheel.
---
Only fun mmorpg in 2019.
---
They're Classic strings
---
Original launch was way worse than anything we've seen so far.  I don't expect classic launch to be smooth and queue-free, but I do expect that once we're in, it will be playable.  The game was basically unplayable on most servers for the first 72 hours.  Loot lag, disconnects, server and zone crashes.  It was so bad that Blizz shut down new account creation for a bit and credited everyone game time.
---
So far, it's not even close.  If the worst we see all week is people end up in a 15K queue on Herod, then it will be quite a successful launch.
---
Something seems fishy with the armor formula. At lower levels it seems to return zero for most reasonable values.
---
Say you're fighting a level 10 mob and have 200 armor.
---
    200 / (200 + 400 + 85 * (10 + 4.5 * (10 - 60))) = -1.132%
---
And you'd think with more armor you'd have more reduction, right? Change it to 500 armor and see.
---
    500 / (500 + 400 + 85 * (10 + 4.5 * (10 - 60))) = -2.878%
---
It doesn't even get closer to zero. Any ideas? It works fine for level 60+ attackers, but not lower levels.
---
I mean
---
You do you
---
But is a 1hr queue really worth it for some name?
---
Sure, its great to have THE NAME that you wanted, but will it really affect you that much if your char is named not GULDAN or MRBEAN or whatever, but just something else? 
---
But oh well. Like i said, you do you.
---
Already switched from shazzrah to gehennas when it came out. All my friends got all their names, while we weren't really successful on shazzrah, so we are pretty happy with the switch. Not really interested in switching again when a 4th server comes out.
---
Love all your calls Lokth!  There's good reason he invites you back you kill it every time.
---
Patch 2.3 brought guild banks.
---
As much as I enjoyed classic, the talent trees are often no brainiers. There are so many clearly bad choices that most classes must only make 1-2 meaningful choices, and sometimes those choices are only a 2-5% difference toward a single ability.
---
There will be no guild bank in Classic WoW. That feature was only added on a later version of the game.
---
People will have to create bank alts to act as bank and it's going to be really scuffed. But you can thank all the "no changes" people for that since they will prevent Blizzard from adding QoL improvements that do not affect the "classic" experience.
---
I love his podcast and he's such a likable dude. Thanks so much for everything you do, Josh. I really look forward to Countdown to Classic every week.
---
?????
---
and quit a month later because realm pop will burn out
---
Can't find any 100% confirmation, but Wowhead is a reliable source.   
---
Beta is just beta, it's wasn't phased, only restricted.   
---
I hope it gets added in phase 1 but we'll have to see...
---
I'm going to be that guy and point out that it's just a name.  If that's worth it to you over 10k player queues, then so be it.
---
i think at this point every server is going to have a login queue. 
---
especially since realms are opening up right when most people are getting off work.
---
Gordo
---
Well if you care more about your names than 3 hour queues, than you're more than welcome to stay where you are.
---
True... I guess my memory just thinks of it before I even learned about mods or had minimal addons
---
it's .03-.05 of a second. It's around 1/10th the time it takes you to blink. Only the most extreme of the extreme players will feel a difference.
---
I play Worgen on live, but there is no Worgen to play on classic. No Pandas either ( much to the happiness of some). If we want to roll a beast race then its the OG Tauren, or nothing. I haven't been on horde side for quite some time, but the cows come home.
---
There isn't a guild bank in classic, it's all managed manually with alts.
---
It’s more the fact that they opened the server with no prior notice names are important to many people. Also they could of just started with more servers because everyone told them they’d need more but I can understand their hesitation.
---
 https://imgur.com/XIr7S3S 
---
Higher quality version since reddit seems to butcher it.
---
I still plan on playing Herod. I have been duped by playing on “recommended” servers in the past.
---
No? Read top to bottom
---
Alliance on Herod. Good luck while leveling 😉
---
No? Wind serpents have a 1.07 dmg modifier (vs. 1.1 for cats) and WatchYourSixx confirmed in the hunter discord that they do not have 20% less hp. "Caster pets" is a meme.

I think with BFA what I noticed the most was this. I've been playing since vanilla but never before did leveling feel so little like wow. Felt like a single player RPG. World felt small, quests we're easy and close together. Felt baddd
---
pve theyll probably go troll or something
---
My buddy and i did LANs every weekend and leveled our druid and rogue combo. One day we were leveling in Stranglethorn Valley when a level 60 priest killed us. For the next few hours we made it our mission to gank the shit out of him. Turns out that two level 40 chars can in fact kill a 60 if you stun/root/heal in just the right combination.
---
After a while the priest called for help. Now there was 3 level 60s trying to gank two level 40 chars. We just stealthed and waited it out until we could kill the priest again.
---
Later on it turned into a full on epic battle between 20 horde/alliance characters in the middle of SV.
---
Good times.

&gt;What is it we want?
---
Haven't you guessed? People literally just want to complain. If they're not complaining, they're not living.
---
I feel similarly. My names I got are a big part of the community for me. The people I’m playing with know me by these monikers, and have for years. I’ll wait a bit longer at the start so I can play with the names I want.
---
&gt;Was it a mea culpa or just his job to say it? Probably just his job.
---
&gt;But if it happens Im gonna be enjoying all the frustrated memes and posts
---
Same here. Whether we get on and play or sit in hours queue it's gonna be entertaining as fuck either way.
---
If this attitude continues to be a problem then there's really only one solution.
---
Destroy all the servers.
---
Josh Corbett is BREATHTAKING!!!
---
Yea I'm gonna call bullshit on that. If all you're going by is your memory from 15 years ago of what the glow looked like you're delusional. All the graphical comparisons I've seen on a 1.12 client vs the 1.13 client have the same glow.
---
The should have given 24 hours notice on the server opening.
---
Yeah dawg I play a healer so what hunters want to do is try and CC me because I can't heal from a trap, and as a healer I'm not going to run up to a hunter for no reason and just hang out in melee range.
---
I agree with your last statement if you think people should just stand around and wait for a hunter to trap them
---
Is that Oliver fucking Twist asking for more porridge again?
---
Rune of Guard Captain is added in phase 3 so unfortunately we can't get it yet.  
---
It's a good trinket but personally I'm not gonna bother with it at the start being that it has no stats and the cooldown on it is 30 minutes.
---
Mm, good point.
---
The thing is, I am okay with 1hr queue times. I'm okay with 3hr queue times. I'm worried about a severe dogpile and even longer queue times
---
says the guy probably on herod who will sit in que for hours and bitch to blizz to fix or give sub time back when it crashes.
---
Herod doesn't need more Alliance. It needs fewer Horde.
---
small indie company
---
I think I do, and I do.
---
Dot dot dot drain raaaaaawr!!! God I can't wait.
---
Then kudos too you. It's your choice to sit in that queue in that case.
---
Yes Blizzard could've handled it way better but they didn't so we'll have to live with that.
---
There is a high chance that they release even more servers before launch though so be ready for that.
---
I still can't decide. Was alliance in vanilla but horde in TBC and WotLK. So feel like I have seen both but not vanilla endgame as horde. 
---
Probably edging horde, tauren and forsaken are my favourite races. But seeing Ironforge for the first time was really something and I still remember it after fifteen years.
---
T2. 5 is bad wait from t2 till t3 then u want t3 neurubian slavemaker
---
What addons is the guy in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK2PNZ75ppc&amp;t=683s) using? Or at least can somebody tell me which one is the one he uses to track dots below his target HP bar.

Best in slot
---
But how much is a laptop with a i5 8250 and a gtx 1050? Atleast 700? And the 8250 is only 7% faster yet it has double the threads. So even a i5 7500u would perform worse or any i3 8th gen mobile cpu.
---
Yea but we have just 3 english realms, while you have 6.
---
How about Yorkshire Tea.
---
Attach some WoW trivia to it and I´ll sub
---
Guide I saw is to tailor and enchant, farm linen cloth (80) level tailoring disenchant items, make wand, scrap enchanting and tailoring for gathering and proceed.
---
**Damn** I wish Twitch wasn't blocked at my job... this would seriously help me through the long days ahead
---
It worries me that a certain number of people still haven't subbed. They didn't care about names, and are waiting for the 26th. So all these full, high, and mediums are going to get higher.
---
pff i was doing that a year ago
---
Alrightie then👍
---
Hybrid builds are designed to be good by yourself.  You don't pigeonhole yourself and give yourself more utility for any situation.  This worked more with pvp than anything earlier on.
---
We were never talking about the gpu. And what does a 7500u have to do with this whole thing? The mental gymnastics are incredible. Have a great day.
---
honestly you will regret it when you hit 60. 
---
It's all fun and games until you hit level 40, and then after that it just all goes downhill and you start to notice you just get worse and worse with dps. Nothing scales with your forms.
---
Ion said in an interview that layers would be about the size of the old servers. They will create as many as the server will hold.
---
Time to buy a foot-pedal

---
Sure, they've learned a fuck ton since then, but they're still underestimating the amount of people that will play. More people = more problems = more bugs being found.
---
It won't be as bad as Classic though were certain servers were down for hours or even days at a time.
---
Yes.  If there's a limit,it's much higher than classic wow will ever see.
---
JRE
---
We are not sure. 
---
I wouldn’t say infinite, but possibly several hundreds of layers, particularly for launch. During the stress tests, while the starting zones were busy, it wasn’t amounting anywhere close to the one thousand mark. In fact, once you left the initial starting area it’s relatively quiet. That goes for the major cities too, which is unfortunate but a necessary casualty for Phase One.
---
These guys made a few more videos tf oo iirc, but ofc frostshock is the best
---
&gt; Not T1, but I remember 2 Nemesis helms dropping from Onyxia which made me the only lock in the guild without one and next in line. The next helm didn't drop for 3 another months QQ
---
Not entirely unrelated but back in vanilla when I still needed the T2 helm there was *one* Onyxia raid I had to sit out due to real life stuff and two of the druid T2 helms dropped. One of them went to a druid, and the other was *disenchanted*. Took a couple of months before I saw it again but that shit *stung*.
---
It's youtube chat, the title is wrong.

Yes ... except when he had Bernie on since I fell asleep.
---
That was my intention :)
---
That's not what you said. 
---
At any rate, they aren't 'extremely powerful in WSG', or rather it depends on your definition.  They have a specific role (flag running) that they do very well, but WSG is very role-centric and pretty much every class is "extremely powerful" at their role.
---
can you show us a link to your talent build please

Retail is doomed. Classic will maintain 4x the population that retail currently has. Retail is a client for wow themed mini games, it's turned into a mount/pet collection money sink.

I can tell you one thing for sure, you will not be top damage in any Classic BG.
---
its not like they fucked up retail into what it is now. They have no clue what theyre doing, trust me,
---
Give him one month of game time to play classic.
---
Very true. Pre create queues do not equal actual launch time queues. 10-20k queue for people trying to make a character name and log off vs. 10-20k queue for people trying to push HARD to level and grind.
---
Doubt there will be much lag, the other two are going to be fucked tho

I'd feed that little alliance brat to my pet and save gold on food cost.
---
If you can't have more than 1, it's not really a consumable like juju/Rum where you can stack an infinite amount, you need to pop one at the npc and redo the quest to still have 1 in your inventory to get 2hours buff. I find the mechanic the same as the songflower tbh.
---
Just posted this in a thread about my favorite pvp moment from classic:
---
My buddy and i did LAN parties every weekend and leveled our druid and rogue combo together. One day we were leveling in Stranglethorn Valley when a level 60 priest killed us. For the next few hours we made it our mission to gank the shit out of him. Turns out that two level 40 chars can in fact kill a 60 if you stun/root/heal in just the right way.
---
Way to pick the most unreadable graph there is man
---
Launch of Vanilla and TBC meant it might take days to be able to finally log in and play. 
---
I got lucky. I logged in 3 hrs before TBC launched and avoided a queue... then managed to get through the portal and questing through to zeth’gor before the server kacked. I got back on a day later...
---
“We invested time and energy into picking a place and out names” 
---
Hahahahahahahahahah 0/10 troll

Tell him retail wow and classic wow aren't even in the same genre. Classic is an mmoRPG and retail is a lobby arpg

Halo Master Chief Collection

It's a shame Need For Speed 2019 probably won't be anything like the golden era. I'd add it to my short list of games brought back from the past.

Not one instant per say, but as a lonely teenager playing on an RP server I got taken in by a really close knit guild and I played with them a ton. Their leaders were super helpful and awesome and were literally the kindest people in the universe to me. I miss them and can’t remember their character names (just the nicknames we called them) to find them again, but they made me a better player.

Every expansion launch I stay up for the launch all hyped then when I finally am able to play I get tired after like 2 hours lmao. Not with Classic though! Rather get a later start and be able to do the long haul than and early start and an early tap out
---
Yeah it drove me insane, especially as my start in raiding was logging in and sitting outside MC 3 times a week hoping they’d need a sub. Not “be around in case”, fucking be there waiting *in case*.
---
Ya a regular nustrafuckingdamus you are

Yeah, I phrased it pretty poorly. I should have said "don't miss this".  I remember it well. They buffed ret in BC, and then they changed the seals before or during wrath, iirc.

---
How is that important? We don't get language specific servers for all those 20 languages, we are all forced to play on the english realms.
---
It's been my name for over 15 years. It's almost more real than my real name in some ways. Bite me.
---
unless they have lifesteal
---
What's the horde alliance ratio like?
---
I mean, BFA was fairly atrocious for several hours.  They took down servers for a long time trying to get shit working and such. Lower pop servers probably didn't have a bunch of issues, but the higher pop ones definitely did.  Blizz still fucks up basically every launch. It's just how quickly they react and repair the issues that seems to have improved over the years.
---
Not at all. I do the same, and while the name I wanted is still taken, one lower on my list actually became available and I got it.
---
This gives me hope. 
---
I don't think I'll ever get my top one, but it's nice to know there's a possibility.
---
Reading this physically hurt me.
---
What are they used for
---
[Here's the build.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-05023201230201-050232330020513)
---
Agreed. Done by a 3rd grader
---
They assume the population will be low enough to remove them. But it could be high enough to keep them.
---
Turns out this was incorrect.
---
It’s a flat 10% increase with an additional 10-30% increased based on remaining health. (Max at 40% HP remaining.
---
It does stack multiplicatively so maximum bonus is 43%
---
Not gonna lie. You had us in the first half.
---
transfer and realize your name is unavailable :)
---
First ever character, early vanilla... I had no idea how to get my Tauren Shaman into Orgrimmar, from Mulgore of course.
---
I still remember the person's name. A Tauren Druid by the name of Ashenhoof guided me in his party all the way through The Barrens right to the gate of Orgrimmar.
---
Questie? I'd rather not ruin the experience.
---

UPDATED!
---
Good one, thanks! Hope it doesn't get too expensive :)
---
I don’t really see what has to do with lightning, and back during the original design the entire story wasn’t fleshed out yet either
---
Ex girlfriend. She was nuts. Sad story, but I don't regret it. I love my kid, and I'm a better man for having him in my life.
---
It’s crazy how many people that have never played an MMO are posting on here.
---
The hype is real.
---
Imagine being Blizzard and thinking no one wants this.
---
No remaster = no play
---
Nice! Do you have the scrtipt on GitHub?
---
Highly recommended if you are playing on Herod during peak hour
---
It's actually gotten me sad how bad it is now. I resubbed since Nazjatar and the Naga was a piece of lore I've been interested in since Warcraft, and they fucking butchered to death with a terrible story and the worst zone ever created. They can't even create their own "mini-games" (I'm looking at you bejeweled...). I've pretty much just been earning gold to buy tokens so I never have to give blizzard another penny.
---
Not much in mage folder yet, still doing research on mage and other classes.
---
Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter
---
The last two expansion launches were smooth as fuck. Just like logging out and back in. Granted it might not be as many players logging in but the architecture isn't anywhere near as bad as say wrath.
---
This’ll be fun!
---
They must have for a while, I distinctly remember it.
---
Full doesnt mean locked.
---
That pc could run modern wow at 60 fps without looking like crap. Also the minimum and recommend requirements for classic were posted a few days on the forums, they are much lower than modern wow. If that pc with th 2400 and gtx 1050 can't run max settings 60 fps at 1080p I will bite my own cock.
---
Works best in towns.
---
grab tailor and enchanting needs about 60 linen cloth to make and DE enough low level greens.
---
Or depending on your faction/race may be an early wand quest like the westfall one at 11
---
WTS Apple, Strawberry, and Orange on Herod
---
And the story was the focus. It's very rpg-esque, but not mmo at all
---
Oh yeah, I took 4 days off and I normally stay up super late 4-5am (Thanks working evenings!) So I'll be playing round the clock for most of those 4 days. Usually not trying to log on during prime time.
---
I plan on going alliance with some friends. More alliance must also be waiting until near launch :)

---
The last one got announced in the morning/midday and then unlock that night at 20:00 iirc.
---
Like the premiere hunter leveling guide, idk how OP hasn't come across this. Probably doesnt know who joanas is.
---
Kek
---
Specifically the Horde campaign. I have to wonder if WoW spawned form that or if that campaign spawned from the development of WoW
---
Grinding on my 40-something mage. Getting close to leveling, really close. Ganked by a rogue but manage to blink away and make a run for it. Health low. I manage to mount up, he does the same. I cross into a new zone, ding from the experience gain and my health and mana shoot up to full (I was probably at like 10%). It’s on. I dismount and hit him hard. He closes the gap after resisting my frost nova. Blink again and get a huge fireball crit to finish him off.
---
Was almost as satisfying a level gain as hitting 60...
---
I dont believe so
---
I too like to be objectively worse at my role
---
If I remember correctly owls disarm, gorillas stun and spiders trap. Which are all useful in pvp.
---
I remade my 3 chars (Gp, Vend, and Edge, thanks for asking) last night with the proper classes and appearances and I was SO nervous!!
---
Even practiced the appearance selection on a p server first so I could get it done in a few seconds each
---
Europe actually has the same amount of servers, just in different languages. The Greman is now full, the French and Russian are both at high.
---
The problem in EU is that it's practically impossible to move people to the other language servers (unless they go TO English, since it's universally used).
---
If Gehennas goes to full before launch, Blizzard will be forced to open at least one more. It will be trickier if the server is full after launch since tourists come into play at that point.
---
No shirt, bracers, belt either. Rest is there though, mount included.
---
Lol the note at the end: The Green Hills or Go Fuck Yourself.
---
Too true.
---
its a material for all sorts of stuff
---
I was looking at this in the player's guide as well, and noted how neat it was that all the Crests were more or less symmetrical. Except for the forsaken having a completely asymmetrical Crest. I assume it was done on purpose by the artist(s), and is a nice touch for the most twisted faction.
---
frost bolt. then frost bolt. maybe throw in a frost nova or a cone of cold and then run away. wand when you run out of mana.
---
mana barrier is a big cost on your mana, but helps with spell pushback. It's better to not use it and frost nova and get some distance or just wand the enemy to death with no spell pushback and start your regen a little sooner. Ice barrier is way more mana efficient, so that's a different story and you should always try to keep it up.
---
frost nova becomes more important once you get shatter. A lot of frost spells that will save your life are the situational ones like cold snap and ice block.
---
Damn I also have played in awhile so i might be messing this up.
---
Thanks! Sure I will, I’m hyped for classic!!
---
I just resubbed after a long long long time. Leveling up a druid in the main game while waiting for Classic. Gonna check out this podcast now. Thanks OP.
---
Ah. If so says so. Oh. Yea. Lol. I talk. As if. I have a. Dick. in my Ass.
---
saves a ton of time iirc
---
Undead is the most popular race in the game, it'll be a cluster fuck. Taurens got it the easiest to start, but I don't think anyones really getting off easy.
---
Huge fan of your shitposts. Always glad to see your name on /r/classicwow.
---
If you care more about pvp, play a gnome. They are best pvp race for alliance. Otherwise, +5 swords makes you better at pve than other races
---
My problem with retail leveling atleast is that it seems you can go multiple levels without unlocking somthing new. Compared to classic every single level you unlock a new talent point, plus spells. In classic it feel like you are making progress with your toon in many different ways. Like for example the arms spec where you learn the 2h weapon specialist each of the 5 levels that you put a point into it you get 5% 2h damage and you see a major upgrade in your damage.
---
Fantastic guide, thank you for your work
---
It's the one you get from fishing, it has no level requirement to use but it doesn't increase run speed, increases swim speed though. Doesn't matter regardless since an actual heirloom mount exists which has the regular mount speed and is available from level 1, it just looks like this guy might've not had it.
---
I mean, some people might have made a name/toon there.. so..? Not like they will play on it if shazzrah got like a 10min queue.
---
Why level a alt to lvl 5?
---
What library are you using to send the email?
---
 Funfact you can use your phone number if you append your providers @address to the end of it.
---
Needs more Amon Amarth
---
I moved today. Got 3 amazing names and was absolutely surprised they were not taken
---
Because nobody played them. Lol
---
Part of the allure of classic is world pvp...
---
I thought it was Mr. Wi Tu Lo?
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
Someone in vanilla randomly opened trade with me and gave me 300g when I was only level 40 something 
---
I thanked them and they said nothing and left. I still have no idea what it was about.
---
From that point forward I was never hurting for gold.
---
Wouldn't ice shards be more damage than piercing ice?  1-2 points elem precision since you are building around scorch and won't cast frostbolt much.
---
Good for you, lad. Genuinely, with no sarcasm.
---
&gt;	He never once indicates remorse for what was a serious mistake that offended many people
---
I really hope you’re joking
---
If he's not into it, you can't really convince him to be. If you do convince him to play, he probably won't last long and you will be even more disappointed. 
---
Learned this a while back: do not convince your friends to play games. If they want to play, they will.
---
that does sound like something someone who enjoys playing an objectively worse class would say
---
Frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt.  Add frost nova and/or cone of cold as needed.
---
There's nothing wrong with them. They're on that list becaue Blizz wasn't originally going to include them until the community made a stink. And in every single thread begging for RP-PvP there was someone justl ike OP spouting off "stop asking for it, Blizzard said no and they know more than you."
---
This continued right up until Bilzz caved and added them to Classic.
---
As a Paladin back in the day I was so mad at Shamans.
---
They just could do anything.
---
That video was the hillarious proof.
---
It's just a flesh wound.
---
Switching over to Alliance to level for the first time. Excited for the same but new experience
---
Awesome job OP, looking forward to seeing other classes added!
---
Yea I guess it depends how you look at it I naturally think consume because it's an item in your bag
---
Which is weird because our way mimics Netflix and Hulu.
---
Good luck hope to see you in stv &lt;3
---
Welcome to the Stalagg gang!
---
All I remembered were the boars have the little charge stun. A disarm would be incredible for keeping rogues from bursting you down
---
Scoreboars shows damage and healing done afaik.
---
&gt; It doesn't need to be new mechanics. The mobs don't have to scale in difficulty. The non-raid TBC gear doesn't need to be better than Vanilla raid gear.
---
It does need to be better, that's the point. Look, I will make it as simple as I possibly can because you are obviously so lost in your own fantasies about how this will work that you cannot look at the nuts and bolts.
---
Dude #1 does 1000 DPS. Dude #2 does 200 DPS.
---
You cannot make a zone which is suited to both Dude #1 and Dude #2. It is mathematically impossible. It will be trivial to one or impossible to the other, or both.
---
You cannot make drops which are an upgrade to Dude #1 and Dude #2. You cannot make instances which are fun for Dude #1 and Dude #2.
---
And because Dude #1 has no reason to run old raids, you cannot give Dude #2 equivalent gear without also removing their reason to run old raids.
---
I was 13 when the game first launched and let me tell you... I was bad.  I clicked all my spells, I wore strictly vendor bought equipment til like level 30, and I enjoyed every second of it.  You really can play this game at your own pace however you like, and it’s just has this immersion and flow unlike any mmo I played before and since.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did the first time around!  I’m sure you’ll be fine regardless of how you choose to play.
---
Wake up and give me Perdition's Blade already!!
---
I hate world buffs :(
---
Yeah, patchnotes etc.
---
Dude, private servers have the glow too.
---
Classic glow is way more noticable.
---
Next time you cast [x spell] it costs no mana.
---
He’s gonna be in for a real shock when he realizes he won’t have those nice shiny heirlooms.
---
Judgement mechanics was garbage before the buff
---
Love him or hate him, op is spitting straight facts
---
yeaaa mage is gona have a LOT of excels, they were preety crazy in classic
---
And don't forget a 60% speed mount.
---
Lol, no it doesnt. It will be full on launch day, and they'll open more realms.
---
a mediocre cover of a song in the game.  this sub is such shit already
---
Lemme put my math brain on and get back to you on that one, that does seem fishy.
---
Yep
---
I'm saying that the values are higher on beta than on pservers. Not that they are high relative to other mobs.
---
Yea, I don't see any proof being presented. The glow is client side, has nothing to do with private servers or original servers. If the 1.12 client has it today it had it back in vanilla aswell.
---
FUCK world buff exporters.
---
I belive the  blue post earlier said there will be 1 more realm before launch
---
are you planning hours of grinding in most of the zones listed? 
---
most zones don't have 10 levels of quests, more like 3-5
---
either you need more zones or will be grinding alot
---
Retail Disc Priests come to mind. Even if the implementation never felt quite right to me I loved the concept.
---
All I remember are the.piles of dead alliance players on the way to mc duento a couple of rouges
---
Yep!
---
These two ugly fucks are getting some why cant you? CLICK HERE FOR FREE MEETING IN YOUR AREA!
---
Yeah, but despite gaming being an industry worth billions it's still seen as lesser than television and film in the eyes of many. People can justify having a Netflix, Hulu, Spotify Premium etc but can't justify it to play a game.  
---
I could go into theories and stuff behind it a lot more but I don't have any statistics to back it up, what i've said so far has just been from experience. I might do it for my dissertation at University just so I have an excuse research and rant about it, lmao
---
lmao at the people commenting “nooooo” in the chat. Wtf are they thinking?
---
One of the great things about wow...it is easy to learn the basic's, but still has a ton of depth if you want to really get into it.
---
Like to play ok in a group, you just need to learn simple things like: Mobs need to hit the tank.  (if your a tank you taunt mobs, if a dps hit the mob the tank is hitting so it dosn't target you, if healer heal the tank).  Follow the group.  Drink for mana.  Use the mini map.  Stand near other people and don't wander around.  Don't "need" roll for equipment you can't use.  etc.
---
Other than that just ask when you don't know something, or where something is.  If someone teases you for not knowing, don't take it personal and ask someone else.  Express that your new if something seems to need more explaining and most people are happy to take an extra bit of time to help.
---
As you go you might get into stuff like stat weights, bis items, specialized builds, min/maxing, consumables and buffs etc.  But all of that stuff will be learned a little at a time as you get interested in your toon and talk with people.  It's not really needed for the vast majority of content, and 80% of people could probably never even look at any of it and be fine.
---
Find a guild, there will probably be bunches of them that will look for new players.  Most guilds are happy to help new people out with info and direction...and if you get one that isn't to your liking just move to the next until you find a good group of people.  Reading the forums the game might seem kind of complex, but most of that is people looking to eek out every advantage and percentage point.  Just to play and enjoy the game you don't need to get anywhere close to the limit.  Just jump in and have fun!
---
It will be min maxed by a lot of people. It won't be like it was in Vanilla, sorry to tell you. The community is so much different. Requiring BiS for progression raids, requiring most optimal specs, and DPS has to be top tier at all times. I won't be surprised if people are critiqued on their race choice because it wasn't the "best".
---
This doesn't mean everyone will be like this, just a lot more people than back in the day.
---
Hello fellow Stallag-tite.
---
DRINK
---
I’m having trouble finding the forsaken’s representation on the horde crest
---
Who are those?
---
Needs more horns and war drums
---
u/Joshcorbo82
---
Thank you for your passion and dedication to all things Classic, as well as giving us all something to listen to as we anxiously await launch day!
---
NO!!!!
---
On pserver I had to mostly single target level and it was very slow, spent more time drinking then anything.
---
Should just need an active subscription.
---
I did also.  Convinced my bro that playing is better than waiting hours to play on a “busy” server.
---
Yeah the community in vanilla was in my opinion the best but the balance and a lot of certain specs were absolute garbage as I said elsewhere in the threat I really wish we could have the community of vanilla with the balance of the burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King maybe.
---
Everybody raging about Talent points and I'm over here just wanting no cross-realm stuff back :b
---
Yeah that hasn't really helped them not fuck up retail
---
The only mess is if you want to keep playing on the mega servers. You're free to get out of this ''mess''.
---
It's not about reach or range, it's about size/radius of the character. Range isn't measured from the center of a character to the center of another character, it's measured from the edge of a character to the edge of another character. Since Tauren are wider than everyone else, the edge of their character is slightly farther from their center than anybody else. That also means it's easier for other people to target them.
---
It's like how when you fight a giant boss monster, you don't have to get in close to his center you can melee him from way far out at the edge of his targeting circle and he can melee you from way far from his center.
---
Ok gr8 tysm.
---
/cheer for elemental spec:)
---
A subscription will suffice.
---
Because if Blizzard release a whole slew of servers, 6 months down the line, 90% of those servers will be dead, players will be unhappy, and blizzard will be stuck maintaining physical hardware of computers that aren't really doing anything but gathering dust.
---
LaYeRz BaD n mAkE pEoPlE mIn-MaX /s
---
Layering has nothing to do with it. It's how the 2019 gaming community is.
---
A quick search on some of the names in the raid reveal this to be false.
---
 [http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/41263693](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/41263693)
---
No, just an active WoW subscription.
---
I made my three Characters there last night. Managed to get all my name's. I ain't about that 2 hour queue life.
---
They're probably going to need to add 2 more servers minimum for us. Not sure why they haven't added a South American one though....
---
It’s always a little sad when you log on to your old guild and everyone is gone. Brings back the memories, and wondering what hey might be doing now
---
Right? Should have been Jester Race.
---
Great! Then why don’t Gnomes have a much shorter range since they’re the size of a toddler?
---
Me too. Someone should photoshop the mask over the blood banner on the crest. 
---
It would suffice
---
There’s no undead in horde crest
---
Woosh?
---
That's in the eye of the beholder my dear. So many people on this sub say a quest helper is cheating or not vanilla that I wonder when it's said if it's genuinely an original thought or just a product of groupthink? That's cool though nobody is telling you to use it and there certainly isn't anyone telling me not to use it.
---
Yeah I burst tauren / trolls with ease.
---
Oooh fair, is there a tabard?
---
I see your point, but i wholeheartedly disagree. The problem that needs correcting is people being assholes in the first place, not their victims and when it comes to GM's being overburdened, that's on Blizzard, not the consumer. I do not in all seriousness think anyone called a noob or an idiot is going to contact a GM, but i am adamant that we dont get to decided when a persons enjoyment is ruined or when "enough" harassment when been given to warrant gm involvement. Lets stop telling people to get over others shitty behavior and start correcting it instead.
---
Make sure you do this immediately after an one hour queue.
---
They slapped Stallagg up there real quick. I didn't have time to reserve my name. If they added a server but gave us say, 24 hour notice to reserve a name, i'd jump over. But as of now... I'm on the shit show train.
---
Yes, that is the Icon of Courage. They use the Lordaeron symbol because the Alliance of today is inspired by the idealism of the Alliance of Lordaeron. Lordaeron was considered the heart of the original alliance.
---
Lol I remember when this video came out
---
Theres analytics dont mean much. They have no idea how many people are going to resub on launch day.
---
Because the last four medium haven't bumped to high yet.  If server pops bump to high they'll probably make more.
---
Pve is better
---
Same hack works for trolls.
---
I really wouldn’t dump $400 into that PC. The CPU platform is far too old.
---
Tell him you won't talk to him again until he is level 30 in classic.  If he cannot do that then he isn't a true friend.
---
Anybody remember [Flintlocke](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=85&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogcdn.com%2Fwow.joystiq.com%2Fmedia%2F2007%2F04%2Fflintlocke_alilfiresgood.jpg&amp;client=amp-blogside-v2&amp;signature=c4e80bfbfe1a8066ea7f9faa2386358904d4384a)? Now that's a Chad server I'd roll on.
---
Second this. Especially when you hit 60 ^_^
---
I started playing in Warlords of Draenor. I am not responsible for dumb shit.
---
And if they open a new server and you don't get your names again, will you keep making this post until you finally do?
---
You're always called a "hater" for criticizing Blizzard these days and immediately dismissed.  
---
But all you gotta do is compare the products. There is utterly not comparison between vanilla WoW and Diablo 2 with modern WoW and Diablo 3. Both vanilla WoW and D2 are classic, legendary RPGs that game designers will still be studying and mimicking another decade from now. Modern WoW and D3 are outdone by free indie games.
---
A solution to all the full servers would be for Blizzard to snap their fingers and close all PvP realms.  Everyone can then roll on PvE realms so that the populations can be perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Lol
---
Yeah, the glow is client side and guess what? 1.13 has a different client. Since private has the original client and classic has the new one, guess what? There are differences.
---
I'm not gonna make a collage for you, I don't give a shit if you don't believe me. I know it's not the same.
---
Just wait a few more days, they'll open a new pvp server, where you have another shot at getting your names.
---
Save
---
I'm sure he didn't hate it at all, its his way of apologizing. Way better PR move in all, they made the right choice easy as that
---
BBC good? Hasn't been anything more than a government propaganda network in years. Maybe it was better back then.
---
there are only 3 medium NA servers now
---
&gt;The WoW doc that was put out directly names Pardo for nearly every major decision of the game, even Kevin Jordan who people here claim had a hand in a ton of things from dual factions to class design constantly refers to Rob Pardo as the decision maker and never mentions Mark Kern.
---
Wow, great points man, other than the fact that no one was arguing that Mark was the main decision maker. Maybe you shoudl read a bit harder before posting lol
---
This will sort itself out when people see 8+ hour queues on launch day.
---
Why has no one in this sub ever heard of screen recording software?
---
I'm planning to play an Orc Hunter on a pvp server. What order should I get pets? I enjoy wpvp. I believe I'll want a cat with a fast attack speed for pvp. Do I need a different pet for pve and/or dungeons? Looking at petopia for fast attack speed I could get a Durotar Tiger. Or would it be worth trying to get The Rake? Are there other options?
---
I also saw a post about owls and it made a lot of sense, screech sounds great. As horde it looks like I would need to wait until around level 40 to get an owl though? Should I get a wolf before then to help when I'm in groups?
---
Thanks for the help
---
You know, those boars are hard to come by during server launch.
---
&gt;You cannot make a zone which is suited to both Dude #1 and Dude #2. It is mathematically impossible. It will be trivial to one or impossible to the other, or both.
---
You do not make the zone challenging for both. Just like ZG or DM was not challenging for people who cleared MC. The new zones basic content can be challenging for the non-raid player. The raiding player gets their challenge from the new raid instances within the zone. Both players get a challenge, and both have a reason to participate in the new content.
---
&gt;You cannot make drops which are an upgrade to Dude #1 and Dude #2.
---
You can, such as in enchantments, new skill ranks, new consumables, new food, new gathering/professions equipment, new mounts, new non-combat equipment, new stat increases... I've explained this already, but you couldn't read "buzzwords."
---
If you still cannot read buzzwords, let me give you a generic example. In Outland, if you finish a long quest chain, you gain access to an item that you consume for +X main stat for 2 hours. This is useful for both #1 and #2. This is useful for #1 because they want to min/max for their raid progression. This is useful for #2 because they can now begin to catch up in gear by clearing old raids in PUGs and can now do so with relatively more powerful characters than were required before the xpac.
---
&gt;You cannot make instances which are fun for Dude #1 and Dude #2.
---
You don't need to make every single piece of content for both people. You can have an expansion that includes fun stuff for each player and let them choose their path. This doesn't have to be a "theme park" MMO like BfA where every piece of content is doable by every player. I don't know why anyone would want that, and I think that's why we are interested in returning home to Classic.  Naxx and BWL were fun for #1. Strat and Scholo can be fun for #2. 
---
If you are still confused on my stance, let me know.
---
Not to be a sticker, but the US release is the 26th. It is a US server after all. Cool video though.
---
Must've just changed cause an hour ago it was 4.
---
*drops 2 T2 legs your fac can't use*
---
Yeah honestly that’s some brain damaged reasoning right there
---
Nice ill steal this
---
Van Queef would be preferable
---
I don't get it. You right click until they're dead or you only click once? Help pls
---
&gt;The expectation is that you report bugs, not exploit them.
---
This assumes everyone realize that a mob allied to your own faction being healable is actually a bug. Which is of course an absurd assumption to make.
---
Lets face it. You are just trashing for Internet point.
---
Time to look up all those brk videos again
---

Now why did you stay up all night to log on the server? You should rest well so you can stay up all night once you're playing.
---
not in vanilla iirc
---
Yeah priests, hunters, druids, and warlocks can level a little faster than them when they're being completely optimal. However, I'd say when everyone is playing like an average player that time difference evens out more. They definitely put warriors, rogues, and paladins to shame.
---
ill be skillingon Osrs
---
Don't worry, they will all go onto Stalagg and then everyone will be crying about that too.
---
First - It's Vanilla. Pretty much nothing is a fair fight.
---
Second - I think in total there were 5-6 APES on the beta and they weren't always playing together.
---
Third - It was level 30 and 40 PvP..............................
---
Fourth - In a lot, if not most BGs, the retailers had private server players in their premades as well.
---
Did he say otherwise?
---
My friend (priest) and I (warrior) got quite lucky with drops in the 40-49 level range. We were decked out in basically everything you could want from ZF, and on top of that I had the Executioner's Cleaver. 
---
We decided to take a break from leveling and hit the battlegrounds at around level 49 for a week or so. During this time, we met an amazing mage player doing the same thing and we absolutely dominated. 14 years later, not only do I still remember that mage's name (Duesofnine, are you out there, bro?!), but it's also still some of the most fun I've ever had in WoW.
---
Massive Crossroads raids. Every weekend damned near. Can't wait to do it all again.
---
Holy fuck dude learn to end a sentence and use commas.
---
Well I can't find anything on that, but I have found some other breakdowns on why he might not be someone I should be subbed to.  Do you have recommendations on other Classic WoW YouTubers or podcasts?
---
You're breathtaking!
---
Hahah I do have it but I’m on my laptop and I don’t have it on this computer, it’s a Mac and just recently downloaded WoW on it, SORRY

I wouldn't trust that brand at all and the CPU is ancient. Big red flags.
---
One time I was questing in the Swamps of Sorrow and I got killed by a dirty ganking female orc, but she /dance over me and lets just say I didnt release my spirit for a while.
---
Its honestly insane to me how much some seem to care about the SERVERS name. Its just so insanely irrevelant in actuality haha
---
Thanks. This is quite the predicament. I suspect that most people woll stay on Herod. Blizz is dreaming if they think they will even out the population.
---
Better include professions for that price.
---
It’s only killing blows, honorable kills, honor gained, right?  TBC I believe did have dmg and healing but I never played classic bgs
---
Tailoring/Enchanting for your initial wand. Then RFC for next, WC for next, BFD for next, so on and so forth. There are a few you can snag from quests but honestly none are worth the effort if they aren't directly in your path. Dungeon wands are what I generally use my entire leveling process unless I get a lucky drop or lucky AH find.
---
They literally look the same. That was my original point. It takes 2 minutes to look it up, there's collages already made.
---
Ah ok my fault. I thought you were asking why they were farming the worms.
---
Ooh running into IF that first time, hitting 3 FPS and falling into the pits.
---
My very first character was alliance, the first 60 I had was horde, but that memory sticks out like a sore thumb and is half the reason im making sure to have a dwarf alt this time around.
---
You grab the torches and I'll bring the pitchforks.
---
No
---
It's not adding up for me.  
---
Player population was growing at an exponential rate during vanilla WoW and only soared once BC rolled around, which was just as hardcore (if not more so) than vanilla. It continued to climb until towards the end of WotLK, where big fundamental design changes started to happen.  
---
And from that point on you can literally track the decline in player population with the increasing "casualization" (for lack of better word) in the game. The only time population was on a positive curve was brief spikes at expansion launches, then immediate and steady decline.  
---
And here we are just over a week until a Classic launch, generating more hype than any expansion has since WotLK.
---
that’s a cute guide, did your husband give it to you?
---
I think it’s just ignorance. Once one understands what you’re getting every hour of game play for a monthly price it starts to make sense. Server infrastructure and staff to support tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of customers is an ongoing cost.   It’s an MMORPG with thousands of players being able to play in a world together in real time. It’s not the MSN Gaming Zone allowing to launch multiplayer retail games with peers in a table.
---
Stay at 120%
---
The types with logical opinions aren't liked anywhere where people post online. Except by the people that do like them. 
---
Definitely did not contribute to this conversation at all, so I must have a good opinion. ;)
---
just install it and copy over everything. your settings should be saved in the WTF folder. back that up if you want.
---
tbf if they do the smart thing and roll out 1-2 new servers the day before launch it'll probably go over relatively quickly by comparison simply because you can't really compare people itching to play a new game and itching to play a character they've invested years in.
---
If the queues are long, there's going to be so, so many that will simply choose to roll on one of the newer servers for the time being and possibly stay permanently. That wasn't really an option in WoD since (as said) they had a established main already that they *had* to reach in order to play at all.
---
There was definitely an addon back in the day that did this. It would show all recipes the item was used in and you could filter out professions.
---
It might have been tradeskill master
---
Popular pvp moviemakers from vanilla times
---
This guy named father keto on YouTube has a great video about this. https://youtu.be/CCDj3XcIQAY
---
lmao yes they will...if you think MOST people will put up with those ridiculous queues 1 month down the line you’re mistaken
---
hate when I can't find the kitchen!
---
never heard of em sorry
---
Do wand reset melee swing or just cause a gcd?
---
Yeah I made the wetlands run, died like 4 times. Doesn't seem that this will save too much time, especially if you have to swim it. Also you get the loch modan flight path on the way.
---
I think the bigger picture is that it breaks the charm from the Succubus, so you can't seduce then Soul Fire.
---
IDK although I can imagine doing that would make melee really suck for Gnomes. Can you imagine playing a melee class where all your attacks are base-line -2 range? Gotta climb into everyone's butthole just to do attacks.
---
Great vid....thanks for posting.
---
Blizzard needs to create a server and allow those on Herod a day to transfer out so they can keep all of their names.  Then open it up to the public.
---
I love this post because of all the sweet ass Metal bands.  Gonna be blasting some Melodic Death when I play.
---
Can't we do a good old tar and feathering instead? Arming a rowdy crowd of locals is so expensive.
---
This was awesome. Brought me right back, wish you kept it going further... maybe add a few drunken dwarves :P
---
Seeing an Orc Shaman and his friend on top of the roof in Lakeshire in Redridge. I just got past the blacksmith area when I see this lightning bounce off a guard and drop two people in front of me. I was like, "OH SH*T WHAT WAS THAT?" I look up and see this Orc casting lightning bolts and it is bouncing off people. Anyone low enough level would just die instantly even if one bounced. Seeing this type of ganking day after day while leveling in Redridge really made me want to level a Horde character instead. Eventually I got tired and playing alliance around level 40 and rerolled to Horde.
---
So Im playing classic for the first time (first time getting into WoW, really) and I know Im gonna be rolling a hunter, is it stupid if i take skinning and engineering as my professions even if they dont work together? I just like the flavor of skinning and engineering character wise, but if its gonna gimp me ill just do something else.
---
Moth into flame
---
Pretty sure no and if they did exist they would only exist for those on massively overpopulated servers to underpopulated ones.
---
Curse of Elements is for the mages. That's why they're taken along.
---
- 1st semester CS student
---
jesus christ dude, its really just a game. he doesnt need to "indicate remorse" for the "serious mistake" of misunderstanding the support for classic. go outside holy fuck
---
I just spotted this and I'm blown away.
---
Thanks so much to the OP and all the kind comments here, you're all the reason that I love this community and you are the reason why the show has been able to continue existing.  This is really, really touching.
---
I can't wait to play with as many of you as possible, and you all make the time put into the show worth it.
---
Our countdown is almost finished :)

---
Blizzard logic at its finest.
---
I grabbed that name during the last stress test, but alas someone else snagged it on Herod during the character reservations. Hopefully they will continue his grand tradition.
---
*M'lady's in Whitemane*
---
Cool guy alert, no fun allowed
---
I feel like 99% of the people that plan this hardcore are the slowest levelers, the worst players, and the least likely to actually stick around.
---
extremely helpful for when you need to cook on the go and aren't close by a city!!
---
He has indicated remorse. Nano said that he’s one of the most sincere guys at blizzard about classic wow. He really wants it too and he feels bad about what he said. 
---
People make mistakes.
---
Well, yeah you get the extra cast range, but unless your enemies are using something that turns them into Tauren, you're only getting +2.5 yards on your damaging spells. It doesn't affect Chain Lightning jump range if that's what you're referring to.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0eboZG0xdrZxMgochoo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0eboZG0xdrZxMgochoo)   Fixed it for you.
---
Good move. Herod is going to have hour or more queue for more than week. People gonna get so mad.
---
Correct, I won't do more zones than whats listed and probably even less.
---
I also prepared a trio; me + warrior + mage.  We'll meet in Durotar.
---
If I talk wow to any of my friends it sure comes across as ramblings as well!
---
We have so much information in our heads from theorycrafting, hundreds of hours of playtime, and of course our opinions as well!
---
We're simply enthusiasts and I'm sure most of us can relate to talking/rambling about this passion of ours for hours.  So I definitely relate to and enjoy your 'ramblings' friend.  Though I wouldn't call your discourse such!
---
WoD was pretty bad with the Garrison crashes.
---
Ratchet is optional but surely can help 15-18
---
I’m aware of that but I’m sure 1000s won’t realize this
---
Some of the bass notes are off but that’s fucking sick
---
Only virgin chad wannabes are playing on Herod.
---
Imma be toxic
---
You can just transfer later...
---
tailor- grind out some mats, make items, enchanter- DE them

make wand

youll be fine an hour in

Plus The has garrisons and class halls. A bunch of stuff to pull people away from big cities.

For the horde

You can come to Thalnos and help us squash all these rumors about us :) We're the bestest and friendliest discord and we're gonna be the bestest and friendliest realm!
---
It would have been so great if he had a soulstone on him, rezed, and started wailing on them again.
---
i say there's no general (ie standard) experience because the experience differs due to factors i listed
---
for example the STVietnam experience that many are nostalgic for would be different for those who start classic at launch (everyone around the same level, trying to level) vs when naxx is out (bored lvl 60s ganking noobs). your server could have an angwe that makes your experience in stv terrible or you could have fun skirmishes against equally leveled players. or maybe you're doing the ganking? maybe you level in desolace instead. the standard vanilla experience is difficult to define
---
Yes, as alliance warrior you either go human for pve or gnome for PvP.
---
So once again, that doesn't matter for layering? And you said "for as long as layering exists". That means without layering it will be "better", yet the population will be huge.
---
It won’t. I’ll eat my left shoe if I’m wrong
---
I'll say grats still just not ding :/
---
See now it's not weird at all. That makes perfect sense. Sounds like you guys will be ready to wreck some people in wPvP with wf + hardiness + blood fury
---
Gnome for that sweet escape artist.
---
Hide of the Wild is a big item they are used for -- BiS cape for healers until BWL/AQ40
---
Grob gang is gonna fuck newbies up! _RP style_

I never played rogue until beta, and I put in 20 days played. That fucking racial was the bane of my existence.
---
Remember, you can't spell "slaughter" without "laughter"!
---
When you say Pantheon, the first thought I normally have is gods. These gods usually are associated with lightning. Dwarves were made from gods. All I’m saying is that it may have ties to their ancestry.
---
A lot of people have no easy way of typing that ü in, that's the main problem.
---
&gt; Azeroth auto pilot
---
Is really bad atm. Might improve before release.
---
remember 50% of player base has yet to order wow subscription so they are not accounted on population. It will get a lot worse on launch day.
---
The lightning definitely represents their connection to the titans. Read up on Aman'Thul.
---
Just keep the happiness train chugging along, friend.
---
Take that shit into the game, shower people with loveliness.
---
How is it more important for priests? Spirit tap pretty much solves mana problems while leveling doesnt it?
---
I played on a low pop server and had a blast on it back in Vanilla. You got to learn every major guild and player on the realm.
---
I expect the people who haven't subbed will jump on Herod see a 10hr queue and quickly decide to roll elsewhere.
---
The funniest part is we can't even go play retail while we wait in queue.
---
I just think of them as tall hobbits with jamaican accents.
---
Is there a way to have this kind of list in with Windows Explorer or alternative?
---
Engineering has traditionally been a very expensive profession. Even with mining to supply it with ore/bars. If you're going to get skinning then get leather working or another gathering profession.
---
without layering you get many realms each with as many players as were in vanilla.  it doesn't matter if the population is huge, a realm can only hold so many players.
---
with layers, that cap is much higher, many vanilla realms worth of players all together, like retail, too many people to form a community.
---
"Sesame street" as a new meaning nowadays

She's got shit to do, dude. Those orcs don't feed themselves.
---
Oh shit, for whatever reason this reminded me of the argent dawn tabard https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=2079/tabard-of-the-protector from the pre-launch event for TBC. I guess it probably won't be in classic, but I was always sad the account I got it on wasn't the one I went forward with and couldn't get it again. :(  Maybe if they do end up doing a TBC classic they'll do the launch event again.
---
Good god...this sub is already bitching sooo much about things that haven't happened yet.
---
Real talk Lokth, your beard is BREATHTAKING!
---
Pick what you LIKE. You'll be looking at it for HOURS on end anyway.
---
I am definitely going to be casual. I’m encouraged that there is no time limit. As in I will have plenty of time to explore all the content without having to worry about a looming xpac.
---
He could also be from Austria the non kangaroo version of Australia
---
Wonder how the blizzard artist of the tier set feels after having created the best armor set of any released in 15 years.
---
Shit sandwich
---
My guild of 20 have all switched to Stalagg.
---
Herod sounded way too hardcore for us, so we switched pretty fast.
---
Baby gnome do do dodo dodo
---
Pretty sure yes because blizzard loves money
---
Amen
---
I AM an adult!
---
I always do it this way for the extra RP immersion
---
This is if you ever get one to drop, which can be veeeeeerryy frustrating
---
This is what a guy I met during stress test did. He gave me the plans for the copper chain vest with the stipulation that I make him daggers once I was leveled enough. He fed me leather for weapons too which was nice.
---
Vanilla wow pre BGs was an awesome pvp game. 
---
That's the true experience for me.  Fighting over quest areas and nodes.  Having rivals who you always seem to run into.  Hunting other players.  Getting jumped and turning the tables. Epic chases (and attempts at running away).
---
That's the stuff that really makes leveling memorable.  For me! Maybe not everyone, but that's the true wow experience for me.
---
The majority will not be BfA players dude, stop it.
---
Sorry for trying to have a little fun guys! Yall must be going on the streamer server joining “Asmond dick riders” 😂
---
Orc has stun resist and increased pet damage
---
I thought that was just a damage meter. I didn't see anywhere to display threat.
---
If you take total stun duration on mobs from you 1-60 warrior has like 100x the stun duration compared to rogues
---
Stay up until launch, jump in the queue, then go to bed. Wake up and play for maximum time usage.
---
WoW was developed by EQ players who wanted to make a better EQ.
---
Cool, thanks! Follow up question, follow up question, is there a "best" pet for hunters? Or can I use pretty much whatever is coolest to me?
---
Is the name that important?  There are 1000 names i would use on any other server before i tried to play on any popular streamer server at launch.
---
Hopefully not because High =/= full, once Gehennas is full then we'll see one hopefully.
---
Sorry I don't think anyone is bringing illidan to his knees this time around.
---
If you have a group of 5 that are good, coordinated, on each other's schedules, and dedicated, then it will probably be faster. Finding a dungeon griup and running a dungeon will not be very efficient.
---
I see paid character transfers, paid name change, paid gender/looks change an absolute possibility.  Maybe it will be a 'feature' in phase 2 or 3.
---
Just.. no. I'm sure i'm not the only one who appreciates the original models. Also, you're asking the people who do the coding to add more stuff to their 'to do' list. There are bound to be some actual gameplay issues and such first few weeks, i'd kinda prefer they work on those.
---
I’m sorry, art designers did not think a decade into the future and sprinkle minor spoilers of dwarves heritage into their race icon. The studio that made World of Warcraft tried to make a game based of the Lore of Warhammer, Warhammer said no, and they developed from their own ideas instead using the same general mythology. They did not have a decade plot in mind, as they definitely didn’t expect the IP to be so incredibly successfully.
---
It’s nice that new expansions can tie things together, but they absolutely were not initially the intent
---
Names are important to other people, other people who paid money to sub ahead of time in order to reserve them. Blizz screwed that up by botching the release of Stalagg. Releasing another pvp server, even though Stalagg is not high yet, will relieve the pressure off of the Herod crew.
---
Had to buy water from innkeeper because conjured was so bad lol.
---
I chose herod just because of the name but now me and my friends have our names so it’s too late
---
I do the same except my ocd makes me download everything as pdfs in case the links break 😓
---
Jeez dude that's a lot of categories
---
Cringe
---
Though I feel the same way you do, not caring.  I disagree about it being insane.   Realm name certainly resonates with some as their community similar to how a guild name may or may not resonate.
---
I server hopped so none of them really mattered to me and that feeling sticks with me.  But the loyalists want to pick one server and live there for the next 3 years.  It's nice to them if you can say the name of your server, guild, and character with pride I think.
---
I join PvP server to PvP
---
Night elf faction then, dirty human faction now :(
---
I'll try and go classic UI for a while and see how I do
---
Back in vanilla I asked in general chat why people were saying ding when the sound of leveling up was more of a woosh. I was told it was the sound of leveling in DAoC. Am I remembering correctly? Can anyone confirm?
---
I’d be happy to be proven wrong. Here is the thing, there are numerous streamers from Method now. If any of them were in the guild back then and you can show me clip of them acknowledging the veracity of this screen, I’ll take the L. 
---
For now, none of them were able to confirm and/or admitted they weren’t in the guild back then.
---
don't think they've said anything about transfers, so not really no.
---
How does this work with deadzone if you are a tauren hunter
---
Continuously spam click. It’ll keep you more alert and have faster responses. Subscribe for more shittywowtips
---
It keeps you on your toes and world pvp can be very fun at times. Maybe some of the most fun you will have in the game comes in certain world pvp situations.
---
Hey, doesn't it like, not matter if you lifetap when you are about to take aggro VS anywhere else on the timeline? Cause if you tap earlier, it just takes longer to get to the point of taking aggro, right? Am I missing something here?
---
you will literally wait 10min max
---
"Only 2-3 hours per day" lol
---
To Gank. To World PvP
---
I’ve just never had fun doing it lol maybe I didn’t play enough but just didn’t seem right for me
---
Half of it? You mean all of it. If Herod stays the same it'll be a multi hour queue
---
I like to kill people to cover up my insecurities in real life
---
Stalagg is Schrodinger's server. Both too low population and too high to be able to reserve any names.
---
&gt;  How can I keep the mood elevated and nip forming toxicity in the bud come the 27th?               
---
             
---
The best thing you can do is just not stoop to their level, I know this sounds like old-timey mom advice but most toxic players only feel satisfied when people respond to them, the best thing to do is put them on ignore and keep a notepad of names and what they did, I always used check it before heading to a dungeon and if one of them was on my list I would simply let the group know            
---
          
---
"Hey guys I know I signed up to heal/tank/DPS but XXX is an asshole/ninja looter, you guys can replace me but I don't want to do runs with people like XXX"            
---
90% of the time they kick XXX, sometimes they're friends with XXX and they kick me but 100% of the time I'm happy with the people I choose to play with.
---
Yeh people were testing it out on the beta. 
---
There are a number of drawbacks to this method; such as having 5 people constantly online and ready to go within the correct level ranges, not wiping excessively etc, downtime if people need to leave etc is what makes this method painful
---
An auto shot timer really helps that level range.
---
You nailed it.  Everything in an mmo is bought with time.  Losing gear or exp just means lost time.  Corpse run is lost time.  It's all the same
---
I played on a low pop server in Vanilla and the world was much more alive than this Retail trash.
---
A lot of people are actually going Stalaag now, I know of a bunch of Herod guilds that switched. I hope it doesn’t have a queue too...
---
The opposing faction seems a lot deadlier and impactful and the world pvp can be lots of fun. It's more immersive and dangerous.
---
Yes, but the dungeon sets (tier 0) is available at launch.
---
Ahahahahahahshahahshsgshshshshshshdiftijf8rjtori9fh48e
---
World PvP. Sense of danger around every corner. World PvP.
---
the few times I tried I was always on the receiving end lmao
---
I remember the first time I entered a "contested area" (ashenvale) and literally stealthed the whole way to the first village because I thought the other team would be everywhere. It took like 45 minutes and I realized there werent as many other players as I thought
---
Ah, Maydie.
---
For starters you need to play a dwarf paladin.
---
I'm on a PVE server so the only rube here is you.
---
I wish they would add heritage armor into classic. How awesome would it be for the world pvp fights to have entire armies in that gear.
---
This is probably the worst video i have ever seen. Half of it is him running around AV with 5 fps. He probably thought this was so epic too LOL
---
Taz'Dingo! Priest all da way mon!
---
People who want a more challenging experience with another element to gameplay.
---
now i feel like i have to roll a warlock instead of a hunter.
---
Hahaha. I've been starting the odd lowbie char and playing it as well. I just really don't like my level 100 chars and their class talents or how the gameplay is in retail. I can't play them, but i'll mess around with just a lowbie character for a few hours while we wait for classic.
---
There were server transfers in vanilla so yes really yes
---
I did it during the name reservation launch and my server list didn't turn green. I had to relog. Would not recommend.
---
Also when you resist the warriors charge stun and can run out of range.
---
just play a cloth class and then you can wear a dress without having to come up with excuses
---
Cause it feels strange seeing an opposite faction character and not being able to attack him/her. Feels less immersive
---
Gotta plan. Gotta be smart. Gotta be patient.
---
Yep, definitely not me! lol
---
I played in a Medium population (Shadowmoon-US) and it was fine specially because it had a good faction balance AFAIK. There were always some people in every zone not counting a good bunch in the main hubs like capitals, goldshire/crossroads and goblin cities.
---
and keyboard turns.
---
True it can be a nuisance but at the same time world PVP was one of the most awesome parts of Vanilla and TBC. Plus it brings people together cause if you’re getting ganked as a low level you call in a 60 guild mate or two to help. Then the enemy player might start getting corpse camped so he calls friends in.
---
i just barely remember what that last line is referencing.  
---
greentext ye?
---
Exactly man. I'm hoping it cause a game design renaissance within the modern team.
---
Auto shot timer is too good not to use. The dps a hunter can put out if they weave shots in correctly is nuts
---
Please give me more tips how should I have my fun in the game.
---
I guess that kinda is my argument. Players on Herod are hesitant to switch because they are afraid that they arent going to get the names that they subbed early for. Blizz botched the release of Stalagg by only giving a 2 hour heads up before they opened it. People paid money to reserve the names and Blizz is basically dangling that over their heads.
---
Those who can, do. Those who can't do, teach.
---
She's busy man.
---
They said they would be open to adding them since they had them in vanilla.
---
Another issue with DKP is point hoarding, which slows the guilds progression by virtue of players passing up upgrades in favor of holding out for bigger ticket items.
---
Transfer existed in vanilla, I'm pretty sure of it. But you could only transfer PvP-PvP etc.
---
Awesome! Where will you be uploading it?
---
We will see how much names matter when herod is fucked in queue hell.
---
Having negative percentages is... weird as fuck... Turns out what I thought was the wrong formula was the right formula all along and I didn't think to test it even in a private client.  I just did this and it works out.  What I put in the video IS the lvl 60+ formula, the levels 1-59 formula is:
---
DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 \* AttackLevel)
---
Thank you so much for pointing this out, I'm going to try to fix this in the video.
---
&gt;I really want to play a warlock, but
---
Play a warlock. That's all there is to it.
---
Sorry, but Grobbulus  has already claimed these noble knuckles of mine. But I'll gladly take a Discord invite!
---
Don't pick a server just for a better launch. That's one day of delay versus potentially years of playing on that server.
---
Arrogant haste, i'm dyin here lol.
---
No Whirlwind Axe for Warrior? Isn't that the best 2h weapon 30+ for a while?
---
In battlegrounds if you suspect a player is afk, please use /afk report &lt;name&gt;
---
I enjoyed my time there thb, Italians are cool.
---
Nice
---
Stalagg is going to be packed on release day also. I’ll be moving to Stalagg also, but every server will have queues.
---
let me first start off by saying i hate pvp. I would much rather do some pve content with 39 of the closest friends. that being said i only roll on pvp servers.
---
this is a world where the alliance and horde are on the brink of war. there isnt a big bad that they have to join up against. so i guess it adds to the immersion your always keeping an eye out for a filthy orc that might try to attack you.
---
&gt;:C
---
B I G  M A D
---
That's why they have PVE servers.
---
I don't have a ton of time to say so I'll be way behind everyone else.  I have a feeling that some exuberant 60s with nothing else to do are going to make my life a hell :/
---
Confirmed. Solomon family were all from Durotar
---
Evening out the populations is in the best interest of everyone, good on you. The more headroom the servers have come launch day, the more likely people are able to play with their friends.
---
I never got the opportunity to raid in vanilla or TBC so this is still mostly going to be new to me! But honestly wish i didn't do beta either cause every game I play right now just doesn't feel nearly as fun now that I know classic is around the corner....
---
I answer this question on the FAQ section of my Mage Google Doc in the Info tab, 8th question.

---
I'm not a huge pvper myself, but there being actual enemies out to get you, allies to help you is a great thing and creates some of the best memories and scenarios in world of warcraft. You don't have to be a pvper in order to enjoy a pvp server.
---
No but if would have planned it better they could have shuffled resources and made it possible. Even if it meant releasing WoW Classic a little later.

I'm ready.
---
Only thing missing is someone ganking my ass.
---
Haha remember when maydie got his shit rekt by mute, naked with a worn dagger.
---
"but but but that was his cousin playing"
---
Yeah yeah sure sure, that makes him an account sharing loser. Explains how he got Grand Marshal at least.
---
Your chance of pulling aggro is much higher in the first quarter of any fight than at any later point. It’s entirely possible you’ll have to life tap even when you have 85% mana. One things for sure - you never wait and do nothing. Life tap fills those voids. You also want to avoid ever popping a lip and wasting your global  potion CD - that should be for your mana pot, which you time precisely after your first life tap at 0% mana to utilize that 0.5 second space before you can cast your next shadow bolt.
---
It's a really great podcast. Thanks Josh!
---
&gt;I see it as being a nuisance and getting ganked while leveling
---
It is, that's why you make sure you're the one ganking.
---
As someone who spends most of their day in full PPE I love that I can just go to his podcast and let it run for the whole day not run out of quality stuff to listen to. I've been following the show since about episode 5 or 6 and ever since he switched to one episode a week (sorely needed for his sustainability and sanity) I find myself just a little bit happier on Wednesday when I know I'm going to have a morning of fresh content.   
---
Josh, you fucking rule.
---
The only time I remember being involved in PVP was that area in Hellfire back in the BC days. I remember I couldn’t get anyone to help me claim the last tower and I had people rush to my aid and I felt like a boss lol
---
my memory is hazy but yes, if you're trying to min-max endgame, there are certain pets that have faster attack speed than the others, but you can worry about that when you hit 60
---
for leveling i would absolutely just go for the pets you think are coolest, like rare spawns and unique appearances, that's like half the fun of hunters
---
check out this website, it was huge back then and now for hunter pets https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
I predict a lot of people are going to sub the weekend before launch, and blizzard will have to spin up new servers
---
Hardiness helps you with rogues. Taurens help you with awesomeness. It's a steep trade, but beef is just better than pork.
---
Daum, today's coolest post!
---
Meanwhile the recently opened Stalagg server meant to take heat off Herod is still only at medium. Americans are so selfish and backwards compared to their European counterparts, IMO.
---
Yeah totally agreed. It’s already at medium pop and there are still thousands still yet to subscribe.
---
First character was a human mage (since early wrath not vanilla though), this time I'm going orc hunter/undead warloc. I want a new experience.
---
I won't have any interface addons for the foreseeable future. Will be playing pretty casually due to uni, but I may consider it on a max level toon. I cbf re-configuring the ui every time i want to try a new class 😂.
---
That and mages at a certain point can just poly you and fuck off.
---
RPGs having floating arrows directing you to every objective streamlines the experience and removes any sense of thought or exploration, if that's not what you're playing an RPG for then you do you.
---
Oh I know, I just see PVP servers filling up and wondering what I’m missing lol
---
You can trace the decline to when Activition took over.  The design focus immediately shifted.  Even on launch day in Wotlk, I remember 2-manning a 5 person quest, something that would have been just about impossible in TBC.
---
Casualization is a misguided effort to tap into a larger customer base.  I think it can work in certain genres of game.  But in a MMORPG that is built on non-mainstream concepts like immersion, RPG, community etc, casualization just doesn't fit.
---
Remote Desktop comes pre-installend on Windows.
---
I was just giving that website a look 😂 im particularly interested in the white gorilla because he looks like a yeti and thats dope
---
Too busy socializing, that's very important you know. ;) hehe
---
My guild and I have already left Herod. But yes, they did create this mess by giving no heads up when they released Stalagg. It was a 2hour notice, would have been much better if they released it the next day. They didn't allow time for guilds to communicate with each other on whether to move or not.
---
Having to care about where your going, what you're doing   retail you just follow the yellow dots and suddenly your 3x the level needed for the area.  You used to have to fucking read.  You had to search.  You had to fight.
---
You can open more windows and monitor duf things
---
Ion said that at launch, they’ll be no shop features. But later on, IF the community want name changes, server transfers, faction changes, etc, then they’ll add that.
---
I played vanilla dethecus when angwe was around. About the only notable thing from that servers history...
---
It was incredible, I think especially as the 14 year old kid I was. All the units and buildings and people that you had only really seen from that top down view were now all part of the works you could journey through. I'll never forget making a human and seeing footmen and the barracks building and being awestruck.
---
Fair point!
---
It's respectively, not respectfully, but good guide all the same, thanks for the quick run down of what to look out for in phase 1 :)
---
Yeah female dwarves should too
---
During beta I said ding every level....
---
That's YouTube chat, no?
---
and I suppose you do right
---
IIRC this never took you out of combat nor removed aggro if it did on Pservers then that was a pserver thing. it didn’t do that in vanilla. and the not seeing thing shouldn’t be active bcuz that wasn’t until BC.
---
Cannot unsee.
---
A While ago I found This gem, which puts it around Mid 2006 which infact was BEFORE Tbc. I couldnt believe it myself cuz back in Vanilla I didnt know about it haha

World PvP still broke out all over the place on my classic PvE server. All it takes is one guy to flag and set off a chain reaction. Then you end up in a battle that can last hours. Good times.
---
Arise, my champion!
---
Man your videos have been great enjoyment for me, thanks for all you do.
---
It's usually worth buying linen cloth from players around Brill, crafting the first uncommon robe available with tailoring, and then disenchanting it for materials which can be used to craft [Lesser Magic Wands \(LMW\)](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11287/lesser-magic-wand) that you can sell to other players for more than what you paid for the clothes.
---
Not only it will provide some extra silver to you, but you will also be able to level your enchanting skill to 70 which is when [Greater Magic Wands \(LMW\)](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11288/greater-magic-wand) become available. Once you craft it you can simply drop enchanting and tailoring for other professions if you want.
---
If you can't be bothered with all that you can simply farm a bit of silver or cloth and trade with another player for a LMW which will be enough to get you going through the quests in Brill and early Silverpine Forest. In that area you can do the Beren's Peril quest (killing some level 20 undead NPCs) for a wand that is comparable to a GMW, although the latter can be acquired much earlier.
---
The next step would be running Blackfathom Depths dungeon and completing [Blackfathom Villainy](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=6561/blackfathom-villainy) quest for [Gravestone Scepter](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7001/gravestone-scepter). From there you can just check the AH or continue finding quests that reward players with decent wands.
---
In what world is typing 'ding' followed up by people trying 'gz' for no reason other than not to be rude fun ?
---
If you've got nothing tying you down to Herod, then definitely go somewhere else.
---
Great video. It's been a while.
---
If you still have the account credentials you can transfer the character you have it on over to another account.
---
Damn I'm sorry to hear that. I was thinking of buying BFA for Nazjatar since, (like you) the Naga are fascinating to me. 
---
Can't say I'm surprised though. They've fucked up almost every single cool thing from TFT except for Arthas himself.
---
Kael'Thas? He's crazy, go kill him. 
---
Lady Vasj? Crazy, go kill him. 
---
Anub'Arak? Kill him. 
---
The Draenai? Completely rewritten. 
---
Illidan? Crazy, go kill him. (Sounds like they redeemed him in Legion which is nice). 
---
Sylvanas? Going crazy. 
---
So let me guess, all you learn in Nazjatar is that Azshara has gone crazy and tyranical and you need to go kill her?
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccodex
---
This is Pfquest addon (not the entire pfUI) If they get the entire port working this will be the best questing addon. (It works a lot like AAP in showing where quest items are, but it also displays a selected range of quests on your map.. so you can see all available quest to you, or if you remove the level range limiter everywhere. It also includes database with drop info and so on so you know which mobs have what drop rates.)
---
We will see how this works out... if someone ported the rest of pf its for sure what i would use.
---
Getting lost and struggling is part of the experience you might not be  used to, but rather than getting a bunch of addons and guides to solve every minor problem try your best to solve it yourself! You'll have a blast.
---
I was excepting it to be high by now from all the posts and such but still sitting at medium.
---
No one is playing with that screen resolution on a pserver, Sherlock.
---
Josh Corbett’s podcast, Countdown to Classic, is the best thing to happen to the WoW community since the announcement of WoW Classic!
---
It gives another aspect to the game after content clear in pve
---
Because PVP is what makes Classic fun.
---
I'm sure it'll still be full 3 months from now as well. /s
---
Is there a source on faction stats?
---
It's more real.  How can u really learn to hate the horse if they're not ganking you?  And those rare moments when you manage to gank them back.  Those were real.  And fucking fun.
---
Why would u want to play either side if there's no real battle between them?  What does it matter, then?
---
Your podcast, Countdown to Classic, is the best thing to happen to the WoW community since the announcement of WoW Classic!
---
Please give my Google Document a try, I've made extensive researches over the past year so I could make the best pre raid and raid bis lists for every raid and phase, also contains more useful lists.    
---
twitch viewer &amp; streamer throw around zoomer &amp; boomer. Unlike boomer in the sense of generation they basically use it for everyone who they think is even remotely old, so basically everyone over 30. For zoomer I'm not sure if they even have some sort of definition for that, but you can imagine it's somewhat the same as millenials, basically everyone born after 2000 I guess, not entirely sure but at least that's the impression I got.
---
doesn't mean it's guaranteed to be in when the time comes and servers start dying though. Plus why tf would I want to waste 32$ for any characters I find relevant like main / alt, and then be in a position of doubting making other twinks and setting up on a server.       
---
Whereas I can spend 0 extra $, setup on herod with any alts, twinks and whatever I care about and not worry about that at all in the future apart from dealing with queues
---
will shadowmeld be any good in pvp situation?
---
We don't know the amount of people that havnt subbed yet, its could be more or less than 50%. But yes, more people are coming regardless and there is only 1 server open for them to funnel into and I don' think that is fair to do to people who are paying them money to reserve names before launch.
---
PC gaming was a thing literally decades before PS1 existed lmao
---
Nice!! I was actually looking for this thread!!  
---
I got to plan around my Hunter i will soon play, but i had a few questions:  
---
First, so far i've narrowed all the pieces i'm looking to hunt for, and so far i've come up with this: [https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/hunter/orc/AjwOUAAyAFBfBVUQAFEwUf8ACmaBNFw8KgI8MwMyf4Utzk48Bla\_hzrWPCqINFo2Qokzm04oijrXYfgLMyoMRTENLicONo2PNBw2OpA0OFz4kTQ4XPiSMWswrA](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/hunter/orc/AjwOUAAyAFBfBVUQAFEwUf8ACmaBNFw8KgI8MwMyf4Utzk48Bla_hzrWPCqINFo2Qokzm04oijrXYfgLMyoMRTENLicONo2PNBw2OpA0OFz4kTQ4XPiSMWswrA)   
---
Is this correct or should i change anything? I don't think i will be spending on a pair of Heartseekers if i can hit Rivendare constantly for his daggers.   
---
Now an actual spec question: Is it really worth taking the pet damage passives over the survival 3% damage + 3% crit damage talents as a Marksman Hunter? I'm going to play an Orc, but even then, if my memory isn't fuzzy, Pets are a deathfest on Molten Core and similar raids because of the lack of the Evasion talent that reduced AoE damage taken. So isn't it just better to reliably spend points on increasing the actual Hunter's damage?   
---
Thanks in advance for your attention guys! Surprisingly, i'm an old Vet at the class, but yet i feel like a kid who hasn't touched WoW yet again!
---
imagine not playing as female, everyone will think you're a noob! (especially you nelf males)
---
But, but.... i loved ret pally.... :(
---
While I cast Frost Shock!!!
---
that awful dispel/cleanse cool down is new? it’s one of the worst changes i have experienced trying out bag while waiting for classic :(
---
And 1.12 is what we asked for and 1.12 is what we're getting. I fail to see your point.
---
TIL Chromie is a dragon.
---
killing other people. its great fun
---
I like the RP aspect of seeing a Horde and killing it or me getting seen by a Horde and killed. Seeing an enemy and not being able/having to do something about it seems stupid to me. That being said, sometimes I wave to the Horde and the Horde waves to me. This is also good for RP but the added potential danger is what makes it thrilling.
---
Because phase one of release won't have battlegrounds. The world needs a little bit of danger to feel alive and the lore only makes sense to me if you can attack the opposite faction.
---
To me "hardcore vs casual" is over simplifying.  Its really a question of "How much do you want to login to Azeroth?"
---
Modern WoW is very technically precise.  It has "something for everyone", and every class is viable, and the world is huge and refined and filled with useful tools.  But it just has no soul.  It sounds great on paper, but its not a world that you're excited to log in to.
---
Classic is the opposite, messy, chaotic and unbalanced, but full of soul and authenticity.
---
I used to like to help the other faction by polying them when they were low on health and then I'd melee them once they were full. Its like a super fast heal with a low mana cost. Almost always resulted in them attacking me so I end up having to kill them :(. 
---
I guess having a priest main and a mage alt leaves me with bad tendencies for a pvp server
---
Straight up.
---
Pretty shit compared to aoe. You can aoe 8 guys down and then drink, or you can take down two single target and still have to drink. Youre pretty much drinking after every mob if you dont use wand, especially early on.
---
Yup, going to the beach. It'll still be there when I get back. : P
---
Well, to answer your question: I’ve never had decent gear, I know I can’t kill them alone and so it’s a lot leas fun when you’re being killed and can’t do shit lol
---
Lol there’s no top damage in battlegrounds in vanilla. Maybe kills. But literally nobody will ever care who’s got the most killing blows cause it means nothing to get the last hit. 
---
The only thing that matters is winning the damn AV and being a good contribution to your team. Imo that’s FAR more important than any damage meter. And trust me, top players don’t care if your damage is at the top. Anyone can get top damage.
---
Cooking or other professions in batches. If there's a way you can buy mats for less than the product will sell for (especially if its to a vendor) then that's the best option.
---
Everything else for the most part is otherwise too distracting
---
Ok whatever man. Flag carrier is a really important role in WSG and they are the best at it. I acknowledged that they’re least suited to AB. They’re generally quite playable in any BG and excel at some things. I don’t know why you need to be so contrarian when we essentially agree but fine.
---
Unless your leveling pretty late don’t think your going to find anyone at lvl 245 enchanting for boot speed
---
Holy fuck that subreddit was awful.
---
I swear 90% of the people on there were smooth brained NEETs that had zero conception of how anything works
---
Don't forget...there's a secret keyboard combination that gives you 25g every time you press it. Press Alt+F4 to enable the secret gold combo. Next time you log in you'll have 25 extra gold!
---
Hunters mark gets removed with vanish
---
as others have said, its down to getting a good group together.
---
if you're leveling on live these days, its easy enough to just queue and keep questing. but if you have to go to the city and find a group, that is time you are not leveling.
---
Killing people right at the end of their robot chicken escorts!
---
All servers are gonna be full on lanuch day. Everyone getting a wait on herod will just hope onto stalagg and than stalagg will be full
---
Because he said “only”
---
Basically the equivalent of an 18 year old driving around in a mercedes
---
do you even payo?
---
Even top guilds have 3 rogues on trap duty. Casual guilds will need at least 5.
---
Lol no I bought the current full edition in my desperation to join. I started w trying to buy just a subscription but it didn’t let me / the transaction failed. They got me!
---
All I remember about WotLK is Str gem stacked 60-69 25k Howling Blast AoE crits 1 shotting the entire opposed factions AV queue.
---
Getting ganked is a minor nusense while leveling. I don't see what people are afraid of.
---
If your getting camped go to a different zone and level there.
---
You'll be fine. Lots of people will be leveling slowly and/or making alts.
---
There will be guilds and things established, and the population will have settled a bit
---
For anyone wondering the girl at 3:40 should be Riley Reid
---
Love the title lol
---
Priest. Mind Control. Hide on boat in booty bay and when opposing faction boards, wait till you’re out at sea and MC them into the water before instance shift. Long swim back.
---
pfQuest and UI where the best addons ever made for any client before WoD. 
---
They work so good.  It literally allows you to pick where you want to go next to quest and level you just look around the world for available quest and head that way. 
---
Also AAP uses a similar system but its mob points for quest are awesome and even provide drop rates.
---
Then play w3
---
In my case i never take a day off for games so nah! Ill be playing maybe from work or after midnight
---
Creating the poisons for dps and pvp is quite easy. Most of the stuff you need can be bought from vendors. There are a couple herbs, I believe blindweed is one, that are needed for certain abilities. 
---
Rogue is easily one of the most fun classes in vanilla. You get stealth which makes you darn near invisible to enemies. If you get to close, they will aggro and break you out of stealth and put you in combat. You do get an ability called vanish. Requires vanishing power to use. 5 minute cooldown. Removes you from combat and puts you back into stealth. Also has a cool smokey animation like a ninja tossing a smoke bomb and disappearing. 
---
Dang. I've been on the fence on what I'm going to main and now you've made me decide on rogue lol.
---
You don't need to go to the city right? Pretty sure LFG chat works everywhere.
---
Warlock - summon your strongest demon and watch it go bezerk on quest givers.
---
Idk if it's the exact same, but I will be rolling on an RPPvP server because it adds in an extra element to the RP. Now granted I'm god awful at PvP because I don't look up guides or use macros for no other reason other than I'm a stubborn idiot, but there's something way more fun about RPing fighting the alliance while ACTUALLY fighting the alliance. It encourages great roleplay through guild rivalries, but also in OOC it promotes a sense of community since, obviously, you can't exactly talk to someone on the opposite faction without whispering them and working together.
---
An expected message from an individual who knows zero about server scaling
---
Instead of the justice trinket might wana try shooting for this. Quest reward so its easier and better
---
Trinket: Rune of the Guard Captain - quest "Job Opening: Guard Captain of Revantusk Village" (Hinterlands)
---
They're obviously never top tier dps, but they caught up a bit in Naxx, didn't they?
---
Do this as Horde in Menethil Harbour, because the boat to Darkshore goes far into into Fatigue to kill someone before they can swim back.
---
The Theramore boat to Menethil is the same.
---
So am I.
---
You mean a needed spirit res wasting gold and a debuff because the water keeps killing you out that deep you sick bastard
---
No u
---
Wowhead doesn't know anything the rest of us don't know. They're speculating on things like this, same as us. Nobody knows for sure if hinterlands quests will be in phase 1 or not.
---
World PvP is fun! I like the potential of having to battle for a leveling spot or simply to display dominance. It's thrilling.
---
Soo question how far we going back as a former shaman like 2hand windfury can proc off of itself again? Or duel wield 2 second crap?
---
Bonus points - Find low levels that don't know what warlocks do and ask them if they want to help you summon someone.
---
Ritual of Doom! Fun for all ages!
---
You're really offended by people not liking your suggestion LOL
---
Sorry for the triple post but add me on bnet if you want. Dirtyape#1271
---
Feel free to ask me anything about the game. I've been playing since 2005 with only having taken a break once during that 15 year span.
---
If its not too late, push it back a week.
---
This guy corpse camps.
---
No one cares.
---
Now I want to play a warlock. I can’t decide between Rogue (played in vanilla), warrior or warlock.
---
Join the GrobMob
---
But Barrens is the best leveling zone in the game. Although the Defias questline in Westfall is really cool lore wise.
---
Also the fact that you can continuously pull mobs, forever. You will not run out of Mana and you can sit there and kill as many as you want whether that's at the same time, successively or not. Too easy..
---
I actually look forwards to Wednesdays now because I know I can put countdown on at work. You make the day breeze by and my only complaint is that its only one day a week! 
---
Keep up the amazing work
---
If you mean SF2: Yeah, sure, but that's not that surprising. It isn't like it was the perfect FG or something, so it wouldn't really overshadow other FGs. But it did get hundreds of thousands of sales in remasters.
---
If you mean SF in general: Uh, yeah it has? SF4 and SF5 sold millions. The FGC grew a shitton, with a huge boost from capcom returning to FGs.
---
Furthermore, vanilla wow's relaunch hasn't proven itself to be some sort of big thing that can eclipse, say, SF4. We'll see what happens in a few months after people have sunk their teeth into it.
---
But mostly importantly, I don't even know why you bothered saying that because it is completely irrelevant to my point in the previous post. I was pointing out that SF2 was as huge as it was because of a lack of certain kinds of competing options at the time. 
---
Thus the point was that comparing subs of BFA and Vanilla is extremely difficult because they both had a lot of factors that make the comparison unfair- Vanilla was held back by technology, but BFA has more competition than vanilla did. Many people who played Vanilla in 2004 wouldn't have played it if they could've played some of the games we have now, including a lot of non-MMORPGs. Thus, it is difficult to produce any sort of convincing analysis that either's sub numbers were "better" than the other, because it is difficult to accurately account for all the favoring/disfavoring factors.
---
Every day we stray further from God's light.
---
Boosting is not big in Classic but gold sell spam will be abundant.
---
Huge difference between 'good' items and tweaked out characters that aren't being leveled. There was no way to compete with your regularly leveling character, you'd just get one or two shot.
---
It made BGs suck to the point that most people didn't want to do them at low levels and if they ventured in to try it, they'd swear to never go back.
---
When they added XP it suddenly made BGs fun again. Apparently the xp locked twinks were going to be put in their own queue, but once they all realized they couldn't run around like gods anymore, the whole thing just died.
---
If twink players actually cared about the challenge they keep spouting about, they'd have kept playing, but they didn't. Soon as the easy targets disappeared they all went and did something else.
---
So respectfully, piss off.
---
You can use like another UI mod it should have an arrow or tomtom, quest trackers, etc.
---
This simple act right here, farming a mix of yellow and occasionally elite red grubs, involved more situational awareness than Mythic plus dungeons and most recent raids.
---
Why? How? The bat and hound patrols as well as the Crimson Courier will respawn and wipe you unless you are constantly paying attention.
---
"But vanilla was easy. It's just tank and spank. Everyone knows the strats and there is no mystery anymore." This coming from players in guilds that have written guides and YouTube videos yet wipe for hours on the first boss of a new raid.
---
I can't wait to see the SM runs where the Humans run away at low health and pull a whole other pack of mobs, lol. They may have been prepared for Legion but SM is gonna murdleize 'em.
---
Umm yea NE here....i look damn good in a dress. Cant say much for cows.....cant polish a turd is what mama always says.
---
I have one character on Herod and two on Stalagg. I'm likely going with Stalagg on launch day if any sign of server bullshit.
---
You uhhhhh have the tabs for this? 😃
---
At 60 team up with a warrior with you being enhancement and riggity wreck everyone's face off. Windfury procs basically eat people alive and your windfury totem makes warriors literal wrecking machines.
---
Blizzard will sell gold and level 60 boosts by mid 2020, i guarantee it.
---
If you think that this won't happen, then you haven't been paying attention to what Blizzard has been doing the last 10 years.
---
Saving
---
I bet you/they could just use a addon quest tracker or something like EvlUI's tracker.
---
Did someone say Thunderfury?
---
But seriously I doubt any guild wants a rogue that deals so much threat that the MT can't keep aggro.
---
I bet there will be more ads than we'd all like.  I think we'll just have to pull that /ignore trigger and move on.
---
When they added the twink only queue, twinking died instantly. If they'd cared about the challenge they'd have kept playing, but they didn't. As soon as the easy targets went away they all gave up and left.
---
Minor changes.  The belt you picked was added in 1.10, so likely will not be in phase 1 of classic.  Leather frostbite girdle is next best.  
---
http://vanillawowhunter.com/windreaver-greaves/
---
These boots are better then the ones you picked.  This puts you 1% over hit cap, not sure best place to drop 1% hit, but if you do it on the crossbow you can get the slightly slower carapace spine crossbow and buff your multishot a bit.  
---
Agility to weapon enchant shouldn't be added until phase 3 either, but it is possible that one slips past blizzard because some other vendor stuff was incorrect phases on the beta.  
---
Wowhead claims 4 stats to chest is in phase 1, but I think it needs phase 2 world bosses for the recipe to drop.  Whenever thats in, it is better then 100mp.  3stats is likely better then 100mp, but not as overwhelmingly so as 4 stats.

&gt;He is one of the main reasons classic is a reality. That is a fact.
---
No, no it isn't.
---
The only person saying Mark Kern is a big deal for Classic is Mark Kern.
---
Can anyone comment on Elvui vs Tukui? Thanks
---
It's why I'm actually okay with right click reporting
---
Back in the day, I always had the impression casuals rolled Alliance...and they usually did, so I have always been horde. It was a great feeling being horde since it felt like we always won BGs, so me running Alliance with my wife this time is going to be interesting. 
---
Hope the old trend of Horde &gt; Alliance doesn't persist!
---
Ermagahh the child in me said to upvote u
---
Best wholesome response I've read in a while. xx
---
Don’t worry you will see how it works when you do it for the first time in Classic.
---
It will work.
---
She runs a brothel. Pimpin ain't ez
---
&gt; Blizzard will sell gold
---
they'll add tokens like retails has.
---
i doubt they directly sell level 60 but i can see 40 or even 50-55 boost.
---
Wow, that is a name I haven't heard in a long time!
---
Nice name :)
---
Right here dude, I have undead warlock name is popcorn
---
Whatever with fast attack speed to cause knockback for casters is generally the best option.  Thats why cats are so popular.  For dueling warriors some people use windserpents for the magic damage that ignore armor.  
---
Tech option for group pvp is to use a scorpid.  It stacks a poison that you can combo with viper sting to make it hard for enemy players to cleanse off the viper.
---
the more u know
---
My plan is to level my holy priest to 60 before the end of November. Once finishing with him I’ll be taking a month of working on him and starting on my Orc Warrior, and will probably be leveling alongside you.
---
What? Stalagg is EST PVP server. You seem confused.
---
No but I was an infamous ret paladin with over 20 posts when I type my name it to search. The other faction is not happy with this little ret paly.
---
I still can't but say "'Ey! Grats, mon!" From that one troll dungeob
---
If you equip it, do you become a stan for Epic?
---
Just get the winterspring mount. It’s easy.
---
You might want to go mining/engineering. Everything in blacksmithing is BoE except a dope anti fear trinket and classic is a social game. Armor smithing is an even bigger gold sink than engineering, but it is hella fun for class fantasy so it's what I'd go with.
---
Thanks !
---
It should still work, the quest tracker its typically just displays information. But not sure how Shagu/pgarneau set this up (such as are the quest objects on the maps being displayed by tracked or active quest or what is in the tracker, etc.) 
---
Its probably more than fine.
---
Shhh he’s Alliance he doesn’t know any better
---
Not really, if I remember correctly when they changed how twinking worked with the exp cap, the only part of the scene that died was the low level stuff 
---
I remember trying to play my twinks around the time change occurred and it was impossible except on my level 70 twink, which I was actually able to get reasonable que times with. I remember at the time there was a copy pasta fourm at the time encouraging people to make level 70 twinks. It was surprisingly popular. Blizzard actually went and deleted all traces of these threads but during cata it was really popular.
---
doesnt scatter DR with traps ?
---
I bought 3 Boots already for 250 $ each and they get 60 within 5 days so why Not? No one Cares.

R.I.P. in peace King Terenas. The last king of Lorderon.
---
It's best in slot for DPS... not for tanks. Sunrazor is better threat... particularly for horde. If you use Battle shout spam you don't need to worry about threat... which means DPS can use TF even with the threat from the proc. 
---
Not sure if anyone is willing to commit to this to min-max fights with just one mob.
---
I guess you’re gonna be playing BFA then

Ok Seqqsy#1954 is my tag. Feel free to add !

Found the person with pink hair and facial tattoos.

unpopular answer: the battlenet client. Has group voice, multiple channels, chat with linking functionality, and is integrated into the game (not 100% sure if this is true for wow classic). The audio quality is great, and you can adjust volume levels for individuals quickly and easily.
---
game doesnt launch till 6pm for me. the day after is another story
---
I’d love to but I have an attachment to the alliance leveling zones
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
I think I was lucky to come in at WotLK when it was the perfect mix of unique class mechanics and you still had to grind for everything, but it wasn’t nearly as hard as BC and vanilla. (I was level 80 before I ever got my first mount because I didn’t know how to make money :/ )
---
It all depends as far as queue - if you try to log in after 7pm est on 8/26 and don't have a 30+ minute queue - there's something wrong :)
---
I reinstalled retail tonight.
---
25k gold later i was up ~50 item levels.
---
5 minutes after that i was in a raid from clicking a button.
---
20 minutes after that i had even more epics.
---
and now its uninstalled.
---
lmao this guy actually put the data in for his meme that's sick
---
You can have codex show all your quests' data. Solves this issue.
---
It adds another element to the game. There will be times when you're just in no mood for PvE or farming and world PvP is something fun to do.
---
Sure, getting ganked while levelling or farming is frustrating. But when you go through one or two Tarren Mill vs. Southshore battles, save a fellow factionmate from a gank or get revenge on one of the asshats who ganked you a few days earlier, you will start to understand the fun of it.
---
Barefoot master race.
---
“Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.”
---
Nope - all nonsense or bias polling samples.
---
Male orc shoulder armor is too big for cloth to look good. Femorcs are the only valid orc warlocks.
---
Fight me.
---
Lmaooo boy cot classic!
---
Took the whole week off the day the release date was announced. Got hella snacks, an ounce of dro, and still have easily a dozen unplayed games on Steam. That 5 hr queue gon' feel like 5 minutes.
---
Thralls resolve is really bad for a rogue, like barely better than Seal of Sylvannas. You're probably going to have Mason's Fraternity Ring from running ZF while leveling, that would be way better. Even the 6 agi quest reward ring from the RFK escort would be an upgrade. 
---
Mirah's Song should be your offhand. It's a quest reward from Scholomance. If your group is dedicated to doing the quest it can be completed in one run by doing the bosses in a weird order. Otherwise it's 2 or 3 runs. It's the next best preraid offhand sword after the dal'rend set.
---
As others have said, hemo is not okay for an organized raid. It takes up debuffs slot that isn't very good, and it's overall damage is very weak compared to combat. In a PUG raid where you're not trying to impress anyone, and it doesn't matter how you perform, it's probably fine. 
---
Combat swords is also often underrated for PvP, especially in an organized group scenario. It doesn't match hemo in 1v1 ganking, but it's still pretty good. If you're not familiar with it already I suggest you give it a shot.
---
All servers will be packed. As soon as they say “full”, another will be opened. But good luck!
---
Appreciate your work man! Passed many of hours learning and laughing. You got the hype going!
---
Don't know anyone there yet.
---
Because Cheeseburger is superior.
---
I play one because I love feeling like an adventurer in a dangerous world. Almost DnD style, but without the need for role playing. It makes sense for going out into the world to feel risky and having the other faction not have the choice to attack you just seems silly. Plus even though people say you can just flag yourself on a PVE server, its really not the same. All the pvp encounters feel different. It also gives different classes an advantage in the wild because it changes the mechanics of who gets the jump on whom.
---
Can you drain life from undead mobs? I never played warlock...my friend said you can't.
---
Yea man, we can just like, totally coordinate multiple groups to move to a new server. Yea that's totally fine, gosh we're so stupid.
---
Only those that have practiced and plan on spending 100+ hours together will have it faster than questing. 
---
Vanilla was never quest or grind - you had to do both.
---
Dungeon grinding will be a great way to level on pvp servers - just don't be surprised if you find a group of randoms "committed" to dungeon grinding and then they leave after 2 hours of doing the same dungeon.
---
I was there. Mila Kunis was actually right in front of me with friends. I'm a few months late on this post but we were in the sand line probably.
---
You'll need to grind out the end game dungeons to get pre raid gear for yourself and guild mates. BRD, strath, scholo, and both lbrs and ubrs.
---
I personally don't think that current WoW and classic can really be compared to each other, due to them being so different. Even down to the foundations of the games, they serve completely different experiences, which branches out to such extremes that something as simple as gear they are almost complete polar opposites.
---
Confirmed in.
---
Not confirmed when.
---
Nobody gives a shit about unarmored mounts man
---
Yes that'll it.
---
You should make a change.org petition
---
me too thanks
---
I want to kill players as I play.
---
Nelf Rogue then and now. Ill stick with the default UI for a while till maybe lvl 30 or so.
---
I was assuming Broken Tooth would be too camped to get. Do you think that's true? If I can get Broken Tooth what's the next best option?
---
they are kul tirans not theramore
---
Gonna turn you into hamburger meat
---
This is my favorite questing addon. Don't tell you where to go and how to level but gives you the tools to find quests in your level range and where to complete them.
---
WTS Flame on Grobbulus-Alliance
---
The last time I ran into Baconn was during the Legion expansion, so it's possible he's still around and considering joining classic wow. A lot of OG firetree players are going to whitemane, so figured I'd have a call-out!
---
Im on Herod doing 12 to 18 on 6 to 8 off for a week. Join the darkside of Herod
---
He has 400 hp, the mobs hit him for 6 damage. I just leveled a rogue to 10 and  ever fell below 97% it was retarded
---
"Relative realm population will be visible in-game to help in choosing a realm so you will see Low, Medium, or High in the realm selection screen. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during name reservation and character creation, we will post warnings about the potential for queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms."
---
Blizzard also posted...
---
"As of now, a large number of WoW Classic characters have been created on the following realms. Players with characters on this realm are likely to experience severe queues at release."
---
Faerlina - PvP
---
Herod - PvP
---
Whitemane - PvP
---
And they posted...
---
"While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan."
---
"Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006."
---
That's why.

Had no idea about the Sash not being Phase 1 available, oh and it was such a neat item too. TY for the correction!  
---
IIRC, Windreaver Greaves got updated on future patches to give 1%. Used to be spirit before that correction. Besides, i'm kind of already on the cap without it, so the real reason to go towards it would be if i'm somehow extremely lucky to drop a Blastershot Launcher (which i'm likely not spending Gold on).   
---
Aw man, that's a big shame. Any other possible enchantment or am i stuck rolling with Arcanite Reaper Farming?   
---
Will pick 3 Stats then! Thing is, i'm a bit paranoid about the whole OOM deal, even tho i'm one of the classes that can actually drink in combat.
---
Well, maybe juuuuuuuuuuust maaaaybe I was asking a question for general conversation and to hear peoples opinions. But for some reason certain people, such as yourself, can’t even add anything of value to the conversation.
---
You can just log out in an inn as soon as your rested xp runs out, and only level with rested xp active. Takes LONG to 60, but as someone's side project that could break /played to 60 records.
---
Most of the people who care more about queue times than having a long term server will be tourists.
---
But the price already changed over the years.  This no changes crap is getting out of hand. It's just a stupid mantra for the ignorant now.
---
Only 12 hours on launch? That is not hardcore.  My wife did 15 last server.
---
I do. The white raptor is the best mount in vanilla.
---
As a Tauren player I agree.
---
So those early on dungeons when leveling don’t really need to be grinder?
---
I want unarmored armor too. It’s ridiculous we need better options for not armoring ourselves.
---
How much did those cost? Like 500g or something like that?
---
you are not wrong
---
Good to know. That then puts your armor caps at 16496 for level 60, 17261 for level 63, and 13809 with the 25% buff for level 63.
---
Holy shit Baconn. I played horde on firetree and have the same memories
---
who hurt you?
---
I'm certain. It does look awful, youtube is still behind for streaming experience.
---
The damage decreased by the frost resist will not outweigh the lack of damage you are dealing to secure a kill.
---
I can update you once I finally kill her since they are hiding her true motivation, but yeah it was pretty much "shes gone crazy and made a deal with an old God so we need to kill her". ANOTHER OLD GOD. Though the animation of her transformation was pretty, which I'm sure is on YouTube. Also, Mechagon is pretty fun, but that alone isn't really worth coming back before classic imo.
---
no thanks
---
Skinning then at 60 do herb and engi

Did I say you didn't?

Content and guests seem great, but I wish he’d just take a little bit more of a natural approach.

I never usually make these sorts of comments, but he sounds exactly like a game show host to me (think PlayStation game Buzz), and it feels like he’s always taking AT his guests rather than with/to them.

Just makes it hard to listen to for me...

Meh.  Not nearly high enough on the importance meter for me.  Sorry brah.

Stalagg crush you!!!

Have never leveled a horse character past 10, but all my friends are going horde so I’m going to as well

Thanks so much Josh!

Fellow SydneySider here, you’ve been getting me through slow days at the office for the last few months!
---
Josh if you read this I want to say you have done an absolutely amazing job with the podcast and your show has been such a pleasure to look forward to every week while waiting to come back to Azeroth. I found your podcast so long ago all the way back when you were doing lore episodes and can say that even back then everything was amazing and it has been so fun to see the show evolve into what it is today. This community is so great and you help people see that every week. Fantastic job!

---
A lot of speed running guilds are doing leveling groups of 4 mages and a healer spamming dungeons.  At some level of play and high enough dps tanking become irrelevant.  By the time you cannot find a warrior, druid, paladin or even shaman to tank, you are almost for sure better off playing in such a way that you just don't use a tank at all and bounce aggro while doing maximum damage.
---
Dungeons can be OK efficiency wise if you've got the quests, didn't go out of your way too much to get the quests, and you complete them all in one run. You need to account for making the group and travel time. Dungeons become hyper efficient if you've got an amazing group that can chain pull and do multiple runs back to back. Youtube melee cleave dungeon grinding and spell cleave dungeon grinding
---
PvP of course. Feel the war between Horde and alliance.

You know team lead is a manager right?

How about Game Director, Executive Producer, Lead Designer, Lead Programmer.

you should, they look way better than armored mounts.

Honestly. Just stay happy. We had sme 4chan degens try and sneak into the RP community and we weeded em out quick and banned them from discords/resource websites. All about playing to cool and respecting other people.
---
This comment is hilarious to me, I love this.
---
Clicking more increases power via kinetic energy ... Didn't you know?
---
I'd like to hope they keep that shit to retail.  They know what the fanbase is, in classic, and it's not in microtransactions by any stretch.

I found the link on the blizzard store. It was some months ago so I don't remember where exactly.

It's not WoW if the shoulders aren't huge, tho

You can iceblock out of a freezing trap so freezing trap isn't affective unless you've burned both blocks (if they're running cold snap that is)

tens or even hundreds of thousands

Will add! And the discord link is in the post

I mean, isn’t that a Warlock draining life in the meme?
---
fuck no.  im taking a vacation \*week\*.

hi id like it
---
His post is a well known meme template...
---
Queue times are a reflection of server population size. I'm using the queue time to estimate the actual server pop.
---
That's kind of the point.
---
I miss the blood elf crest already
---
Using this one simple trick, you’ll NEVER BELIEVE this pregnant mans reaction.
---
It will be interesting to see how quickly or slowly low level dungeon groups will form and actually start (guild groups and pugs).  That will likely directly influence how keen people are to run dungeons more frequently at lower levels.
---
Blizzard, I’m a multiboxer and if you put unarmored mounts in the game, I’m not playing Classic. It’s your decision. Take this clown’s $15 a month or my $75 a month. We both know which you’d prefer.
---
6PM Eastern USA, it's technically a 27th release for the rest of the world
---
When Blizzard speaks of 10k (and possibly much higher) queues, that isn't just "one day" of inconvenient queues. That is a queue totally unprecedented in all of WoW's history. I've heard estimates that 10k alone might mean upwards of 5-10 hours in queue, and 10k is Blizzard's conservative low-end estimate.
---
Kind of zone specific, but as a Warlock in Blasted Lands you can control a level 62 elite Manahound from the Tainted Scar. It has 40k+ health, an AOE mana burn, a 70% slow, and a bleed. Its basically GG if you get that on anyone. Its also kind of nice for mindless farming.
---
The current ones are going to fill up regardless. The next server they open is going to fill up regardless. They are forcing players to move to Stalagg, players who subbed early to reserve their names. They feel like they are getting fucked out of subbing early because they were forced to role on a mega server and are now being forced to switch to Stalagg before more servers will open and they lose their name.
---
Where do you see blizzard estimating that much dropoff?
---
You'll be playing on the most populated server with the most community ran events, pvp tournaments. You'll be able to find groups for dungeons even at 4am, there's more guilds to join and more people to recruit. Seems like more than enough reasons to me.
---
It was the sound when you leveled in EverQuest.
---
God this is so epic! Also wasn't this posted like "about" a week ago as a fan made but gave credit to Hurricane? (most the footage from Hurricane)
---
Yeah, you’re right. It’s crazy they don’t go with a much worse version of layering that’s much more disruptive to all communities involved.  
---
Hear that Blizzard??? Smash all those servers together! Never mind you never did that in classic and haven’t done it in half a decade in retail!
---
LF science on Herod pst
---
Poontank#0208
---
Original servers were capped at 3,000. We are going to exceed that number by a shitload.
---
The first character I got to 60 was a tauren shaman (probably the 10th or so character I had played). Around level 20-25 I had got my ghost wolf form and thought it was incredible, I remember trekking up to ashenvale from the barrens to have some fun. Being a tauren, my character's size was always very... Noticable, and so the ghost wolf form was huge to me as it gave me a means to be a little stealthy. Anyways, my biggest memory was finding a small indent at the top of a hill where I could hide myself in ghost wolf form and scout out anybody traveling up the main path. I must have spent hours in this spot just chilling like a trap door spider. Anytime some hapless night elf came flopping up the hill I would wait for them to pass and pursue in my hastened form from behind, vindictively murdering them for choosing the wrong faction. It was probably the most satisfaction I had experienced from video games up until that point and is why I strongly favor open world survival games hoping to again find my niche.
---
I thought he said he wasn’t attempting world first?
---
Night elf is the best one. Followed by Orc
---
This is so damn accurate.
---
Whoop Aggressive Alliance Priests for the win! (NE here, in classic and in retail)
---
Grobbulus you must seek
---
Dungeons quest are the one ritch with lore. They usually starts in the main cities from major characters. I can't wait to read them and get into the story.
---
Whatever man. Enjoy your 5+ hour queue on Herod for the first week, followed by 5+ hour queues once layering is removed. Don't want to "miss out" on the action, right?
---
It's a pvp server. Not rp.
---
That name ain’t gonna be much use when you’re sitting in queue for days.
---
Maybe not worth the time investment to farm, when upgrades are avail through dungeon while leveling normally
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
i was agreeing with you, mate.
---
On pve, you can farm spots without any worries about getting killed but if someone is there, you can’t kill them. On pvp, you can kill them for as long as you want. Also, the twink scene is a lot better it seems on pvp servers. Also, people told that it’s harder to rank up in honor since you’re competing with a lot less players..? Or something like that.
---
This, stacks of leather vendor for a decent amount actually. 10silver for a stack of medium leather is pretty fair pre-60 if the AH isnt popping.
---
What's disruptive about it?
---
He didn't specify base damage, which quite frankly is negligible end game.  The main complaint with normalization was that, weapons don't make that much difference to the damage you do.
---
You are correct in your statement though.
---
Are you dense? Stalagg was just announced three days ago it's the new east coast pvp server
---
Thanks it gets better in aq =D
---
You will have the chance to ask them in a couple of days. They are doing a AMA on reddit.
---
omfg, this takes me back.
---
There was only one PvP EST server released for name reservation as far as I'm concerned.  And before you ask, no I don't count Streamer Server PvP EST or Brazillian Server PvP EST.  There was only one server released for us.
---
Just the characters and the cities etc..
---
I understand your point
---
I can afford it, I'm just super frugal :(
---
Frankly I took the day off and I wouldnt even be mad. Ill just do more of the FFX monster arena while I wait.
---
Sale, yes. They happen enough too at this point that you're silly if you pay more than half price. Comparing dollars per hour spent playing, it's a fair buy.

ummm, got some bad news for you... lol
---
IMO grab every quest then run the dungeon – but that’s just how I play. The gear upgrades will pay off. Try to remember it’s Classic and you’re gonna get excited when gray shoulders drop.

Same here. GuruBRashi was a fucking nightmare. Even stuck with it through WotLK.

Thanks for this, haven’t seen this before.

---
In a world with layering, why? I'd take overpopulation now and a healthy playerbase later on than dead servers and heavy fragmentation.
---
Assuming level 60, just to soft counter a mage to the point that frost spells aren't hitting enough you'd want at least 150 resist. That means just about all your gear will need to be "of frost resistance." That means you'll have very shit damage and low health, so when you do get hit, it's going to hurt a lot. You can't really meme gear to completely nullify a frost mage until naxx gear is out.
---
Haha.. this made me laugh out loud
---
Just level a character on the other server on a different WoW client while waiting for queues on Herod *taps head*
---
I had skinning and LW and i always regretted LW because the high end recipes suck. Nothing you can farm mats and make a goos buck for. It felt like i only ever used it to hand out armor kits during instances lol.
---
But who gets to keep the name Thex when you merge servers?
---
it's a retail addition that made it less likely for your guild leader to just steal everything, lol
---
Haha the fucking game isn't even out yet and we already got shady drama shit.
---
If you're in the area I'd deffinitely hit dungeons and hope for someone to share quests. Otherwise I feel like the travel time to each dungeon would make your leveling slower.
---
the wand hustle on a fresh server is the best. You can  sell them boys for 10-15s in starting zones while you level and everyone will love you and you'll make a good buck out the gate.
---
 Cartman's been putting pot in the hot-pockets again...
---
Definitely. So worth it!
---
You only think you want it but you don’t !
---
Essentially. But there would be no layering when the game launches.
---
What lvl 32 green?
---
2007 for me, but I'm back and so are you!!!
---
I took Tues-Fri off and we have Monday the 2nd off for the holiday. I'm planning a whole week of sweaty classic WoW starting midnight on Tues. I've been looking forward to this for months.
---
Not sure if you knew what I meant. While a mage is frozen from freezing trap, at any time they can ice block and either wait out ice blocks duration or cancel ice block to effectively negate your trap. This means if you freeze them and then run away for an aimed shot they can just time their block for whenever your aimed shot is about to go off to waste your cd/mana, or just instantly cancel their block and negate your freezing trap all together
---
Well, duh. I’m not judging, I’m trying to understand. 
---
Would it be better if Blizzard just gave you a boost to 60 on day one? Is that what you want?
---
and if a warlock ask you to help a whole party click an altar, you do what he says!
---
A fellow priest perhaps? The pressure to abandon my beautiful nelf body for an ugly  dwarf one for the fear ward is strong.
---
You’re conflating the online population with the total population. Server communities back in the day were much more than 3k.
---
Oh I see what you mean. Windowed without a toolbar but not fullscreen. Yeah, I have no idea how to do that. My bad.
---
I would say no, but if it turns out to really be a big problem I would reconsider my answer.
---
Generally whatever you find green won't be too far behind any blue items you might get doing dungeons. It can be worth it to do a dungeon once for xp and quest rewards since quite a few of them will last a while. Generally though until Maraudon and higher you really don't need to do a dungeon multiple times.
---
&gt; You'll be playing 
---
....Other games while in queue
---
What do you mean layering seems to do the same thing as what you’re suggesting? Wouldn’t it be painful to merge the servers and have everyone’s stuff get messed up? What about name conflicts? I dunno, making separate servers seems to have just as many problems as layering does, it just also creates new ones
---
I currently use it all the time for Final Fantasy XIV and voice chats with friends. I think it's great and much simpler than discord overall. Less clunky than ventrilo or mumble used to be.
---
Always remember seeing Gurgthok the Orc Shaman with that red shield in Orgrimmar
---
Guys gold sellers use stolen accounts to spam.
---
Pretty cool
---
Shadow priests would like a word with you
---
There are other mmos with decent pvp. None with classic-esque world pvp. World pvp is the main draw of classic. No reason for pve servers to exist
---
If you can’t be bothered to look up such basic information with a simple google or wowhead search I don’t know how you expect to lead the groups through the actual dungeons.
---
Can we get this stickied? Some great advice in here.
---
Once you get flagged as a gold seller, your ACCOUNT and all characters should be muted.
---
Thanks
---
This is an interesting mechanism to think about... maybe up until level 5, since that takes less than 10 minutes to achieve.
---
What about Borderlands 3?
---
u/SoupaSoka
---
will the ama have links (usually a comment sticky) to blue comments or will we have to go find them?
---
Yeah, maybe later. But I’m doing it for the fun, to help my guild and not I’m too interested in min/maxing.
---
I've played on private servers for the past five months or so? I don't feel like "living the experience" all over again, for the 10th time?

If you're worried about the servers culture you wont even know what that is with layering. There will be 10 different instances of Ogr and SW going on at one time. Rarely running into the same characters.
---
Thanks for all you've done for the classicwow community Josh, I've been here on this sub since we had 3k subs and you have been pumping out professional content since the beginning. I really appreciate the mature, lighthearted way you run your show. Maybe we can grab a beer at Blizzcon. Best of luck man!
---
Listen to your heart
---
As I said, not many options worth the time if Rune of the Guard Captain isn't gonna be there for phase 1.   
---
If you have a suggestion I'll be happy do update it!
---
Hunter
---
I've been unable to try FF14 thanks to its horrible download system (if it fails I have to start over, thanks to my bandwidth it ALWAYS fails), but every other MMO I've tried over the years still hasn't come close to the worst moments in WoW. I legit prefer AFKing in my Garrison over SWTOR as an example...
---
Only when the cables don't fail and your raid leader isn't an ass who demands you all suicide asap.
---
A raid leader would have to be a real douchebag to tell someone they have to wear cloth instead of their T2.
---
Pet classes are always the best for leveling.
---
Does anyone know if I’ll be able to import my UI that I was using on a TBC private server?
---
What's funny is PvP videos ste good because if the music. I could imagine everyone would have a good PvP video with all there good fights. Nvidia auto record I think so over time I'm out together one yolo

---
From what I gathered from the beta, you can jump on and get in queue 15 mins before the servers come online. I’m not sure how else to get around the queue.
---
I did know what you meant. But listen, if you had enough frost resist to make a difference. What is your kill plan? You have to force ice block no matter what.
---
In a PUG Raid yeah... but hopefully I won't be going through the terror of it :D
---
Warlock or Hunter
---
U mad?
---
Just hop on another server if that happens lol
---
We will likely sticky a comment to the top of the AMA with links to blue comments.
---
Old AV. By far. Being a Fire Mage during that era was just phenomenal. Dozens of people fighting at the front line, and you're the longest range besides Hunter. Plant yourself there and begin winding up Fireballs and you could single-handedly push back the entire enemy faction after you explode a couple fools. So many antics and chases and battles were had in there. People seemed to treat it like a WPvP zone that happened to have PvE objectives to end the match, rather than a space you can grind honor in an efficient manner - so long as people fight one another as little as possible.
---
It was a sad day when AV devolved into a simple PvE rush. Not having old AV in Classic will be a big lacking in terms of authentic experiences that I most fondly remember and will never relive. Really hoping that the x-realm stuff doesn't sap the glisten out of the server communities.
---
What evidence do you have to support a multi-hour que on Herod? During name reservation, my que was 10k after the login sever dc’d me. It took less than 6 minutes from 10k in que to get back to the character creation screen.
---
Nice remark on the symmetry. Hadn't noticed. 
---
Those guides are full of great fantasy art. I really enjoyed reading through them in preparation for classic.
---
Me not that kind of Orc
---
I would rather have a 1 time problem rather than seeing people disappear in front of me for the foreseeable future.  If it is removed after after phase 1 I would be happy with that. Just dont see it happening

You don't pay a monthly fee for private servers.
---
Very true... extra vanish is kinda nice though
---
Have only 4 vacation days + weekend. Hope take atleast 30+ lvl
---
Zandalar Tribe! For the horde!
---
Legends say it was lost beneath the sea...
---
World of roguecraft was a hell of an era.
---
The reverse for me.
---
I haven’t played alliance at all, except for having a level one spy that I’d use to find players (/who) for world PvP. 
---
This time around I’ll be playing alliance, and killing horde instead! Thought I’d switch things up.
---
Despite never playing alliance before, it’s all the same to me. I would sit in alliance zones as Horde all the time, just because I loved how they looked (that and world PvP)
---
There's currently 3 seasons out and a 4th confirmed.
---
Remote into your PC an hour before your due to play? I remoted in to mine via Chrome to reserve my character names.
---
That makes sense. If layering does go away
---
Unless you do high mythic plus or mythic raiding retail is all pretty faceroll anymore.
---
That autocorrect at the end got me
---
If you’re talking about pure, server first, speed leveling than most of the time it’s not worth it. I think the only exceptions might be if there’s a really solid quest reward that’s going to be a bis item for a while (example that comes to mind is the Thrash Blade from Mara for rogues which can last from 45-60). But the group would have to be good and come together quickly. 
---
If you’re just talking about being efficient, within reason, than a dungeon quest run here or there isn’t really going to hurt you.
---
EDIT: *Youtube chat reaction, can't change the title now, sorry Twitch chat.
---
Warlock is the easiest going leveling.  Get a pet from the beginning, free mount at 40, several ways of keeping up health and mana efficiently, at level 10 you get a taunting tanking pet.  You just throw some dots on things and they die.  If you're rolling pvp server, demo warlock is broken.  Fears pretty broken, soul link is broken, can sacrifice the voidwalker for a shield.  For pve they're not very gear dependent, do good ranged dps, bring a lot of group utility.  Would recommend.

This one is actually so bad that you can get reported for griefing.
---
My very first character in Vanilla I rolled a Female Night Elf Protection warrior. I knew literally nothing about the game or how completely arduous it is to level a warrior, especially prot. I'm pretty sure I stayed at level 53-54 for about 2 months, just spending my time fucking around and doing random stuff with my friends because I didn't know how to level any further with running dungeons. I had already ran BRD about 20 times as the tank and at the time I didn't even know about any of the other dungeons around my level. I'm really going to miss my naivety from vanilla.
---
By others you mean demons or what
---
He had his bnet linked like an hour or 2 ago on his discord profile, hes taken it away now and probably changed it.
---
Ill take the pretty dress thanks~
---
I'm gonna be rushing my main to 60 in around 2 weeks. Why? Well, if I get to start running MC ~6 weeks before your average player, that's a 6 lockout advantage to get more gear. More gear = more power. It also means that high gold/hr farm spots will not be as contested. Which means more gold for me. And more gold = more power.
---
I play to win. Getting to level cap early is a huge advantage. I'll be in full prebis+hopefully one or two raid pieces when you hit 60. I'll have my epic mount and a pretty decent chunk of gold in my pocket. 
---
Obviously I wouldn't want blizzard to give out boosts, because then my sweatiness would mean nothing.
---
Joke aside, but it just takes you back to the character select screen, which is past the queue, so wouldn't actually matter.
---
Vacation Week, some of my guildies have two weeks off.
---
Even though they're supposed to be "epic" and "engaging," zone-wide quests never engaged me. In fact, while most people don't pay much attention to them, I think they're a huge cause towards the "on rails" nature of modern WoW that people loathe.
---
The leveling experience consists of the game *dragging* you from place to place, throwing some sidequests at you at each point. I much prefer having the choice of doing whatever I want in a zone in whatever order.
---
Even as early as Durotar you're given a choice: Echo Isles first, or Razor Hill? The choice is yours, and having a choice drastically improves the player experience. It makes it feel like not just *an* adventure, but *your* adventure.
---
Hunter I'd say
---
I would argue that they have the single greatest looking set in Judgement Armor but to me the rest are not my taste.
---
Cant wait.
---
Please keep up the memes so my guild will have more room on Herod.
---
Like drinking water in dungeons after a big pull? Don’t roll mage.
---
Hunter is the easiest leveler by far but the easiness does not translate to PvP at all. Hunter has a relatively high ceiling, and to be frank even an "average" skilled Hunter is going to have trouble because the deadzone is so easy to abuse.
---
Mages are great levelers as well (top 3 I would say) and while like Hunter have a very high skill ceiling, I feel like the skill floor is much, much lower. Frost PvP is annoying.
---
Why are people making posts about them going to a different server cause of the queue.  We get it...
---
Just use reddit instead: 
---

---
Seems like discord is unusable without heavy moderation.
---
How does it work sorry? Do we have the old models, but they have been revamped to have nicer graphics?
---
Half of the game, will you be the predator or the prey.
---
That hurts new players way more than it helps prevent gold spam, I'd guess
---
It works on a lot of packs in dungeons but some fights might be scripted to make things happen regardless of what you do. 
---
Shadowmeld is good for soloing dungeons, gives you an extra tool. It really shines during wpvp though.
---
Check curse forge, willitclassic, or Warcraft tavern. If it’s classic it should be on me of these websites.
---
Can't wait for classic wow, got my bloodsail bucaneers application in.
---
I don't really plan to do dungeons. If I can get a group of players I know aren't trash and I can complete most quests without going out of my way, then sure. If not, I won't bother.
---
Dungeon grinding is actually a valid method of powerleveling in Clsasic from what I gather but you need a solid group of people who know what they're doing, you pretty much need to speedrun the dungeons to make it worth it, relying heavily on cleave.
---
&gt;Wow, so you mean he was literally the guy solely responsible for making sure the game came out the way it did? Wow! pretty important work!

Going for 5 days off work. Ends up being like 8 days since we have off for memorial day as well.

So monday i take off and dont go back to work till next tuesday
---
Was where my IRL friends were, which never made sense, they never wpvp in fact they avoided people, and towards the end of every expansion they only get on to raid, made it a pain in the ass as the only one who was usually on farming.
---
This is the most stupid comment I have seen on this sub.
---
Nothing wrong with that, sounds healthy.
---
They aren’t forcing anyone to do anything
---
Alot safer than low 30s
---
To you, but not to everyone. Same with Vanilla.
---
I remember Bacon and was always searching the blimp for him before takeoff since I had a potato and would buffer in dead if he was there. The only alliance player I still remember the name of.
---
 
---
I was a lvl45-48ish troll priest, had been in a small world PVP scuffle near the bottom of Thunder Bluff with some other higher levels doing most of the work. It seemed to be over, and they'd all gone back up the elevator. I was going up the ramp when a 60 warrior rezzed, bandaged and came after me.
---
By some miracle, my fear didn't resist. I'd say I ran for my life, but all I could do was get on the elevator and hope he didn't break the fear - he didn't for some reason. Looking down, I saw he was getting on to the second elevator and had a secondary oh shit moment.
---
He had me targeted and I knew as soon as he charged me it was over. All I could do was try to get a mind control off before he got in range.
---
And some fucking how, I did, and again it didn't resist. He was probably just as shocked as I was, and I quickly threw him off the cliff before it could fully sink in.
---
I remember a few seconds later some other horde 60 ran over from the bank seeing the commotion, and I saw him just kinda look around for a sec, go to the edge and look, turn to look at me, then go back to the bank lol.
---
Scapegoat that literally spent millions on advertising an unfinished game in the form of a fucking game bus.
---
He was a fucking lunatic, if you think he was some scapegoat for how shit that game is then you are delusional. There is a reason why he doesnt get to work on anything else anymore and its not because RED5 was spewing bullshit.
---
Great answer, thanks.

If you're leaning toward Warrior, do Warrior...
---
hey mods, do the thing
---
Yea people always say you can fish and do other things but I cannot focus on ANYTHING else properly while fishing. Simple math takes significantly longer because of the moment of focus loss when the bobber hits, it takes me too long to regain that focus
---
&gt; we are not going to raise that cap **any further**
---
Yeah, there's a tabard, but it doesn't increase xp gain. Increases the guild rep gain by 100% instead.
---
u dorks reserved the dumbest names 2 weeks in advance.  thanks.  clver wow players will get their names
---
Don't tell me there are Tauren Paladins on current WoW?!
---
Nah vanilla isn't nearly chore heavy - it's why vanilla is the best version of wow :) 
---
Have a wonderful day!
---
You need to watch it i had a massive erection during every episode
---
But as blizz said if they raise the cap too much with layers early on there is a much bigger issue in phase 2 when layers have to go away.
---
O shit
---
Why u so racist
---
Yeh, just being comical
---
Without watching the video, how many genders are there?
---
Here's to hoping they do a BC rerelease after all the phases of classic are finished, that was peak WoW since more specs were viable while still maintaining a very close classic feel
---
Just wait till you meet the mods in this subreddit.

Herbing assists in making thistle tea efficiently. You need a lot of thistle tea if you want to maximize your damage at 60, both in pvp and pve.

Added a quick and dirty Warlock sheet! Stripped of recommendations for the most part for now, will make a pass at it after doing a couple of others.
---
I really don't understand how people think this is "cool" at all. There is no skill involved, he literally just twinked to be basically invincible and started griefing lowbies. What is wrong with you people?
---
I never thought the thing that would kill world of warcraft.....would be the original world of warcraft.
---
Maybe I'm more annoyed by that half of a bracket where drinking to full takes forever than others :shrug:
---
Mid 40's, on my NightElf Priest (I started Alliance due to friends, now I play mainly Horde) in Thousand Islands buy the large lifts.
---
I would ShadowMeld and wait for people to approach the lifts (be invisible).  Then Mind Control (MC) them as they are crossing from Barrens into Thousand Islands.  At the time, you got MC much earlier and you didn't leave ShadowMeld stealth until the spell finished casting.  Once you mind controlled them, you can jump off the lifts and release the spell, which gets them to fall to their deaths.
---
If they showed up with help or their high level 60 to fight me, I could run off the lift and levitate and flee the area.  Fun times.
---
Nobody used it in vanilla.
---
You could just hide shoulders?
---
Layering is continent wide, rather than zone wide. So it's not like dozens of versions of the starting zone will spin up. The starter zones will still be crowded.
---
ret pally seems a great fit for you
---
Nothing goes well in PvP with limited raid play. And gets worse and worse.
---
However, you can be sufficiently potent as a UD frost mage with zero raid play due to the fact that 
---
1. You can easily solo queue to rank 8 for blood guard and legionnaire pieces in the hands and legs. 
---
2. You can craft robe of the archmage for chest.
---
3. Your wand, offhand, belt, cape can all come from AV rewards.
---
4. You can get the orb of the dark moon as your necklace.
---
5. You can get 1 ring from the ah (freezing band) and the other from a quest in strat ud (15 stam 10 intel).
---
6. Your bracers can just be first sergeants for a dose of stamina. Later, tier 0.5.
---
7. Your main hand can be witchblade from gandling, your shoulders the burial shawl, both from scholomance. 
---
8. Your helmet is the pimp helmet from magistrate in strat UD.
---
9. Your trinkets will be eye of the beast, briarwood reed and every single engineering trinket there is, as well as PvP trinket. 
---
Spec a PvP frost spec and play.
---
Still closest thing to classic. Since I am sure those zones are untouched since TBC. The rest of the world got revamped with cata.
---
And TBC is closer to vanilla than cata :P
---
Why do you keep asiding jokes in a post full of jokes?
---
I don't know why people are so interested in this code but trust me nobody cares about the code quality. Release it or don't. You'll never clean it up.
---
Companies aren't one person. If he was able to push such crazy ideas through alone with no one supporting him internally, then he was far from the only problem the company had. And if he *wasn't* the only one in support of those ideas, he was still far from the only problem the company had.
---
Also why I'm a huge advocate of spi&gt;int while leveling. As long as you make sure to take advantage of the 5s rule.
---
Only earlier in the week they reconfirmed layering was going away when talking about populations, so I'm pretty confident they will keep their word on that.
---
Yo, what does this picture have to do with classic?
---
This video got me playing a warrior all those years ago. The feels!
---
Especially considering over half the day one population won’t be around in 3 months. At least half.
---
did you even check the site? he is working on it.
---
I am taking a few days off work... 3 days after launch.  Not expecting launch to be very fun
---
Source on them refusing to provide Vanilla era WoWhead prior to the announcement of Classic? Without the source all I'm hearing is that you want them to spend an extra bunch of hosting costs for a community that has been considered "niche" by the general public for many years, and let's be honest, a lot of people still consider previous expansion communities to be niche
---
Same my brother....same
---
I hope so.
---
Hey you could always try MrBean?
---
I mean.. what makes you think your post actually belongs on the WoW forums? Was it about WoW? Or was it about another person you were arguing with?
---
Put your kids to work farming for you!
---
I reworked this meme a bit, my original had: "And a Dragon in a Gnome Suit" as the first day but I felt like this flowed better. 
---
Still funny to think of it as a dragon in a gnome suit though, lol
---
I’d say do the very early ones (Caverns and Deadmines) as those upgrades help a lot but after that it’s users choice until grinding gear to get ready to raid with.
---
&gt;Companies aren't one person.
---
He was a fucking co founder lol.
---
&gt;If he was able to push such crazy ideas through alone with no one supporting him internally
---
Again, co founder, there are plenty of high positions in the corporate world that basically have zero oversight.
---
You are right that he wasnt the only problem at the company but when the fucking guy holding the steering wheel starts driving off towards a cliff its hard for the people in the back to stop him.
---
RED5 was a failure and as the CEO and co founder of the company he bears the brunt of the blame.
---
Shielded until past level 30? Ever hear of hillsbrad?
---
What is fishing buddy?
---
*Yikes*
---
...You right, tho.

My advice would be to either pick whatever your heart is telling you to pick(whatever comes to mind first when you think about it) or go on to a private server and play around with all the classes and see which you find the most fun or to your play style.
---
I'm not sure why the hate for an addon that helps spam chat for groups or even lets others be notified that x person is looking for a group.
---
I like the mythic+ LFG in retail, where you still have to scroll through looking for a group. still have to PM the group leader. to me that's fine.
---
You know how when you buy a new car then start to notice everyone on the road has the same damn car as you? You never noticed them before, but now they are everywhere...
---
That’s how I feel ever since I decided to main lock. Are they more popular this time around or is this just the “new car effect”?
---
Hey Josh, I'm that former GM that ended up too shy to do a call, maybe you remember me. Thank you so much for the content I could listen to when trying to fall asleep at night, fantasizing about classic and its release. I hope to see some other classic content when our countdown is over!
---
i'ma ask to put it on wow interface too. i hate what curse/twitch has become.
---
Those orc shoulder pads are really something on warlocks...
---
Those aren't random mobs. They're a part of the stormwind faction. They're friendly to him.
---
All paladins are boomers in mindset tbh, myself included
---
I was flagged for simply stating there were going to be queues on Herod and quoted the blue post about it in one of the threads.  Its probably the last time I will ever use that forum.
---
He said he will be speed running it but with at least 6-7 hours of sleep each day due to his health. So he won’t be first to 60 but can still get a low /played time
---
Low effort trolls just putting some sticks together and came to the class presentation looking like baffoons compared to the other races
---
Dude!! Thanks so much, you're awesome!
---
Try gearing for spirit instead of intellect and keeping track of the 5s rule, after 5s of not spending mana, spirit regen kicks in. You can usually get between 1-3 ticks of spirit mana regen between each mob, using your wand to finish off your current mob then walking over to the next one.
---
High spirit speeds up leveling by quite a bit in my experience and is the most underrated stat.
---
The biggest problem is that if low population realms are merged and two characters share the same name then the entire point of name reservation has been removed because one of those people will need to be renamed.
---
People will talk about simply disabling the "inactive" account, but a low population server does not mean that everybody is inactive. If two people playing this game are playing on characters named Sam and their servers are merged then someone loses their name. That in itself is a complication, especially if both of those Sams reserved on character creation. 
---
Sure, there is a shit storm now, because people have their names and don't want to give them up, so servers like Herod are being filled to the brim and people are refusing to transfer off, they were too slow to reserve on the new release servers so on Herod they stay. 
---
Now imagine how bad it will become when those same people are forced to rename their characters.
---
If you do all the quest in one run I think that would pay off more than soloing.
---
Just did the same. Bought my first ever real gaming PC.
---
can't wait for the game to come out lads. my popcorn is popping
---
I have Nevil on Herod, 99% sure I won’t be playing there.
---
I decided I wanted to play wow when I saw my brother riding on his raptor in strangelthorn vale in a huge raiding party killing alliance
---
Herb/skinning.
---
Yeah it will be there in some form
---
Are you capable of posting an argument without cursing at least once per sentence or did you learn about bad words yesterday.
---
sometimes the great firewall of china will dump the connection if it detects certain phrases.
---
So no herbalism? Are the rogue reagents cheap on AH?
---
i like it when they get smart and start reporting those that slaughter their bots.
---
No it does not.

This will make a legendary pfp

I notice the past tense here.

Blizz new that east coast players were split into 3 groups. People spent money to reserve their names on the 1 server that didnt have big streamers  or BR/PR. Once Blizz realize that too many people subbed, they stealth releases Stalagg allowing friends and guilds no time to talk about whether to stay or not. They then tell people that Herod is over populated, they will see 10k queues, and that they wont release more servers until people move from Herod. Even though, regardless of people moving from Herod or new subs creating chars on Stalagg, Stalagg is going to fill up. People don't want to move from Herod in fear of losing their name that they payed for. Blizz is forcing players from Herod to switch to Stalagg before they will release a new server, and when they release that new server lets hope they dont botch that again.
---
Damn that's incredibly lucky. Sucks for the other dude though.
---
 Couldn't agree more, and when you opt for convenience, you lose everything else that made whatever it was special. I generally try to refrain from calling them MMO-RPG's, these days, as I feel the RPG has been lost in a lot of aspects. They've turned into nothing more than MMO-G's, instanced dungeon crawls where you're constantly chasing the slightest ilevel increase. And even that no longer feels meaningful since you're constantly changing gear, like you'd change your clothes. It's all become so tiresome and soulless. 
---
 My hopes with the resurgence of Classic, and others such as OSRS, we'll see more upcoming MMO's return to their routes. There has to be a middle ground where this genre can flourish like it once did, without all these empty clones being spat out for a quick F2P buck.
---
If i were you id just watch noob guides on YouTube to get a basic understanding of the first 10 levels.  By the time youre level 10 you should get the hang of things
---
ransom!
---
Only the most dedicated belong on Herod , enjoy your ride on Stalagg.
---
I don't doubt that some company out there will create the next WoW, Scarcraft, etc, but it won't be Blizzard. Classic is Blizzard's last hurrah. The cancer of Activision has metastasized so much that the chemo will kill the host.
---
But wow has been out for 15 years already /s
---
To this day I still think Druid t3 is one of the best sets ever
---
They will all be packed on release day. And for several days or weeks after. You may want to consider waiting an hour or two after launch to see if blizzard opens any new servers you can get right onto
---
It is not a 1v1 spec whatsoever, meant to stick with the larger group of allies to sneakily provide massive aoe damage support.
---
we have new 13 year olds, who dont know better.
---
World buffs are not an exploit
---
“Penetrate Up” Oh?
---
which version? it hasn't been updated since wotlk.
---
I'd love to see the intervention highlights for this episode... I'm just worried he's losing his connection with reality \* [I'M THE MAN, I'M THE KING, I'M THE ONE THAT'S PURE I](https://genius.com/Soil-halo-lyrics#note-17132658)NSIDE!!! MY LITTLE HALO

Druids are fantastic tank healers, and bear form can hold mega single-target threat with crowd pummellers

It depends on the people you are playing with

I got banned for calling myself a huntard

Hell yeah
---
In vanilla you could definitely heal the alliance NPCs in south of ratchet, durotar, theramore etc.
---
We almost there boyo - just wait and take it all in :)
---
You'll soon see why people get addicted and why a lot of people have taken time off of work for launch week.
---
Have fun!
---
They need to let people know a head of time.
---
Lies.
---
All that you can control is your behavior and your experience of the community. That means blocking and ignoring
---
i.. i couldn't deal with that.
---
You could make a funny meme for that lol
---
Does it upset you? Have you been on the internet very long?
---
XD
---
100% :P
---
Anyone that trades gold on retail for gold on classic should be permabanned. Just my opinion.
---
i write it on paper and stuff envelopes then mail it to myself!
---
imagine being the president of blizzard in 2019
---
yikes
---
Seriously it’s a just a name pick another one
---
Good games are good, no matter the year you play them. Like music, movies, or cooking recipes
---
“...I play to win...”
---
Play to win “what”, exactly?  I’m genuinely curious.   I’m still quite concerned about some (not all) players rushing to “win” and then returning “bored” a few months after launch.
---
Being a large aoe damage contributor was enough to tip the scales to a win very frequently.
---
I like the idea. If it's clearly way too full, they may want force people to 'transfer'
---
Blizz did said they intend to use it up to AQ events
---
Mee too. Seems like a bit of a shame really...
---
We had a petition but the post got removed on the official forum and the person who linked it was banned for a few days. Apparently it isn't allowed to let blizz know how many people are interested in something.
---
What are the blasted land buffs called?
---
If it's anything like Vanilla? Ha, no.
---
Private servers may influence the economy, and I admit I don't know jack about that, but Fadeleaf prices in Vanilla made me ditch everything and take up Herbalism.
---
Hunter or Lock
---
WOW, HALO, FF7, Cyberpunk, Outer Worlds.....  
---
My poor girlfriend and studies =(
---
First, let’s talk about ice cream. I like chocolate.
---
Even less reason for blizz to remove them to protect players from rushing to get them, then.
---
The comments in there are juicy as fuck, those shady bastard are going hard on the defensive. I hope they get banned.
---
no cloth tauren
---
Only helm and cloak my guy
---
I loved to kill people.  Intermittent distractions from a grind is nice. I also see no reason of becoming powerful if I can't use that power in the world I inhabit
---
I was mainly posting to focus on that aspect as this story is still developing. Developing in the sense that ape is having a flame war in the shazz discord and the classic forums are currently buzzing about the RMT side of things. However, like you, I think these services shouldn't be permitted at all so even if they're not RMTing (which the evidence heavily disputes), I would hope that blizzard would comment on the issue.
---
Why do you say classic was flawed?
---
Truly split, that's adorable
---
Wait. Were you in &lt;ransom &gt;?
---
Does that matter though?
---
Blizzard has said that a medium server now has more population than even the very most populated server back in the day.
---
Unfortunately, I don't think blizzard has revealed more specifics values to represent exactly what "medium" is, but my uneducated guess would be 15,000 players.
---
Additionally, I believe that there are a significant group of people who will be playing at launch, but who are not subbed to WoW for retail, and did not sub to WoW for the stress test.
---
But, ignoring that, lets just keep the number at 15,000 people. Say even 60% of them quit. That leaves 6,000 people, which if I remember correctly, is about as populated as the most populous servers back in the day.
---
It all depends on what qualifies as low, medium, high and full.
---
He actually turned out to be right. Which to me is actually the funny part. So many people want "vanilla" but there are a ton of different versions everyone wants. Now were getting true vanilla but a lot of people still aren't happy.
---
IMO Paladin T2 wins over all others and you can't convince me otherwise, although there are some other really great sets, such as warlock T3
---
another thing I forgot was how similar all the caster PvP sets look, it's annoying
---
They still made the idiot president of Blizzard Entertainment.  He's a big reason retail is the state it's in now.
---
Herbing for your blinding powder/thistle tea and maybe skinning for extra cash for that mount.
---
How are you people still having tantrums about this sentence move on
---
What was the reason blizzard gave for no unarmored mounts?
---
That's why these nobodies jumped so fast on assembling the server discords. Just another reason to pay them no mind, server discords go against everything Classic is meant to stand for. You're not meant to have such easy access to chat with the opposite faction.
---
Something something, realm forums. Yep. Realm forums were policed by blues, also didn't have DMs and 3rd party advertising.
---
Thanks for all the f@#$ing f@#$s - don’t change a word and let your cat howl when we all finally get to the final countdown!
---
If you have any extra soul shards, say you are going back to town, and you farmed more shards into your regular bags. You can just dump them into a guild bag easier. 
---
If you have some bag mod, this doesn't matter.
---
Ah, there we go then. Thx!
---
Check out gyazo. its easy and free, its all i use
---
Cleansing air totem for 20% threat reduction
---
I'm not disagreeing with you but Jay has done a fair amount to try to course correct on that. I still don't trust the guys vision of the game because that was a really out of touch thing to say but I'm willing to give him a bit of a break at this point.
---
Yeah, that was my line of thought.  I don't have any confirmation if fists are faster on the first autoattack than a slow 2h weapon, it's probably just confirmation bias on my part as I could never get the tag on my warrior during the stress test when I was using a 2h axe.
---
It matters in the fact that players who will actually be around for years may get frustrated and leave entirely, or at least not be able to play while someone who quits takes up their space on the server.
---
sap fails, I fondly remember playing my lock and from time to time a rogue would just pop up next to me and regret everything that came after =D
---
Yeah, I'd be willing to bet the majority of people aren't rolling as part of a guild.  They're either rolling solo or with a few friends.  I'm rolling with a few friends as well.  Got names on both Herod and Stalagg reserved.  Herod is our first choice, but we plan to feel it out.  If the queues are horrendous then we'll all just switch over to Stalagg.
---
There are definitely a good amount of people already rolling with a guild though.  I think it makes sense for those players to stay on Herod, since trying to get a whole guild of people to switch is just a pain in the ass.  For the people like us that are rolling solo or with a small group, Stalagg is an easy switch if Herod's queues are too insane.
---
Skyrim has been rereleased like 7 times in the last 10 or so years and I would get many people on this sub will admit to having bought it more than once.  When a game is good, it’s worth going back for sure.
---
At this point, no lol. Just wait 10 more days til release.
---
Nah, just wait and don't ruin yourself by over-learning the game before it's even out. Getting burnt-out and jaded is the biggest endgame monster
---
In retail I have a Rogue named Bean and a Warrior named Beanicus. I thought of having those names reserved for Classic. It's funny to see how many other Beans are out there.
---
But it hasn't grown, it's shrunk is my point.
---
And today I learned of the suffixes button in the bottom left! Cheers bud
---
This is even more confusing
---
Lmao
---
Fuck off then
---
I used to have an addon that would auto "ding!" in guild and take a screenshot when I leveled. It would also auto "grats!" when someone else said ding in the guild chat, lol. I have so many screenshots of my character just mid-jump on his mount, or standing by an npc after turning a quest in with the golden light surrounding him as he leveled. Good times.
---
Say you're trying to attack a move named Scorpid Badass. But the area also has many Scorpid Pleabian. If you /target Scorpid Badass and he isn't up, the macro will target a Scorpid Pleabian.
---
Whaaaaaaat!? It’s ok to have constructive criticism, but A) this is an appreciation thread which really isn’t the place for that, and B) you are just flat out wrong. I’ve listened to probably hundreds of podcasts and Josh is one of the most natural and unforced hosts there is in the business. And he is interviewing people who he has mostly just met over the internet and asking them questions. Take that shit somewhere else man, countdown and josh are the shit
---
yep, back in TBC days we'd always hit em with a stonard or TB port on top of the shatt when they least expected it
---
I used to always give my gold away if I decided to reroll on another server. It took me a few servers to find my home server so people all over got bits of gold. Haha
---
I also haven't really played since MoP and I am returning. I think it'll be fun no matter what.
---
Sorry there was a typo in my original reply. I said auction house instead of "bank"
---
The blizzard shills and wanna be game devs on this sub will tell you to give him a break.
---
The reality is he shamed a normal guy (like you or I) in front of thousands of people in an overly condescending manner who was asking a simple innocent question at a q&amp;a.
---
If he's going to be an ass to the fans that are paying his salary he better be able to take it when he turns out to be flat wrong.
---
Oh and I forgot to mention he goes way above and beyond to be active in the community that he created, far far more than most content creators.
---
If they remade diablo 2, KOTOR... I’d be just as if not more excited.
---
Where are the originals now?
---
I have fond memories of wow and I truly love it but I was just worried I was remembering it through rose-colored nostalgia haha
---
I believe that the minimum level to enter Scholomance (or any other level 60 dungeon) is level 48.  I don't know if a level 40 could enter a cleared BWL to access a lab there but I wouldn't count on it.
---
What'cha got for warlock?  
---
Been doing the same for general information and warlock specifics.
---
I think classic will be a good sandbox for a casual player. You can go at your pace and I don’t think you will have a shortage of people at any level.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAnd no one cares
---
Keep it going man!
---
Dude I am gonna have fun just sitting and fishing if it's a gaggle in the beginning. The smallest things made vanilla fun

They say this legend is level 110 already.

I appreciate it, I didn’t know what it did and was too lazy to google. Thanks!

even in reality this is wrong..

Meta: Would it be possible to get links to the other classy Friday threads in the post every week? Maybe just a link to the previous post, and you can chain them together? Idk, I like this thread and want to see more.
---
Doesn’t everything though?
---
It was not that hard to read. You might need some English lessons???
---
How much do you think blizzard pays him?
---
Hahaha absolutely this
---
I know: Add a free level boost to 60 and some heirloom items as incentive to transfer.  Or an alabaster mount. I'd transfer off Herod then!
---
Yes I have been. Madseason,tips,punkrat, all kinds of them like a psycho
---
It looks like the post you made was just harassment. It added no value and attacked someone specifically. Targeted harassment is bad no matter how justified you personally feel.
---
ill see you there brother
---
That's funny, because 80% of world firsts were alliance kills.
---
Never makes sense to me when people are upset about this tbh. It's first in, first served. If someone else got that name then it's important to them in the same way it's important to you and you're not more important than they are.
---
Dwarves take the throne
---
!remindme 9 days
---
For sure the people. Sadly, none of them are coming back but I met some solid friends in classic
---
Why didn't you put the ion name in
---
I can only speak for myself but personally I find Classic to be better for casual game-play. The reason I say that is because your progress doesn't get undercut every time a new patch comes out so there is a feeling of permanence to your progress. In retail I feel like I have to rush to get as much out of my progress before it gets invalidated.   
---
At the same time if you are only interested in raiding then MAYBE retail is the better option because you can get geared up so fast etc. but again it depends what you want to get out of it. I find raiding in classic to be a lot more social which I enjoy more.
---
Was thinking about dungeons first, raids second.
---
Can’t wait to hear that raid leader’s reaction when he calls for sui and the group zones in to repops.
---
&gt; If every game was made the same every year we'd all be bored.
---
FIFA? COD? Look how well they sell.
---
But some people don't want to be play private servers. There is a lot of wow to play on 60
---
Classic is like art, anyone can do it and how much you get out of it or how much joy it brings you is up to you. Do you want to spend just a few hours a week leveling and doing dungeons? Yes, you can do that in Classic. Do you want to spend most of that time in BGs or World PvPing? Yes, you can do that in Classic.           
---
If anything Classic is the MOST casual of all the expansions, it's massively more time consuming if you want to max level or raid, but it's all what YOU want to do.
---
Hell no. 
---
There I cast my vote.
---
they're actually pretty decent in PVP.. at least that's what I read elsewhere :)
---
but yeah, itemization was an issue in classic
---
Well yes, Undercity is a mess but Orgrimmar isn't that bad. It's more confusing post-cata
---
Not really. Being level 15 in classic is harder than ALL the content in retail that 99% of the playerbase will ever even attempt. Very few people do anything more than LFR. Even fewer even attempt Mythic Plus. Even fewer ever get close to ahead of the curve.
---
Most of the playerbase never even learn their rotation or the basic mechanics of 5 man dungeons. They don't know how raids work since they only do LFR. You can just out DPS/Out tank/Out heal everything in WoW without even trying until you get to the very high end. 
---
That's why its so hard for some to 'break in' to high end content. Retail does not require any level of skill or talent or game knowledge until you are attempting current end game content. 99.99% of retail wow is a faceroll, nothing more. Classic WoW will look like Dark Souls snorting Battletoads in comparison.
---
Still takes weeks. I'm part of a 150+ man guild from pservers and we all just kinda laughed when Blizz thinks we can coordinate to move to Stalagg in about a week. A week minimum is what's required to discuss if we even want to risk moving to a server that might die, let alone give up the names we have on Herod and spent weeks planning to reserve.
---
That there comment section is one giant cluster fuck. Lol.
---
Yes they are. Dungeons technically sheep is another button but not usually.
---
stalagg fam
---
Multi-Boxing still sucks. Stick to your boxer forums.

No, listen to episode #53 of countdown to classic. For good mages it's not a 1 button mash

Holy mother of Kentucky fried fucks that was some deep shit fam
---
Can you square something for me? On your stealth chart, you describe Stealth Rank 4 as being
---
&gt; Stealth (Rank 4) [60Lx5S/L=300S]
---
Working backwards it looks like you say that Stealth is 5 skill granted per level, eg Level 10 Rogue has 50 Stealth Skill. Which is kind of as expected.
---
But, database websites like WoWHead, which I believe pull their info from the client (??) have stealth values tied to the Rank of Stealth itself. See the individual ranks [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/rogue-abilities/subtlety/name:Stealth). 
---
When one clicks through to those ranks, it seems that the spell is described as granting a flat load of 4 skill at Rank 1 (level 1), 99 skill at Rank 2 (Level 20), etc and so on on Rank 3 and 4. Reading that looks like it's just adding on to a maybe innate 1 skill that is the baseline? IDK.
---
If that's accurate, and our Stealth skill levels come in big chunks, not in skill per level as expected, then levels 19, 39, and 59 could be particularly precarious levels to be trying to scoot around our mobs or bad PvP dudes.
---
Thoughts?
---
True Champions!
---
Why is Blizzard giving EU all the hard to pronounce realm names? Are they trolling us? I already feel insecure about speaking English so why do you make me try to say Shazzrah / Gehennas / pyrewood village etc.
---
Imagine being the guy to shit talk the man that hand delivered 300,000 printed signatures to Mike Morhaime which certainly had an impact on the consideration of making Classic a thing while simultaneously posting in a Reddit dedicated to Classic. 
---
Mark Kern most certainly was not the sole reason we all got Classic but you can bet he had a significant role in making it happen.
---
yeah you're right he should but still Jay allen brack humiliated himself with saying that. He probably regretted it and he has since changed his tone. I've heard he is in support of classic and we are getting a pretty damn good recreation of the game apart from a few issues. I'm still skeptical of blizzard but damn man the spite is real that was like 6 years ago...
---
What’s your thought on Primal Fury talent? Most raid fights are full rage bar anyway, is it necessary to get 5 more from Crit?
---
Also what’s your take on -1 point from HOTW for nature’s grasp?
---

At Most bossfights Mages only Spam frostbolt. There are some where u have to decurse or later in naxx u have to kite some adds..
---
In bwl most guilds let the mages aoe „Tank“ the goblin technicals, After lashlayer.
---
Short answer: Mostly frostbolt spam and use CDs
---
Enjoy the warrior mate! Did you see that victory dance of Miocic, hilarious
---
Of all my friends who are planning to play classic wow, _one_ is subbed. One.
---
Warriorrrrrs come out to playyyyyyeyaaaaay
---
Just logged in, only had 80k. Oh well
---
BRD run with a super suboptimal group. BM hunter with an AoE owl pet as tank, Warlock and Mage as CC and DD, me as an ele shaman as healer. I think we had a warrior as a tank first, but he left for RL reasons before we even managed to properly start the dungeon. Didn't feel like searching for an replacement, so we tried it with just four people.
---
It was hell. Hilarious hell. Detaily are hazy, what with it being roughly 13 years ago by now, but I remember a whole bunch of deaths. We surely spent four hours in there. In the end we didn't finish the dungeon, but ended it in the room with the four braziers you gotta light, after beating all the other bosses before that. Primarily because our mage (probably rightfully so) was super afraid of AoEing those mobs in there, without a proper tank to keep aggro off of him. But to this day it remains the one dungeon one that stayed in my mind the most. The hunter and I are still friends and we bring it up all the time when talking about the 'good old days'.
---
True. 30 levels w/o cat
---
Thanks for letting us know!
---
I'm seeing all this bullshit happening on other realms' Discord servers and our server (Pagle) managed to get legit chill admins with a laid back community.
---
We're angling to be the best server to be on. Feels good, man.
---
This. If you're trash you only use 1 button.  Good mages will know how to squeeze out more damage and utility
---
Same!! I never fully leveled a horde so i rolled a race I have never played and a class too. it's going to be like the first time all over again
---
This can be done in just a few lines of c#/Java, so I'm not really sure why people want the source lul?
---
Nordland for Dun Morogh is a great idea, might as well throw in some Blood on Ice once you reach Brewnall Village
---
Enjoy it. I played both in Vanilla &gt; WOTLK
---
Alliance in my view have more interesting zones and stories. The start zones alone cover magic forest through creepy woods through snowy mountains. On the Horde side, I always found the Barrens pretty boring. Undead and Tauren start zones are okay, but Durotar is seriously bland. That is a theme that repeats through out the game in Vanilla.
---
how did you get the horde and warrior icons on your name?
---
Aah ye that's it. I really though it was Chromie. Funny how your brain can fill up gaps so specific but so wrong.
---
I mean, that's what most people on my server called it back in vanilla.
---
Shadowpriest is one of the worst dps with today's knowledge. For example, Feral druids are better and you can be a Holy weaver so not needed for that either..
---
I'm going Holy priest myself but if you're consider MT or shadow priest as endgame I'd go Mt
---
Rogue was my first 60. It was horrible.

BATTLEGROUNDS- Admittedly WSG had it's moments where you'd stealth in and snatch the flag and run. Unfortunately druids are better at this, but you'd score if you knew what you were doing. More often than not you'd end up trying to hand it off to a warrior or druid after you'd made it midfield.   
---
AB/AV was a much more lame experience. You were effective at guarding flags or ninja-ing them if your opponents were AFK or braindead. 2v1 situations were crap because most people could break out of sap and then you were out of luck. YOu might also consider ambushing people at choke-points in AV, but it wasn't a very rewarding experience IMO.   
---
WEAPONS - You could be super dependent on gear, and in strange ways. IIRC one of the best daggers was the barman shanker because it had a high damage and LOW SPEED level, So that high number would get multiplied to calculate your backstab/ambush damage  
---
GRINDING/QUESTING - Solo grinding/questing was okay. I never felt like I had it as bad as I did on my warrior (my second 60). I played on a PvE server at first and I think I would've enjoyed being able to gank, but all I could do was /wave and /rude any alliance I came across. Nobody wants you in their 5-man groups though because you don't provide buffs, and you'll often be competing with tanks for weapon upgrades  
---
CLASSES TO AVOID - Warriors. Warriors. Warriors. Especially Arms warriors. You dodge, and it triggers their overpower.  Pallys also sucked because they could bubble/hearth.   
---
After I hit 60 and did MC (because my guild was nice enough to let me raid on their B-squad) I left my server and rolled a few different classes on PvP servers and it was a blast. I got a mage to 40, a druid to 30, and eventually a warrior to 60, and I'd probably never want to be a rogue ever again.   
---
It's probably worth mentioning the "world of roguecraft" video that pissed off everybody and mad it look like it was a cakewalk. That spec allows you to stunlock and kill someone every 10 minutes if you blow every cool-down in your arsenal. It's not exactly my definition of a "good time"
---
@OP same
---
You're not the moderators so don't go around trying to police like you are.
---
Stuff like that is what made the game great. The human element. I'm sure that still happens on retail still, but with the world so large and spread out now you rarely stumble over other people in low level zones. Thanks for sharing, made me smile :)
---
Considering the majority probably have not even subbed yet, they are going to need more.
---
Yes sir
---
I'm with you man going horde starting fresh first time ever always been alliance player !
---
I PVP a lot.  I will be getting rank 14.  But my destiny has been decided.
---
&gt;Imagine being the guy to shit talk the man that hand delivered 230,000 printed signatures to Mike Morhaime which certainly had an impact on the consideration of making Classic a thing while simultaneously posting in a Reddit dedicated to Classic.
---
Imagine shit talking the man who blew millions of dollars on a fucking party bus as a studio CEO and bankrupting a company costing nearly 100 people their jobs.
---
Imagine shit talking an irrelevant ass who feeds off the need to be injected into everything as if he is the reason for everything so that idiots like you lick his boot.
---
&gt;Mark Kern most certainly was not the sole reason we all got Classic but you can bet he had a significant role in making it happen.
---
No he absolutely fucking didn't, nostralius did by proving their was an audience and getting the medias attention about the closure of its servers that then led to the hack Kern wanting to inject himself into the situation because the media is covering something he has a passing association with.
---
it worked for me on private servers with the elvui unofficial 1.12 fork. it will probably be fine with the official version as well
---
There will definitely be early enchanters who want to get an early monopoly on selling enchants
---
The player base getting "better" at playing meant players like me would forever be left behind.  I gather and make stuff and don't give a whit about armor levels or pvp or dungeons.  The terrain was all changed (every expac), and expansions only meant there was yet another level of expansion I would never "complete".  Every guild I have ever been in since 2008 has melted down - except the guilds I have created and populated with my own alts for storage space.  I tolerated expansions as they came, enjoying the added flying in Azeroth with Cata, while bitching about the huge gaping chasm across the barrens in Kalimdor.  I have yet to see any way to run a toon (ON THE GROUND) from Booty Bay to Light's Hope Chapel while staying outdoors (you HAVE to go through/inside BlackRock to change zones there, unless you fly or port).  
---
Vanilla: No Draenei yet - my favorite race and cutest females
---
Burning Crusade - Yay!  Draenei appear! Still no flying in Azeroth yet.
---
Cataclysm - Yay! Flying in Azeroth finally!  Hmm - huge gaping chasms in places and Deathwing destroyed some nice areas.
---
Pandaria - um, Panda people? well, ok.  Oh!  Glyph of Nightmare for my Warlock!  Most awesome glyph effects EVER and useful functionality too!  My Warlock could use RIDE ON WATER with Dreadstead or Felsteed trailing FLAMING HOOFPRINTS!  Totally Awesome!
---
Warlords of Draenor- ... so of course Blizzard had to REMOVE the Glyph of Nightmare - along with about 400 other functional glyphs my Warlock Inscriptionist made profits selling.  From 500+ glyphs down to a little over only 100 ALL of which were now only cosmetic and essentially useless.  No more Warlock riding on water trailing flames.  No more profit selling glyphs made from inks from the MILLIONS of herbs that had been collected to fill two guild pages with inks.  Flying in Draenor?  I'd never have managed to get it without my spouse taking me on her X53 to hit the high spots.
---
Legion:  OK - Add a bunch of REQUIRED battle scenarios - ALL of which I avoided anyway.  I got my toons to Draenor through the secret underwater cave somehow and made their garrisons anyway - screw Broken Isles in this "broken" game.  An "open world" game should not REQUIRE the player to battle through dungeons if they don't want to.  Not to mention, that now Blizzard broke all the (admittedly TOS violating) "things' people did that modified their own alts appearance on their OWN screen only and which made absolutely no difference to the player's power or game play.  Changing from MPQ to CAS files only slowed the patches down and prevented custom models. 
---
BFA - I don't know why I even bothered to upgrade one of my THREE accounts to BFA.  I'd still have to play through Legion to do anything in BFA and I didn't see anything in either Legion or BFA that I actually WANTED to do.  Meanwhile, people who had actually played Legion got their hard won gear artifacts nerfed or changed or whatever, and I'm like "Are you really that surprised?"  Blizzard giveth and Blizzard taketh away.
---
What next? WoW "Classic" - uh huh - 90% of my WoW alts have always been Draenei, in my opinion, the best looking (females at least) race in all of Warcraft.  But they are not present in Classic.  Why didn't Blizzard use a little wisdom and look to see "hmm - which expansion had the MOST EVER players in WoW history? Let's ressurect THAT expansion!"  I don't know if it was Wrath or Cataclysm, but either would have been acceptable.  And yet, do they learn from mistakes?  I hear now that eventually WoW Classic will be upgraded to Wrath and I'm wondering are we DOOMED to repeat the entire last 15 years?  
---
Blizzard, if you want to resurrect and older version of the game, pick one that had the MOST PLAYERS EVER, then bring that online AND LEAVE IT ALONE EXCEPT FOR BUG FIXES!  Let everyone get their addons working and quite breaking all the addons with periodic minor (or any other) level updates. Maybe build in some system where people can "mog" their gear to LOOK LIKE ANY DARN THING THEY WANT!  Who really CARES what it LOOKS like anyhow?  If the people in MoonGuard want to run around with no bikini's, create some way to allow verified adults to turn off the bikinis appearance on THEIR OWN display and leave them showing to other players. Hey, maybe you could charge REAL MONEY to players to enable the feature!  
---
All that said, the most brilliant thing Blizzard has done in the last decade was to add WoW Tokens.  They only allow real money to flow INTO the Blizzard's coffers and they discourage illegal gold buying from sites that hack players accounts.   Blizzard sets the auction price of WoW tokens to balance the economy.  It's a win-win solution that I'm sure has cut the gold sellers profits and helped reduce people getting their accounts hacked.
---
Blizzard: Bring back the Glyph of Nightmare, if no others.  And don't forget to include the trails of flaming hoofprints and the riding on water capability for those Warlocks.
---
Cool more Mage power. Maybe warlocks will get a lil benefit too
---
Stalagg Gang where my bois at?
---
Not everyone enjoys MMOs as much as others might, but imo, classic wow is the best mmo.out there, by a vast margin. Definitely give it a solid shot.
---
all the druid sets looked really really cool to me.
---
[You're never too low to have a STV flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teldsUlHiI0)
---
Are you flagged in the entire entrance area or just the arena floor?
---
I had a similar concern about FAP for Druids but I don't think there is any pre AQ/4 Dragons.
---
Mostly pornhub sometimes Netflix
---
And maaaaaybe, just maybe, I was stating an opinion for the sake of discussion, but whatever.
---
Raiding, essentially. Dungeons, pvp, and farming you’ll use the whole toolkit. Most classes have the ‘standard’ raiding spec which are fairly monotonous. In spite of that you’ll have to challenge yourself while performing encounter mechanics to stand out from other raid members.
---
Yes it is. You can do some good dmg with mind blast - SWP - Mind Flay before you start wanding and yet never run oom.
---
Everyone respeccs at 40 for that reason. Then you start getting Wand specc again.
---
Enjoy your 10 000+ queue. Guessing you have neither school or work or anything else in your life?
---
;)
---
Not really in dungeons or pvp, but on single target boss fights you do end up mostly using frostbolt. 
---
Thing to keep in mind though, practically nobody has a very complicated rotation for single target boss fights.
---
Yeah if J Allen Brack, really actually cared at all, I'd like for him to come out on stage at Blizzcon and apologize. Admit it was a great idea and publicly apologize for being so condescending to a fan who honestly just cares about the game.                   
---
Heres the reason why he won't, Blizzard would rather be hated then admit they made a mistake and this is typical corporate behavior, once you apologize for one thing then people will expect it from any future goofs, companies will break their own legs rather than walk out onto a platform and admit they fucked up.
---
The majority of the items are used by warlocks also! It’s a very similar increase for them as well.
---
Reddit is a tiny fraction of the wow classic population
---
Yes. YES!
---
And yet you found me here?
---
I always have a macro for /g gratz
---
It really depends on the content and phase/raid but overall no they are not however there will be certain fights when you are essentially just using different ranks of frostbolt. Don't forget about things like poly, mana agates, evocation, blizzard nova and cone of cold with coldsnap on add packs in some cases. That doesn't even cover later phase fire specs and ignite. Also in pvp they are amazing.
---
I had [these](https://imgur.com/a/ca6GrD2) on the Rogue I played during the last stress test. It just swapped my Main and Off-Hand weapons so I could Backstab in Stealth and then back to my Main for Sinister Strike. I don't remember too much about how Main/Off for Rogue's worked in Vanilla but I think you wanted a slow Main and fast Off, at least if you were Combat Spec. This was before I got Cheap Shot too but it's still helpful for some I'm sure.
---
Also ran DM and got a Blackwater Cutlass and was able to use that as my Off out of Stealth while having the Dagger in my bags and swap it with the Cutlass (Main Hand) when needed using this same Macro.
---
Ehhh, it was an interesting read but I'm just not super bothered about joining a realm's discord for some reason, takes away from it a bit I guess.
---
12 years playing alliance, rolling undead priest on a pvp server, girlfriend is rolling warrior, we are going to bathe in Alliance blood!
---
Solution: just move if you don’t want the massive queues.
---
Im moving to herod all these people leaving means there will be 15 less people in the queue.
---
Yeah unlike in real _adult_ games. If you did in the matrix, you die in real life!
---
I'm still trying to decide what pet to use for raiding. I'm stuck between cat and wind serpent (maybe owl too? does screech override demo shout?). Which one is better? In my small amount of testing their damage was comparable.
---
Probably what he meant by a regular user. Aka one that buys the services from them
---
Gifto ode Wild!
---
It wouldn't be the fastest way to earn gold but it won't fail you.  All the crafters will always need ore, herbs, leather, cloth, etc.  And I imagine if you're diligent enough from the get-go you could have some sway in dictating what they pay.  Chances are I'm doing exactly this.  Herbalism and mining while leveling then once at 60 switching, most likely alchemy and enchanting.
---
Thunderfury here i come.
---
No way.
---
Well, at least actiblizz will give us free time to compensate for whatever downtime ma- pfft, bwahahahaha!
---
Sorry, couldn't make it all the way though, I tried, I really did.
---
Now that's a boomer meme
---
Maruku of da Wilude
---
Dude I cant believe he won that.  I was watching and was like "yupp so SP.." then last round he completely changed his style and dominated.
---
Because Classic is a LARGE percentage of the community, present and PAST (and that's huge, getting back old players), that is stating very clearly that they reject the design decisions of the team. 
---
The designers have been pushed in one direction by shareholders and the head honcho.  They are still capable of designing a good game, when given a reason to.
---
It's like the owner of a restaurant that wants the chef to make his mom's shitty lasagna.  The chef can probably make way better lasagna, and now that enough people have sent back the owner's bullshit, the chef can take a crack at it.
---
Doesn't WC3 make too much of WoW nonsensical? Such as Night Elves in the Alliance and no Ogres in the Horde...
---
Let people know you are new, and for the love of god, don’t roll on items that are for other classes!
---
a) nobody will have much gold to buy anything, so everything will sell for barely above vendor price.
---
b) as someone who will invest all my gold early to make gold later... I'll buy ALL your shit (at barely above vendor price)
---
Ye. Is bezt race, truefax.
---
World of WARcraft.
---
Woo! Shadow priest is better now too ;)
---
Go to your browser and log into your blizzard account from there, go to the overview of your games and licenses, theres a bar to the left that says games, click on it, scroll down and then select wc3, whichever of the two you want to play. After downloading and installing you will get prompted to insert your cd key or to validate your wc3 reforged prepurchase with your blizzard account, select the second option, log in and boom you are done.
---
Cool.
---
wolf gives furious howl and should be your goto. wind serpent will let you do damage at range with it. Its quite good for personnal dps. Kinda need the one from ZG (so not at launch) for the rank 3 lightining breath though. Expect to be nagged by your party mates to just bring furpaws instead though. If you bring a cat it will just die in fire and has no buff abilty. Expect barely audible yet passively aggressively resentful huntard mutters over discord.
---
14 is amazing but that's just a good example of a modern mmorpg. Doesn't compare to old school mmos like classic.
---
No, this is Thex
---
The login screen is static 16:9

But once you log in, [21:9 is fully supported](https://i.imgur.com/34bUgjg.jpg)
---
Good.
---
i've not seen a single post like that
---
Imagine spending 15 dollars sub fee to play Moses simulator 2003 an wander the desert for 40 levels.
---
I think Blizzard should make this an alt universe and go for lateral progression content updates, where you stay at 60 but do new content (not vanilla content, new content for Classic+).   
---
After doing this for a bit,  make a whole new expansion for Classic+ which keeps all that was loved about vanilla but with a different alternate universe story.
---
There should never be a point where all the servers have a queue.  That's would be ridiculous if it happened.  They're not going to turn customers away who are willing to be flexible with their realm choice.  That's just bad business.
---
Blizzard can scale their realms up to however many shards they want.  The point of the login queues are to nudge people off the most populated servers onto the least populated servers to try and balance out the server populations.  If all the servers were evenly populated, there would be no point for blizzard to have any queues.
---
If they realms get to the point where ALL the realms simultaneously have too many players, then Blizzard has a solution... a new server which won't have a balanced pop, and won't have a queue.
---
Yeah same. Gonna stock up on elemental earth aswell and when AQ hits.. $$$$$
---
Not Penny's boat
---
Same here took a week off from work just to make sure I get my Classic fix during that week. I’d rather be off than be at work thinking about playing...
---
Isn't this the guy that told us "you think you do, but you don't."?
---
Just play with a friendly Paladin 😁
---
I'm kinda getting the same vibe from whitemain so far. The discord just seems to be full of people that I wouldn't want to hang out with, online or real life.
---
Nah my friend said he did it back in Vanilla, to get a player that pissed him off banned. Just wanted to see if Blizz has any procedure for something like this.
---
Why are we waiting at the Washington Monument? I don't have a laptop to bring with me and it takes like 5 hours to get home from there.
---
Please don't make me go.
---
I got into vanilla beta because I was on a Mac and there were plenty of keys left.
---
There was like 2 weeks after beta before vanilla launch where I was jonesin' for WoW. I tried every Neverwinter Nights persistent world I could find, trying to scratch that itch.
---
These days I been getting antsy and forum warrioring as I wait for Classic to drop, it's like a mix of waiting for Classic and waiting for TBC expac to launch.
---
We're feeling it.
---
Tauren you uncultured swine.
---
1) Blizz is well aware of this tactic to get people banned.  This has happened before.
---
2) Asmon has no incentive to buy gold and take such a risk given he makes a living from playing wow.  Especially when he has an army of people who will give all their gold/items to him.  There is no upside to him buying gold.
---
3) Asmon has no history of doing shit like this.
---
So no, this would not work to get asmon banned.  Maybe some other, much smaller streamers, but it would only be temporary.
---
Does PTO mean "play time online"? That was all I could come up with, means something much different to me.
---
Chunkrat has been putting out some good content
---
Lol Miocic did the Dwarf dance after he won. That was the joke
---
Merging servers is always a last ditch effort solution. There are lots of risks in doing so. It is much easier to just spin up new ones.
---
Sounds like a fun guild. I hit 60 on a couple pservers, what's your guild name?
---
Thing is if you’re Herod you won’t get in any day for the first week at the very least. Will be hours queues. So if you have a few hours after work you just won’t have time to get in then play.
---
Okay then maybe my friend was a liar. He said he got someone he didn't like banned in Vanilla by buying them gold.
---
Totally replied to the wrong person. Mobile woes. Oh well.
---
I skip Primal Fury in my cat/bear hybrid build that I will use while leveling and when I first hit 60. You can live without it as long as you only tank one or two targets at a time. I take it in my tanking-focused builds though. Each hit of Swipe can crit and return 5 rage (up to 15 rage returned per Swipe) which is important for AoE threat.
---
Not a fan of 1 point in Nature's Grasp. You have to leave bear form and burn a global cooldown to cast it, then you have to wait for a 35% chance to proc on top of that. You're taking a lot of unnecessary damage just sitting there waiting for it to proc. Better to travel form -&gt; get 8 yards out -&gt; Bear Form -&gt; Feral Charge. Then you can step back and cast Entangling Roots while they're rooted from Feral Charge.
---
Eventually, you will get the 4-piece PvP set bonus, which increases your movement speed by 15% in bear form. You don't even need to use travel form to get away from people once you get that. Just strafe until you're 8 yards away, then Feral Charge, step back, cast roots, and watch Warriors + Rogues cry.
---
That basically gives you a free 3% by using Rhok.
---
Holyshit 0_0
---
I get where you're coming from, but vanilla really isn't difficult enough to swear by pure objective performance.
---
Day 4,597 over become enthralled with watching old pvp videos, nothing else can seem to satisfy at this point we are so close yet so far.....
---
Imagine how many people would do this if it was possible. Just pay $5 to get someone you hate banned. 
---
Yeah trust me it’s not possible.
---
I personally think there will definitely be some portion of the population that purchases gold from farmers, and no doubt some of it will get "donated" to Asmon and other streamers. But how is that different from the rest of the economy that will be affected by the influx of gold? How is that different from the rest of the gold that him and other streamers are gifted in general?
---
In Asmongolds situation he has stated multiple times he will not be taking donations until he is already 60 and the raids are on farm. Obviously whether or not he sticks to that is neither here nor there, and other streamers certainly wont all have his tact in this regard.
---
I don't see how you can punish a single person in that situation other than the farmer and the person they buy from. There is no watermark to distinguish legitimated obtained gold from gold farmed gold.
---
Because I haven't taken a vacation in a year and I have a shitload of time saved up (enough for 2-3 vacations lol). Wife's on board. It'll give me time to work on an alt or two.
---
I haven't been able to really spend time like this on a game since high school/college so I decided to make a trip out of it.
---
Why not, I figured.
---
A really good player can go 1-60 rather easily without dying on a pve server.    Doing that on a pvp server will be a lot harder.  The element of playing against another human adds a lot challenge.
---
Best post im gonna see here all day 🤓❤
---
Gz
---
Depends how long you want to be in the raid twice a week
---
Out of curiosity, why are you dreading it?
---
It does, but that's 10 seconds of CC you have, 13 if you get 2/2 clever traps
---
In what raid scenario is doing 700 hps going to be better than doing 1000? If you have to tank youre gunna get one shot with or without your leather by the first crushing
---
The thing about single target farming is that, in terms of efficiency, it's a waste of time. With your mana pool, you can take down 2-3 mobs with single target. So why not take down 15 with your mana pool?
---
Bud, your best bet is just find a guild. A group of friends that won't judge you for being hazy. You can experience the game together with them, and all be happy at re-learning everything with one another. My guild is like that and I &lt;3 them for it. They don't talk down to people who don't have it all memorized. They help them. You should find a crew like that.
---
Or hey, if you're rolling on Myzrael hit me up. I'll play with you and help you remember stuff. =)
---
Vurtne elemental mage ❤❤❤ played nothing but blastwave/iceblock. It was the shizzle!
---
Dont post questions on reddit that you can find the answer to in 5 seconds on google.
---
Man that's awesome. Shit I'm jealous, I would use a year's worth of sick/personal days to do that. Good for you, enjoy it!  I didn't mean to seem like a dick.  If you're one of the first to 60 you can always help others level and be the hero of your server.  I hope you're on mine!
---
Reminds me more of Lineage 2 tbh
---
I had some cold confiscated in WOD for buying gold to use on my dead sever’s BMAH. I did the AH list expensive nonsense method of delivery.
---
 I woke up thinking I’d have my gold buy saw an email with a warning and notice that they took it. I logged in and there was 0 of the 20k gold I had when I logged out, but all of the 500k I bought sitting in my mailbox from the auctions.
---
Yes, the guild bank in Classic logs everything. Make sure to donate some gold to your GM to help pay for the additional tabs.
---
Yea you're reallllly exaggerating this.  You will get on your server within an hour on day 1, just might have to wait.  If you really are under the impression NOBODY will get onto Herod for a week.. that's absurd man.
---
login / loading screens will have black bars down the side. the game will be in 21:9 and it looks beautiful!
---
I'll admit: blood elf racials used to confuse me a little.
---
Considering Draenei get their +15 Jewelcrafting racial, a profession which came in the same expansion as they did, it is only common people also think Enchanting came in TBC because of Blood Elves and their +15 Enchanting racial. If you haven't played vanilla like I did that alone can also be subject for thinking it's a TBC profession. So I feel you.
---
Based on your reply, you're missing the point of what I said entirely.
---
&gt;Herod could experience 10k queue   
---
&gt;

&gt;at a minimum

Command + Shift + 4 will allow you to click and drag a rectangle around what you want to take a screenshot of. It will save it as a .png file on your desktop.
---
Damn and I thought I was hyped for classic.  I just can't afford more than a day off work.
---
Asmon was just a hypothetical. Jesus. Wish I didnt say his name.
---
Could you expand on how Blizz handles this?
---
Paid Time Off
---
Because blizzard isn't retarded.
---
Same thing you did on your computer the day before. People acting like they cant just play PubG while in queue on a second monitor.
---
Maybe in a guild pushing record times, but there is most certainly a guild that will accept that kind of gear without much scrutiny if the player is decent, let alone good.
---
If it was a warrior chasing you it was probably me.
---
Yeah that was what I was concerned about. Which is why I asked the question, seemed like a fat loophole.
---
Sounds like a tool
---
Sub count doesn’t matter unless it drops to the point of unsustainability. Mmos get stale after a few expansions since your only doing the same thing you did last expansion in a new place with some changed mechanics.
---
You don't need to change out of an optimal leveling spec to start collecting gear.  You can pick up resto gear in enhancement spec.
---
Oh shit TIL, just got this thing
---
You're actually retarded nvm.
---
Did you try reading the content presented by the original poster or did you just get your panties bunched up over nothing?
---
Just like a bot, actually...
---
And you don't know how it works =)
---
I've been looking for the same thing. Noticed the author had updated the mod on curseforge a few days ago for retail, but nothing for classic as of yet. Though it's the same author as Bartender4 and Shadowed Unit Frames which both seem to have classic versions available, so there might be a good chance for Quartz.
---
In case it doesn't happen, eCastingBar seems decent.
---
Seriously? Wow, thanks! I guess I just assumed it wouldn't be available.
---
Lol I was shat on by this sub when I mentioned this months ago. The reality is that communication has changed. There will be cross-faction coordination. Just like on private servers. There are situations where an Alliance guild is farming a location, and some new Alliance competition moves in, so they contact their Horde buddies to come gank those competing Alliance. 
---
The question is what stance Blizzard will take on this, as it absolutely didn't exist in Vanilla on the scale that it does exist in private servers, and the scale that it will exist in Classic.
---
Whenever I hear billy maclure the first thing that comes to mind is: [https://youtu.be/G-ZHAZv8Xk4?t=7m44s](https://youtu.be/G-ZHAZv8Xk4?t=7m44s)
---
You haven't disproven me, so it's you who is wrong.
---
I enjoy PvP.
---
I find it much more gratifying and exciting to kill a player, than to kill a boar.
---
I like to be able to kill people who are farming the same mobs/resources as me. To create less of a competition.
---
Getting killed by higher level players has never been a huge issue for me. Sure it happens a few times, being in danger of an attack spices things up for me.
---
Players bring a competition that PvE doesn’t have, countering or changing strategies to kill you. A boss will always act how you expect (well, you might get weird RNG with deep breaths)
---
I think in the end it all comes down to personal preference.
---
My best memories playing WoW are almost always world PvP with friends. It’s just part of the game that I love. 
---
Some people hate PvP, which is why they have PvE servers.
---
I like his format. Sit by the fire and let's chat.
---
Good luck with your twitch income ;)
---
Very nice
---
Death Knights would also like a word with you.
---
Thank you so much! :\*)
---
Fiscally responsible, love it
---
It's okay, not knowing the basics of WoW qualifies you for a career as a top streamer nowadays.
---
&gt; or at least not be able to play while someone who quits takes up their space on the server.
---
I'm not sure I understand correctly. what do you mean?
---
I think it’s good discussion
---
It was changed before 1.12
---
I’m jelly! Forgot about the holiday though! Thanks for the reminder!
---
Yeah Medivh was all like "bring your Horde to Kalimdor" but look at this shit - Durotar, Barrens - all dry and scorpion invested
---
The eastern Kingdoms is where it's at!
---
You’re gunna fall behind ;)
---
Just use your fingies 🤷‍♂️
---
Conservative goal! What class?
---
Green with envy...
---
Most people who have played it, have quit. That's not great evidence that most people are happy playing retail.
---
Overlord is an amazing anime/LN/manga and I recommend everyone watch/read it.
---
You might be underestimating the belly crawl nature of vanilla wow.  I would consider 2-3 hours to be limited time as well.
---
Usually talking to general helps.
---
Get some other people from your faction together to drive away the ganker. Which promotes more PvP.
---
I know I'm in the wow sub but now I want to hear him do the Diablo one!
---
You get placed in a layer before you have even logged in? Doubt.. If that was the case then why did they open more stress test realms when the other were full with an insane queue? It's your character who is placed in a layer, not your account.
---
This is great advice and you sound like an awesome, supportive player :)
---
My issue is that I'm predicting at launch, all of us guildless peeps will be bombarded with messages/whispers/posts on forums/etc about guilds and I'd prefer to play with people awhile before I commit. I don't like the idea of guild-hopping or taking an invite immediately based on a 15 min interaction with someone on just 1 quest or whatever. I'm a super casual player now but when I'm logged in I want to get stuff DONE and that's a weird dichotomy to juggle- finding a guild that's casual and doesn't have strict requirements but also isn't so laid back that every time I log in people are just fishing or whatever and don't wanna do anything. And knowing that's kind of specific I don't want to waste peoples' time or earn a reputation for being picky or whatever :) Yep, I'm neurotic.
---
Have fun :)
---
Yes absolutely.  
---
Try as hard as you can to not downloaded any addons until 60. Don't do instant quest text.   
---
That's about it
---
LOL
---
:O
---
 Cool.
---
This made me lol. Well played.
---
Everyone who plays PvE is a fucking noob. Anyone who is playing on a pvp server is superior, you can't smoke shit but easy to beat instances. Imagine rolling pve for less than 4 hours worth of raiding a week hahaha
---
No way I'd face you, I'm not a girls dick on a PvE server, geez youre bad
---
Herod is gunna be nuts...
---
The system that classic will use is expensive mounts, cheap training.
---
Then you haven’t been looking at the subreddit since name reserves, it’s been a plague lol I’ve seen at least 2-3+ a day, way more the first day or 2 after. Then the comments with them are a flood of people doing the same thing. It’s kinda wild
---
There is maybe grid but the blizzard UI makes mouse over macros much more manageable for healing.
---
Yup the very same
---
Well, if you spend any money on entertainment at all, WoW is likely a better deal. If not, /salute!
---
Youre going to have to account share and PvP like 16+ hours a day between the two of u if u want rank 14.. And if ur rolling on herod that still might not be enough
---
The over reactions are priceless
---
Just go with the people you like more, and let the people you didn't choose why.  Problem solved:).
---
The second ring is for extreme angler bois only tho
---
They would probably investigate it if it became a problem. Asmon doesn’t need to buy gold due to his position in the community.  He can get gold whenever he wants as I’m sure you know. Blizzard would not ban him because they know he wouldn’t do something stupid like that to compromise his job. 
---
If you sent it to a random person that isn’t a public figure in WoW, then that is a different story.  I’m sure if they’ve got enough gold sent to them from strange accounts they would at least be questioned.
---
what are you talking about? the point of furious howl is it buffs our rogues and warrs.
---
Please, for the love of azeroth you braindamaged normie learn how to use your pc
---
The recent "why your class sucks/rocks" segments have been informative and hilarious. I love hearing the various reasons why people love their class.
---
Its gotta be the pve realm thing right? People not caring about ganking or pvp shit. Just playing the game
---
No feel free to buy gold for my character
---
were you there? in those irc channels seeing the number of people yourself?
---
Bunch of friends rolled on PvE but I wont ruin my experience to play with them.
---
Go fuck yourself, he's exposed some scumbags.
---
Just get into the assassins creed series. Some games are a bit different so you might not love all, but every game is excellent!
---
Only upset there would be release of unity, was quite buggy but fixed in a few weeks and is an amazing game now. After the backlash they decided to only release AC games when they felt finished. Origins and odyssey after that have been super!
---
I'm always more hyped for a new AC than anything else.
---
No, too far
---
Love the podcast! Will it become Countup from Classic soon?
---
Proof?
---
I just finished bingewatching all of captain grim's videos on youtube. Almost all of his videos are gold.
---
What addon?
---
Realm discord owners using their influence for financial gain?  This sounds like stuff that happens every day on a much larger scale in government and politics, but no one gives a damn and no one gets punished.  But mess with some autist's vidya game and man, you're going down.
---
Business partners?  Coffee &amp; Agony’s elemental earth compendium
---
Any time.  Wow is one of those games that I think everyone should try for a while.  It might not stick with new players who enjoy fast/shiny games, but for people who can let themselves go and want a world that is alive that they can just dive into...it's something that they can enjoy in so many ways and a very long time.  Hope you have a great time there!  :)
---
This is a dangerous idea.
---
I dont want my healers to have any self respect.
---
Reckoning is also pretty worthless in pve
---
If you manage to get your account hacked in 2019 you're a dumbass.
---
*Ayyy Lmao*
---
This.
---
I can't be 100% sure without logging on since Pservers are different but I would sell your armor/weapon over food/water since the early levels food is far more important
---
Follow the group and don't dawdle. I've done these dungeons plenty of times and you can bet i'm ready to get lost again when classic comes out.
---
Only thing I can really say is don't fall in wailing caverns.
---
Yes because I want my server to actually be alive at all times of day, I want to be able to makes an UBRS group at 3am, so queues 9-5 don't matter to me in the slightest.
---
Only useful thing on there is guild recruitment. If anyone has a better suggestion let me know.
---
Perfection!
---
You'll want to keep a bag of Soul Shards in your bank just in case you need them for a raid or something.
---
So you can make a Soul Shard bag and put it into one of your bank's bag slots. When you right click a shard to put it in your bank, it should prioritize going into the Soul Shard bag first.
---
You got me curious, so I looked around for a bit, and I think this is the video you mean :
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7urKwC2PY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7urKwC2PY)
---
Wow changing Stratholme's map layout such a game changer in the lore!
---
They have some sick animations with two-handers tho, I really liked playing troll warrior in wrath for that reason
---
Pretty sure they saw the larger numbers on PvP and chose based on that.
---
That bot is the single best and worst thing i've seen on reddit this week...
---
All my friends ended up levelling their low level humans (aka kids) in real life and have no time to play anything anymore. :/
---
That's not my point though. Obviously people aren't content with the direction of the game, otherwise we wouldn't have lost like 80% of the subs.
---
Clearly people still like the WoW franchise since during new expansion launches they always sell alot of copies however people quickly realize that it's trash.
---
It certainly was not this bad before. When pumps were actually good, bloom was not as tweaked and shit as it is now and they did not add in all the fucking crutches for shitters to win the game was good. I love the game, the characters, skins and the building but my god they have ruined the competitiveness of the game over time.
---
If you are in top 3 as a warlock, you have terrible warriors, rogues and mages rofl.
---

Love it

I find this really strange and somewhat unbelievable. Judgement is arguably worse than pre-bis gear to heal with. Either you were lucky being in a guild not caring enough or they were ignorant to what good Pala gear was.

I'm considering investing in that Huel meal replacement I'm constantly seeing advertisements for.
---
I mean there’s some guy: let’s call him Dave. 
---
Dave is 32. Has a family and a 40 hour a week job but misses his Vanilla experience, and intends to put in 10-20 hours every week. Until day 1, when Dave is #12348 in the queue, and he’s thinking “fuck this, I work too hard to sit around waiting in my free time”. And that’s totally understandable. So Dave decides this isn’t the game for him. Dave would have had a wonderful experience with Classic. He would have played for years, progressing with his casual guildies. 
---
Instead, there’s some douscher named Kyle streaming to an average of 6 people, trying to “speed level” to 60, gets to 30 and decides its hard, rolls a new toon. On his new toon, Kyle gets to 35, and moves onto the next game released on the hype train because he didn’t attain internet fame through WoW like he expected. 
---
Kyle is going to be there. I get that. We can’t avoid it. And I genuinely don’t care. My only problem with it, is when Kyle is playing on the server, taking up space that Dave could have used and would have kept him around. We’re going to lose a lot of Daves because of the thousands of week 1 Kyles. The Kyles can log in at 10AM while all the Daves are at work, and when Dave comes home at night after a long day of work he doesn’t want to spend an hour of his two hours of free time that day waiting in a queue.
---
Thing is I've been around. Maybe I'm cynical but I believe people do things for some kind of benefit. If anyone says they are spending all the effort making and upholding realm communities out of pure altruism I don't believe them.
---
I've been looking for a pvp video from VERY early days of wow. back when before i even got 60, a 60 paladin fighting a 60 shaman in winterspring and for some reason it was so awesome to see. i think it was the first pvp video i ever saw that were 60's fighting. i haven't seen it in way over a decade.
---
Exactly this. Do not advertise this realm. It is already medium, which blizz has said is higher than high on the old server counts. Upon launch it will have a ton of people flocking to it which have not gotten their names yet. We need it to stay medium until launch to ensure a clean launch with minimal queues.
---
filthy casual.
---
Do both if you can lol
---
And that's healthy. I've played on private servers for years, and it was always just one of those things that owners tended to, eventually, sell out. I get that it's super common, and power corrupts, etc., and all I can do is promise I won't do that, but I'd like to think that my promise means something because I don't have much power to begin with, nor do I care to gain more.
---
I've run quite a few subs over the years, and even one that I shut down because the company that the sub was based around became vaporware (I didn't want to subject users to pre-ordering something that was never going to come, so I shut down the sub instead of allowing it to continue, even though I could have given out my own promo code that would have benefited me financially).
---
It's a shame when this kind of thing happens, and just goes to show that humans are still human, prone to terrible judgement, and always at risk of corruption. As long as we maintain a smart control over the level of power people wield, we'll always come out on the other side. I guess what I'm saying is: let me prove to you that r/Atiesh is going to stay away from this kind of thing; let me prove to you that there are better people out there. Some people are motivated by money, while some of us are motivated by getting the chance to be part of this game in ways that require a good reputation. I'll try my best to make sure that all of us at r/Atiesh are **always** transparent, logical, and fair in everything we do.
---
hearing this instantly relaxed me...
---
That was kinda weird. Great music, great playing :)
---
Hand of Justice is not "guranteed"
---
and this is only for horde, and doesnt include alliance items
---
Play the game at launch. Don't be stressed about the power leveling folks. I've played wow before and I'm gonna enjoy my self. Relaunching a game like this never happens on such a scale. This is a rare chance for both new and old players, take advantage of it. 
---
Wow classic has much more to offer than endgame raids. Those dinging 60 first will be bored waiting for everyone else.
---
I completely agree.
---
It will definitely be gone by phase 2.  That is why Blizzard has made it publicly known that there is the potential for very high queues for certain servers like Herod once layering is removed.  Basically, you have been warned, if you stay it's on you.
---
I just got a new high end PC and didn't realize until right fucking now it doesn't have a CD ROM drive.... how will I play WC3 now?  Any advice?  I assume I need an external CD drive now..
---
I'll check it out, what faction?

That's because the source of them confirming it is a video, not a post.

This dude explained he was buying gold. I was level 30. I dont know why but he said to me " When it finally goes through ill hook you up." Dude randomly handed me 50g like 3 days later.
---
Druids are virgins anyway.
---
Pretty sure blizzard doesn't even ban gold buying that often, they just send you an email telling you how gold buying is bad. They much prefer to ban the gold sellers than chase down buyers
---
What addon is this that alerts you to nearby stealth usage? Sounds neat for when I'm playing music or streams and don't hear the sound.
---
Playing Warrior is braindead in BFA.  
---
Maximizing dps using Warrior is actually very skill based. Play BFA Fury spec and optimize your dps and rotation. That means no rage wasted overcap, and keeping key abilities on cooldown. When to rampage and when not to ... so forth.
---
OCE ARUGAL - my mate Druid (feral) OT and me Shamman or Priest LF horde or alliance guild raiding early morning around (6am  AWST)
---
Dailies sucked back then &amp; sucks now as well
---
It's a lot less stealthy. Easier to detect. I seen the numbers before but cant quote them accurately. 
---
But plenty great for a hunter to be invisible at a flag and get the jump on someone unawares.
---
Frostbolt!!! Got enough crit and hit to roll fire? FIREBALL!!!! IGNITE TICK STACKING but only one mage gets the tick stack so... inflated dps!!!!! yea, thats your endgame raid rotation sorry.  
---
unless youre some winterchill fire spec support build. then youll weave in some frostbolts to keep up winterchill.

Should be able to open Blizzard app choose wow classic and start downloading now since you can reserve you name's already.
---
For sure - but this is why this final week is important - find a guild now and let launch be the ice breaker :) I'm pretty sure most people will be patient with strangers at least for the first few months. Have fun!
---
Also the population. Gehannes is already at high status and game isn't even released yet.
---

---
You have been able to install it for ages. Change it from battle for azeroth to world of warcraft classic in the battle.net app

yes and the dl is only just over 4 gig.
---
The lightning bolts probably have something to do with the WC2 and WC3 lore for dwarves, some of which was scrapped. For example, the Mountain King has two abilities that reference lightning: thunder clap and storm bolt. Further, the gryphon riders in WC2 (who I think are mostly wildhammer dwarves from what I recall) also have lightning infused hammer attacks.
---
Not to mention full debuff slots. MC is going to be very easy, even for super casual guilds.
---
I like these a lot!
---
bad point, doesn't make sense, probably an insignificant factoe
---
I've never played alliance but all my friends want to play horde, so here I am, playing horde forever.
---
Sure, if Blizzard stops trolling us with this amount of servers.
---
No, but it's easy to set up a macro and manually switch it periodically.
---
Ironforge is super nice, but the Orgrimmar bank roof is life.
---
the people buying the gold would get banned, asmong if he knows about it and accepts it could loose his twitch account.

[One of my most controversial posts on this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a9qbj7/unpopular_opinion_not_implementing_the_wow_token/) Expect the return of a huge black market RMT for Classic. And because ya'll won't let Blizz implement a safe alternative, ya'll are gonna be in for a world of hurt.
---
It's not about whether there will be RMT in Classic or not. It's about who controls it: Blizzard, or shady third-party hackers.
---
Yeah except they keep fucking up stat squishes. I mean I sincerely tried to keep my level 60 and 70 twinks on retail. But the squishes just utterly fucked us over. In WoD at first because they overdid it (five manning Sunwell ... at level 70), in Legion because they didn't tune it enough (Mobs one shoting you in full raid gear at 70 when they really shouldn't), and ... now in BFA that was the death sentence of it all. It's no longer doable. As in seriously not doable anymore because the scale they used relies on max level players soloing old content (and thus getting the appropriate damage buff to kill it).   
---
For the twinks though ? Well, they do normal damage. Which is okay. What's not okay is that your stats were squished into making it impossible to do at the appropriate level. Feels like trying to take on the ICC raid in level 70 epics.
---
Imagine being this prepared for raids tho?
---
It's gonna be hard killing a 60 rogue when you're leveling in stv, and finding someone to kill him means you waste so much time waiting around for your friend to arrive. I'm not a teenager anymore and I only have a couple of hours at most each day, I'd rather spend that having fun rather than siting in ghost Form.
---
if you wanna kill 14ish hours just watch the director's cuts of the lotr movies

---
We actually went with Thalnos in the end!
---
people didn't use it or earthshaker or the hammer of the titans because of the backlash that organised pvp saw with the unstoppable force - Back in those days proc based CC was putting DR on controlled CC
---
after 1.9 these items saw a lot more use when proc based CC was no longer DR ing regular skills. Same goes for  proc talents like black out, imp conc shot and stuff like that

Dm me the info or discord info

But to be honest, the lordaeron symbol is 1000x cooler than the lions head. At least its a symbol, like the horde one.

---
neat! is there a good site for addons?
---
Too OP to be a server name. NA Herod would look like a low pop server in comparison
---
I'm not sure that is. But "I'm excited... and a little nervous" is I think.
---
In other words: if you want to level an alt to 60, do it before phase 2 starts.
---
&gt; There shouldn't be any queues
---
I'm glad you know more about this than Blizzard:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835
---
&gt; the Herod realm is looking to be massively overpopulated. If all existing players on this server remain there, login queues in excess of 10,000 players are a certainty, and possibly much higher than that.

&gt; the Shazzrah realm is looking to be massively overpopulated. If all existing players on this server remain there, login queues in excess of 10,000 players are a certainty, and possibly much higher than that.
---
If they could solve the queues by adding more layers, why don't they? Could it actually be because you don't know shit about what you're talking about?
---
The fact that we were the only pvp organized group to do rank 14 in alliance and there was just another organized group in the horde so they were our nightmare and we were their nightmare.
---
In order to do rank 14 we would spam arathi all day. When we catched them we could probably just leave and find another bg with pug cause we would be more efficent in farming rank but we always fight them.
---
Some of them were so strong they became my idols, my legends. I knew their name because we kept fighting them and they were so good.
---
Then one day we went to meet them in their teamspeak. For me they were like VIP's I was excited but u know the funny part?
---
I WAS THEIR IDOL TOO! they knew everything about me like i did about them, they also remind the name of my pet (I had a broken tooth name Iggy, in honor of the dog of JoJo 3rd season)
---
This is because there wasnt sharding and u always play against the same people and u develope respect and knowledge of this people.
---
Then we try each other character and we had fun for a while. I even helped them to do rank 14 with  their horde char and had fun with their rraid and viceversa.

heirlooms go to 120 now, so it's even more than that.

the default raid frame seems to be pretty good so you don't rely as much on grid as you might think. I know that there is luna for 1.13.
---
I'm not sure about clique but I highly recommend mouseover macro. In my opinion they are generally far superior and absolutely crucial for PvP.

I don't want to read that whole post as none of it makes sense to me, and I'm a bit out of the loop.

Someone want to give me an ELI5?

There’s a maximum capacity of players on each server. Let’s say it’s 50k. 
---
The queue, is exactly however many *more* people are trying to log on. When one of the 50k currently on the server gets off, the first person in the queue is then allowed on the server, and everyone moves up one position on the waiting list. 
---
Dave doesn’t have any effect on the queue, but Kyle does. The queue wouldn’t be nearly as long if 4k out of the 50k are Kyles.
---
know where the popup respawn chunks are. makes grinding a breeze when you don't have to travel much and constantly get to fight

Join Stalaag.  Pop is still Medium.

Nope, all my buds are gonna chill together on discord as we wait for that sweet herod queue to countdown
---
There was a Shazzrah discord with like 14k+ people but due to that place having horrible admins and extreme toxicity a new one was apparently made. Lucky I'm on a PvE server and our discord is very chill.

I do not see any problem. It shows quests with minimum level requirement equal to your level selection. Maybe it is not enough self-explanatory ?

Not yet. Once the doors open though we can get population data from the classic wow population addons. I'll install it just to help gather the info.

I'm not trying to  "stick it" to anyone and I don't really care what hardcore players do, they are so far removed from my effort that a lot of their worries don't apply to me. Just trying to play my game and enjoy myself. Since my play time is limited, investing a lot of time(/gold) at 60 to change professions might not be worth it, so wondering about it before.
---
A thorium grenade for a random battle in a battleground costs 2 thorium bars, a runecloth and some smaller bits. that's over of 50s per grenade. Way too steep of a price.
---
I don't know which other BiS items you refer to, especially items that would still matter in p2/3 when i finally hit 60 and if I don't care too much about beeing BiS to go to some Pug raid.
---
If I recall, you just get a * next to your name.
---
yeah I think you do lose durability if you're in combat, either that or if the mob gets the last hit on you, I'm not sure. Anyways it would makes sense if you took your gear off for that reason.
---
How?
---
I agree
---
im not sure what youre trying to argue here. Did you read the comment?
---
I’m in the same dilemma. But my irl life friends are going Horde, on a pvp server, and will never make it to 60.  All negatives for me. 
---
So the choice was easy.
---
Why do people think there are going to be insane queues?! Do they forget that Blizzard is going to layer the fuck out of each realm?
---
Like seriously, they can easily go 6 layers and depending on the load go probably 10+...
---
That's well over 100k total per server. So I just wanna say, get over it already people
---
As it was my first mmo, I can say yes you can.
---
yes, that was what this was about:
---
&gt;It's not exactly like this as not all factors are llinear
---
This is only a small difference.  you have to multiply the speed advantage with the percentage of time people are actually travelling in that speed form.   If the advantage is 30% and they use it for 10% of the time, the total advantage is only 3%
---
&gt;COD?
---
Which is kinda funny, and somewhat ironic, because CoD is now doing rereleases as well...
---
Yes, exactly what they did.
---
If isn't about hit and crit it's that fire gets hard countered in ony, mc and bwl because of the bosses and trash having hugely increased fire resistance. We'll all be fire again for AQ and Naxx :)

You can farm until Classic TBC and you won't get anywhere close to 140K gold unless you make WoW your life and farm 12-16 hours per day, 7 days per week.
---
I haven't either, I just checked the subreddit.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spy-classic
---
I use to just drown mates who did that :p
---
yes
---
So? In that case you can't play wow. Because gold farming is optimized compared to then, raid tactics and gear bis has been optimized since then. Everything is "better".
---
And yes all this existed back then. Because you were to young or inexperienced to understand it doesnt mean it wasn't there.

On our server everyone was in the IRC.

No. A player is a player, no matter their faction. The game won't know what character you select until you've hit the enter world button.
---
Think we're on diffrent pages then. I took ur comment as thinking rogues were so strong due to abilies that reguardless of bi's gear they win. Where as how a days a naked rogue wouldn't get far vs average vanilla player
---
on the contrary. newer ones are more compatible because the new client is based on 8.2.
---
This is one of the reasons you do not join discord servers hosted by total randos. In a worst case scenario you get your account banned because some dipshit spammed weird things on a server you happened to share.
---
no your so kawai
---
This is indicative more of the gaming industry as a whole to be honest. 
---
Much like whenthe Joker says to Batman “We can’t go back, you’ve chaaaanged things”, WoW was so successful that practically every other publisher remotely interested in making an mmorpg, tried to emulate WoW using the focus of extracting as much money as possible in the shortest amount of time. I hope that the success that Classic appears to be due changes things again, and shows that making a good game first and monetising it second is the path required to make sustainable bank. 
---
We might start to see some innovation in the stagnant mmorpg genre. I mean, technically the most impressive MMORPG was Ulitma Online, so maybe we might see some interest return to that too if Classic is a resounding success.
---
Even if he was trying his hardest, which he’s not because of health reasons, he still wouldn’t make it. He’s knowledgeable about the game sure, but his mechanics are poor and even while speed running takes too much time doing mundane tasks.
---
Who would have known unofficial discords created by power hungry nolifers would lead to bullshit like this.
---
Is this 16 like I think it is?
---
Everyone else on your realm is facing the same situation, so you don't have a disadvantage over others. As long as you're not going for a levelling record, it does not really matter if it takes you one day more or less to reach 60. It's just a question of mindset, if you let it bother you that you will get killed by the opposing faction every now and then - in a game that's storywise about the two factions at war.
---
The best single target TPS is a battle shout and heroic strike spam warrior with 4 hunter/locks in their group for fights with just a single mob. If you have more than one mob a feral druid would be the best TPS.

I was a bit confused how it started out not in English, but then all the spell titles were in English. What is this from? Are they copying the spell names from an established Western product that already has the spells with English names otherwise why wouldn't they be named using the local language?
---
I enjoy playing the game i just like to have something else to pay attention to a bit also seeing how i plan to go pretty hard the first few days.
---
There shouldn't be any "safe alternative". If you want to cheat in-game prepare to be cheated by cheaters. The more people lose their accounts due to RMT the better.
---
Of course it is. :)
---
Subbed.
---
I think cap 4k means its the ideal number that server could handle efficiently, and with no waiting time. but you can still push the limit to some point beyond that before it actually crashes the server.
---
It objectively is.
---
That's why I'm avoiding it completely on my fragile little mage.
---
I'll probably go there with a group on my Resto Shaman when I get to leveling him.
---
the internet is for....
---
People wont care if you stream unless you have a huge following
---
Ah, that sounds glorious.  That's the kind of game I remember WoW being.
---
Pick what you want, on warlock the int bonus is so small for warlock that it doesnt matter (same for gnome)  
---
its around 0.5% extra crit what you get when you play gnome.  
---
mb this helps your decison
---
&gt;I miss waiting for games to release from developers with imagination and passion... Which are so few and far between now, and are the exception instead of the standard. 
---
Pay attention to more than the AAA/mainstream industry.
---
&gt;I hope the release of Classic WoW helps the industry regain some of what it's lost, and can highlight that these games were played and popular because they were hard, because they were made with people who had passion, and because the industry allowed a game to take risks and push boundaries.
---
The hardcore gaming scene is growing significantly. The mediocre CoD kid mentality is not cool anymore. What's cool now is weird, hard-assed experiences. The Soulsborne games are the most obvious and popular example, but there's a whole section of independent and smaller-developer titles that are considered the creme of the crop now when it comes to actual gameplay. Kenshi, Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld and scrods of other actually interesting stuff is out there and is being actively developed and followed by many. Of course, the mass-selling bullshit still makes millions compared to the beans that the other stuff makes, but the industry as a whole still allows these smaller games to flourish to a notable degree.
---
I do think that the industry should experience another crash to get all the casuals and businessmen out of it, though.
---
He menas Dave was elitiest and tryhard and time and life on planet earth and on the internet it more important that other people.
---
Yeah..
---
retail bad classic good
---
100% agree. I seriously don't understand why people want to be apart of unofficial community-run server discords.
---
Twitch actually bought Curse a few years ago.
---
Anecdotal but there was a sight that would show spell power. And when my fire mage has the most fire spell power on the server for a week I thought I was the coolest shit in azeroth.
---
Forums
---
Because they think they'll be dueling others left and right while leveling and it's gonna be fun.
---
They don't remember losing hours and hours of progression getting camped by higher level players or being denied access to dungeons by an enemy raid. Most people are in for a reality check.
---
World PvP can be fun, but most of the time time it's going to be frustrating instead.
---
i was purely speculating, if you have more reliable source of how it was back in the day, be my guest posting it.
---
oh, I knew that already :)
---
the attack animations / emotes are probably from retail wow.  
---
you can see it when they autoattack, they have 2 "new" animations that dont excist in classic
---
Perfection
---
I'm in a similar boat! I played star wars galaxies at the time of vanilla wow and some guild wars 1 and 2 but never WoW. Hella excited to play with a bunch of childhood friends who I grew up with always talking about it.
---
Arthas was the last king of Lordaeron
---
My experiences with a Paladin are all BC+, since I've always played Horde. So my knowledge of vanilla Paladins is limited.
---
But my understanding from vanilla has always been that vanilla plate armor is not even slightly best-in-slot for healing purposes. As a holy paladin you'll be wearing a lot of cloth, mail, etc.
---
With that in mind, coupled with the sheer amount of proximity-based danger vanilla bosses have, I can't imagine Holy Paladins are much different in vanilla from Resto Shamans: keep your distance.
---
I forgot how pet skill works, if I tamed a mountain lion and learned "Prowl 1" from it, will I have to tame another cat that has Prowl 2 to learn it?
---
That’s pretty intense but I love it! Been playing wow for a few months and I still feel lost and not really sure what I’m doing (other then questing).. can’t wait to play classic and also been watching heaps of videos. Any tips or videos you think are great feel free to send them on :) ... what character are you going to go with?
---
The only thing I can read here.
---
Rediscovering my classes and the world, hell yeah friend!
---
I managed to kill a lvl 60 Hunter as a lvl 39 Scarlet Crusader RP twink.
---
lol
---
Ok... I'm not sure what that has to do with my question. You say that the 2006 cap was 4k. You also say that 10k = the most crowded realm in 2006.... It can't be both, so which one was it? 4k or 10k?
---
But is the outcome worth it?
---
Actually he requested to announce it himself. That was mentioned in a Classic interview a while back.
---
Probably not. Blizzard has never done anything to force faction balance.
---
I do know feral is really good for threat, but I think I remember Skarm saying fury tanking becomes best for tps once you have the crit gear. That being said, it wont even be viable till BWL.
---
No....
---
They would just bot it or pay venezuleans.
---
The only thing that stops them is not buying any.
---
Why would you even go retail in the first place?  :T
---
So other people who has a life should suffer because you don't?
---
i have changed, i will not wait an hour every day to play. once layering is gone, the server is going to be hell. forget ever leveling an alt after phase 1. the cities will be too busy, the amount of people spamming chat constantly is going to be terrible, it will feel like asmongolds twitch chat. your ignore list will be 10 times as long as your friends list. i was going Shazzrah EU, ive changed to Gehennas ( same situation as US but not as bad as HEROD) 
---
there are only a few servers with hundreds of thousands of people playing, they will always feel extremely full.
---
This is a reason to bring a retri paladin into raid, since they can refresh all judgements on boss. If he has Nightfall weapon and focuses on supporting other classes instead of damage, he can be pretty valuable for raid
---
All this talk about dying pets, and yet Furious Howl requires it to be within 15 yards of the boss. If it's within 15 yards, it might as well be attacking.
---
Thanks for explaining. 
---
Surprised Alchemy doesn't make a lot of gold. I expected Arcanite transmute to be a baseline income all throughout the game. For the flasks, they are also needed all throughout the game. I guess it all depends on the mats, hence why herb is the money maker, but there ought to be a nice margin for the flasks as well.
---
For PVP, as I wrote otherplace, a thorium grenade costs like 60s or something. Not something I plan on over using in PVP. Battles are simply not worth that much gold. I don't know how usefull deflectors or the other gizmos are as you need to give up other items. If I know me, I'm not going to feign death and hotswap items in battles or anything but maybe i should work on that for the reflectors I suppose.
---
Jumper cables is a major major thing, you're right. Especially for casual instancing and beeing able to rezz the healer after a wipe. Battle-chicken is obviously a nice buff every 30 minutes but requires gnomish engineering, which locks me out from the goblin stuff. And how important is it really in a random pug?
---
Teleporter sounds nice, saving me some time to get down to gadgetzan, but it's more a gimmick than "this is BiS, you need to have this"
---
15 yards is 13.72 meters
---
Blizzard actively tracks gold. An amount of gold that is identified as being purchased outside of the EULA can be removed regardless of how far-spread it has gotten. What blizzard does with the tracking information on a per-character basis is, in my experience, variable.
---
Literally everything you say is that of a child... please go the fuck away. I am some how the one who has never played vanilla when you need to be explained basic game mechanics to even hold a conversation....
---
The pioneers used to ride with these babies for miles!
---
Its really sad but this is True heirlooms in my opinion is one of the biggest mistakes in wow.
---
Even if Skarm said that it wasn't true at the time. And is certainly not true based on the things we have learned in the last couple months from beta.
---
I dont think that is true, they are using some 8.x base, but I believe it's a modified version that removes some features. Its possible some mods will work, but def not them all.
---
I'm so glad I was born into gaming in its infancy, we are all vaccinated against streaming, streamers, anti streamers.
---
The whole thing is so irrelevant to us that it's like watching pigeons scrapping over a week old baguette.
---
I mean, he is right. Discord is free, easy to use and set up and most people will already have an account. don't know why you tried to hit him with some snide shit.
---
What a dumb broad , in her face!
---
You've played since you were six?
---
It's from an anime called Overlord
---
They reportedly found the light in An'She, the sun god(ess?).
---
+healing don't mean shit when your dead lol. we must all aspire to be leather chads.
---
Idk how other rogues can play without dirty tricks :\
---
Ah, looks like I was a bit behind the knowledge curve there. Good to know though.
---
It's actually not BiS gear at all, players not wearing heirlooms and instead leveling blues do noticeably more damage in leveling dungeons.
---
I liked this reaction the most: https://youtu.be/7Ao08ootjKM?t=351
---
That’s ridiculous. Sure, some servers may be more competitive than others, but to the casual player that’s at such a higher level than they will ever play at, the differences between servers is essentially nil. Dave is going to stay wherever he rolled Day 1 and made friends.
---
My problem is that there doesn't appear to be any categories so it's just an endless list of all guilds an all servers. 
---
Or can I sort out specific ones somehow?
---
Do it for yooorrrrkkkssshhhiiiirrrreee
---
"a tiny bit more consistency"? :D  
---
dude... they get 3 % hit for free, and Glancing blow reduction ....  
---
this is like you wear 2 extra items as human on top of your normal gear.
---
I was there and many users still are, most communities used their own forums or ventrilo/teamspeak for voice in my experience, even the large but infrequent IRC servers didn't have 500-2000+ people on in my experience, more like ~200.

---
Thanks :)
---
I read the spec as "HOTWINGS"  That's what I'm calling it from now on.
---
if you havent already started it, you are going to waste much more time in the first week/ 2 weeks when you start it on the toilet. when you change your diet so drastically, you will 100% get diarrhea until your body gets used to it. you can see it in any animal if you have had a pet or a horse, if you change their food at once and not 'ween' them off, it will cause that.
---
plus with this Huel and similar products, they give you gas like you would never believe. you would need to open the window a lot (better wait until winter to start :))
---
I scheduled it, but I work from home. So if servers are literally down, I'll work. If its a 4 hr queue, might work 1/2 day, but I doubt most servers will have queues more than 90 mins. Itd surprise me anyway.
---
as a guild leader, i only go into the guild discords to do some recruitment. I do keep getting messages from these groups who want to collude and join forces to schedule world boss spawns, and these are mother fucking cross faction groups. I tell them no every time, and they get fucking salty af.
---
This got me emotional haha, I can relate to this to an extent. But this right here is what makes this game so fucking special to me; the relationships you can form and make life long friends. I've made dozens of friends back in wotlk and we still are very much in touch today. Thanks for posting this, I thoroughly enjoyed reading your thoughtful post.
---
It's a global release. Meaning its active at the same "time" but obviously different times. It will be 3pm if you're PDT or 11pm if you're in the UK, midnight for mainland europe.
---
Idk op wanted utility build so no roon for it.
---
You're arguing about a culture change, and not just a gaming one, but a universal one.
---
I'd bet that the majority of players this time around are going to have better ping and the game will run better. 
---
They're also going to have easier access to information.
---
The world changed. It's been 15 years.
---
&gt;  everything Classic is meant to stand for.
---
Vanilla was the "baby" MMO designed to be a lot more accessible to the average games user. It's significantly less punishing and more intuitive than the other games of the era. The fundamental drive of the game was that anyone could get into it. Not some elitist ideal you have where people aren't allowed to have a fucking server Discord.
---
Go with RL friends imo. Can always make an alt later with the PvE guild. Its going to be super hard to keep up with 2 paces (not to mention time consuming) and you might find yourself burned out half way there with both characters.
---
I really hope realm discord end up beeing useless. Much rather do everything but voice chat via ingame or official forums like the old days.
---
Battle shouto
---
You fucking kidding me mods, i posted this same picture and it was taken down lmfao
---
Stop being such a passive mussy and just take it as banter. I'd leave the horrible admins title to the ones trying to gather monopoly on eu server discord and then launch RMT campaign on those discords.
---
its not. a name isnt you, you're kidding yourself if you think its relevant in any way. how you play and interact with people is what matters, a name can only enhance what already got. which is why we're even in this mess w/ streamer groupies and BR
---
IRC was pids easy to use. I have no idea where you are getting this idea it was difficult
---
Risky click of the day
---
If you /join world or /join lookingforgroup, you can take barrens chat with you wherever you want! Silver linings.
---
I had absolutely zero issues with both bfa and legion. No dcs no queues, no lag.
---
Traitor!
---
depends on their class tbh. rogue will be interesting. the pvp spec isnt raid worthy, the hemo spec is banned in raids I think, but the optimal raid spec for rogues misses out to much to be pvp viable. Yet there are builds that can do both at like 80% effective? 80% is my made up head number, but you get the idea. I dont know mages, but I suspect the raid and pvp specs are close enough it wont matter. 
---
 Warrs raid as fury and pvp as arms. I cant tell you about mages or locks though sorry. So depends?

You're whats wrong with wow's playerbase that wow ultimately pandered to and made the game shit, now fuck off if you don't like it. Plenty of tokens on retail
---
My guild leader, who I barely knew at the time, bought me my mount when I hit level 40.  Ended up also buying them for all of my other 14 year old friends.  Damn he was a nice dude.

Priest moves, “You think you do, but you don’t.”

Death to the living!

This is the correct explanation.
---
Wasnt legion launch the highest player count wow has ever had?
---
You can't a afford taking a week off of work?
---
Lol ok good luck in AQ
---
The "death knoll" of the game will eventually prove to have been when changes were made that made it possible to instantly level AT ALL.  Poof! And you have a level 90, 100, 110, etc.,  newbie who knows NOTHING about where stuff is in the game, or how to play it.
---
I mean, they know that. Its why they made it an issue and enlisted Blizzard and got them to agree to break/disable such mods were they ever developed. /shrug
---
Folks saw this coming.
---
i am going skinning and mining from 1-60. dropping skinning for engi. once i have sufficent gold.
---
there is always gold in vendoring the materials, there is also a lot of gold in holding on to your good mats (lvl 40+) until the server economy balances out and make more money on all the herbs you have saved. 
---
saying that, there are a lot of people on each server, over saturation is going to be very common, nothing will be too expensive, there will be a lot of everything IMO.
---
It is/was harder than clicking a Discord link.
---
i got the shakes already : /
---
I watch the trailer every few days. I get chills and tear up every damn time.
---
In fact, once people hit level cap, many get bored looking for next activity to do, and find it fun to teach and talk to a new, eager and polite new player. :)
---
Dont worry about being "bad", thats why the game slowly grows your skill list up over dozens then hundreds of hours. Lets you learn them solidly! Don't be afraid to try new stuff, tank or heal a 5 man dungeon, maybe start with 2-3 man grouping on quests or elite enemies first to get the bate bones basics down.
---
I just give people a heads up im new at a role, but eager to learn, and open to suggestions!
---
(Also try duels/pvp, I love low level duels! Learn the unique footwork and challenge of a real person. So neat)
---
Good luck friend!
---
i started playing at 7 and im 20 now its totally normal :p
---
The hero we do not deserve
---
click the link it will all make sense, Jeff is WoW, Jeff is Green hills of Stranglethorn and now unfortunately Jeff is Overwatch.
---
You get it from ghazrilla in zulfarrak right? Man thats long ago. Carrot was the bomb 😀
---
Lol I’m American, I know they’re pretty big, but that’s about all I know
---
Not a secret anymore!
---
That's hilarious. Good dad.
---
Your argument is out of place, the discussion was focused on this claim - "You're not meant to have such easy access to chat with the opposite faction."
---
Which is true. If it wasn't Blizzard wouldn't have retroactively brought back the limitation to not be able to make characters of both factions on the same server.
---
Do what I did: preemptively Dump your girlfriend, save up 3 paychecks, and take an entire month off to Feed The Beast.
---
You need to prioritize your life.
---
How about rogues, are they a desirable class?
---
Lol represent!
---
Yeah, thanks but no thanks. You can keep your toxicity and I'll take my discord with chill atmosphere and decent moderation. We still got plenty of banter while maintaining a friendly atmosphere. To each their own I suppose. But if somebody is indeed doing RMT shit on those discords they can die in a fire for all I care.
---
Just pointing out the fact that most guilds dont use a website anymore and run completely from discord. as it has great push notifications, voice quality and functions.  you can still have the same news feeds and whatnot too. 
---
I do like a good looking guild website, but everyone has prettymuch shifted to discord now and a lot of the websites have become inactive.
---
Will you make one for blacksmithing? I remember struggling to break even as a new player back in the days.
---
They decided to move, yes, after Blizzard asked to do so two days ago.
---
Also Pyrewood Village is the PvE hub of choice.
---
i am in the exact same boat as you. i am doing skinning and mining until 60, i have a guide that tells me everything i need for engi from 1-300, i will save all the mining supplies i need on an alt, then drop mining at 60 for engi, level it up to 300, drop skinning and level herb to 300 for the money in a long run (thistle tea and all that)
---
Absolutely can and should. But you should be extremely careful on certain bosses like Ragnaros (he does random AoE on mana users and you might blow up melees if approach him from the wrong side) and C'thun where you should watch out for green beams. There are some more examples in Naxx where it gets tricky, but still absolutely doable.
---
Just make sure you picked at least 2 points in Lasting Judgement talent.
---
Thats still a week behind the rest of us
---
Completely agree.  Everyone deserves an opportunity for redemption and he took it.
---
I’ve been watching a ton of raiding videos from holy pally perspective. Ended up stumbling over some random people streaming them leveling paladin and just enjoying it. I’m so hyped.
---
Everyone has different situations.  At my last job I probably wouldn't have.  Current job I am taking 2 weeks.  Will still have over a month of vacation time left.
---
Skinning engi for that sweet devilsaur bm
---
Whelp this subreddits gone. Was nice knowing you
---
If anyone does buy gold, make sure you do it from a market site or find someone you trust.
---
It’s going to be a huge market with ALOT of cash, and since there are no public bots, they arnt going to banned. A lot of the big sites will try to hack up prices and rob you, where as a lot of the people who made a bot and are making some free money won’t.
---
As someone who has been in the industry a while, stay careful and don’t get ripped off. There are bots which can run MC.
---
Be very aware of the 5 second rule and how it affects your mana regeneration.
---
Be very aware of how much each spell costs you, and make appropriate decisions about what rank and kind of heal to use.
---
Whack-a-mole but with health bars.
---
No. The private server community is tiny compared to what classic will be. Horde have better PvP racials, and skilled players will be playing on both sides. True PvP minmaxers would choose horde
---
Beta is up for those that were invited to the closed beta originally. Otherwise it was a private server!
---
How has it been now ? 
---
I want to start playing this asap. But just feel something stopping me from starting ?
---
Anyone else feel that ?

One of the secrets to WoW's success is that it runs well on potatoes.

I &lt;3 my blue dresses as a druid.
---
Sooo to join a group with a pala healer that let us die and just buble heartstone is really good group play
---
Isnt this wrong though? I mean he compares the same items not what would be BIS pre itemchange. Without a doubt other items are BIS pre 1.12 itemization?
---
Clique is just making mouseovers though, but allows you to bind left and right click too though
---
Absolutely not, lol. You don't have to kill every red name you see. I've made many friends on the opposite faction.
---
Well my first character was alliance but with 8 i really got started and made my self an orc dk
---
I too remember Superhetero.
---
That’s sad man, you had some sick gear too
---
Yes and you really notice that it's a bit like "game of Thrones sucks now this went wrong"-videos: there's thousands of them, most are clickbait, bad and shallow information and the same stuff regurgitated a thousand times. The best actually informative videos usually have less than 100k views. I do like madseasojc though because he doesn't seem like a pretentious douchebag like most YouTubers.
---
That sub is called r/wow, not r/bfa or r/retailwow and it's up to mods if they want Classic posts there, not up to you.
---
Outside of my non-PC hobbies, I've been trying to make my way through Singleplayer games that I know I won't really want to play once Classic drops. Finished Titanfall 2, Battlefront 2, KOTOR 2 (with the lost content mod) and almost done with Witcher. 
---
One of my plans is hitting the gym more. Hoping I can mitigate all of the crap I'm inevitablly going to have once classic launches.
---
The International 9
---
Terrible idea kys
---
Dude, I am Italian I can understand them but it's just impolite to speak it in an international environment. I just asked them to be respectful but the majority doesn't care tbh.

---
How does this work on a pve server? If I enable pvp in phase 2 I will probably get some HK's. Because there will be less people doing PvP will that mean its easier to rank up on a pve server?
---
nothing about roleplayers will ever be "chad"
---
after a long day of doing whatever i happen to have done, i remember that it's single digits away and read posts about it for too long to be healthy.
---
&gt;I dont think so
---
You might not think so but it has been discussed literally hundreds of times here, and they most definitely share DR.
---
&gt;but typically a DR is going to be 75% then 50% then 25% 
---
Nope, it's 50% then 25% then 0%
---
if you are going integrated gfx then make sure it is intel hd 4000
---
The t440p has a nvidia gt730m, should be fine 
---
and the t550s has integrated intel gfx over the minimum required, the problem with integrated gfx though is that it shares system memory so personally i would go for 6 to 8 gig ram with integrated.
---
There are a lot of situations where its mutually beneficial not to pvp, for example if both sides just want to get on with questing/leveling in a zone. You definitely won't be banned for this!
---
That website is fishy AF.

This is not how I remember leveling my frost mage. I'm fairly certain that it's frost nova-&gt; Blizzard-&gt; Cone of Cold -&gt; Blizzard. Single target killing as a mage is way too slow. So as a tip: Learn to AoE farm, frost mage is one of the quickest leveling specs if done right, but rather poor when done wrong.
---
Your against RMT. But why are we worthless human? Are you upset that for about 20 hours of work, I’ll make 6 figures from this launch? Boo hoo some people buy gold. Odds are they are playing less anyways. 
---
It’s a game and people are going to provide a service. Literally printing money isn’t even close to being worthless as a human, and anyone with the skill set required to make the tool is most likely doing far better and contributing more in life than you ever will.
---
Probably also gold a lots of bag space.
---
When I say "healthy number" I don't mean that more is worse -- as long as you don't reach a point where questing becomes painful (unlikely due to sharding anyway) or queue times are consistently huge, more is pretty much always better. And sure, something specific like that would be helped a lot by having more players, but it's not the majority of the game's experience for most players.
---
My point is more that people shouldn't freak out about having a realm population of 5k. The game will be more than playable and it will not ruin most of the game experience for most people most of the time.
---
nah, i genuinely dont even understand what is going on lol, what does this mean?
---
Not likely. We can copulate with four different species...

High-key best comment

Nice list. Try this chest instead: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22272/forests-embrace

I pugged about 5 times.  Piss off jerks 99%. Blaming the healer when some hotshot aggros all the mobs at once. Blaming the tank when the healer gets targeted by mobs that some dp'er lured over to them healer.  Blame, blame, blame, because it's NEVER the player who screwed up who was at fault, right?  After that, I just let a single way-too-high level friend run me through the few dungeons I bothered with. Or better still, dual-boxed with my own alternate account and ran my own alts through dungeons.
---
Damn yeah you're right, I completely forgot lol.

Hide of the Wild for 6 healers, we decided to farm during a LAN party, dividing stuff amongst us. I spent fucking 4 days farming those Carrion Grubs / Devourers. Still have nightmares.
---
All I know is I'm going Alliance for those sweet, sweet queue times.
---
Sitting in a queue for 15-20mins is not my cup of tea.
---
From what I understand the people staying on Herod aren't necessarily to blame, it's just that they don't want to lose the names they subscribed 2 weeks early to obtain.
---
I understand what your saying but it could be adjusted slightly to accommodate the change, I understand it's not practical but I could see it being gun.
---
Who knows probably only possible from a private 
---
server
---
Now that, was cool
---
It is actually very subtle despite the way it may sound.
---
Blood barrage
---
What bracket?
---
I do think if they could they should implement faction balancing mechanics.
---
But as others say its player based not faction based.
---
A bot maker pays for a sub and electricity. Making a good farming bot takes about 20 hours max, so we can disregard the work cost over the lifetime.
---
This means for a bit to be profitable, it has to make 15$ before it’s banned. In classic it will make far more than that. But it even does that in retail as well. Tokens won’t do anything, it just makes it so the greedy ones have to charge less.
---
I will remain vigilant and not be trolled by the likes of you!
---
Seriously, you are fucking retarded.
---
My guild chose one, I hate pvp
---
Team Varys for the Win!
---
you say that but some of those corpse runs are a fucking epic inconvenience
---
Everybody has always emphasized community too much.  Groups come and go.   Guilds form and dissolve faster than clouds in the sky.  Guilds with 1000 players ?  Who knows more than 20 people in them? Really?  And will you still be playing with those same 20 people 3 years from now?  Not likely.

Subreddits are designed to discuss things, theyre forums. Discord isnt made for that at all. It'd be like using LinkedIn to chat with your grandma, there are better ways to do it
---
Yes but you’ll lose durability. Nude up!
---
Could've just as easily showed people the manual method too which comes with the bonus of not having to use Twitch's shitty desktop app which they chose to force onto people because nobody was using it.
---
"Gear and color scheme matches flawlessly." This is sarcasm, right? Right?!?!
---
Nonconsensual PvP adds an additional layer of immersion to the world. The world is now not totally scripted, but there is a completely dynamic aspect to the game. It's simply a lot more engaging having to look out for players of the opposite faction rather than just questing itself.
---
Also nonconsensual PvP can lead to some cool open world PvP battles and increases faction pride.
---
When a player from the opposite faction can kill but still does not, it means a lot more on a PvP server than on a PvE server. You will remember the players of the opposite faction who spare you and those of your faction who help you. This helps relationships to form.
---
tldr; it adds an additional layer of immersion to the world and improves faction pride and relationships with other players.
---
Yes exactly or like those open pvp everywhere worlds
---
Holy shit I forgot the mobs used to run away in dungeons
---
learn about time zones
---
If you enjoy World PvP check out Albion Online.
---
If you enjow wc3, check out the custom map Island Defense.
---
TO BE FAIR, a HUGE percentage of the signups for Classics DON'T know what they're in for.  Regarding them, his statement is correct.  Those of us that played vanilla are a different story.  And even some of us are a little clouded by nostalgia.  That being said, Blizzard deserves some credit that this is happening.
---
Nothing's "easy", if you want to be good. But you can play Rogue and try to snatch players other people brought low for you...
---
Oh man... I'm even further dreading inventory management... Thanks for the reminder haha
---
I was considering it at first but it just feels wrong having to change the name that I have used my entire time on the internet
---
Hey there RajaSundance, yes I plan to make a guide for blacksmithing as well :)
---
Well, I don't live in the US.
---
And I more meant, I get 27 days paid leave, where instead of having a holiday, I COUUUULLLDDDD just being in a second income.
---
Easy fun and good play a priest,
---
Runescape does have deadman mode which enables pvp everywhere. Though if you travel with a group you could perhaps avoid the problem. 
---
Maybe make PvE servers with no contested zones at all
---
Yup I'm no-lifeing, took 8 days off work but will keep a reasonable sleep schedule. Probably more like 11pm to 4:30am for those days.
---
Because I dont have that much pto?
---
If your grouped up the starter zones should be easy
---
The Instance. I highly recommend it. It covers other Blizzard stuff too.
---
Do you have a phone?
---
why the fuck u hating bitch, dude just wants a separate fun server, shit wouldnt affect you at all 
---
im down for this shit op
---
hc ironman is fun AF would love to see an official blizz server for it on wow
---
It did.
---
I once led a small army to slay a dragon that had been sighted off the coast. We strategised, formulised, and finally battled that dragon for what felt like hours.
---
Comrades fell, healers did their very best, the beast put up a mighty fight. A few sworn enemies got wind of the action and tried to muscle in. They fought bravely but we outnumbered them and had the advantage.
---
Finally, the mighty dragon lay slain. We had been triumphant. There was much celebrating and a mighty march westward to the nearest transport point.
---
That was a beautiful day. A day of glory. Now I hear the drums of war thunder once again.
---
Have the same question! Any help on what to roll as a mage/lock duo group?
---
Ty
---
Try Dominos instead. Looks great, works on classic and is more or less the same thing.
---
fem orc has always been the only choice when playing horde
---
I hear you, but that invalidates healers a bit and removes one of their tools
---
Same here, but I won't downvote him for stating his opinion.
---
I have played several retri's in vanilla, believe me that I know what I would get myself into without crashing and burning, thanks tho :) As you can see from my flairs, im rolling warrior this time. Yea holy can refresh it but I dont remember seeing one doing it. I havent seen any hunter spamming slow with nightfall either. Maybe I was just entering unlucky pugs without those people. In overall, saying that retri is completely viable in raids is as much lie as saying its total garbage
---
... a year of wow.
---
&gt; And I have a feeling that up until \~6 years ago the demand likely genuinely was not there (despite what the people with private server blinders on like to tell themselves). 
---
Demand was always there, despite what you'd like to tell yourself about private server people having "blinders" on. They just literally would not commit resources to develop a way to make it work until Omar did. So that's a swing and a miss on your part.
---
&gt; And people STILL kept shitting on him. It's really sad that people can't let go of their grievances and move on with their lives. 
---
He deserves every bit of it tbh. He told thousands of people they didn't want Classic when they've played shitty recreations for YEARS and are still passionate about it and genuinely WANT it, and they even had a good model to look at with RuneScape. Strike 3 bud, you're out.
---
You would consider that a waste?
---
I'll see myself out.
---
Mostly for the same reason as why you need a subreddit for the game.
---
They changed vanilla items to have this, because blizzard doesn't want you having fun.
---
Ya but was/will be in classic.
---
search
---
No it's literally a joke about (mmo)rpg characters buffing before a fight.
---
Spam ARAMs in League with breaks between for refreshing this sub. It's kinda slow, but not really that bad so far.
---
Cute.
---
source?
---
this thread is great. can somebody share the alliance version of this?
---
You're going to die at some point, and then you're back there.
---
25% stun resist is better
---
I don’t need it...
---
Probably contrary to the point of the subreddit, but killing mythic Jaina with my guild will likely be a memory in my head forever. 2nd intermission played out perfectly, entered phase 3 with battle resses left and everybody alive: one of the tanks fucks up and gets frozen so we break him out, our strategy for phase 3 gets ruined by Jaina spawning an illusion in the one place that we didn’t account for, a hunter normally not raid leading perfectly shotcalls all 20 people dodging 2 glacial rays. Looking good, the blizzard starts but DPS is low, another glacial Ray, with 2 illusions out AND Broadsides from the ship, and the broadsides gets dropped right on top of the raid! But then she dies, we killed her, we got cutting edge. It was glorious.
---
Moreso than anything for now it's just to have people to talk about classic with. The Whitemane discord was actually a pretty decent place with good conversation for a few days, but at this point it's grown to the point where edgelords are everywhere and it's just cancer as to be expected. (highly likely the timing with it getting cancer and 4chan declaring whitemane as their server isn't coincidental lul)
---
It'll also be an easy way to find people to jump on voice comms and chill with if no one from my guild is around v0v, although since we have 100+ people already at this point it's unlikely that'll be an issue for a while.
---
To be fair, they removed the RMT stuff in less than an hour and removed mod status of everyone ignored.
---
The big shazz discord on the other hand doesnt even delete rape threats.
---
Blizzard should re-launch servers for Vanilla, servers for Wrath, servers for Cata, run them each for a year and then let the most successful server remain as it is FOREVER AND EVER.  Players who get tired of the one that's left, can go back to retail BFA or BFA+1 or BFA+2 and try to catch up with the instant level to max-minus-10, playing at whatever even-more-violently torn up area has been added to the game, playing with the thousands (or hundreds, or dozens) of new players who haven't a clue what's where and what's to be done.
---
Why bother with new expansions anyway?  The most vociferous players seem to be the ones who group together to be able to achieve and boast about beating the top level boss within 3 months of the new expansion.   If the point of the game (as they seem to think it is) is to simply get to the top and beat the baddest boss, they should go back to playing games like Iron Helix that had a guided path and only took 3 hours to complete.  Heck, Blizzard could probably sell those people a $50 token that would give them the best gear in the game and drop them in a fight cage with the baddest boss on their first day in.  That would give them tons of free time to learn and play all the now-included distractions from actually doing questing and exploring the massive game content. Oh right - there's no time for that either.  Everybody's too busy doing dailies from level 10 on up, or doing Darkmoon Fair rides, or pet battles at all levels. Or mining and herb collecting in their garrisons or learning a dozen kinds of cooking in Pandaria.  Nope, they've beat the baddest boss, so why should they bother themselves with doing all that other stuff.  Certainly , cooking doesn't drop any pvp gear.
---
If you're looking purely at premades, then Alliance premades have 'better options' as far as gameplay execution is concerned. If you're just looking at random nobodies in random BG's though, Horde have the advantage, by pure virtue of Shamans generally being able to damage and heal with the same gear-set, were-as Paladins generally will not.
---
yeah I could see high lever character hanging around the early contested zones just ganking lowbies 24/7 sounds real fun.
---
ROFL!  Me neither!
---
Regular Deadman mode is dead apart from the few people who made it to max level and can now shit on any new player trying to join
---
Mapster seems to be working.
---
re-read it, try again.   :)
---
You're giving me ideas
---
As long as it is a sword or mace you have. 
---
If not it is useless.
---
Bro, apparently.  I never really felt that until right now, but damn.  These Blizzard employees have been working hard to give us a great game, let’s be thankful.
---
Absolutely agree neither will I
---
Ah that's a shame :( are you playing on Shazzrah? You can always join us virtually :)
---
I stopped playing during cataclysm, returning for a few weeks here and there. But I remember having to organise a group, and then wait an hour for everyone to also walk to the dungeon.
---
There was something special about having you warlocks summon another person to the raid so that you could use the summoning stone.. but Jesus as a warlock player, I was sick of always being the one to have to stop questing so I could travel to the damn summoning stone.
---
Ahh damn I didnt check spreadsheet. I just noticed same items was compared in the video. Thanks for clarifying.
---
I start a new job on the 25th
---
those first three days will be literal hell.
---
Shaman herbalism, warrior mining, one of you skinning, last prof whatever you want
---
Warrior threat may lead to less viability for warriors and warlocks, and as a consequence shadow priests.
---
We know from history that mages and rogues are fine. Warriors and Warlocks weren't as common and this could be why.
---
Yeah, i misspost /sad
---
ahahahahahahaha - I'm choking on my laughter.
---
Enchanting makes wands which is a cash cow off the rip
---
Never needet such a thing! Play good, be nice and you‘ll get asked to join groups all the time!
---
Tailoring/enchanting and mining/engineering
---
I've been catching up on retail WoW the last couple of days, 8.2 is actually alright
---
Is it a bad thing? You make it sound so negative...
---
Same here
---
Ah yes I've heard of dire maul, I'm rolling mage so will have to learn how to make gold there
---
It's not that you can't, it's that most people won't bother to put in the effort to do so safely.
---
If you want to be dead last on the meters without contributing anything else unique of any value you should be able to. Don't expect any group invites though.
---
i respect your opinion but  no group finder is honestly the main appeal of classic wow for me otherwise I wouldn't be wanting to come back to game.
---
Friendly reminder to always log off in cities/inns to get more rested XP.
---
Wtf dude, you call youself a metalhead?! That's Austrian black metal.
---
will not "1v1" ??  Is that your super-cool version of leet speak?  Or is your keyboard really so old the L and the 1 key were the same key?  Or did you mean 1 on 1 PVP?  Just say "will not duel".
---
Doubt there will be too much in terms of raising, some differences but not necessarily many big meta changes.
---
As far as leveling goes, dungeon spamming is potentially one of the fastest ways to level in classic, unlike on private servers
---
Honestly, knowing OOM means out of mana and announcing it when you are OOM (in and out of combat) has saved an untold amount of pickup dungeons from wiping. People want to rush and they will early in classic, or once they get used to the dungeon. They will forget to make sure you are ready. (This happens more often the better you are at healing.)  
---
The tank is the only other player that can keep aggro off you, if resources start getting tight, they are the only one that matters. You can resurrect the rest, but if you die, everybody is walking.  
---
Music with a quick and consistent beat helps amazingly if there are no surprises you can time your heals to the beat.  
---
You can lower the rank of the spell you are casting to reduce mana cost (down-rank). If you are constantly running out of mana, lower the rank.
---
I'll be leveling axesmith to try to craft my own Nightfall and Annihilator as shaman. If it's not impossible to find mining nodes, theres some gear to be made while leveling.
---
And "Greater Hardening" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Because there are people who like to please their eyes when playing instead of having a fucking ugly character.
---
I couldn't agree more! That's why I'm going DPS and no tanking or healing. Save a fortune on changes.
---
Let me guess that band that you dislike the most in this "list" is Dimmu Borgir.
---
I don't consider myself a elitist metal head but I have to say I really don't like Sabaton. I's a metal band for normie dads. I can't stand hearing "soldiers rest in mud" and "suffered heavy losses" every other song.
---
Nah, weekdays will go by easily unlike the last weekend
---
Executus is the next logical name.. although I think it’s occupied by a retail server
---
More than one, but I appreciate the enthusiasm haha! It would be nice to see the community feel back in live!
---
I dont know. For some reason. Felwood comes to mind?
---
Heh, it is hard to play Classic in your sleep I suppose.
---
Yes.
---
Hi, /u/IAmHuman2

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/crytjc/where_are_the_british_playing_gehennas/). 
---
It’s not just slight changes that would make it work but major overhaul. The game is designed around the concept that player will die often and it’s no big deal.
---
I mean what would be the gameplay: spend your time in low level area farming mobs who can’t kill you unless it doesn’t give you XP anymore while crossing fingers that a rogue 10lvl above you doesn’t one shot you? Being at the mercy of one player getting afk,DC or trolling you in a dungeon?
---
Hardcore mode only works with games where death means you fucked up, in WoW you can die dozen of times without having made a single mistake
---
Melees also have access to some reitemized gear. As well, Warriors have access to the reworked Fury tree which was garbage at launch. In general the whole thing is going to be piss easy.
---
Private servers with progressive itemization and buffed boss armor were probably closer to the legit 2005 experience.
---
https://willitclassic.com/view/6CleY1wpKSPUo4Q6mQgt
---
You can't drain life elementals.
---
So make sure you have a healer nearby to res you, unless your a shamen. Even if you die you can just roll a new character. Will it take a long time to level? Of course, that's why it's called "hardcore"
---
Anyone out there reading this, please know that this embarrassing scumbag does not represent the classic community. I wouldn't be surprised if he's a paid shill, in fact.
---
Literally my favorite thing, absolutely hands-down, about Classic will be my ability to actually DO THE THINGS before they become obsolete or get nerfed.
---
Be prepared to be blamed for deaths, but don't take it personally. Other players may be impatient, douchey and need someone to blame. 
---
Always announce a mana break. 
---
If you can find yourself a tank to team up with and find your rhythm of healing by choosing the spell ranks according to the situation. It will help your mama pool.
---
That brings back memories!
---
As long as you're healing normally and not getting oom in your fights, you're not less efficient to the point it can be called "gimping".
---
Trade chat isn't global and if that person or of the city or is at work and not online maybe you get your enchant before the raid.
---
I assume to look for people for dungeons or quests. Maybe some guild recruiting as well. 
---
I joined because I wanted to know roughly how many members the discord had, if that gave any indication for the actual server population on launch. Or how the community behaves. If it is any accurate then Shazzrah is going to be a dumpster fire.
---
Nope. Our community chose PvE because we wanted to avoid the PvP server drama
---
ive decided to take my wife on a 4 day holiday and come back on the 26th :D
---
the thing about shs/deep sub pvp builds was, they had a tremendous amount of utility and mobility, but only a little bit of burst, and it wasn't super reliable.
---
if you could get your head out of the box of thinking that "rogue = shadowstep," there were a lot of viable comps for non-shs rogues that did more and more predictable burst, like [muti/spriest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HnthGAKrn8)
---
you didn't see just a ton of non-shs rogues up in the 2500+ zone because non-shs builds (like harp and muti) were really just kind of pretending to be things other than rogues and they weren't necessarily the best class to bring for that role
---
that said, a few folks did some work
---
No, he has no clue what he is talking about.
---
pokemon GO, gw2, and factorio mostly. also work on weekdays.
---
Araspecto pactaru
---
Nobody cares what you make but they do care about people like you fucking up the game.
---
(I started out on a private server because my family was cheap)
---
wandering into Westfall as a level 6 and getting killed by a young fleshripper. that motivated me like you wouldn't believe. I wasn't good at the game, but I was going to get stronger and get to the mysterious level 60 like my Mom did already.
---
I played constantly going from zone to zone, doing every quest that wasn't broken, and I even tried leveling by just discovering zones for a while. as a level 20 (I think), I managed to stick to the road, and corpse skip all the way to the Blasted lands somehow when I saw my first skull level enemy. and that gave me a second wind in leveling.
---
The private server got shut down when I was level 53. in front of a cave with a bunch of ogres in the Blasted lands. I cried. (I was 9)
---
Pretty much this.  
---
Horde racials are nice.  But not having to wait 15 mins for AB is nicer.
---
Fire is basically two buttons
---
Early on you could.  Not in 1.12.

---
You're one of those dead set on layering saying, even though they specifically mentioned again that its gone by p2 in the last blue post adressing servers?
---
Define real?
---
The one with 14k people was created first, however the moderation is non existent and it's basically 4chan with rape posts, loli and general bigotry in the general channel not getting deleted.
---
The smaller discord had the drama of the RMT mods however that got cleaned up quickly and the people behind it removed. 
---
so it depends if you want a decent community well moderated discord, or 4chan with zero moderation... I know which I'd say is more legitimate!
---
I start my new job on the 25th

---
So lets use Phase 4 gear BiS vs. Phase 4 gear BiS no-cloth to compare a resto druids performance in AQ.
---
You lose 38 spirit but gain 17 Mp5 - so your mana regen increases. You lose 250 health and 105 mana. Not too much. You lose 1% crit, which is a fair bit. You gain +90 healing, which is more than a fair bit.
---
TL;DR - You lose very little. It's literally only 3 pieces you swap out anyway.
---
If your guild refuses to take you into AQ based on this, or you're suddenly finding yourself struggling on the healing meter because of this, I can gaurantee there are other issues than the gear.
---
Very true. Blizzard can review in-game communications easily enough but if there were none there's literally nothing they can do from an evidence standpoint.
---
So true. When my credit card info was stolen and I saw that the guy spent it all on wc3 and tft keys I thought 'Yes thats justice blizzard. Get rekt'
---
I agree that it would likely need a overhaul, which obviously changes wow, I believe a system could be found that would work. Think of Deadman mode and hardcore iron man in Runescape
---
This is exactly what I’m planning to do. I took a week off of work and will absolutely nolife the shit out of it.
---
Gonna try to grab a few levels during release if it’s possible then go to sleep to get ready for the nolifing sprint
---
You're one of those that can't read?
---
I thought it is only to bind clicks and I think that is a really bad way to play, especially in pvp
---
Blizzard now has probably better tools to track this. Most likely they would take thegold away and ban the gold seller and the person who bought the gold. I highly doubt they would ban the third person who is just a victim, especially if they are high profile.
---
Isn't the guild APES? What server are they rolling on?
---
Pvp disabled?
---
The other classes
---
My Serbian crew is also anxious about moving, we are probably staying on Shazzrah as well.
---
I want that buff. For scientific reasons of course.
---
Dual talents are wotlk
---
I think their point isn't that Classic isn't fantastic, it's that in 15 years we have essentially made zero progress on MMO's.
---
To me it's bitter sweet, yeah I get to play classic again, but seriously why had nothing better come along?
---
Back then I imagined a game 15 years into the future would have all the things I love about classic, but with a whole lot more on top. Dynamic instances, high end graphics, free form combat, a much larger world with much more players, in world player housing, etc. None of these thing happened properly in any MMO since... disappointing.
---
we are ALL pioneers on this blessed day! :)
---
haha I know it's scuffed it's supposed to be only a teaser for classic. I appreciate it though!
---
I play in EU and I'm not sure that this social movement will be popular with us. Therefore, I am looking for a sponsor who will pay me at least 1 month of playing in US so that I can devote my time to this interesting action :)

literally on the front page rn, cringe.

---
You’ll need to do more then tell people to listen to a two hour podcast.
---
Yeah, that was going to be my top choice too (in conjunction with making more specs viable, if you could call that a feature). I've always liked to swap between roles and characters to try out new things, but that's less appealing when respecs are expensive and you've often only got one viable spec for PvE anyway.
---
LFR just to watch the meltdown
---
1 phase out of 6 is major?
---
My one man operation selling gold is going to ruin the game? The gold goes back into the economy and makes crafted and raw materials vastly cheaper due to increased supply from my farmers. And then the little Timmy who buys the gold is going to spend his gold and inject it into then economy. 
---
Arguably it makes a better economy directly and indirectly, for all those but the farmers, who benefit indirectly.
---
And then for boosting, who cares if little Timmy buys a fully raid geared character? He will still be bad and just have the epeen flex on people. Then get shunned out of good groups for being the worst player they have ever seen despite the gear.
---
Yes, I vendored it. That was very aggressive of you to jump to that conclusion lol.
---
That was an amazing story! One that guilds can tell their recruits, one to awaken courage in the fearful hearts of low-levlers.
---
There was no guild bank in classic? This is gonna be a shock when I’ll first time play classic I guess lol. I also never thought about dungeons being something else than 5 man and learned that a few days ago. 
---
But: I think aside from this whole layering thing that goes wrong so much cross realm was a good invention for small servers. I’ve played on a small rp pvp that hardly had enough players being in one region to defeat elite quest mobs.. so it was a good thing they at least pooled some servers and gave people the opportunity to group with players from other servers if they needed help.
---
When WoW launched in 2004 the server were unstable for over a month. That is 99% not going to happen with Classic.
---
[Not all rank 14s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdzj0Hn5VNI)
---
Third fight, two blinds.
---
But Maydie's PvP video wasn't supposed to be about skill. It opens with his weapon. He is saying it is his gear that wins him fights, but that when his gear isn't enough, it is his friends that make the difference between success and failure, or even whether you play at all. That message, that friends are important and not shiny purples, is why the video resonated so well.
---
I always remember it as 44 is half way, 50 is 2/3.
---
Having said that I always find 50-60 pretty easy compared to 44-50 for alliance: more zones to quest in and the goal is in sight!
---
Goldmakers have nothing to do with maintaining classic.
---
Are you retarded? They're literally defunct.
---
Stalagg is not EU
---
Yes, it absolutely is. It's one of the longer lasting phases out of the 6 and it's one of the most impactful ones too.
---
your math is terrible lmfao
---
Thats a big difference indeed. We will see. I think the idea of Normal servers hurt the game. There were (almost) no PvE servers on pservers scene and therefore all the raiders were forced to join PvP realms resulting in even population slightly in favor for alliance. Based on discords it seems, that highest disproportional in favor for horde will have Shazzrah, meanwhile Gehennas seems quite decent
---
This is some bullshit advice in real life too.
---
Mute was a warlock.
---
About 1 hour is about mages and listen at 2x speed at its done it 30mins
---
I attribute this to angsty undead rogues.
---
Barov
---
so assuming your definition of merge is correct. Then everyone concerned about "merging" servers is an idiot, even the guys at blizzard. AS why would they "merge" low pop servers rather than "connect" them? And if connecting is indeed a painless solution why would blizzard be afraid of having some realms eventually go low pop?
---
Are you disrespecting the Shaman tank?
---
Ultima Online had in world housing and that was pre-wow. It seems like the further we go in the future, the further we digress in a lot of ways.
---
&gt; It's reward addiction
---
Yeah this is it... exactly
---
only on /r/classicwow will something this absolutely fucking braindead retarded get unironically upvoted.
---
ITS TOO SLOOOOOOW
---
:D
---
I cant see a world where less tham 50% of players stop playing within the first two weeks tbh. Thr pace of vanilla is so slow in comparison to modern WoW, I cant help but feel we will lose a lot of people early
---
But some are creatively impared so they can at best try "TrueLegolas" instead, but that is also taken, so they end up with "TrueLegolaXxX12", because there is a high numer of equally creative player! :P
---
I just subbed now to give the client time to download on my temperamental broadband connection. I imagine more and more people will be joining the closer the date gets.
---
And then you get real quiet when the BIS tank dies in AQ with the boss at 1%
---
essential trinket tbh. i would dare say it's the best thing for rushing to enemy territory in AV.
---
It's times like this where I hope I don't randomly die from a car accident or an anvil to my head before release date.
---
someone get this man a doctor, he's being PLAGUED by 2-3 threads a DAY with a similar subject. How awful, how dreadfully awful. Are you ok? Keep breathing and stay calm help is on the way.
---
guild bank please
---
I wanted to play WoW casually, since  I don't have much time to play. A few weeks later I'm just plowing through min/max leveling videos, class progressions and BiS gear planners.
---
Uh, yes? Because it has happened before. If you are on a server and some weirdos start sharing illegal things the server gets nuked, alongside it's users.
---
&gt;trying to make roleplaying "chad"
---
It is treason then
---
Achievements but with an option to turn them off... I enjoy them, others don’t...

Sorry I couldn't just pick one, I tried! 😁

Slayer is the time for ranged leveling!

You could have at least waited a day or two before reposting this in a feeble attempt to gain karma. It’s literally on the front page right now
---
Could you please tell me your reasoning about how arena had such a negative effect on the game
---
I know, but I said please.
---
I have the skill set to create such a tool. I still think you're a scumbag if you provide these types of "services".
---
I'll take my honest wage writing websites for companies with legitimate business over your six-figure bullshit any day of the week, thankyouverymuch.
---
I don't get it.
---
Doesnt affect your Blizzard account
---
L-&gt;C: probably a convenience thing.. is aoe loot a thing in classic?  
---
C-&gt;L: i would de-streamline questing to the point where knowing where to go and what to do was like classic (aka reading comprehension), and then those that don't want that can just download the addon
---
Get the businessmen out, sure, but why the casuals? Gaming started as being basically toys, and I think a large part should continue serving that purpose. I rejoice when my 9yo sister likes playing the latest Zelda or asks me to play a quick Mario Kart race.
---
Or at leasst look at all the dialog/animations.
---
That's fine for duels and 1v1 battles but in BG's it's a very different ballgame.
---
Skinning, Mining, Blacksmith and Enchanting.
---
It allows you to make some gear and enchant it along the way, and you can DE whatever you dont need to make some coin.
---
RNGesus smiled upon you that day
---
so what u think we should expect? will a regular mortals be able to log in first 30min ?
---
Hardcore progression in 15 year old content lul. 
---
Raids are gonna be absolutely stomped on these servers, week 1 for anything that isn't gated behind some grinds like ragnaros for example.
---
People worry way too much about the minmax in PVE , the shit specs and connections people raided on back then were a thousand times worse.
---
In BGs DoT + Chain Fear + CC + NF procs...
---
Source? The math I've seen on the subject says otherwise.
---
Sometimes the hardest decisions require the greatest sacrifice. I’ll see you all in WSG from atop my mountain of alliance corpses. For the Horde.
---
yes, I play at 3440x1440 with no issues
---
Ya we used Ventrilo, an ancient way of communicating online.
---
Do you really think the Activision bosses know Warcraft 3 came before World of Warcraft, "there is a 3 in one name!"?
---
I'd say warlock has a higher learning curve then most classes too but it is nice for leveling thanks to blueboi but annoying because you have to farm soul shards
---
Thank you!
---
True, but your discord getting hit can be bad as well.
---
man...that comment made you look like a total asshat
---
Web development has as much to do with reverse engineering as a Nascar driver compared to a delivery driver. 
---
Honestly laughable that you would even compare the two. If you at least flexed application developer then maybe you would deal with memory or inlining at least.
---
Citation needed on dungeon leveling. Don't see how it could possibly be faster than an optimal questing route.
---
I don't know if I'm more impressed by the 2vs4 or by the fact that you remember the exact levels of your opponents after all these years
---
Yup no guild banks. Generally the GM or an officer would have an bank alt and would keep items for the guild for distribution. My guild used to use the guild site to request something or over ventrilo (lol I miss this)
---
I guess I was lucky to have been on a ok population server to not experience lack of players that were around and willing to help. I don't like cross realm because it doesn't allow for player reputation on the server. I loved that I knew the good players from the bad, that I made friends from random encounters in killing elite mobs and generally felt like it was our community.
---
Out of curiosity, which addons will everyone be getting?
---
Which will be the most useful ones to have for pvp/pve/QoL?
---
Thank you
---
Not really. All pallies where in full T2 when we did AQ40 and Naxx. We were a progression guild so I guess we knew what we were doing. Also I remember that we never went oom as pallies
---
Was leveling my 1st character, an undead warlock in Western Plaguelands when I ran straight into a group of 3 alliance scum just past the Bulwark
---
I'd managed to fear one and seduce another (was leveling destro after watching a drakedogg video)  but was hamstrung and going down fast.
---
As this was happening one of the first High Warlords on our server, a Tauren enhancement shaman name Neato, just happened to be passing by. 
---
Three consecutive windfury procs later Neato  had cut them all down and I realized how lucky I was that I would never have to deal with shaman in pvp. I think I gave him a healthstone as thanks.
---
Two of the PvP servers are "Full" and Blizzard suggests that we go/move to Gehennas. They will most likely add a 4th shortly, after the population evens out a bit.
---
Because skinning easy. You can skin almost everything. You gotta find mining nodes
---
Shazzrah is overpopulated as fuck, the rest are full. 
---
If you don't mind roleplayers left and right, Zandalar Tribe will be very liveable queue wise with a more laid back community.
---
Also best melee animations. The forward flip. Mmmmm.
---
With amphetamines you won't need to sleep!
---
yeah if only reforged was out already :\[
---
Why would you even care about server names? Its completely irrelevant for your gameplay. They could just name the servers 1, 2 and 3 for all I care.
---
We are rolling ench tailor on the mage and lw skinning on the lock.
---
Funnel lw crafted gear to level ench faster, and extra gold through skinning.
---
Being fully enchanted throughout the leveling phase will help some :)
---
you could always just wait until after the games launch, shit IS going to hit the fan and there will be more servers added
---
i know this is supposed to be a joke but it will be actually true...
---
You'd be surprised what people will wait for if they believe they're getting the best experience.
---
Bought a German shepherd puppy last Wednesday. Times fucking flying. Highly recommend.
---
You won't get banned just for not attacking each other on sight. If you start win trading BGs or helping each other control farm spots against your own faction, that's when you'll get in trouble.
---
I'm calling an idiot out for spouting crap. They have nothing to do with eachother. It's FUD and it's dishonest. 
---
It's common practice to call out people like that in the engineering world, since in this world, you can prove what is true or not.
---
btw gallywix and oblivion are both rmt behind the scenes. They are both also a fucking pest in trade chat
---
Especially the anvil thing. That seems to happening a little to often in cartoons for it to not happen in real life.
---
1 hr? holy shit im never getting married
---
That's pretty much my plan too. I have the week off but I want to keep the same sleep schedule as my GF. Also I'm hoping that starting in the morning will mean lower queues compared to launch
---
enthroned darkness triumphant is a great album for sure
---
Killing myself to hurt them more #LivingMyBestLife
---
Just unzip the addon folder in interface/addons
---
What are you going to do after the first 48 hours?
---
My only friend that was willing to play classic WoW with me wanted to join a guild that was doing cross faction collusion and kinda forced me to follow them to whatever server they picked. They went to a west coast server and we both live east coast, its gonna make raiding a pain in the ass for me, honestly makes me want to reroll if blizz opens another pvp server.
---
"Before I give you the Big News I'm announcing Classic!"
---
Not sure if Classic not being the Big News will age well :P
---
See you back home? Dude your 22 you’ve never played classic. Your not fooling anyone 😝
---
What planet are you on.
---
IRC wasn't some arcane technology no one understood. Server wide IRC was commonly used and is pretty much identical to Discords usage here.
---
Try Wastyy?
---
My Brother (42 Priest) and me (40 Paladin) were near crossroads and meet a 60 t2 mage and we somehow managed it to kill him. It was a insane long battle but we won.
---
Guild bank is probably my big one...always surprised it wasn't a thing from the get go,as a perk to joining one in the first place.
---
Use joana's, no guide will be perfect but he has put years of effort at this point to get it to where it is today. If you're strapped for time its simple and efficient  you'll feel like you made good progess everytime you get to play
---
You've been doing this on retail or on private servers? Blizz has pretty good bot detection so I'm sure you'll be banned unless you found a way around that. 
---
Also how do you gear a bot in raid gear? I don't believe there are bots who can run a raid without anyone noticing.
---
100% - no fucking way am I going to do 30+ hours day 1 and get less than 6 hours of sleep each night.
---
I've done the content phase 1 has to offer in the past... and we wont see phase 2 for a couple months minimum so no reason for me to rush or be sleep deprived.
---

---
Trust me it was never hard finding that stuff on p servers. I doubt it will be hard on classic with how many more people there will be.
---
I played towards the end of vanilla actually
---
Transmogs as something you can opt into through the interface menu.
---
E.g. By standard you see everyone in the normal gear, but toggling transmogs on allows you to see mogged sets/mog your own stuff.
---
yes please

That one is real :/

If he posted this from his 2005 PC with 10 fps while browsing with internet speed from 1995 and it took him days to render all those pages, and on top of that he's a boomer and doesn't know how to use his PC at all, but through guidance of his other boomer friends that in their turn overheard how to use internet explorer from their children, managed to somehow post this. Would it still be considered low effort, or should it be considered an epic achievement at this point?
---
Yeah exactly. It's also accentuated by the fact that blizzard's main driver is the casual audience and they know this. Running a server for hardcore would most likely be unprofitable - but i could be wrong.
---
Yeah man, i mean when you think about it, theres so many players waiting for the launch, at least some of them will get in some kind of accident causing them to be unable to play the game
---
I think Luna Unit Frames got ported for Classic. Check WoW Interface. Pretty sure I stumbled upon it while browsing the addons.
---
I plan on sleeping/napping until 2-3 hours before launch, then I'll play for 23hrs (launches 01:00 for me).
---
After this I switch into a similar pattern like yours with of 8hrs of sleep, 16hrs of mostly playing for the first week. Will have proper food mealprepped for two weeks as well!
---
Forsaken pre-cata intro naration. I quote: "Harboring no true loyalty for their new allies, they go to any lengths to ensure their dark plans come to fruition."
---
Congrats
---
Nah, I like the creativity it forces you to take in trying to make adaptable talent sets. For example, my Pala's going to be a Prot/Holy mix when he initially hits lvl 60 so I can both tank and heal dungeons if I've the appropriate gear.
---
Then I'll be switching to a Holy Shock build (Holy/Ret) so I can both heal but also PvP.
---
It might not be minmaxing, but it's fun to try cover multiple bases with one spec.
---
TIL, thank you kind stranger!
---
Took me about 40 levels to realize there were talent points :(
---
Pick Gehennas. Or just wait for them to release the next one, which they most likely will do very soon
---
Yes, the faction forming was very hamfisted. Thrall had no contact to the Forsaken at all, the literal ocean separated them. There were no Forsaken on Kalimdor and the remaining Horde on Azeroth had been wiped out in Blackrock &amp; Roll, Too!   
---
As for the Alliance, the refugees of Lordaeron had no relations to Stormwind and their Alliance with Ironforge, and the Night Elves only had contact with survivors of Lordaeron and Quel'Thalas, as that's where Maiev chased Illidan to.
---
It worked out, but lorewise it was not really supported by the end of War3 TFT
---
Guild recruitment for the people that want to go for week 1/2 MC clears. That's the reason I use them.
---
I've been on shazz disco for a week but was only using it for giving advice on rolling priest. Just checked the general chat and its fuckin twitch chat at its worst
---
So hes speed is even worse
---
Classic literally revolves around gold. You ruin the game if people can just buy wow tokens. If you go through the black market then you're risking your account and most people don't want to do that.
---
Nerdy Eminem
---
No, you'll be fine not killing every red you see...you might even get a list of Alliance guilds from your Horde guild that are on a list of "We're cool with these guys"...happened more than once in my vanilla experience.
---
This, + you have portals, blink, and other fun abilities, so the class isn’t boring imo.
---
You want enchanting for the lesser and greater Magic wand tho. Or you wanna buy them from others (will be expensive). I think its to late to reroll skinning if you go for greater Magic wand first. So you need to choose between more dps (faster leveling) or skinning money
---
Pets do not have a taunt. Their Growl just builds threat and not a lot. Having the pet up next to the tank in threat can be good if the tank dies. Then the pet offtanks instead of the healer or mage.
---
WillE has some great videoson youtube  too, his 'was it any good though' class summary has been killing time for me!
---
Is this on loop or just never ends lol
---
BTW night elves all of a sudden picking sides in horde vs alliance conflict after wc3 seems farfetched too
---
Lol, that is a really nice story, typically something a 9 year old would do. And not giving up but finding creative solutions.
---
This plus the spurs? Used to call that the poor man's epic mount.
---
They seem fairly even, with a bit more Alliance than Horde on both, which is usual on PvE servers.
---
Im mostly fishing and playing the auction house in bfa while trying to get champions of azeroth to revered. Also doing the eternal palace lfr once a week. Additionally I try to finish up all questlines that came up in real life so I can concentrate on classic on release
---
🤣😆😂🤣😆😂
---
Shazz will probably be a shitshow at launch and when they remove the layering. But it also has the lowest chance of turning into a ghost town once the "tourists" leave. Personally going Gehennas to avoid at least some of the queues, unless they add more servers at launch.
---
I'd find a new guild if I were you. I'd also imagine that most guilds who are recruiting before the game is even out, is not really that casual.  
---
I'm sticking to DKP guilds.
---
Man why the fuck did they fuck up that site.
---
How is wanting a logical and structured loot system make the guild not casual?
---
we were just talking about one of these the other day on the Durotan discord. I think the launch of classic might pull a few of these out of storage :D
---
Most definitely won't happen. The game is much easier with 1.12 talents, the overall knowledge of the game have only increased, paired with the general expectation of the average raider and how the average player have gotten better and more hardcore over the years.
---
Weak Auras. It's one of the most customizable and useful addons to have, since you can basically track everything. If you know how you can have the functionality of, let's say PallyPower, over to even the simplest of buff and repair reminders. And you can even use custom sounds and icons.
---
Yeah Mirage Raceway
---
Ehh, it's a shit movie, but at least the orcs are pretty. I'm probably still gonna rewatch at as part of the weekend pre release hype.
---
Paying 15$ a month is not being given it, we pay it’s their responsibility
---
Nope.
---
Don't tell me what to do.
---
I figured. Thanks.
---
this is getting out of hand :D
---
How reliable is the Twitch app in recognizing which add-on is actually compatible? Does the author have to mark it as "compatible" or something? Some people have complained that the Twitch app has updated an add-on to a non-compatible version.
---
Anyone else pick their race solely on how cool their emblem was as a kid?
---
"Believe me, you don't want that..."
---
They would have decided that beforehand. Now it would cause an even bigger queue than on full realms.
---
I'm not talking about the wow-market site at all. I know nothing about them, and I specifically said, I am not one of the big companies.
---
But if you make a bot, then yes, you will most likely have reverse engineered some of wow. Unless you do something stupid like a pixel bot. 
---
Saying a web developer, is key to this business is a joke. You know nothing about what you are talking about, and are completely out of your realm. You are so abstracted from what goes on at a systems level. On top of that, most people like myself use marketplaces, forums, or discord(Skype in the oldschool days), completely avoiding the need for a web developer. And if I did, I would just make one myself. Front end is a joke, and the logic required for the backend is so boilerplate it hurts.
---
Stop talking out your ass, and trying to make it seem like you have any idea about what you are saying. It's actually laughable, that you think it does. And it's a bit sad.
---
Yeah that's correct, it's made by Sleepa. Check out his YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaAyOOgkg4K7bqfbcDOa13Q
---
Can confirm, used to get grouped with these ninja looting nooblets
---
It did, I set it up in the last stress test.
---
Gross.
---
Any 'casual' guild that uses loot council is one you should stay the hell away from (which, you seemingly understand anyway). It's a massive red-flag (like the size of Sargeras sword sticking out of Azeroth).
---
***
---
Just bail from the guilds, they need you a lot of a hell more than you need them (and quite frankly, keeping 40 recurring people interested on a week-in-week-out basis is going to be the toughest challenge of Classic).
---
Im sitting here on Faerlina and just giggling.
---
Dont speak for a community you're not a part of
---
Depends on how long the queues are in 6 months I'd say. Every server will have community events. Plus Faerlina has the streamers so they'll prob be the server with the most community events.
---
HotW and Moonglow... It's so hard to decide:)
---
Tried starcraft remaster cartooned? Shit is hilarious!
---
Not surprised really. Also their Shazzrah discord is toxic af, nothing but low life memers and spam all day long. This post needs more upvotes!
---
Maybe just write about it and not post a 12 minute video.
---
This got me right on the feels
---
Then you are trashy RPer :)
---
you can download addons into your game addons folder at any time, you cant configure them until you sign into the game tho
---
Wait really? That's amazing and I need that in my life
---
To me finding an efficient way to complete a bunch of quests was part of the fun.
---
personally when someone asks me for help on a quest, even if I've already done it, id likely help out anyway. my old guild won't all play classic so we will all have to join a bigger guild anyway, maybe this way i meet some nice people to raid with
---
It's about to not be in the past anymore... and people are going to realise it makes itemisation a lot more fun
---
Eh nothing more vapid than the “its a video game” card. It’s a hobby of mine that I have passion for, I must be some sort of monster. Hardly, it just happens that I’m not some goodie 2 shoe who will forgive without cause out of some asinine notion that it somehow makes me a better person. He is accountable for his mistake, same as anyone, including for “just a game”.
---
I was asking about configuring them.
---
why's it called "anime" when they animate as little as physically possible?
---
No that's why I didnt give my opinion.
---
World housing in that game was a croc when everywhere was taken. Also dendrites the scenery when going across any open ground and it being covered in houses. I like the way Asheron's Call handled it. There were select few overworld housing, then there were portals to "studio" style apartments.
---
Me and my friends gotten to rock bottom levels of boredom. We found ourselves on roblox playing a MLP roleplaying game one night. I just feel tainted now.
---
I feel the same, tho i still wanna be ahead of the pack for some key moment to avoid trouble. Like leaving the starting zone pretty fast and being ahead in levels in stv. Then I'll slow down a lot and enjoy the ride through dungeons professions and stuff.
---
Well I'm assuming the goal is to stay alive. I don't think you can maintain 2/3 for weeks or longer.
---
Elite mobs do about 60% less dmg to a mage in the same gear in classsic vs (blizzlike) p servers, was the tldr of the maths post I read
---
Not as ancient as Roger Wilco.
---
Could also mean the **RISE OF BEAR TANKS**  
---
Although, I'm not holding my breath for that one lol
---
AoE spit. I like it.
---
So they already spoilered the first raid, I wonder what this mystique end game will be and which raid comes after MC :O
---
I'm thinking about going enchanting &amp; tailoring. Do you believe this is viable while leveling or will I be bankrupt trying to keep my professions high enough to match the content?
---
Really like that you have different options for the tailoring level based on if you're going to level enchanting or not, that will really help me out whenever I decide to go for this combo. Thanks!
---
Back then more hardcore players rolled horde and more casual rolled Alliance. That is the main reason horde dominated the bgs.  But a pre made alliance team was as scary as it is on pservers. There were just less of them
---
I wonder how many of the new players will be sucked into the addiction, while they currently think that they'll just try it for a week.
---
For me it's that im the head of a guild with mixed players, wish a smaller core that is more hardcore. Some people who are more casual might not be as aware of which item is best for who or which role or when the next upgrade for a certain class can be had. And instead of having everyone read up on that kind of stuff to avoid someone getting an item in mc and replacing it with a dungeon drop while it might be bis until aq40 for someone else. That is done by the more dedicated core. 
---
On top of that it is also a way to reward players who are dedicated to the guild.
---
Side note, planning to run a loot council with the class leaders &amp; officers, backed by spreadsheets regarding raid attendance and bis lists.
---
With the target audience of Classic wow it isn't monster you want to invest in.  It's Mountain dew.  After all they already partnered up once for Wrath which also predates the ruining of Azeroth (Cata)
---
For me it's Holy Shield or that sweet crit chance on Holy spells/Holy Shock.

"We want the classic experience but miss me on anything inconvenient".
---
Sorry, unusable on mobile.
---
Made a 5 year education take 10 years in my case with bad grades instead of good grades. But hey, I am in a good career now, so I managed.
---
i did the exact same thing on a blood elf hunter! got to 94 and now i’m just stalling. very bored with the game and just waiting for classic
---
Best way to communicate 🤣
---
Same year here!
---
Private servers yeah
---
You don't seem to understand the basic reasoning for loot council.  
---
Loot Council = Fast HC Progression
---
In Classic i was in dire maul with a grp of total strangers, I haven't played with anyone of them before. Rngesus was with me that day and forors compendium actually dropped. At this time the book sold at the auction house for 3-5k. Since I was the tank I was the only one who could use the sword. I didn't even have to ask, everybody in the grp said "gz" and passed on the loot. Had the sword at the same night because we went onyxia with the raid ;) 
---
So it's more about the nicest thing people did not do: ninja the book and sell it.
---
PvE? I fart in your general direction.
---
Are there any official discords? I dont see blizz creating one
---
I don't find it satisfying.  I find it frustrating.  It means the people at game companies actually understand the problem, they just won't take action.  Or at least, they have a reasonable grasp of the problem; I think Mark is missing one big thing here: the casuals aren't that invested in the game to begin with and will never be converts.  They're perennial tourists.  You can snowball your recruitment to your game with advertising and casualization, but you'll never make those players stay.  Not because the hardcore base stops recommending the game, but simply because they don't have the personality to get invested to a level where they'd feel any loyalty or fall victim to sunk cost fallacy.  The casual players are inherently short term customers.  It's just the way they consume games.
---
Sacrificing long term stability for short term, unsustainable growth is obviously a bad long-term decision.  It's so obvious, it feels a little weird to even state it.  But with the way corporations, and more importantly executive pay structures, are set up, there's no incentive to promote the long term health of the company over large quarterly growth.  Collect your check for 5 years, jump ship to somewhere else and leave some other poor sucker to clean up the mess.  And that's not just a problem for publicly traded companies; any company that isn't a sole proprietorship is subject to the threat of someone mortgaging the future of the company for a payout today.  People are incredibly short-sighted.
---
That sounds great, I've never used it before. Do you know if there are any good resources for different classes in classic to get a good foundation to start with? thanks!
---
For me nothing beats walking to Stormwind and going wooooaaah what the hell? And that music 😍
---
Why pop caffeine pills when I can just snort cocaine?
---
100%. I just don't get it. Funny enough both GM's have been memespecs which makes you wonder even more.
---
While people have different reasons for wanting Classic, ranging from just pure nostalgia over to legitimately liking it the most out of all the versions of WoW, there is no denying that companies cashing in on nostalgia of people born in the 80s and 90s is one of the best steps they could have taken. Speaking from a pure financial perspective.
---
Blessed Light, lend speed to our deliverance.
---
No, a loot council should be used to ensure the loot benefits the guild best, rather than an individual. 
---
That does not mean hardcore progression.
---
Trying to decide between mage and lock, not arsed about min/maxing or topping the charts, just wanna play for fun. Mainly going to be pve and might have a little dabble in pvp. Locks look pretty fun but also very tedious with the whole soulshard situation and also heard raid bosses can be boring as your just spamming the same spell. Mages look decent and fun but very squishy and dont seem to have as much variety.
---
What do?
---
The problem isn't one of server scaling.
---
If they have to scale up to accommodate several tens of thousands of users on layers, that's going to be just fine in phase one. You're right on that point.
---
The problem is with several tens of thousands of people on one server it's already too late to add *new* servers because those people are already levelling and investing themselves on an overpopulated server. A server which will have sick queues come phase 2.
---
Oh and by the way, nice going being an arrogant antisocial little shit to the other folks here. I feel bad for the sad fucks who have to work under such a man. God damn.   
---
Act like an adult, huh?
---
Saw a post a few days ago. It involved a priest shielding a pet to do a huge ass pull. Then use a frost mage to kite all the mobs, while other mages/warlocks grind the whole pack down with AoE.  
---
It does seem tricky to constantly coordinate 5 people, having them online at the same times, in the same area, etc.
---
I thought it was decent, but I also believe it did a pisd poor job of introducing the world for peoe who didn't know anything about warcraft. It didn't do a good job of saying, hay there's shit loads more content this world has to offer.
---
There's still caps on realm population with layering active. Blizzard hasn't disclosed how much it is, but they did communicate they're expecting severe queues on the big servers.
---
Exactly. I was just ranting because I'm kinda frustrated. Just looking for a casual cozy guild for me and my homies since we had our share of hardcore in vanilla.   
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
We don't want people who will intrude on our RP just because they want to avoid layering. Giving people a reason to want to join RP servers other than for RP purposes is a bad idea and will make communities clash.
---
Will private servers still be active after Classic is live? I'm curious about what is the general feeling among the community.
---
A big part of me wishes the whole community was going in blind like this again.
---
Planetside 2?
---
That's where I'm at now. Got my name's but haven't made my characters properly yet. Too nervous to delete them and risk losing names.
---
I think you are correct. Modern game studios are trying to turn art into industry. Games are art and storytelling, and it can't be industrialized without losing its soul.
---
Had almost forgotten about this. Can't wait to get the gz spams every time I level.
---
It's fun talking with other people who share an interest in a chat room. It's even better if these are people I can play the game with (soon).
---
No, they are put together by the classleaders, officers and me. And I expect most people will know their own bis. But not other peoples and how their bis compares to that of other classes. And with bis Im also including things that aven't bis but would also be useful. 
---
Dkp is very blunt and doesn't take those things into account
---
I never had room for soul shards in the bank , too much bop stuff I wanted to keep.  I did use one soul bag but always kept it equipped.
---
This made me chuckle. At least his wee baldy heid got it eventually.
---
Wastyboy
---
...no that still works for the bosses Goku fights
---
...but gnomes hate stairs?
---
You think you don't, but you do.
---
I think this was the point as well. And it's disheartening that nothing has happened since then.
---
What is life?
---
Having such a hard time between druid and shaman.
---
I mostly know all about both and just trying flesh out the following information on both.
---
Shaman, do I really need a million keybinds with the totems? How many totems do I really use in PvE enviroment? And is the totem management a huge hassle in vanilla as it seems? 
---
And for druid, do they do any damage at all when farming all kinds of stuff at 60? It really puts me off hitting like a wet towel in soloing, shaman would be alot better in everything but the totems are scaring me
---
&gt;3-4 layers per server buddy,
---
I'd like to see your source for that number, because I can't find it.
---
T1 and T2 is LEATHER
---
Yes! Played in a 3440x1440p AW3418DW model
---
I suspect this guy actually loves WOW. Getting to be wrong and make an announcement that makes a ton of people happy might be a little embarrassing but it would also be a good feeling for him.
---
Choose the right wife and this won't be an issue. Get a gamer girl.
---
Out of curiosity, I'd love to hear what these are worth
---
One more week on vacation with the Family 👌
---
Everyone will enjoy their alone time, once we are back 😆. Two days left to prepare the battleststion then.
---
then you gotta repair, so you hearth and walk back towards the entrance and rinse repeat lmao
---
I want to roll a paladin for that T2 set man, I know they were kind of meh, and i'd have to go lolret for levling, but damn I think they will be one of my top alts if I had the time.
---
Still, it's what the community was quite clear on. 1.12 1.12 1.12, always 1.12 was being shouted for a year straight.
---
. This is what I want in classic, make friends with the guild and have fun clearing content, as such I don’t care if I don’t get the first swords etc. I don’t mind putting in the work for raiding semi-hardcore but something that makes me uneasy is DKP.
---
I don’t want to deal with keeping track of DKP and bids, I don’t want to be salty about someone sniping a piece etc.
---
Just let me raid, and keep DKP far away.
---
yep.
---
I have the week off work, but I aim to eat well and sleep well.
---
the warrior T3 looks straight out of wrath, and isn't too bad.
---
But the Paladin T2 is as you said, hands down the best.
---
I've never played before but looking to board the hype train. Have done some research and I want to go with a shaman. I think for the end game I want to be restoration spec but for levelling I'll do enhancement to level quicker. I understand you can pay to respec talents, but I'm a little unsure of when I'd make the change. At 60? Would that mean a lot of my gear would be inefficient for healing if I've been engagement from 1-59? Thanks 😌
---
It wouldn't hurt to try a few classes. It's not like you will get far in a week so not much spoiled.  I recommend the server which name sounds like cosmos
---
In vanilla you lost durability when you die no matter what kills you.
---
Only way to configure em right now is a private server.
---
You could try setting some up in the BFA client and copying the settings over in your WTF folder but have not tried that yet myself.
---
So true. Or Sot Rue
---
Some are closing down, some are changing to become an instant level 60 AV kind of thing.
---
But are you goong to shift your day so that you sleep when most people want to play (17 to 02)?
---
What a horrible backdrop :p
---
The troll bow animation is the best, too. Shame they have such bad posture lol
---
https://wago.io/classic-weakauras
---
I haven't really looked at it that much, but there are already a few class specific ones. Most, if not all the WAs on there are player made, so expect the amount to increase once classic officially launches. Since only a relatively small pool of players had gotten access to the Beta the accessible WAs is small.
---
But you can just download retail WoW if you want and use a trial account if you don't have a sub and toy around with the addon a bit and see what it can do. Weak Auras is at its best, in my opinion, if you can make your own. I think one of the best examples is this one from Legion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEPwFlYjEg
---
Each time a spell crits it makes a chicken noise.
---
Let me approach you in a different way.  
---
What is your point? You mentioned you would have a smaller 'core' that is more 'hardcore'. This thread is for discussing loot systems for casual guilds.   
---
From your side of the fence I agree that Loot Council is better - It's just not casual. Which is the point of this whole thread.
---
Al dente actually got me
---
You underestimate my Hunter Macro skillz!
---
As far as I understand and have tried this isn't the case, because Classic is running on a modified version of the 8.x client retail uses. A lot of the addons working in Classic doesn't work on private servers for this reason.
---
Bear tanks weren't really boss tanks back in the day, they took too much damage. However I can't remember if we had figured out armor&gt;defense by then.
---
Imagine thinking getting corpse camped is fun lmfao holy fuck
---
I can imagine the role play for the rp realms exempt from layering: 
---
The time paradox happened due to the evil lord chromie. Now all the quantum realms exist as one. It took me 3 days to slay enough evil boars to level my power up enough to the 5th level. We exist in an oppressed realm where we all stand next to each other barely able to move due to over population.
---
There are a ton of cool versions of the tavern theme, from Vanilla onward, Horde taverns included, which alliance will never hear.
---
The best thing you can do is get the [Taverns of Azeroth soundtrack](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/games/music/wow-taverns-of-azeroth.html), which contains all the awesome versions.
---
Yeah there would have to be major modifications for TBC and WOTLK for it to work for me too. I hated flying mounts too and yeah it did introduce isolation, although it was slight as shatrath was a portal hub and no-one hung around there. The isolation got worse in WOTLK with Dalaran and then eventually the AH in Dalaran. I just loved the lore and gameplay of TBC and WOTLK being a previous WC3 player. Everything after Cata was not for me.
---
Original ooga gang confirmned to StaySafe they won't be doing the same come launch, was just something to do on the beta.
---
Will likely be imitators though.
---
Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire  
---
Burning, burning with desire  
---
Burning for the steel

---
Big chance they are going to add a new PVP server seeing how quickly Gehennas filled and the game is not even out yet.
---
Being RP doesn't change the fact that Blizzard don't want dead servers a few months down the line.
---
I'm probably roiling a female orc warlock, just because it's the race with least clipping. Plus mostly all the racials are tight for pvp.
---
I would like if it was that way, but it isn't.
---
Blizzard should put in mechanisms to help faction balance. I think separate queues for each faction is a good idea, as well as character creation being locked for factions that are above a certain % of the playerbase on the realm (defined through activity or something).
---
People in casual guilds are much less likely to farm full pre raid bis gear + consumables, so getting raid loot is even more important. Rolling for loot is terrible, people will be greedy fks that want everything that is purple even if its not a "real" upgrade or take something that is much better for someone else. Casual leadership probably cant be bothered to set up some dkp system.
---
Casual guilds also have to deal with lots more people that vanish after a few raids, especially when you need 40 man. Loot is pretty scarce and its much harder to gear up fresh players while progressing, since there is no easy catchup like m+.
---
Rofl feels so nice to relate to the dreaming part.. means I've been consuming too much lol
---
somewhere during the login queue shenanigans it put you on another server and you didnt notice.
---
happened to guildies (although they did notice) and I had to log back in and double check mine.
---
I went to opposite route. My gaming laptop died last week and I can't afford to buy a new one right now, so I'll be playing on a 7yo office laptop with a shitty GC (even for its time).
---
&gt; This assumes everyone realize that a mob allied to your own faction being healable is actually a bug. Which is of course an absurd assumption to make.
---
Someone who knows enough about the game to optimise a twink probably has a vague idea how very basic mechanics like that work. I'm not saying it would break the laws of physics if they did not, it is just extremely improbable.
---
&gt; Lets face it. You are just trashing for Internet points. 
---
Right now I'm at -19 points for calling this shit out, and you're on +12 for going "but you can't *prove* they knew they couldn't do it in vanilla!". So I think I know who the one "just trashing for Internet points" is.
---
&gt; Private servers try to closely emulate Vanilla. They dont claim to be perfect copies.
---
Pirate servers are Schrodinger's Blizzlike. When it suits their defenders they are 100% totally Blizzlike, the definitive work of thousands of meticulous neckbeards labouring for a decade to make everything perfect, and if you say otherwise you are a big mean hater who is just jealous of the people killing Rag in greens in week one with no fire resist. When it doesn't suit them, nobody ever said they were perfect copies, what did you expect, it's a private server!
---
&gt; Either way, this "exploit" like you called it is easily avoided by just not attacking the Paladin. You wont get PvP flagged otherwise.
---
If you are solo, as most of them seemed to be in the highlights reel, nah, you're screwed. You'll run out of health and mana fighting the mob before the paladin runs out of mana to heal them, and running out of that castle hoping not to aggro anything is a bit of a long shot.
---
&gt; If these horde were actually smart they would group up and just outdps the healing. Ten minutes later they are off doing another quest, and the Paladin cannot interfere.
---
For all we know that's what most of them did, and chuckles just edited together the handful of noobs who didn't figure out that strategy.
---
&gt; This is just a little fun
---
This is what every bully says, that they are just having a little fun. Sadly I think a lot of WoW griefers were victims of bullying at some stage and end up copying the behaviour and language.
---
&gt; This is exactly what the game is about.
---
I think you are right, for some people. For them playing the game is not nearly as fun as finding some way to ruin the game for someone else, even if only for a moment. There was a massively upvoted thread around here a while ago urging people not to fully loot world chests because they thought it was funny for other people to loot it, find one food item and be disappointed. That's the mentality for a lot of these people. Hurting people any way you can is funny.
---
You're so far up your own ass that you can't even see how much you are reading into my original comment that I clearly did not write.
---
But sure: You are very smart. The world revolves around you. You should definitely get an orange spraytan and start using words like "bigly" as I see no other way for you to get any smarter.
---
Forsaken really sucks you in.  
---
I made a forsaken back in the day and I can't play anything else.
---
Sub fee stopped them at the gate
---
IIRC, they stack but there is a cap.
---
The most recent nice thing was having a random level 60 give me +5 spirit on my 2H sword for free. It did wonders for me as a level 11 warrior.
---
Err I'm playing from 5am to 11pm. I sincerely hope there will be players around I can play with 😭
---
Oh, so you think "gimping" and "nonviable" have the same meaning. Gotcha.
---
Congrats i guess ? Hope you did not pay for it
---
Holy shit that's hilarious.  
---
Take my upvote!
---
No, I mean you will most likely get killed by a random trogg
---
You're probably better off going skinning and herb/mining instead of herb and mining.
---
There's no need to have enchanting yourself unless you're a Druid tank.
---
I don't like dealing with DKP either but I certainly do not want a memespec GM to keep track of who gets gear and who doesn't. I also just want a casual experience, hell at this point I'm almost down to just roll for gear with certain boundaries ofc.
---
The worst part is when you tryhard, get ahead of the pack and go to sleep, only to find out in the morning that there's a sizeable population of players who are like 10 levels ahead of you.
---
I'm so jealous. I know would burn out very fast if I began watching videos or streams of wow. A huge part of my interest and hype towards the game is because I've not touched the game for 10 years and that I want to rediscover it so bad.
---
I'm not even a part of discussion but your comment is pathetic.
---
I didn't have any success with this on the first stress test. It seems like they share somewhat the same client, but not enough for addons to function properly both places. Have you tried this?
---
they are not even full
---
How do you make these?
---
For the horde!
---
You can no longer learn the mystic arts or obtain the age of heaven through self cultivation.
---
Are you planning on no-lifing Classic, and thus decided to make your upcoming miserable life easier to end?
---
Lol, thanks. I enjoyed reading this
---
I loved the whole buff thing in classic. it sucks that they took it out later on and i don't really get why? Was it to make it so a specific class wasn't relied on so much?
---
Get a list of their names and let's gank em!!!! 
---
Just kidding I'm not that evil
---
actually sick, the way he drags his corrupted ashbringer on the floor towards Kel'Thuzad.. chills man.
---
"Albeit , a persistent one."
---
I think its gonna be pretty much the same. Dungens are easy on private servers as well. Difficulty depends more on your group then on enemy mobs.
---
Dat repost
---
I've got a guild and realm set, told my friends which realm it is and it's up to them if they want to join me or not.  
---
Got two close friends that'll likely roll on it.
---
You will die with that regret.
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
Stay in the loop then!
---
&gt;\- 80 healing less than Virgin build.
---
I'll invite virgin  
---
**Pros:**  
---
\-has 80 healing more that so called "chad"  
---
\-wont go afk because of gf\\wife aggro  
---
\-will stay all night to farm mats for me, bacause I'm his only friend
---
**Cons:**
---
\-none
---
Thanks alot for the answer!
---
One more thing, is na or eu more populated than the other?
---
Or are they about equal?
---
CD reliant=strength?
---
my personal experience with warlocks is that it gets pretty tedious and boring to open all fights with applying dots, especially on normal mobs while questing, as they die pretty quick. mages don't really have dots, buy rely on direct damage attacks. they're both casters, but play way differently than one another.
---
Followed by miraculous reserrection? Cos her know...bills to pay 😂
---
Aww man that sucks, the devil in me is like pull a sickie!!
---
Hi guys, planning to come back for classic since I really like the BC days and I wasnt playing before that.
---
I have a question regarding class choice, atm im wondering between prot warrior for tanking (which is my favorite thing to do), a druid (hybrid mainly healer for pve and pvp) and eventualy hunter (for having fun kiting) or enhancement shaman for low lvl pvp
---
From what I gathered, lvling is gonna be a lot harder and longer than other expansions so im kinda afraid to be playing warrior since it seems to be pretty damn weak.
---
On the other side druid seem to have every advantage with his hybrid nature, and from what I remember back in BC when I played feral druid you can solo elite quests etc
---
Also in PvP warrior look out of question to me, being kited all day is not exactly my idea of fun
---
Now what I have specific question about is dungeon, is it possible to play multiple roles in dungeon, ie heal as a leveling feral druid, tank as a resto druid and more importantly tank as a DPS leveling warior?
---
Ty for your help
---
Since you haven’t played any wow before, what makes you go with Tauren and shaman?:)
---
Not sure a out guilds clearing MC in greens, but the mind control fire resist buff was certainly a thing we did prior to raiding.
---
"Ready to work"- in country bumkin voice
---
What is love?
---
Tbh the 28-30th is probably better taking the days off.
---
First day or two might be really crowded/serverproblems etc.
---
Wait but what do you do with the dog once classic hits? I can't even manage to keep my hunter pet feed, how could i support a dog when grinding 40 hours then sleeping 4-6h
---
DR gets reset after ~18s so maybe you were kiting a lot in between. Also the dr wasnt shared in earlier patches and it was a bug for it to be shared in 1.12 but the but stayed and now is recreated.
---
There will be no cross realm battlegrounds in Classic
---
Sometimes that's just how things go. Developers capture lightning in a bottle, and are never able to do it again. Quake 3 Arena, Ninja Gaiden Black, Starcraft 1, Diablo 2, Unreal Tournament, Chrono Trigger, Team Fortress 2, the list goes on. Those games became considered classics for a reason: they were never topped in their genre.
---
There's nothing inherently wrong with that, it just means sometimes the pieces fall into place. The right, talented   
---
and creative people were there at the right time, and made the correct decisions during development, resulting in a fantastic product. Doesn't mean it won't happen ever again, we just haven't seen it yet, or know who it's going to be from, or what it's gonna be, even.

WTB: Harry on Oceanic PVP
---
If I could convince one of them to not be a dick and roll a tsnk
---
I searched for a homepage website to make it and found [start.me](https://start.me), which worked decently. Haven't tried any others yet, some other websites might work better.
---
Addons are tied to your account(locally). As far as I know there isn't a way to spoof it. Might be wrong but IDK.
---
I'm tempted to! I told my manager that I'm going away (because I'm ashamed of who I am) so I might just say there was a scheduling error 😂
---
Have you been on retail wow in recent times? Their current server infrastructure is absolutely atrocious. The moment you get more than 50 people in one zone lag just completely annihilates any meaningful sense of gameplay. I was surprised by the server performance during the stress tests, but I'm not holding my breath. Blizzard server quality has gotten a lot worse in recent years, unfortunately.
---
I get off work right when it releases, i figured there is no way it works right away...
---
&gt; How many totems do I really use in PvE enviroment? 
---
You mostly use 1 of each school to buff damage both in dungeons and questing 90% of the time. 
---
Strength of Earth, Searing or Fire Nova, Mana Spring or Healing Stream, Windfury or Grace of Air.
---
Other totems are basically situational but you need to be aware of their effects, obviously. Shaman is indeed the most keybind-intensive class.
---
Check out the 30/0/21 spec.  My plan is similar to yours for leveling, starting out as enhance, but at 40 I'll respec to the above as that's when you can get reasonable cast times through talents.  I'll stick with that elemental spec all the way to 60 and beyond, which will allow me to heal well in 5 mans and raids while still being able to kill things effectively out in the world.  I'll be using caster gear from 40 on, so when I get to 60 I've at least got something usable.  When I get to the point where I can afford weekly respecs and my guild is telling me they need me to have mana spring totem, that's when I'll start looking at a deep resto spec.
---
Where can I see pictures?
---
Yeah, very good point.
---
Take matters in your own hands and take ressurection sickness,  you will be ready för Classic!
---
They only released dates for phase 1, you know something we don't?
---
Leatherworking pairs surprisingly well.  Warriors get a lot of use from armor kits.
---
During the stress test I was a Druid and my buddy was a warrior.  I leveled LW and I would always give him an armor kit when he got an upgrade.  He did mining/blacksmithing.  So, there really wasn’t much use I got from him.  lol
---
Right now I have Wastyman but it's just not the same as to have just Wasty, you know?
---
&gt; You do not make the zone challenging for both.
---
Then nothing in the entire levelling experience is challenging for, or provides any upgrades for, anyone who has even raided MC. It would have been ezmode BFA-style levelling except without even having any loot upgrades to keep you interested.
---
&gt; You can, such as...
---
You realise this is WoW, a game which is mostly about improving the things in your eighteen equipment slots? The things which you cannot make drops for which are an upgrade to Dude #1 and Dude #2? The things which are the core upgrade mechanics apart from levels throughout the entire game?
---
What you are arguing for is an entire Outland experience with no gear upgrades, with raids that less than 1% of the population could dream of playing. Nobody would want to play it or pay for it.
---
&gt; You don't need to make every single piece of content for both people.
---
No, you are just throwing development time and hence money out the window every time you make content which 99% of the player base cannot access because they are not Naxx raiders.
---
&gt; This doesn't have to be a "theme park" MMO like BfA where every piece of content is doable by every player. I don't know why anyone would want that, and I think that's why we are interested in returning home to Classic. 
---
This is a false dichotomy: TBC hit the sweet spot in terms of accessibility, fun and challenge far, far better than vanilla did.
---
Thank God Blizzard didn't have someone like you running the show when TBC was developed. Instead of the entire player base enjoying challenging, fun, appropriately challenging content together with the vertical power differentiation cut down to a manageable size, we'd have had 99% of the player base stuck forever playing the same (relatively bad) vanilla content forever or more likely just unsubscribing, and 1% of the population ever seeing Karazhan let alone Serpentshrine.
---
Don't forget the Glove-Enchant. Thats why you always need 2 pairs of Tier1/2/3 Gloves.
---
No Soilwork? At the gates??
---
Aye the relativity of time is cool and understanding how that works is much more interesting than thinking it's an illusion
---
I just went on retail to check and used this macro:
---
    /target Prairie Dog
---
    /cleartarget [dead]
---
Near a Prairie Dog there were mobs called Prairie Wolf. Not once did the macro ever target a prairie wolf, even when every Prairie Dog in the vicinity was dead. I've had the same problem you're having and it was because the name of the mob I was trying to target either wasn't input correctly or I was using a shortened version of the name i.e. "Prairie" instead of "Prairie Dog".
---
This might have been more of a Private server issue maybe idk, but I'm standing in front of a wolf right now and no matter how much I spam my macro it never targets the wolf.
---
I'm pretty sure this is flat out wrong.
---
you wont, but if someone from your faction engages your friend on pvp and you do nothing or help in some way the other faction you can be banned
---
Any prefference in faction lore wise?
---
Jesus, someones mad I said web development has nothing to do with reverse engineering.

Why don’t u roll a tank? In my group we had to argue because 3 of us wanted to be warrior, we let the guy who played warrior in vanilla take the position though. But this group is unreliable so it might not happen anyway

Also wear your gamer badge with pride! I have told people at work about why I'm taking time off even if they never asked lol! 
---
The normies are so shocked...love it!
---
I mean I won’t change my schedule just because of a new video game, but if I did I would keep my 7-8 hours of sleep.
---
I get 4-5 hours routinely already lol this is nothing new
---
You know in all of wow's history Eu&gt;Na apart from a couple if times Death in Texas. So what you on about with your Eu not as good as Na.
---
Which class is better if you plan to only get r10 gear + some pug raids.
---
Hunter or Mage?
---
Hunters start strong (BM pet is as strong with no gear as without) and it seems you mainly want BWL wep on top of r10 gear. Similar for mage. Which would you reccomend?
---
But how am i supposed to buy gold if there are no goldfarmers? Im definetly not gonna farm it myself. You guys can do that boring shit.
---
Biggest reason not to is that it attracts players wanting to avoid layering not roleplayers.
---
Yeah interesting items has no place in new expansions ! Erh?
---
I will defenetly be adding you, be prepared for a lot of stupid question my freind :)
---
Weak hp is a strength for mage? What?
---
I've seen and heard so much part of my brain thinks i played for years back then
---
Just to clarify, quivers won't speed up wands in Classic! It was private server only
---
What do I need to do to avoid this messing up my live/retail addons?
---
Only to die because someone ninjapulls or the tank dies in two swings.
---
I bet Angelina lips up there is as mean a mean girl as there ever has been. Probably why no one likes her. That's why she started getting to suck the souls out of some of the other students. Or made them like her briefly... I'm getting to deep into this, nice meme.
---
Enchanting definitely isn't a must.  
---
The only 'must have' profession if you want optimal PvE progression would be Tailoring for ZG set and/or Robe of the Void early on.
---
You really underestimate how good spriests and warlocks are.
---
Super helpful, thanks!
---
Don’t hurt me
---
They're not doing that on release but there will be copycats for sure on Faerlina
---
This is actually good for you, the first day of launch will, without a doubt be a massive fuckfest and most won't be able to progress very fast. I'm considering not playing the first day (Who am I kidding I'll try either way).
---
Commenting to find later
---
Wait for a new PVP server coming next week for 100%
---
Is it? I mean Vanilla didn't have cross realm battlegrounds. I guess I could be wrong. I just haven't heard anything about it.
---
Wait, what? Did they say there would be no layering on RP realms?
---
Those arenthe perfect days to let blizz figure its shit out. You will not miss much or be behind the pack that far. I say stick with it.
---
Kinda true. Tho there are still good ones after filtering the monotone voice guys and all the "HEY GUYS WHATS GOING ON XXSHADOWSLAYER BACK AGAIN WITH ANOTHER VIDEO"
---
Taking 10 days to kill Ragnaros. :)
---
No more
---
Afaik they were always available in the BMAH. I remember being a few seconds too slow on maxing out the Tiger in WoD.
---
I wasn't going to bother getting a quiver anyway. It's just from the slides in a leveling guide that mentions it
---
I have a question that I'm hoping someone can answer for me. If you are a human rogue and you pop perception does it take you out of stealth?
---
I remember druids being a hard counter to hunters.
---
On the "Not a bug" list, it says the following:
---
* Warrior health Regeneration is working at the expected rate.
---
What does this mean? What is unique about warrior here?
---
HAHAHA, one of us, one of us, one of us, one of us!!!!!
---
Such a relife to hear that the consumabels needed aren't a pain in the ass to get a hold of.
---
Yeah I know that I probably won't get much done and end up going to bed around 1am but I know I'll be itching to play when I'm at work
---
Got about 45 shrines in Botw
---
Yeah true!
---
We'll all try to play on day 1,but let's be honest, it's not gonna be working well... You won't miss anything, well, maybe the pain of being disconnected again and again xD
---
guise check out my ebic cosplay XDDDDD
---
guise look i played guitar!! xdxxdxdx
---
Why would one ever want to be in a server discord?
---
Both great choices. Mages might get a slight edge in raid invites and aoe grinding but hunters can grind non stop. So you should be.fine.either way.
---
I've been doing the opposite. Stopped playing on prv servers and have stayed away from anything Vanilla-related except for a few videos here and there so I'm as fresh as I can get going in.
---
Gold sellers don't actually promote their gold selling from their own account, they hack other accounts and promote it from their accounts
---
Where can I find info about class specs? Are there any websites that are particularly good for this information?
---
Was a great movie!
---
Have you ever seen the true face of god, exile?
---
There should be plenty of people 24/7, so I doubt you need to worry about grouping unless you want to to something that doesn't contribute to leveling.
---
I've tanked most of MC bosses in prebis bear gear on pservers (healers did complain a bit, and I would often spike very low), but since it appears Classic will have easier raids, it might just be the way to go. Just activate a MCP charge at the start of the fight, and everyone can go nuts with dps from the get-go.  
---
Bears also didn't have the Dire Bear Form(370% armor) back when MC came out, only regular Bear Form (120% armor), which is where a lot of the "bears can't tank"-stigma comes from.  
---
It's gonna be interesting to see how the "slightly weaker mobs/bosses" affect the long established builds and unwritten rules of Vanilla.
---
there's no difference population wise between NA or EU. there's more NA servers than EU, but for both regions there has been opened aditional servers, as with the name reservations, many servers already reached max capacity. 
---
Glad i could help!
---
&gt;So Dave decides this isn’t the game for him
---
No, Dave decides to change the realm.
---
Tailoring has bop items that u want to craft. Also i think The lvl rec for 200+ is 35 or 40 so u need to level up ur crafting alt if ur into that
---
It was a really well made movie , was good
---
Doesn’t help that for the past two weeks, the first thing that’s said to me as I walk into work is “Hey, Charlie; ‘X’ more days until your vacation?”
---
Also doesn’t help that when I get home, I open Classic to see how many hours are left. (203 hours at the time of writing this)
---
I’m really starting to lose motivation to do anything not directly related to Classic.... ITS FUCKING BAD, MAN. 
---
But please, don’t send help. Let me just see how far this Rabbit Hole goes.
---
I’m really nervous I expected last week to go slow but it actually went by really fast to me. So now I’m worried this week will be even slower to make up for it.  Maybe I’ll just freeze myself for a week.
---
Travis Fimmel (or at the least Lothar himself) was actually the worst thing in the film.
---
The only character I even slightly enjoyed was Khadgar, I think his portrayal was pretty well done all things considered.
---
How is moving not viable? The game hasn't even launched yet. Nobody has leveled anything so far. Moving is definitely viable right now or even the day prior to launch. As long as everyone knows then I don't see how that's a problem until end of week 1.
---
I am. You're talking out your ass, there's no official "max 3-4 layers" statement.
---
As much as I hate cross-realm BGs, they were introduced in patch 1.12.
---
Why are they using controllers...and playing on the same screen? Reee
---
It's certainly possible to play multiple roles in a dungeon but you will not be as effective and it will depend on the rest of your group as well as your individual skill. You will still get the main spells for all the roles regardless of what talent points you choose, you'll just lack in effectiveness.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Go skinning+tailoring on your main while levelling, once you hit 60 (after getting any skins you absolutely need) you can drop that and level enchanting if you want; you won't have missed out on a significant number of levels just from disenchanting.
---
But but but! They gave us rppvp servers and language servers, and those things weren’t just no brainers that should never have been in question, no they were gods erh I mean activision wait fk I mean blizzards gift to us because they care!! 
---
A reasonable relationship and attitude towards blizz is hard to come by in this day and age when ppl will somehow defend them charging for 2 separate betas xd Was glad to read yours. We should report, and they should do the bloody basics to maintain quality. 
---
We do have some genuine responsibilities as classic wow consumers, which is the same one we have with any product: Be informed, put your money where your mouth is, be vocal against bs game designs and mtx.
---
How good is seal of fate? I guess it is very good but not so many people picking it. Any reason?
---
Iron was also closer to BRM and wetlands/boat.
---
Bad execution of introducing exposition about the world and Garona looks like a human painted green instead of the Half Orc Half Draenei she's supposed to be.
---
It misses a few things like Khadgar's aging curse, the whole thing about Aegwynn and Alodi not matching the lore, and the father-son dynamic with Lothar and his kid was phoned in.
---
Other than that I enjoyed the film as a whole and I hope they continue them.
---
PS it's considered non-canon fyi
---
Duuuude. No. Wtf don’t even think Cursed Thoughts like that. 
---
It’s bad mojo, mon.
---
You still saw the same players all the time on 10k population private servers
---
I don’t want people to know what race I’m picking!
---
Yeah, afraid it is.  I don't think we have a lot of details, but there was a dev interview where that was answered.  It definitely was not part of vanilla, but I'm not sure I feel strongly about the change.
---
Lol trying to grab the specific of a name on the most popular server along with herod is a needle in a haystack  
---
They might not have even heard of reddit
---
Seems to be a ton of servers up for between 2000USD and 5000USD: it's really relative. They hold no value and is basically like buying a wall piece and seem to sell super slow.
---
 Limited Invulnerability is so insanely good for warlocks. It covers up one of the only major weaknesses they have. You can actually pull off some crazy 1vX scenarios vs melee by popping that and casting howl of terror. Gonna be stocking up on those for sure.
---
1.12 did, not all of vanilla, but it was introduced in 1.12, and is confirmed in classic I believe.
---
Hmm, Frostadamus, Huzzah, Classicwinds?
---
But why not?  If everyone has access to it, it's not imbalanced.
---
In the name of the king, the war chief and the spirit healer speed to you all brothers and sisters, our time is nigh stand strong together and remember, We thought we did, AND WE DO
---
Yeah, I've looked in to the different professions aswell, although it's super confusing and a lot to take in herb + alch seems to be the way I'll go. I'd love to take on skinning aswell because it seems to be such an easy way to get gold but if I've understood it correctly i can only choose two.. :(
---
Why not just wait til release to make your character and just pick the lowest pop one? Seems easier than all this guesswork. Or wait it out a day or two extra so most people settle in
---
That's just something anime does, it uses a variety of animation techniques to cut back on costs which gives it a distinguished style.
---
Here's a good example I found where even though it looks like there's a decent amount going on on screen, your animatiors don't have to work that much because a lot of it is just still images: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-2jFVVm_MU
---
Without any further adue, let‘s explore.
---
Love the guy!
---
Thanks, ofc... Didnt think of that :)
---
Because " befenits the guild best " can be whatever you want. If you want to distribute your items based on RP reasons you can do that. Do you want to distribute based on attendance, you can do that. Just roll on certain items? easy.
---
DKP and Lootcouncil face the same problems. If people dont like the system or the implementaion then they will quit.
---
No worries! =)
---
Are there tools out there to determine which piece of gear might be better when comparing different stats, crit, hit, etc all into a single number?
---
uuh I don't get what you're saying?
---
Thanks for support, i like that idea ✌️
---
Yeah, idk, my days go by pretty fast. I've found ways to fill them up with various activities, gotta live my life before I lose it completely I guess.
---
Seems like every discord to do with a realm is cancer. Why does discord attract people like that? Joined my realm's server and someone spammed pictures of a guy molesting a chicken.
---
no it would just be gank on gank, if the enemy has higher numbers there is no point to engage as you would have to start from scratch, most people would not want to play on such a server and it would be a dead server.
---
Sadly, these kinds of rivalries are unlikely in classic due to x-realm bg's.
---
What's the best and fair system for someone semi casual like you and me? I just want to play the game, roll the loots if it's my BiS.
---
???
---
I thought it uses the vanilla wow logo anyhow.
---
30 PvP servers without layering. With layering, 5-6.
---
30 PvP servers with layering? No way lmao, unless Fortnite kids invade:)
---
The survey shows that both have PvE servers have a slight overweight on Alliance (Pyre 63% and Mirage 58%) so you are good either way. I'm not sure why you would want to be on the server with more alliance anyway since uneven faction balance just causes issues.
---
*Arrr, Me Hearties! I be havin' some extra Treasure that i be givin' away at the Gurubashi Arena! All ye need to do is collect it is open the chest I leave on the arena floor!*
---
For sure. Sorry for the spreading the wrong info. I played Vanilla into WotLK and thought it was a BC thing.
---
Hmmm console pesents I guess yell a lot.
---
All realms will have queue. It's a choice between a 10 hrs queue on biggest realms or 1 hr queue on smaller ones.
---
But yes, many people will absolutely reroll at launch. They will choose the path of least resistance : lesser queues.
---
Or reroll Aussie.
---
ya, i mean that to. Ideally they get banned, but I just don't want gold farmers existance to make people feel that selling gold on blizzards end is justified
---
I don't have much warrior experience so I'm not gonna try there, but I did play druid exclusively in vanilla and I can't praise the class enough.  First, yes, okay, you're not the best at anything.  In PVE, there's always someone who can put you to shame with whatever you happen to be doing at any given moment.  But with whatever misguided suboptimal feral build I had fumbled into, I was able to passably fill any role through my entire leveling process.  It wasn't until RFK that I started carrying a separate set of caster gear for dungeon healing.  That sort of flexibility is really valuable in a vanilla setting.  
---
And PVP, holy shit.  Nothing is more fun than pre-cata druid PVP.  Stealth, self heals, stuns, escapes, roots, battle res...  It's a good time.
---
How about  [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=26023/pursuit-of-justice](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=26023/pursuit-of-justice)? Does this stack with carrot on a stick and spurs?
---
&gt; Then nothing in the entire levelling experience is challenging for, or provides any upgrades for, anyone who has even raided MC. It would have been ezmode BFA-style levelling except without even having any loot upgrades to keep you interested.
---
Min/Max players who are in top raiding guilds are not taking their time to level... You are conflating two different types of players. The players who enjoy leveling and take their time will do so. Those who rush to max level aren't looking for a challenge during the leveling process, and those types of players upgrade their gear quickly anyway.
---
If you have a player in the middle, not being all the way hardcore and yet not casual, maybe they will want to do a little OUtland to catch up and then clear the stuff in Azeroth they haven't done yet, and repeating back and forth as they see fit. This type of progression allows players to not only keep the progress they've made, but it allows players to choose their own paths. TBC was the beginning of the "Theme park" concept of MMOs, because it was the first update to direct all players to a certain zone and obsolete the content from the old zones. This horrible concept, which started in TBC, is why we have 14 years of obsolete content in the game, and all the players packed into one zone to get their participation trophies.
---
Regardless, this is not final game design, this is one example. You keep moving the goalposts every time you wrongly say "X is impossible" and I give you a clear and simple example.
---
&gt;You realise this is WoW, a game which is mostly about improving the things in your eighteen equipment slots? The things which you cannot make drops for which are an upgrade to Dude #1 and Dude #2? The things which are the core upgrade mechanics apart from levels throughout the entire game?
---
Yes, and people will upgrade their equipment. Player #1 will rush to max and begin raiding in Outland. Player #2 will get better through catch up content and then get the gear from Vanilla dungeons and raids. ALL PLAYERS are upgrading their gear. The casual players can finally earn that cool tier-2 set that they never had the time to work for in stead of it being trash. That player in full-Naxx can start to piece together their next set in the new raid instead of throwing their epic items in the trash because a *lvl 61 boar dropped something better than* RAGNAROS did. This is not complicated. You are thinking too linearly and stuck in the mindset of once the xpac comes out you leave the old world behind. Both players can upgrade gear as soon as the xpac comes out, either through old raids/dungeons or the new ones.
---
&gt;Thank God Blizzard didn't have someone like you running the show when TBC was developed. Instead of the entire player base enjoying challenging, fun, appropriately challenging content together with the vertical power differentiation cut down to a manageable size, we'd have had 99% of the player base stuck forever playing the same (relatively bad) vanilla content forever or more likely just unsubscribing, and 1% of the population ever seeing Karazhan let alone Serpentshrine.
---
I think you'd enjoy BFA then, because vertical cut-downs are very common there, and everyone can play all of the content. You also won't have to worry about the bad Vanilla content. Thankfully, next week I will be playing a game that doesn't do vertical cut-downs and doesn't hand out participation gear for buying expansions and killing trash while leveling.
---
Yeah, blizzard is in such rough shape thet had to resurrect the God of classic.
---
ya that part sucks, that people who engage in doing stuff illegally get fucked, I still would rather have it that way. And just trying to minimize the issue itself
---
Yeah, it's like an assist.
---
The only thing that I can forsee really coming along that would give me any modicum of hype is going to be World of Diablo, and it's highly unlikely I'll ever get this.
---
I didn't take any from the stress test so I included the videos from which I grabbed them.  All of them with the exception of a couple will be found in the 2 videos I credited at the bottom of the post if you'd like to see the specific functionality of them.
---
For example, Leatrix Plus found the in 2nd video I was not aware of til I came across the video and does a number of things I listed like the faster autoloot, autoselljunk, etc
---
The Frostadamus video will show you how the UI mod looks but if you don't care for it you can disable it, largely the important things in the folder which is why I uploaded for my buddies is all the leveling helper stuff
---
Some people will be in queue until you get home at 4pm so don't be sad...
---
edited post to show time timezone
---
sorry man it was objectively dogshit
---
Check out https://github.com/max-ri/Guidelime as well, make it even easier
---
What is the twitch app and what does it do or why would i need it?
---
Your job is **NOT** making sure everyone is full HP
---
Your job **IS** maximizing group damage while making sure no one is dying.
---
Looking at the impending queues, I think Twitch will blow over 1 million views with ease.
---
Why would you encourage gold selling
---
Thanks!
---
Tbh as long as the dog is potty trained, it doesn't take that much time to care for it. If you're gonna be playing classic full time during release, it's a great reason to go outside and take a walk every few hours, or just stand up and play with the dog for a bit! The thing you gotta think about is that the dog will most likely be part of your life for the next 7-10+ years and that is a pretty big decision.
---
I had it wrong too, I thought battlegroups weren't introduced until BC.
---
They do if they're well written...
---
great, you're saying my queue will be even longer....
---
Hmmm maybe it was WoD then that they released it, because i know they weren't in MoP.
---
My mistake.
---
Yes. The color of the item. Purple &gt; blue. Always.
---
Just realized It’s been 3 years since this released. Time flies by, Yee he kills it!
---
Professions, Or get really good and sell heals to dungeons. 
---
Make sure you take conc thrown on your best stam gear and run aoe down the SM dungeons, Can even sell leveling boosts for it once you comftable. Makes more money if you have enchanting.
---
The effects usually spread outwards from the people who are directly involved in "doing stuff illegally".
---
&gt; DMs and 3rd party advertising.
---
To be fair, there was a time where gold sellers had their banners on the official WoW website and forums. It was pretty funny when Blizz realized.
---
A lot of the PvE meme specs were actually quite good in PvP.
---
gz
---
It really comes down to what kind of player you are. Looking at your comments about CS-Go, my guess is that you are the "min-max" type of player (meaning you optimize a lot).  
---
So the first thing you should research is what class you want, and what race you should choose for that class. Some races are naturally better at PvP (Orc, Dwarf, Undead), while others excel more at PvE (Human, Troll). To reach max level as a newer player will probably take more than 10 days played (+240 hours), so realizing by that point that you picked a "bad" class-race combination can be pretty devastating.  
---
I would advice you to get a questing addon, but other than that, I don't feel like any addons are a requirement while leveling up as a new player.
---
what does that mean
---
They definitely do.
---
Classic wow and Halo Reach coming out the same year. For me this is the best year of gaming in a long while.
---
Even if you dont see that kind of shit in the in-game chat, its horrifying to know these are the people you play with everyday
---
Your Discord account could get nuked if you're associated with illegal content on another server. The basis of that association is variable.
---
Well I guess most of the players reserved a name on each PVP server so of course they all look full
---
This is the worst attitude to have and the very reason the retail community is awful.
---
Dwarf Priest Min Max Cringe
---
Will you be an EU Gold Farmer? Speaking in broken-ass Chinese, and running away from your own faction as they get ganked?
---
Can mages aoe farm without going deep frost?
---
Yep, I know, I roll a 30/0/21 shammy.
---
But the whole not getting into raids = not getting gear for that spec = not being able to PvP in it kept a lot of the meme specs off the table on pservers.
---
You won’t see that in classic. Pug Bgs will have all gear levels, all specs in classic, like it was in vanilla vs the tricked out players on pservers playing optimal specs we see today.
---
Pvp gear is a few months out,  but that's a good thing because you can relax and work on pre raid gear without worrying about ranking. Ranking on average is what breaks people's spirits to play the game.
---
Hahahahahaha i love to see dumb posts like this :D hooe u never play, enjoy trolling yourself and making me lol &lt;3
---
Stolen credit card gets used for something else, the fraud is detected but the money is gone. Some insurance company or the credit card company has to compensate the person who got fooled and the money comes out of the pockets of the other credit card customers.
---
Hijacked accounts are as advertisement accounts for gold buying sites (as the accounts get banned by Blizzard at some point, they need new ones and free = good).
---
&gt; First time player here, hoping the rest of the community in game ain't like this. 
---
They're not. What you are seeing is a tiny amount of the playerbase basically interacting outside of the games sphere itself. 99% of the actual players wont even think about signing into a server discord, so when it comes to playing on live you will meet a different group of players, with different goals in mind.
---
go resto at 60, at level 50+ start gathering some healing gear for each slot. when you switch you'll have a few greens and blues, start farming dungeons. There is no GS, no one is gonna wanna inspect you before you start a 5 man so you'll be good to go. Have a look for a few key quests you could complete on your way to 60 to get some healing gear.
---
He's right with the 2nd one tho
---
Ok, thanks for the advice, will do :)
---
Well since you've made such a convincing argument....
---
Yes. That's all I got.
---
Old news
---
I rather watch Asmon if I am in a queue than play retail.
---
There's really nothing to worry about Mary. Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. You know, like on a head-on crash or flying off a cliff or getting trapped under a gas truck! That's the worst! I have this cousin, well y'know, I had this cousin...
---
It worries me deeply that so many people want to change classic... Really hope there's some sort of system in place to prevent new players from having a say in changes to classic.. 
---
If you don't play on an account that was registered in Vanilla, you shouldn't be allowed an opinion.
---
Yea, you're gonna be best off looking for a guild with a Kiwi-core if you're staying on OCE. Even if you're in WA you should know how lazy we are in general (not to mention that sort of time competes with children's extra curricular activities on weekends, not withstanding anyone doing that on a weekday.
---
I'm sorry. Talking more about pvp
---
I plan on doing an extreme marathon for like a week and then go back to playing 2-6 hours a day depending on schedule for the next weeks until life forces me to only play 1-2hrs a day. I kinda feel old to play wow hardcore again, but I hope I'm not the only one whos gonna do it anyway
---
Imagine bootlicking this hard.
---
Did someone say Ret Paladin in raids?
---
This is, kinda terrifying. How many people need a rotation guide and what quests to do from 1-10?
---
Get your girlfriend to do your studies and work for you. Problem solved.
---
you know crossrealm bg's started in classic, right? it's the only thing thats crossrealm
---
Just figure out basic stat weights and do it yourself.
---
Just remembering it's still just a game, and there are plenty of more important things to get on with in life..   
---
I'll enjoy it when it comes..
---
You think the majority subbed only to reserve a name on a handfull if realms? Guess common sense is lost on ya.
---
Bad idea
---
DOOM is pretty cool. Can't wait for that to drop. They took a step back to the old feel and it is amazing. You should look forward to DOOM Eternal!
---
I also attempted to unlock flying but it's too tedious and I stopped with that. Then I made a human warlock to mess around with a bit and an undead priest...just wishing it was classic already!
---
Go to the servers Discords and look there
---
I booked the day after launch too, just to avoid the major server issues that normally happens at launch. It will be fine unless you are trying to speed level.
---
Except it's not though because we've been cleaning it up for a week and now its just copypasta.
---
Ape spread that there was CP in the other one so that his could grow and promote RWT because I said no.
---
Oh. From what I’ve gathered preparing to go Rogue for Classic: Seal Fate doesn’t start to excel until AQ levels of gear. Something to do with Crit % being 30% or higher.
---
it's a priest leveling slideshow. it just happened to be on that slide. yes I know how to use spells.
---
I dont even know who apes are :/
---
I'll probably make a human actually because I don't like dwarves
---
Take your filthy upvote and get out
---
About the same as every other class in this game.
---
Wife, job, house, etc., get ready to say goodbuy to all of them.
---
We don’t know if classic will be a success yet what happens if 80% of the player base quits even before reaching 60 when the hype dies he will be proven right then
---
Whitemane and Faerlina will also have queues in excess of 10k. Stalagg probably also. Same for all PvP EU realms.
---
The launch queues, if no more realms are added, will be atrocious on ALL realms.
---
I think you get experience from BG's. Not sure but I think eventually you'll find 60 😅
---
OP is going ally rogue.
---
A quest addon will (in my opinion) take away from the adventure. Look up quests (classic.wowhead.com for example) only when you get stuck.
---
No my lvl Partner and I are going in at midnight and play till 8, take a nap and continue.
---
I haven't really been checking, but it makes sense of course. It's just that growing up frustration and not having everything figured out by now, is what kind of frustrates me.  Good to know anyhow, thanks! :)

Thanks josh!

The other half also has the week of classic booked off. She is on full time puppy care. While I get the advantage of breaks to train and walk him!
---
Luckily he is 10 weeks old and already potty trained!
---
I'm just going to assume that you've never tried to queue as Horde in Retail in the last 15 years. Because that is literally how long they've had longer queue times for.

Luka along with a guy whose name I forgot had control over one (or several?) of the classic community discords, and used it to advertise a give-away tied to their website (that deals in certain WoW-related services, but according to them for in-game gold only). People got mad, word got out that the guy Luka was running with had openly stated to be okay with real money transactions and owned other sites as well as tried to "get together" with another site.
---
Luka, someone from Pink Panda (a boosting guild whose owner just happens to share identical name with a website that sells boosts for real money saying that "he can't help someone took his name for themselves") and some other boosting-community folks started doubling down hardcore on defending Luka and that other fellow.
---
The problem isn't necessarily their advertisement, but the shady shit and the fact that none of them could really make a proper argument and handled it like panicked children.

The only reason why alliance queues would pop more often (with a 50/50 split) is if the alliance side are less inclined to queue for BGs.
---
So; if you assume that horde are generally more active in BG PvP, the alliance would have shorter queues.
---
Solid name.

thats just part of the classic experience :D
---
That and ganking the china farmers on pvp realms
---
Now that's a totally valid point, and I'm just as blind as you are on this sort of minutiae to be honest.  Do a search for "stat weights" for your class and spec.  Usually you can find a resource that will give you something like 1STR=2AP and HIT&gt;STR&gt;CRIT&gt;STAM etc.  From there you go further by checking out "hit cap" (it's different for casters, melee, dual wield, and weapon skill racials can factor in) and soft caps for stuff like crit or defense.  
---
To keep it as simple as possible, find out your stat weights and hit cap and just pick up the rest when you start getting curious.

I agree with you 100%.
---
Real good games are those that are hard. Those in which you have to make an effort to obtain rewards (just like in real life).
---
When did Wow pop exploted, and went into the hall of fame? During classic and TBC (and maybe TLK). When an epic was an epic. Then all went down... until today. Waiting for classic in a few days. How is possible that companies don't see this fact? Good games (and money) comes with effort, with hard worked rewards, with impossible objectives, that keep you fighting.

That's a great advice! I've been more like: "It finds the valuable shinies or it get's the hose again."
---
Why are there so few servers, and, which one is the best to play on?
---
I guess so, but not loads.
---
Crazy how he rallied so much at the end and DC looked bit gassed and wouldn't keep his hands up. Stipe found the weak spot like Nintendo Mike Tyson Punch Out and that was it.
---
Yep! Classes end the 24th.
---
I've been using Dartols rod of transformation since vanilla for the furbolg form when healing.
---
I’ve asked this question before and this is generally the response I get. Also people say most of the honor in BGs comes from winning
---
For those that haven't realized it yet - Shaman is BY FAR the most popular class. Every shared class can be treated as the total/2 to separate between both alliances. However, since Shaman and Paladin can't be divided, it means that for the Horde side, there will be FAR more Shaman than any other class.
---
Madseason is prime sleeping material, his voice is super calming
---
If the tank knows his way through the dungeon the rest of the group is pretty much good to go.
---
You don't need to make an ass out of yourself. Ignore the posts you don't like, maybe hide/block the OP and move on.
---
I plan to slowburn it from 15 to 22 every day on normal weekdays. Cant play on weekends because wife tho.
---
Can we assume that in Classic? From what I've heard, Alliance were dominant in  PvP on 1.12 private servers, and many of the top streamers are Alliance. What you said makes sense, but I really hope it's more even.
---
hahah man I pay good money, THEY do their job and I'll keep paying. They aren't "giving" anything they're simply seeing its an easy viable product and making it.
---
They are a company, not a dang charity man, they get as much as they put in.
---
yeah but that's been super annoying in beta tbh -- mostly because a lot of addons are broken and require updates to fix all the lua errors
---
Classic is a circle of life.  18 months from now a fresh start will be released and we will rejoice.
---
That jacked dwarf means business. G'damn!
---
Was nice if you server died then you could just swap as needed. $25 for account I think originally then only 1 character. Cant remember exactly. Been 12 years lol
---
Ahh these are good dreams
---
I mean, yea, pretty much. As opposed to your definition where if you're doing literally ANYTHING, you can't be gimping yourself.
---
Well thank you sir!
---
I'll add the ally version later today. It's only a pair of items you have to change.
---
or put enchanting on ALT to just DE items :D
---
So... how cross-realm bg is working? All eu servers players like pvp/pve/rp playing togheter?  
---
And how work any langauge server group with cross realm? example french-deutsch-russian-english servers to be join on total cross realm bg?
---
I know the feeling, I've leveled a couple of characters as well, but the end game is so tedious and timegated, I can't bring myself to log in every day and do the dailies.
---
My point is purely to show my perspective. And I would call us a casual guild in that we're likely to have some 10 tryhard people and over hundred people that come and go (as raid schedule is concerned).
---
When 3% was the difference in running away or catching someone.
---
&gt;Also you need a very specific rotation to stay mana efficient as a priest actually.
---
Yeah, dot and wand.
---
if blizzard were to open 20 servers before launch, and everyone would scatter all over those servers, resulting in several low populated servers at launch, then it would be a harder task for them to combine several servers and make it into one, than it would be for them to open a new server if all the others appear to be full. don't sweat it, they will fix this. also, best server to play on is something youll have to decide for yourself mostly. there's pvp, pve, and rp pvp. decide which kind of server you'll want to play, and then choose between that kind. also, be wary of picking your server if you're playing NA servers, due to streamers (some see this as a bad thing.)
---
Those are the choices you made, want a tissue?
---
Another PSA for hunters.. Growl can be turned off
---
If we assume a sizeable influx of... casual players, many of whom will not play alliance for their PvP racials, it will be quite different from p-servers.
---
P-servers had players that went through all that trouble to play a 12 year old game. The people who play Classic will not be the same, overall.
---
Also, premades are another thing entirely.
---
If not, it's on Steam. You can use windowed mode and tab between the two.
---
It was actually Amazon who bought twitch and Curse, and merged some of their features.  
---
Curse LLC is now sold to Wikia.
---
I thought about dungeon Bop's:)
---
Ah thanks. Well i dont play on pvp server so it doesnt bother me

Herbalism engineering is the best combo end game. Herbalism for mats for consumes but it's also a good money maker which can fund engineering.
---
Yes. \^
---
I'm a lock, I dont need money. And I don't plan on rushing my epic mount as they wont use the old models anyways.
---
I agree, low effort indeed!
---
you realize that missing a day won't actually kill you, might be better as the serves will be really full of people and that will slow questing down
---
without being elitist, if you are not level 60 already by the end of phase 1 you are a casual and should probably go on a PvE realm.
---
even if you somehow don't reach 60 or maybe you're playing an alt, from 52 to 60 you can simply grind dungeons for xp and get your pre-raid gear in the process. my point is that if you get caught in the gank-fest that phase 2 will be it is absolutely your own fault and your own choice

Does anyone know which English speaking EU PvE server is more populated?
---
Yup I’ve been doing this regularly for the past few months. 
---
Most of the same info repeated but it’s keeping me hyped and eager to play. 
---
Side benefit is I’ve settled on my starting class and professions for launch.
---
id take the committed guild
---
rl friends are flaky and will fly for the next game
---
Aspect of the Dazed.
---
I only like some studio Ghibli films.
---
Amateurs. On eu ive booked the whole week off, although it launches here monday 26th at 11 so Im tempted to go in that day and take the following Monday
---
&gt; So long as layering is enabled, capacity isn't a problem.
---
-
---
&gt; You haven't disproven me, so it's you who is wrong.
---
That's not how things work. You made the initial claim, so it's on you to prove your claim. I mean, that's basic knowledge... not that I'd expect someone like you to care about that, lmfao.
---
When proved wrong or sensibly argued against, you go on to change to story and come up with a new point.  That point is completely irrelevant to the actual discussion by the way, seeing as how it *should* be (according to your brick of a brain) has nothing to do with how it actually is.
---
Then you just insult people. Classy.
---
It's time for your nap. Go get mommy to tuck you in.
---
Finland is not part of the scandinavia tho, nor were they vikings. (Referring to nightwish and children of bodom)
---
I've been playing since Taurean didn't have mounts, so that would warrant me to have a say, but I'm on the same boat as you, I wouldn't change a thing. As mentioned in the post, and a previous comment, it's purely for fun and I'd be at the front of the rage train if they changed anything at all. I don't want change, nor would I agree with anyone wanting change, it's just a bit of hypothetical fun.
---
Nobody knows and anyone who claims they do is basing the information from incomplete polls which are subject to bias.
---
Name still matters quite a bit for people, for a lot of individuals using special characters still doesn’t feel the same. It establishes a sense of identity

This is all without talents. This means Leather in general is even stronger for 0/30/21 thanks to HotW. In general going leather is a sidegrade, except in phase 5 where it's actually a downgrade.
---
Still dont get the need for realm discords lol
---
Why cant u be 3 warriors lol
---
They seem to be pretty even, both on population &amp; balance.
---
Wish they kept updating them each time they added new races
---
Anti token folks would rather it be no one at all.
---
All Blizzard needs to do is police the servers and perma-ban both sellers and buyers when found out.
---
I keep reminding myself that Activision owns Blizzard and then some of the hype dies cause you know they'll inevitably ruin the game.

---
what did he say that was racist?
---
he didnt smear the race or the nation?
---
&gt; the smart thing and roll out 1-2 new servers the day before launch
---
smart thing is rolling out servers in time for people to decide to move, not scrambling to do it.
---
Hmmmm holding people accountable obviously makes you an asshole elitist.
---
Playing on a PvE realm in classic is pretty much ruining half the fun, for me at least
---
Greetings,
---
Id love if someone can point me out to some addons and help me with some questions.
---
* Is there an official link to Elvui? Will it has all the faction it currently has on retail?
---
* Im looking for an addon i saw in some videos with mob drops.
---
* Also looking for a good addon for Auction house and selling items on vendors with prices!
---
Thank you :)
---
GROBB MOB
---
I got 28-1st off as well, assuming that the 27th would just be a shit show of dcs etc
---
But now I'm trying tk swap a shift to get 27th off as well haha
---
True, but we want a more effective looting when we are in dungeons... If we have 3 warriors and 1 paladin they will all fight over mail/plate
---
What server was it on?
---
they are basing it off, stress test users and renewed subs...also probably off the number of names on the petition to make classic in the firstplace, now they have name reservations and are adding servers if/when needed.
---
BUT this won't cover what will be happening on launch or even a few weeks into launch (when twitch blows up with WoW and all the news articles that will pop up)
---
I wish you both fortune in the wars to come
---
It's going to go too fast for me. I got stuff to do before launch. Other games that need some grinding and so on.
---
Lol no
---
Being a Hunter does reduce the risk somewhat, since unsold ammunition is useful to my character as well. I'll try selling and see how it goes :)
---
&gt;Also you need a very specific rotation to stay mana efficient 
---
no you dont :) have levelled three, its dot, pws self and wand it down, rinse wash repeat
---
Where can I find reliable macros for Hunters that will work with classic?
---
To be fair, you don't have to learn any "rotation" for most  classic classes. Except for using lower level ranks of those spells for mana regeneration.
---
They don't even come close to facing the same problems.   
---
And yeah people will quit if they don't like it, some won't. That's not a problem, that's a solution.
---
wowhead
---
Sounds no different from the retail experience to me, that’s gonna be a no from me dawg
---
The last blue post said that it is not a technical limit and that they just want to make sure that once layering is removed that there aren't super massive queues. Layering isn't staying past phase 1 no matter what.
---
Yep, pretty much this.  
---
I clicked on Shazzrah but it sent me to some other PvE realm first.
---
&gt; Min/Max players who are in top raiding guilds are not taking their time to level...
---
I never said anything about that. You jump around from weird accusation to weird accusation to avoid any real discussion.
---
&gt; TBC was the beginning of the "Theme park" concept of MMOs, because it was the first update to direct all players to a certain zone and obsolete the content from the old zones.
---
It's a necessary evil, dude, otherwise you'd end up with the player base scattered so thinly the game would no longer work. Vanilla had nearly broken down this way in 2006, it just wasn't realistically possible for new players to experience AQ40/Naxx. The population had to be squished then and it had to be squished then. The idea that you could have stretched them population out even further and still had a viable game for even one xpac is silly, let alone seven more xpacs.
---
&gt; Regardless, this is not final game design, this is one example.
---
In the end there's no point talking to you about this because you are in love with this totally imaginary (and impossible) game you have made up, you refuse to address the most basic and obvious flaws, and when you're cornered you can just say "lol this isn't my final plan no criticism applies".
---
&gt; That player in full-Naxx can start to piece together their next set in the new raid instead of throwing their epic items in the trash because a lvl 61 boar dropped something better than RAGNAROS did.
---
Yeah, found the guy who knows nothing about TBC. You are repeating a stupid rumour you heard that has grown in the telling. I ditched my last piece of MC gear when I was 63 or 64, which is pretty far in considering that MC was only the entry level raid.
---
And guess what? You said "that player in full-Naxx can start to piece together their next set in the new raid". That is exactly how it actually fucking worked. The upgrades from Naxx were in Karazhan/Gruul/Magtheridon.
---
It's no wonder you are spouting all this ignorant twaddle about how TBC was a theme park and ruined the game, you don't know anything about it except stupid things you heard third hand on the internet.
---
&gt; I think you'd enjoy BFA then, because vertical cut-downs are very common there, and everyone can play all of the content. 
---
Here we go with the pathetic attempts at gatekeeping. I played real vanilla, kid. I also played real TBC and WotLK. I quit in Cata without getting to the level cap because it wasn't doing it for me any more.
---
Imagine waking up and thinking "I know, I'll go the subreddit that is solely for people who want to play Classic and I'll act like wanting to play Classic makes me special!".
---
We knew
---
Math?
---
Did someone already mention nefarian? :D
---
Not really, the world is plenty dangerous and immersive without people camping you for whole days at a time. 
---
Also who has time to get camped for a whole play session. And who thinks that's fun?
---
torn between priest or rogue can anyone convince me which one to choose?
---
I’m a man of culture, I only corpse camp if someone was doing it to myself or a stumble across someone doing it to someone else.  There must be balance to this world.
---
My wife isnt a gamer and gaming is a non issue. She respects my hobbies and I hers. I think I said the first day we met that Im a gamer will that be a problem. honesty from day1 rather than waiting 6 months to unveil the gaming rig.

---
Back in Vanilla the Quakenet #wow.fi channel had over 1500 Finnish people in it. It was very much a common place. Most guilds had IRC channels.
---
Loot Council sounds like fun dealing with over 100 people that will come and go!
---
I doubt there will be server problems, blizzard has gotten pretty good at launch days. It will be crowded though.
---
Getting all achievements on Underlords. Feel the same way about this game as I did about Hearthstone when it first came out.
---
Im rolling pyrewood. Dont know any numbers.
---
At least you made the great decision to roll pve, the true classic experience
---
If it is very popular then its possible.
---
A ton of players have made posts about people basically making bots to try and snatch names.
---
Yeah, and you need to actually be aware of how mana efficiency and mana regen works to know how to do that properly. which isn't something you would guess without having read guides about it.
---
So tired of this smug elitism in wow players. Yes I watched a priest leveling guide on Youtube, does that make me subhuman to you? If you judge people based on that you have a problem.
---
I agree. It is common sense. Out of the friends I have that will be playing, only 20% have reserved for a name. I imagine many people are still yet to sub and there will indeed be a huge influx.
---
My life quite literally feels like the Eric Cartman meme when he’s waiting for the Nintendo Wii. Holy shit this week is gonna be dreadful lmao
---
You're right, I had forgotten about select mounts being added to BMAH. 
---
In regards to services selling very rare mounts, how does that work? What prevents someone from swooping in and just killing the rare?
---
Buncha euro neets living on welfare
---
If you’re leveling on a pvp server and expect to get into a lot of fights, I’d suggest just getting a 1.2 attack speed speed, those are plentiful and easy to find.
---
shame they deleted that, am also looking for a early morning guild anything after 3am or so AEST up to around 10am AEST start. Gotta be alliance on arugal tho.
---
Do you think a retail pvper will dominate apes? 
---
I suggest you look them up. The clear all raids have great gear and can tank the likes of venruki etc so they are very skilled.
---
They also have a legion of people for raids on top of using all consumables for PvP.
---
Good fucking luck if you reckon Joe retail bloggs is going to be beating apes.
---
Invest in Taco Bell, door dash, and toilet paper stocks too
---
Easily overlooked cause why would you need one in retail?
---
I'm just gonna... play the fuckin game 😂. Don't need all this BS
---
That sounds hilarious actually
---
And 3 of them can't say no.
---
When the p-servers were at their peak hordes used to camp Dire Maul and BRM entrances just because their BG queues were too long. They have better racials and from my experience they have in almost all expansions (Wotlk is the exception) been the most prevalent faction in PvP.
---
So how do you stop warlocks from stealing away all the competed caster gear if it's easy?
---
Absolutely Mad Mage Bros
---
Weird I though it was the racism and bigotry...
---
Same boat. Just wanna go in as I would brand new to the game. No research, no second and third monitor covered in min/maxing strats and routes and split timers for per level speeds.
---
I just thought it would be crazy unlikely that this would happen, so I guess in the future I'll get my friends to do this.
---
&gt; scale that it does now.
---
The game is not out yet
---
I raided Warlock since MC and don't really understand what people are talking about. It is highly unlikely that you won't fight any mobs between two raids. Perhaps the people complaining about shard farming are super forgetful and only remember to get shards just before the raids... If anything the space the shards take is more annoying.
---
I swear I'll turn this car around right now
---
YO THIS POST DOESNT MAKE SENSE
---
Was planing on playing human paladin, got room for one?
---
Yeah I might be misremembering then for alliance. Either way 1.2 or 1.3 is good enough and you won’t have to go out of your way to find that marginal increase in attack speed. 
---
If you’re min maxing you obviously should go for bt but otherwise it doesn’t really matter.
---
Idk man.. if you struggle to read out Gehennas idk what to say. Its more easily structured than most others
---
I've done it for 2 months straight. Fastened my tablet above the head and watching videos until I get sleepy. I've run out of things of interest to watch.
---
Still the funnies thing about the "you think you do, but you don't" is the freaking WoD in the background
---
Well with the purchase of in game gold through real currency if he just happens to have a good job and can afford all these items from the BMAH.
---
I’m not defending him but since blizzard implemented the method to purchase gold then it’s difficult to determine where he got these items from.
---
Could just be a rich bastard 😂
---
Alright thanks for testing it. I have a memory of using a /target [exact] macro but that may have been from some mod I used in the past.
---
The only thing Blizzard have said is that it really depends on the popularity of Classic.
---
Imagine thinking open world content with no actual threats is fun lmfao holy fuck
---
Looks awesome man. Definitely saved for later. Thanks for your hard work!
---
You'll be surprised. I know a plethora of Swedish, Greek and Turkish people, personally or through reddit posts, who gold farmed during their student/college years.
---
I played on a low pop server during vanilla and there were still queues on major patch days, the most obvious thing will there was only 4-5 'top' guilds on each faction instead of the 30+ you'd see on the full realms.
---
A key point being "Stay away from REALM DISCORDS"
---
Discord itself is great.
---
I mean guild name is different. Its directly in the gameplay and you create it, build it and represent it.
---
The server name is just a name on which you click to find your characters.
---
nooo go Horde this time! It will feel like a fresh new game
---
Apart from it's not, we had 1 night where someone spammed us with Loli and porn and we've cleaned it up considerably, it's now 100% SFW.
---
Don't judge us over something that happened a while ago, now it's just a shitposting discord..
---
You're actually fucking bluepilled if you think a RWT discord is better than being in a shitposting one.
---
Thanks for the video, Mr. Trump.
---
I live my life a quarter mile at a time. 
---
Nothing else matters
---
If it’s worth it to you, it’s worth it. You’re talking attacking one more time per 13 seconds though, so almost negligible unless you’re really into min-max.
---
Post is about apes so its not literal you fucking mong
---
Probably Desolace, or Swamp of Sorrows (I mean we're talking over a decade ago).
---
In the Classic patch pick-pocketing will be a good way to get Rogue reagents (instead of buying from vendor) so we're all just going to have /cast pickpocket /cast &lt;opener&gt; as macros anyway, which should make leveling lock-pick a little easier.
---
Wait this isnt Tidal Charm.
---
Cats have a 10% increased damage family bonus so you kill 10% faster nevermind attackspeed. The question as as relevant as possible since you should be leveling as BM, therefore pet choice is extremely important.
---
You aren’t even locked in POE wtf bud
---
The site was actually turned into a massive paywall before you can watch anything, not the same warcraftmovies it used to be

Doing one-off Dungeons won't be "optimal" if you want to speed level. I think you can treat yourself to a Dungeon while leveling, there is no prize for leveling quickly to 60 and you'll have plenty of time to get tired of the level 60 dungeons! ;)
---
I mean, it's pretty shitty that they used the realm discords for Real World Trading and goldselling but at least it's not toxic like the 15k one
---
Ditto brother, but for Alliance!
---
true but that's what makes it so exciting! it will feel like a fresh new experience. 
---
plus Thunder Bluff layout is amazing
---
I want to make a Troll Hunter and level really fast, but i want to also learn skinning so i can skin along for easier money + hitting 300 skinning when i come to un goro  because i want to get ahead of the devil saur mafia. The Question is, when is the best moment to learn skinning? There is one ocassion i'm very close to OG i guess ( When picking up the Harpy Quest from the Goblin) or is it better to pick it later? I guess sooner or later i will arrive in OG but that will be right before i change to barrens and there i can't skin with 0 or can i?
---
It could be a bot that is set up to steal names.
---
Lmao REKT!!!
---
Not a classic question really... but I just downloaded all the blizzard shit again. I said fuck it might as well download BFA while I’m at it and play some of my long lost toons.
---
I logged into BFA and tried to play my enhance shaman. It doesn’t even feel like the class I used to play and at all. Sure some abilities are named the same but I hit like a napkin and im using rockbiter to gain maelstrom so I can use my abilities? What the fuck?
---
So about when did blizzard completely redesign/fuck up enhance shamans?
---
Where did you get 30k?
---
They said medium now = full back then
---
Back then full = 2.5-3k...
---
Full servers now I think will be around 7-8k
---
This is why we need way more servers. Queues are gona be insane.
---
Monetization schemes have ruined several genres and they have never recovered. Mmos used to release every other year, there used to be new rts games and new fps games.. Now its the same bullshit lootbox simulator ad infinitum with nothing paid attention to fun. Engagement and attracting whales is all they care about now.
---
There's no reliable way to know before launch. Be aware that realms with the "medium" status now would have been labelled "full" back in 2004-2007.
---
Only plebs play pve realms
---
It's been so long since I played "Classic" Skyrim (without Alternative Start mod) that it took me a while to get the reference...
---
But hey, it's some sort of Classic... right?
---
Yeah, perhaps I shouldn't have said all. I wouldn't agree that there's a plethora of non-chinese gold farmers but ofc there are exceptions.
---
Yup, I'm ready to be a stoner NEET playing this from when I wake up to when I eventually pass out.
---
I'll do that till life hits me upside the head and forces me to get a job, or untill paramedics drag my seat-fused ass away in a body bag 
---
I have my personal reasons for this and I consider this my own holiday from my life. I think it's well deserved given what I've dealt with these past few years.
---
I heard that owls are a pain in the ass, because you have to also catch a bird from west fall to train the ability on the owl. So it turns into a double tame to make the owl relative. Is it still worth it for the owl, because it was a serious consideration to me early on?
---
Goodbye my looOVEE!
---
Holy shit you hit the nail on the head with me he's the exact one I'll play when I'm getting sleepy
---
Definitely do what someone else here suggested and get your friend to keep it safe while you change your character up.
---
Pandaren monk
---
I'm on AEST zone and raided on a PST realm from Vanilla all the way through to WOTLK. The latency really wasn't an issue for raiding. Especially with spell batching being 400ms in Classic compared to 20ms in retail, latency has even less of an impact.
---
well, your pet kills things 10% faster, you aren't killing things 10% faster overall. You arent taking into consideration the damage from the hunter itself as well.
---
99 ofc hbu?
---
Imagine spending 15 dollars sub fee to play your actual physical race over 7 other options for 60 levels.
---
Yeah I'm not even kidding at least have two to three a week they're pretty cool usually LOL
---
Dabu
---
I thought that might be possible too, definitely seems more likely than someone just trying at the same time as me
---
Yu
---
How is dotting more boring than pressing the same spell over and over? Also many dots are not worth using for quicker fights.
---
By saying "undead are unhorde" I mean that they are not a real part of it: the horde is strong in unity just as alliance is, yet forsaken don't really give a shit about anyone else, they lack that unity that the rest of the horde races share. Forsaken are technically in the horde (and they will be until horde/alliance gameplay separation exists), but throughout all expansions they mostly tend to themselves and use horde as a tool
---
I read that as "mostly Paladin leveling guides."
---
Warrior will be strong if you tank. Will benefit your friends and allow you to get easier gear if you are the designated tank. 
---
Shaman will also be desirable because you can heal. Also strong in pvp, with an ele/resto hybrid. Very fun. Harder to farm.
---
Warlock will be easiest to solo farm. A bit boring playstyle but rewarding with gear in pvp.
---
Hard to pick with vague goals but you have to balance them around the group of people you're playing with and what you think you will do and enjoy most. Best of luck dude
---
Probably not but the feasibility depends on what you want the companion app to do and not do.
---
Will have to try look for an EST guild cause I don’t think any guild will be raiding 3Pm PST
---
Do you happen to have a source for this? I don't doubt you I just want to send it to some of my friends.
---
Rotations in general are so simple in classic... For casters anyway, it's "dot, maybe cast, then wand" across the board
---
Unless that 10% increased damage (putting aside other factors) is actually resulting in a significant change to 'hits to kill' or 'time to kill' it's irrelevant. Over-kill is wasted damage and then you (eventually) have trade-offs between single-target (sequential) or multi-target (aoe) farming.
---
Oh NOW you tell me.
---
I didn't want my house anyway.
---
You're really trying to stress yourself out aren't you LOL. So many of these what if worry posts Robin have heart attacks before it launches
---
Kill your friends
---
It's unlikely but entirely possible. Maybe sub the day before the day before!
---
Fuck that gnome, he had it coming.
---
I'll be working every single day before launch.  I hope it doesn't go slow. Holidays are upon us!
---
I love Brom! His books are great too.
---
&gt; just because a game is old... doesn't mean its not blockbuster good.
---
This. I remember when I discovered masters of magic  (1992) a game in early 2000s, and I couldn't believe nobody had made anythinglike it. Only later on I realized age of wonders was a bit similar, but masters of magic still had more gamplay options.
---
Why do you suggest warlocks will be mostly Undead? Character immersion?
---
Enhance shaman from 1-60 is pretty great but falls off the moment you start getting pre-bis. 
---
But ele gets really good when you start collecting spell power gear. It's the burstiest class in the game besides mage.
---
I would agree with getting an Owl. You do however have to get to Westfall and tame a Carrion Bird in order to learn screech which is the big reason for having the Owl. You also could just keep the Carrion Bird. It's a great leveling pet but the Owl does put out more damage all though at the expense of less armor.
---
As far as fast attack speed... It's irrelevant to PvE damage at this patch. It does provide push back in PvP.
---
Ultimately, you'll have to decide the right tool for the right job.
---
I started to play as a holy priest in 2006 (late Vanilla), then leveled up many characters (main as warrior tank in Legion, dinged 70 in mid TBC).
---
And now I can't decide what's better for me to play: a priest or a warrior.
---
I like vanilla holy priests with all that manaconserve (5-seconds mana regen rule), that was really fun to play. I also like the warrior tank play-style with battlestance dancing and the responsibility .
---
I don't have much time to raid more than like 2 evenings a week (I can play a lot throughout all evenings but need breaks for cooking, dog stuff and my woman), so I cant expect to be a main tank.
---
I don't like warrior pvp, can visit several BGs with a priest when they are out.
---
I like to level up alts so I'll have both at some point, but what would you say I should start with (and make my main): holy priest or warrior tank? Which char will be easier to find a group for dungeons / some raiding with?
---
So, why use "Wasty\_YT" on Reddit ? :-)\~
---
Post it here :D
---
Thanks my brother
---
LOK TAR
---
from my friend group? About 75% havn't subbed yet.
---
So not only do they have Growl, BM specs also have Intimidation.
---
Ask any Vanilla tank how they enjoy Hunters who use those skills in Dungeons and Raids.
---
Then come back and tell us Hunters can’t Taunt
---
What name. 
---
Super common word or thing?
---
Gotcha lol. We still plan on going and fucking them up when they go somewhere but who knows we might truce at parts lol
---
a lot more
---
I would imagine there will be pugs but be prepared to waste a few lockouts due to groups disbanding mid raid.
---
Not a muslim or someone who lives in EU but i ahve a question for you.  
---
How old are you? Be honest please.
---
We know ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
If you are not interested in pvp you definitely should consider rolling on a pve server
---
the bot is faster than your friend lol
---
Look into cross/faction trading. Keep tabs on the prices of things, and ask them/him to do the same. Could be easy money
---
Ally or horde?
---
no chance
---
I would never suggest anyone to go out and waste time on BT. Specially for leveling. It's not even moderately worth it. Boar till you get an stv cat is the way to go.
---
what's the name
---
You can bind any key combination, I believe
---
The cap we're talking about is a fixed player cap on the server, it has nothing to do with layering. A fully load balanced solution should be able to support an infinite number of players. 
---
My point from that start has been adding more servers adds problem down the line. 
---
Again, learn to read before attempting to call someone out it just looks really bad on your end. You aren't even arguing against my points because you have none.
---
Pathetic lmao.
---
Changing from russian to english or visa versa should be possible just pvp to pve/pvp and pve only to pve.
---

Here you go!
---
Of course it differs quite a lot, there's a lot of spammer Discord servers that are used by friends who play together, who used to use Ventrilo or Teamspeak.
---
But yeah, the general bandwagoners who act like a mixture of edgy 4channers and Twitch spammers are incredibly cancerous and widespread on almost any major Discord server for anything.
---
For anyone that aren't aware of what Discord is, don't bother  unless you have a good reason to use it.
---
I recall on the launch of wotlk, I tried to renew my sub and I had to wait 3 hours or so for it to be fixed. Kept getting one of those 404 messages. I would probably say that was one of the bigger subs per day at the time too. So day before shouldn't hurt.
---
Another PSA for hunters... You can use Feign as to drop aggro to your pet without reseting the NPC &amp; combat.
---
I can't imagine that prep.  I actually stopped playing my warlock as I disliked the slog which was wipe recovery solo.  Demon shield, health stone, soul stone, summon demon, drink.  Hearing about farming shards was bad enough.  I never considered distributing health stones.  No thank you sir.
---
Horde
---
24 mins
---
No one, because it doesn’t get posted here every day.
---
Maybe it's just me but I tend to go for a leveling pet that roots the target. I remember a dark darkshore crab just pinning targets down in pvp and pve. Helped me keep range.
---
Do a lot of hours next week and go to work the 27th late in the morning while playing since 2 in the morning.
---
From what I remember from retail, it shared the hearth CD. The only differences were that /stuck didnt require you to use a bag slot and hearthing was usable in combat, while /stuck wasnt.
---
Insults are not arguments, and I am not interested in an internet fight with someone arguing in bad faith.
---
I hope the rest of your life is exactly as pleasant as you are, and you get exactly what you deserve.
---
Offline chat.  Can't find your tank in game.  Maybe check discord to see if anyone offline wants to do it
---
Not on RPing.
---
yea, helps deciding on classes too (...not really lmao)
---
i've been on a few of the new server discords and my IQ dropped like 45 points
---
Yeah you'll beat it. The A.I is broken and doesn't work anymore. So it's a bad time to play it tbh. Maybe if you can offline install the disc, you can get the real experiance.
---
“Remove the most important part of the post and it’ll make no sense”
---
Yeah no shit?
---
&gt; You forget somthing they are all pretty hardcore with extreamly good gear
---
You forgot something, NOBODY has gear at all.  It's a fresh start.  This is why they were decimated in the beta.
---
Are shadow priests fun to play? I played shadow in vanilla, but I have only vague memories of their playstyle.
---
I am hesitant to roll either shadow or elemental.
---
Sorry bro,  I would be gutted af if that happened to me. Thats a real shame. I'm on Arugal also.
---
It was "Retarded" haha, was going to be good fun.
---
You mean, download torrent and click wow.exe? Its more trouble getting to lvl 10, or get people to pay 10 each month. Why do people always think p-server players need to have some magic hacker skills to get to play?
---
To be solo and pick up all enhanting formulas/alchemy recipes, do I have to have learned the profession? If not;
---
Can I pick up all formulas/recipes if I have only skull 1 in said professions?
---
HAHAHA!
---
It was "Retarded" I was going to be a bit of fun.
---
i do have a question too, what if i drink something like lucazade or gatorade with the water, are those drinks better for you? i dont usually drink them, i usually just drink water.
---
btw where do you spawn when you run to another map as ghost and rez there?
---
Right. Like they said, it was more for knowing how to manage mana well to reduce downtime, and I don't find that too insane.
---
Personally, I like to figure it out myself.
---
Isnt that phase 2 content?
---
f that
---
You won't have money for your skills, either.  I'm not joking, you'll be completely broke.
---
I think he meant the people in charge of the discords promoting RMT sites chose the PvP servers due to their early popularity.
---
If we count, there are approx 800k active players playing retail, we can only assume that 80-90% created a character on classic due to overall hype. People say, there are still majority of people waiting for the launch, but we would need basically another 600-800k people to resub on launch day. Im not sure that will happen
---
I have never seen a deployment for WoW without login issues. WotLK through BfA, I recall issued on launch. I can’t see. Classic being any different considering most servers are High or Full population. I for one am not expecting to be able to play the first day.
---
This is the most hype game trailer I've ever seen.
---
Blizzard can buy the services and ban the accounts that deliver.  No idea why they don’t.
---
I get up at like 4-5am for work anyway and I've already risked it once, I'll risk it again.
---
I just need to remake my Rogue (from Dwarf to Human). As fun and unique as 'Stoneform' is in cleansing Blind it's not worth giving up perception for (especially since Perception lets you free up 5 talent points that would otherwise need to be spent in MoD).
---
I still use this mechanic even in bfa... Because apparently mm hunters are agro whores
---
Probably part of it yeah. Also the old school notion that undead is the best pvp race on horde. However, when Orc is an option, it’s usually the best race to go. 25% extra stun resist up all the time is better than wotf imho. Too bad undead look cooler than orcs with cloth 😕
---
LOL. Good shit, OP.
---
I can’t imagine how somebody who’s never even heard of Classic would react to some of memes/hype on this sub.
---
As recently as May they said they would have crossrealm battlegrounds.  I'm on mobile and a caveman so I don't have the link, but if you look up the Tipsout dev interview it seems pretty clear at 12:45.
---
Rekt
---
Servers are going to be a tad bodgey for awhile, get proper sleep, a video game isn't more important than your health, anyone who thinks otherwise is a bit of a loser.
---
My brother and I will be duo leveling warrior and priest. Is focusing on dungeon leveling going to be optimal for us? Or should we focus on questing with only doing dungeons for the quests?
---
And the Villas/Mansions were so cool. 
---
AC did so much right. I miss those days and that community a lot.
---
anyone can loot a recipe, and this means sometimes you have an infuriating situation where other players loot a rare recipe they cannot even use.
---
you can hold onto it until you can use it as well.
---
For example, you can buy all the vendor cooking recipes and then learn them as you level cooking.
---
You can only learn from the trainers if you have the requisite skill.
---
Its full of sugar. You will have to deal with inevitable sugar rush and following sugar crash. Depends on dosage though and you can always go for some Zero variant that has no real sugar, only sweeteners that will give you shits in large doses
---
Hoping there's some experienced Elv users here that might be able to answer a few questions for me. 
---
I've been using Luna on the past private servers I played on, and really like that - however, I enjoy the way Elv is a full UI update, and not just unitframes.
---
I tried setting it up on the stress test, and besides from a few bugs I really enjoyed it. 
---
One of the key features I couldn't figure out if it has, was integrated MP5 rule timer, and energy / mana ticks. It did look like there was an option for druid bars, but I didn't get to test it as I didn't level up enough to get any forms. 
---
Do any of you have experiences with Elv and whether it has these features ? Any other key differences between Elv and Luna (unitframe wise?) 
---
Another question in case I can't get MP5 ticks, etc - is it possible to simply disable the unitframe part of the addon, but keeping the rest ? I actually enjoyed the action bar implementation more than bartender, and really loved the minimap, bags, menus, etc and just the general look and feel it gave the game - but if Luna is just a better option for unit frames I'd prefer to use that on combination with Elv. 
---
Any advice is very welcome :)
---
BT is bis the entire game. 
---
With frenzy, bite, and claw, that is so much pushback.
---
My classes start the day of launch. There is nothing I can do /cry
---
Bout 350
---
Gatorade is just sugar water, I’d stay away from it unless you’re working up a sweat playing.
---
keep/roll on any high level shadow/frost gear you find in preparation to aq40/naxx, or try to buy them from people who dont know the value.
---
Let's hope the sub system got better in 11 years
---
Regardless of where you sit in terms of what you feel is centralized its still absolutely moronic to pay someone to do that for you aswell as paying for the game aswell.
---
It wasn't just APES, honestly. They get all the blame, but it was really the fact that 80% of the PvP community decided to roll alliance together. APES were the most prolific and had the most hardcore players, but they've been in other servers where it wasn't an issue because there was opposition. Last time around, the guilds that had previously been horde either went alliance or didn't play at all, leaving horde with almost no hardcore players. This meant alliance got a huge head start in levels, so once horde players got to level 50ish, it was just ceaseless all-day ganking literally everywhere in the world. Groups of level 60 alliance were camping every possible place you could go to level, so it kinda ruined the server. BTW phase 2 will be that times ten because there aren't even BGs to occupy those players some of the time.
---
Thankyou ki dly, good sir.  I shall use that.
---
Yeah... This is painfully not accurate, from a glance.
---
The discord got brigaded by 4chan "clover squad" or some nonsense who were trying to troll the place, and when people started calling them out they used "wow were Muslim, this is discrimination" as an obvious tactic to crybully their way out of being free to fuck with people.
---
Tirisfall is just too good. I always played alliance but this zone has some kind of magic to it. Damn I‘m jealous
---
Caution:  the following is an opinion-
---
There will be just as many - if not more raid PUGs on a PvP realm.  It is a false assumption that PvE progression will be faster/more prominent on a PvE realm.  The hardcore raiding guild I ended up with in TBC had played on a PvE realm during vanilla.  They transferred to my PvP server for TBC because they felt that it would be easier to find more skilled players on a PvP realm.

Also keep in mind that top tier raid gear is fantastic for PvP in classic.  There will be lots of serious PvP players who also raid for PvP gear.   A favorable byproduct of my hardcore raiding guild was that some of the officers who had alts would run unofficial guild raids for alts that we pugged up with our non-guildy friends.    We even did premade BG's this way too.  
---
From what you're saying, it sounds like you might enjoy playing on a PvE realm more.  I don't think you're going to have trouble finding a PUG on a normal realm - I think pug raids will be MUCH more common this time around.    I don't think there will be a lot of open world PvP on PvE realms however.  If there is it'll be on a small scale.   If you play on a PvP realm, there will be many times when you get ganked by higher players mercilessly while leveling.  If that's going to bother you, then roll on a normal realm.
---
It stacks only 4 times, not infinitely like you may have seen in some old videos.
---
I think alot of people pick a pvp server for the classic feeling horde vs alliance. I guarantee you still alot of people will do pve. Its like a pve server with world pvp. The pvp servers will also have a longer life cycle i think (higher population)
---
This. Pretty much if you’re a solo player who doesn’t have a guild dedicated to a specific server or whose group of friends hasn’t chosen yet, jump ship from Herod because otherwise you won’t be able to play in the capacity you thought you did
---
From the census which has around 45k votes, it’s around 50/50 on people currently subbed. However I suspect people who have taken the time to do the census are mostly the more hardcore players who will have subbed, in reality I would estimate its closer to 70%+ currently not subbed
---
Gives people a chance to get out of their starting zones without getting ganked though?
---
Meanwhile I dreamt I was being horribly tortured by drug dealing Latinos/Mexicans because I knew and saw too much.
---
Can you do one that is just quests? Things lile devilsaur leggings are going to cost a fortune and may as well be unobtainable for most people.. Especially if those stupid fucking mafias show up.
---
He forgot living action potion : [https://classicdb.ch/?item=20008](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20008)  Especially useful against rogue if your insignia is on cool down (or if you are a warlock). Will not be available until phase 4 tho.
---
It's not hard to understand if you actually looked it up
---
look at the right side on the addon page, if it says "WoW Classic" download that file and it should be compatible and recognizable within the app.
---
example:
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tellmewhen
---
Thats the stupidest shit i’ve read all day.
---
Caffeine is caffeine.
---
Just curious. How did you prepare this in advance of classic coming out? I would like to make mine as well.
---
then what have you been doing since announcement?
---
Lol I’ve been doing this since like February. It’s just a lot easier now
---
you’re doing the right thing. the ones with the free time are the jobless neckbeards
---
Hours longer? idk Locks don't have feign death, SS is on a 30 min CD.
---
Everything will be fine, I’ve not had problems for the last two expansions.
---
Just play a shaman, best class the in the game anyway
---
In all seriousness, if you plan on doing PVP, shaman is a good choice, not exactly the most fun out of the 3 but it's still really good and frost shock spam can pretty much win any 1v1, at least that's how it was when I was dueling out of Org on my resto shaman.
---
Just a gentle reminder not to download any random zip files you find on reddit atleast without looking heavily into it first.
---
&gt;"Anything that removes the human element from the game, i.e., the need for you to be present and to initiate an action, or that makes complex decisions for you is considered automation. Automation is a practice that we don't allow".
---
The chance of you getting banned for it are EXTREMELY minimal though and with extremely minimal I mean the amount of people that got banned using stuff like auto clickers are basically zero for all I know. My friend did it for years during MoP/WoD/legion and he didn't even get a warning for it, I don't think they can track it and even if they could.. their guidelines are probably so strong that it usually don't end in a ban. It's hard to tell if someone is using one and they don't want to ban people without fully knowing that they actually are using a program of any sort.
---
But yes, according to their rules it is bannable.
---
Fishing buddy is an addon to count the fish you have caught, puts a list of how many probable successful casts you need to the next skill point.  It has an easy cast function and will automagically put lures on your rod.
---
Thank you Medowi - I hope so, it was a pure joy to publish it after 8 months of working on it on and off. Glad to hear it is appreciated =D
---
WeakAuras and Bartender both support classic, so I just made it on retail.
---
As far as I'm aware, it *should* just port over. I took special care not to touch anything that doesn't exist in classic.
---
I don't believe it doable as a lock. The only reason hunters can do it is because they can feign death to get passed certain mobs and they can feign death to chain the last boss to their pet on the ledge. I have seen locks solo DM E though.
---
I don't know, I can see the use for it. Guild recruitment, grouping for elite quests, dungeons, raids, selling/trading etc. Gives you another way to do all that other than just the in-game chat channels.      
---
I'm still probably not gonna use it because the Shazzrah discord is just horrible, but oh-well.
---
Bfa launch was fine, so was legion.
---
Right now download on [b.net](https://b.net) is 2.9GB, unpacked is little over 4GB
---
To me mage is boring as shit, no matter how good mage is I’m not gonna play something that bores me. To each their own though.
---
You mean 6 - 26 hour login que gangbang of 2019?
---
You maybe wanna check them out individually with the actual sound
---
I bought a Razer Naga the week Classic was announced. I used one back in Wrath and figured I had to go all in again
---
23
---
out of the like 12ish people i know that are gonna play only one has a  sub atm
---
Thats exactly what botting means. Its an automated process.
---
Having the mallet pretty much guarantees you a group for ZF though
---
We don't speak his name anymore. He has been stricken from history.
---
....no, I just haven't leveled a character.
---
Faster, faster, until the thrill of speed overcomes the fear of death!!!
---
Here lies Trhallsballs29.
---
Feats:
---
reserved character name
---
Have u tried it on the 1.13.2 client during stress test or beta?
---
Just pick one yourself, yah bish
---
Hunter has far less gear competition, offers unique utility and is really strong (WHEN MASTERED!) in wpvp. Drops off in damage slowly as the patches progress  but still always necessary/wanted in raids. Awesome RPG elements if you like that too with ammo and pet, annoying af if yu dont like that.
---
Mage has a fuckton of gear competition, are beasts in wpvp, MANY different specs that you can run in certain situations whether its nieche PoM Pyro or elementalist mage etc. Amazing utility in portals, food etc. Top dpser throughout the content. 
---
Negatives idk.. ID rather point out the + on both so you find what you like the most. When you do that, you can ignore/work around the negatives.
---
You and I have VASTLY different definitions for “no-lifing” 
---
I’m taking a month off work for this game. Saved up a hefty sum, just in case I don’t feel like coming back to work. I will also be playing 15-24 hours a day. 
---
Stopped being homeless, got a place and a computer for this game. I’ve planned the entire year of 2019 around Classic. This is the real No Life.
---
Like, uh, I always thought that quicksand was going to be a much bigger problem than it turned out to be. Because if you watch cartoons, quicksand is like the third biggest thing you have to worry about in adult life behind real sticks of dynamite and giant anvils falling on you from the sky.
---
&gt;Arguably, flying didn't ruin much until Cata.
---
Yeah, I'm gonna have to give you a hard disagree on that. Flying was a mistake from day 1, and if Blizzard is in any way interested in re-doing the progression through the expansions in a "vanilla style", and the first thing they do is still add flying mounts, then you can safely jump ship right then and there.
---
Even if somehow it is true that it didn't ruin much until Cata, what will they do to flying mounts in Cata then? We have already seen this pattern in recent expansions, they'll lock flying mounts behind some arbitrary progression thing just to keep it out as long as possible before finally giving it because people are complaining too much. Blizzard damn well knows themselves that flying mounts were a god awful mistake, else they wouldn't keep locking it away at the start of expansions, but the outrage of removing them outright is more than they're willing to deal with.
---
The best move, objectively, is to just never add the cursed things in the first place.
---
So you haven’t actually tried it in classic yet
---
Retail is like that specificially because of CRZ and sharding.
---
Weakness.
---
ty
---
Would also love to know the answer to this question as I'm in the same boat.
---
Honestly, stick to normal healthy habits.
---
- Sleep: Individual, but I need 6 - 8 hours of sleep to function properly and stay on top of my game.
---
- Stretching: Once an hour, stand up and do some basic stretches. If you have a standing desk, consider standing in intervals.
---
- Relax your eyes: Take your eyes of the monitor and look at something far away through the window for like 20-30s, try to see the details of what you're looking at.
---
- Morning routine: Have breakfast, take a walk and do some light workout. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, stretch and take a cold shower.
---
- Food: Eat normal food. When I say normal I mean fresh veggies, fish, chicken, meat etc. Do a meal prep the day before so you have 8 meals ready. You can complement with something like Huel for convenience and have some nuts for snacks (natural, not roasted/salted). Macadamia &amp; Para are great snacks as an example. 
---
- Drinks: Water is important, but don't overdo it. You can aim for something like 2L per day as the food also contains water. Avoid excess sugar, if you want coca cola make it no Sugar. One energy drink (33cl) per day should be sufficient, I'd also aim for the no Sugar version but the sugar also provides an energy boost for a short period of time.
---
If you normally drink 3 cups of coffee per day, just stick to that.
---
Tl;dr : Don't treat your body like a rental car
---
Found a guy named tJustSoup helped me out a lot, he has low subscribers but the content is 10/10
---
Mage boring hunter fun
---
"IF you're fighting beast mobs"
---
At least half of the mobs in the game are Beasts.
---
Well, if another player jumps in, or you reach camp...
---
Rdp requires router knowledge and also if your ip changes it kinda sucks. Most other options just connect as long as target device is online. Chrome rdp is probably the easiest
---
Dungeons for the quests, but normal questing beats dungeon leveling. Especially if you are warrior and priest.
---
Can you link it
---
mage good, huntard bad why waste bag space on ammo when i would waste it on portal mats
---
Yikes.
---
Not tryna level that Fishing/Cooking, gank scrubs, level hella alts, and flip stuff on the AH? It’s worth the sleep deprivation.
---
I had a friend with beta access give it a quick test, and they said it didn't throw any errors. They haven't tested it extensively, but I'm about 99% confident there aren't any issues.
---
&gt;  most people are happy with retail
---
No.  If that was true the population of retail WoW would not have steadily declined since WoD (when the you think you do was said btw) with the exception of upticks at expansion launches.  The game is in decline not because of it's age (as Classic proves) but because of it's lack of vision and quality.  Retail WoW CAN be saved but it starts with them learning the mistakes they've made to get here and Ion even admitted that earlier this year when he said the team has a lot to learn from Classic.
---
Ah, the good ol' switcheroo
---
What does his spec matters? It is all about his integrity and will to se the guild succeed. You can easily raid whit 10-15 meme specs and clear early content as casual. The more I read your comments the more it looks like to me you should not apply to a casual but instead a hardcore or atleast a semi hardcore guild
---
nothing, i've never had any problems with it, just put the path of your wow folder in the app, , but make a backup of your addons folder just in case.
---
This guy looks like a monster energy drink
---
He can just say that he's rping as an Airbus plane.
---
haha yeah, love these in depth guides for classes, like crazy in detail what spell with what gear is most effective regarding specific scenarios. How much a certain stat improves ability etc etc. 
---
I'm not even playing that class, but might be handy in PvP lol.
---
Questie   
---
Leatrix  
---
 Weakauras  
---

---
Best to wait until launch day and hope they add another server. All current ones will be packed
---
Nah spoke to a GM and he said heaps of ppl have it on retail and would've been fine most likely.
---
I dont get this discord bullshit thst everyone is obsessed with. Why put an entire servers community in thr hands of schmucks who happened to be first to create? Fuck that noise
---
Yeah so if you cast a damaging spell as a Tauren against a non-Tauren, you get +2.5 cast range but your opponent also gets +2.5 cast range against you (because you're a Tauren).
---
Looks like an excellent casual loot ststem
---
That's really quite sad
---
Because APES will be rolling there i guess
---
I reckon they're bullshitting. They don't want people to avoid them. The whole point of playing in a guild like APES is to win the servers that matter the most. Notice he doesn't say "play on another server," he says "go Shazzrah." It's reverse psychology &lt;taps forehead&gt;.
---
They won't ban for using a mouse/keyboard/software macro like this. But if you are scared then just use your mouse wheel and scroll like crazy.
---
I've been watching videos of how to get into hyjal because I wanna try get there
---
Poor soul. 
---
The Chains That Bind.
---
Hey, another Mana love it! Yeah, it's really frustrating, nothing can be done though.
---
thanks man, couldnt find some of the addons on twitch weirdly but now i got them
---
Where is the best place to find up-to-date addons? Like 80% of the addons i tried in stress test didnt work?
---
You had less fun though.
---
in an addon, I need it constantly on my UI
---
THIS ONE IS BRILLIANT!!! xD
---
Mostly old pvp movies. New classic players gonna be shook when I hit em with that old, Scatter shot -&gt; FD -&gt; Frost Trap then wind up that Aim shot.
---
I was a Hunter named Ignition, in The Ancient mostly. We had some drama because our guildleader Gorbag was greedy on (I think) our first Nefarian kill. The whole server ended up hating him for it.
---
Do you remember Littlerabbit? He was also in Ashes I think. We befriended somewhere in TBC but I quit during WOTLK. Would love to know if he's gonna play classic.
---
Clearly people still fail to grasp sarcasm.
---
It's Blizzlike bro did you even play vanilla?
---
agreed
---
jokes on you.. i had this in vanilla HUEHUEHUE
---
Given Jay's new position as president of Blizzard Entertainment he's  in full possession of the reigns to World of Warcraft.  His ability to announce Classic after the "you think you do" fiasco shows he's willing to at least attempt to atone for his sins at least.  As to vision though?  I don't think he was EVER a visionary.  As a suit in the big chair that's actually a good thing.  Now true visionaries can lead the day to day development team... if they can find them.  To be honest I'd like to see Jeff Kaplan return to WoW.  For all his faults at the time when he worked on WoW it was clear he was passionate about the game and he's proven with Overwatch he knows how to build successful products and systems.
---
They have classic wow videos on pornhub now?
---
 lost? The anti-classic circle jerk is found at /r/wow
---
Yeah but it ain't my shit they're getting. And I have millions still left over from WoD. They haven't gotten a dime from me in years, nor will they for years lol. If some dumb fucker wants to give them cash, by all meanz.
---
Bis for pvp against casters ? Yeah. True. But not even worth mentioning in pve, leveling or pvp against melees.
---
Mario is the best example.  While the 3D jump was (arguably) a huge departure from series standards the games have otherwise remained unchanged since the very early 80s minus any side project games.
---
MM is so delicious in BfA
---
Laughs in RP
---
In a truly authentic experience there shouldnt be layering at all, wether your RP or PVP.
---
My classes end with 2 exams next week on the 23rd. I feel like the devil writing this
---
Then you're missing out on class lore in legion and existing and future race lore in heritage quests
---
So on launch day I am flying back home from conducting a 2 week rotation. When I get home the game would of been live for roughly 4 hours. Depending on how I feel I may just say fuck it and go hard then or just fall to sleep and wake up at 5 am like I do anyways. 
---
Either way excited to do my turnaround right at the begining and able to just go hard.
---
I feel the same, but Age of empire II (and I seriously consider re-subbing for classic).
---
I plan on doing push ups while I'm in flight
---
[This exact link](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A7350&amp;filter-sort=2) is the correct filter options. You need to click on the "Classic" files bottom right when you want to download a specific addon. There are always (or very often let's say) 2 type of files, retail and classic, be sure to download the classic files.
---
Actually, it stacks 5 times (even if maxed out as intended, by taking legit crits). What I was wondering is if sit proccing works at all, so that you can actively stack reckoning and do a quick bomb on almost every mob you fight after level 34.
---
why upload this low effort repost twice in a 15 minute span? ... To the same subreddit?
---
&gt; My point from that start has been adding more servers adds problem down the line.
---
Did you just learn to communicate yesterday? I've never encountered someone so bad at making such a simple point, lmfao. Like, holy fucking shit, it's insane.
---
Either that or you're continuously changing your point, because you realized it was dumb as shit, then pretending the new point is what you meant all along. Then refusing to admit how dumb you were originally, because you're too arrogant or can't handle a slightly bruised ego.
---
I argue perfectly against your original point (but you keep changing it, so there's no point...)
---
Either way, here's a fun little counter-argument: if Blizzard could start out with just one of each type of realm, don't you think they'd have done that? If they could solve it all with layering or other solutions, preventing any issues down the line, don't you fucking think they'd have done that? Holy fuck, you're so dumb, I refuse to believe you're not trolling and as such, I won't bother replying anymore. You're simply not worth it and too stupid to ever admit you're wrong.
---
&gt;There are other options.
---
You never mentioned any, so you're just talking out of your ass.
---
I'm not white knighting at all, I'm merely being REALISTIC. I haven't played any Blizzard game since WotLK came out.
---
You're living in a FANTASY world if you think there is any possibility of them removing layering this late, as the development and testing phases are already over. 
---
I'm trying to enlighten your peanut-sized brain. You're a complete fucking moron, it's gross.
---
Agree
---
what is this? a template char with an incorrect home location set?
---
Sunken? There was a ship with a lot of boxes in the barrens close to ratchet
---
Fair! I overlooked because my druid won't be my skinner and likely won't have nearly as high a % of beasts killed. But, like with casters, more power to the people!
---
like maybe half or a little under of these i was able to find on the Twitch app.  For anyone looking on twitch, you have to make sure you have the right install folder selected to search addons for 1.13 build!  And yes, like I mentioned above, I did this for my friends because of how pain in the ass it was going around to like 5+ websites grabbing all these lol
---
Littlerabbit rings a bell! Can’t remember specifics though, my memory from back then is mostly gone until I’m reminded of it 😂
---
If you work, chances are the company you work for employ cleaners. Does that mean you should just leave shit everywhere? No, you give them a hand before you go home at the end of the day by tidying up a little. They get paid, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't help out. The report button is there for a reason.
---
good advice!  here's a crappy video I recorded showing the file downloaded and scanned but take it as you will :)
---
https://streamable.com/se34l
---
In pvp reckoning works you just have to have a big two hander equipped and not mele hit anything until you want to unload your stacks (max4 or 5). Remember the stacks reset when you switch weapons so you can't use a sword and board to stack them. In leveling in private servers you could trigger a stack from using /sit this won't work in classic you still get a stack from a normal crit so you can stack up to 4 or 5 and unload on an unsuspecting poor npc aswell. If you want to spend the talents all the way down into the prot tree is more your choice tho
---
This is exactly the type of comment I’d expect from someone who rolled Herod lmao
---
That’s why I’m resubbing 1-2 days in advance
---
Or any other video game for that matter
---
Pretty sure all it would take is 1 person to report it and you would have been forced to change it, it’s a slur for people with a mental disability.
---
Mage is fun if you like pressing only one button during the raids. Hunter is boring if you dislike pressing many buttons.
---
I respectfully disagree with Blubb, [following those researches.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/co9rmv/dungeon_leveling_xphr_compared_to_a_speedrunner/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Right now you have both the tank and healer, you only need to find 3 DPS friends willing to level in the dungeons with you. Keep in mind dungeon levelling beats the world record in quest levelling.
---
Exactly. We’re talking multiple hour queues across the board, Herod will be the worst by a very large margin
---
For me, the real one is where most people are. So the one with 15.5k members currently. The other one with 4.5k and RMT involved admins I'd rather stay away from. Exactly due to their RMT involvement.
---
Yep absolutely, great way to do it.
---
I ran a lot of raids myself later on and had similar policies. If you were GOING to be 10-15 mins late and knew in advance then that was OK.. just log out in front of the raid 100% ready to go. But if you didn't say anything beforehand... best hope that I didn't have someone else wanting to go.
---
ye, but like 90% of all tank weapons are swords .  
---
maybe only for the beginning you could go dagger.
---
StalaGG!
---
Vanquisher's Sword vs Amberglow Talisman absolutely pits the min-maxer against the cosmetic collector in me. Leaning to aesthetics!
---
LOL maybe after progressing most of the way through AQ40.
---
Warlocks are by no means top tier DPS in MC and early BWL.
---
It’s gonna be interesting to watch their realms swarmed as all of the ppl will finally sub in the last few days
---
Shazzrah is the best shitposting discord I've been in, possibly ever.
---
Tunaaaa
---
Watched this as a kid and then decided to play a mage..still most fun to AOE all the enemies
---
Hah. Thanks for clarifying - I was thinking “how tf did I not know about this before?!”
---
Yeah we will see
---
I won't do it. But I can totally understand why someone would do it. You wanna raid with friends or pvp with a class, without the hassle of spending ~100 hours into leveling.  Maybe you have money and don't care about $400 (or whatever the cost).   
---
Sure you might not know how to play your char, but that's another topic and it's your problem to solve and learn when you get to play it.  
---
Also, I would very much like to have a lvl 60 mage since I've always had one when I played from Vanilla to Cata. Actually, I leveled four or five mages over the years for different races, factions and servers.  
---
I will do it again this time after I level my main, to have a farm slave. But DAMN do I not want to do it and how I would gladly pay a insta lvl 60 pass to Blizzard for it.  I have nothing to prove to no one, I know the class in and out, spent literal thousands of hours playing it. The leveling will just be 100 hours of boring running around for the fifteenth time.  
---
So yeah, there are bad reasons to pay a leveling service, they are also some very good ones. I can understand how the gold sellers affect the economy and health of a server. The levelers, not really.  
---
It's a silly thing to cry about I think and what people enjoy in WoW / why do they play  is HIGHLY subjective.
---
If you are going to repost a meme 10 minutes after it was originally posted, at least make sure its a good one.
---
Sure glad they fixed her eye for the box art
---
Subscription is a definite. Issues have been in place since the last stress test, if not earlier. To your larger point, the chance is zero.
---
Truth
---
Yeah, this bothers me the most. This kind of thing needs some sort of vetting, precisely because shit like this happens.
---
I did years of PVP server from the orignal release. For classic I am going PVE to avoid the commen and often lengthy time wasted on PVP when I wanted to do other things. I had the time and blood thirsty friends back then, so it worked fine then. Now I am not sure how much time I can spend. When I am out in the world for what ever purpose I will want to not be delayed/stopped/distracted. Back then I also really prefered the BGs for PVP anyway.
---
You mention city raiding but that works the same for PVE and PVP servers since the residents are not PVP marked without them choosing it.
---
I am leaning towards Pyrewood Village. Just seemed like the least terrible name out of terrible names.
---
I would definitely suggest PVE server from what you are asking for.
---
Wait till you find out about Mag'har Monks.
---
Bored people waiting for classic, pretty much it.
---
lmao
---
If only paladins had a similar miniscule difference between their cloth and full plate sets :(
---
2004, played the beta....
---
Where do you download the classic bartender ? Twitch app? Cuz I couldn’t find it on the vanilla-wow site
---
Its because switching to Stalagg is a huge fucking endeavor for large guilds. Coordinating a few hundred people to all move servers is a fucking headache. Specially since everyone already did name reservations. Oh you got Muffinz on Herod but its taken on Stalagg tough luck!
---
I have had to leave all of the server discords, they were so hideously toxic
---
Poke mongo?
---
&gt;Does that mean you should just leave shit everywhere?
---
No I do not make an inordinate amount of mess in the first place at work... What is this point even, I am not expecting myself to be a botter, gold seller, or person who needs to be reported. 
---
&gt;No, you give them a hand before you go home at the end of the day by tidying up a little. 
---
I am not going to go around to all my co-workers offices to make sure they clean to a good standard so that the cleaning lady the office pays has an easier job, that is not my job. 
---
Now that all of that has been said, that was not here nor there to my comment, can't expect people to both read and comprehend...
---
&gt;Paying 15$ a month is not being given it, we pay it’s their responsibility 
---
My comment was in reference to OP acting as if the game we are paying for is a gift when in reality it is a consumer purchase/service, that the onus to maintain is on the provider.
---
Good posture. For some reason excellent posture improves performance. I learned this when I was into CSGO for a while, all the top dudes had immaculate posture while playing and coincidentally were juicy AF.
---
everyone will be 60 by then and starting their alt
---
Don’t worry i’ll grab that sweet blue gear for you.
---
I find these server hype videos/memes interesting because at first you assume someone rolling on Stalagg is making these, but the people most motivated to make these would be people on Herod who don't want soul-crushing queues.
---
/tinfoil hat
---
Amazing. At least we're 45 seconds closer to classic now!
---
I don't recall anyone DLing elementals in the beta. I'll go look.
---
That's good thinking!
---
Yeah 20 hours minimum.
---
It only gained stacks from /sit on private servers never in vanilla or classic. The 4 or 5 comes from me not remembering if it was 5 hits total or normal hitt and 5 extra
---
GOOD LUCK CATCHING ME DOING SOMETHING YOU CANT CATCH ME DOING HAHAHA
---
I'm having doubts that Bfa players or however the latest version is called are that hyped for Classic. Some, sure, but 80% seems way too much. Pretty sure the major share of Classic players are specifically resubscribing for it. Many already did however, for the name reservations.
---
He just proved you wrong. YOU should be quiet.
---
I, too, refuse to leave Herod and am happy every time I see someone else jump ship.
---
I agree, LFG and others QoL are good for a quick run but the pleasure to search a group , to speak during the road (sometimes very long road ) to the dungeon etc... are far more interesting.
---
I know it will be hard with my actual play time (not a student anymore like in 2005) but I am ok with that, Classic will probably not evolve in the content so... no hurry)
---
Also Azeroth is my favorite area in WoW even today, it's so big , there is so much area with different design , no flying mount to rush etc... that's amazing. i am not opposed to a "graphic enhancement" to classic (maybe on client side with a switch for the one who want the old ones) because classic with all the retail improvement can be amazing.
---
I wanted to play another class than my typical Hunter .. but the epic quest, the quiver, the pet food, pet variety in skills etc... I loved it.
---
Or the son of a rich bastard
---
For real, I paid $7.50 for these names, I'm not letting them go.
---
Yes I agree but it definitely can work in pvp in your healin gear whit a good 2 hander
---
Or his daddy has
---
Not an exercise tip but do you have a good chair with proper back support? None of that gaming chair nonsense.
---
I have a Steelcase Leap and never get pain even sitting all day as it keeps your posture while being comfy. Those chairs are designed for office workers sitting all day long. They are extremelyyy expensive to buy new but you can find lots of offices getting rid of them dirt cheap on ebay or similar.
---
No, at least you wont have lag in zones. Maybe layering will be disabled by then.
---
I'm pretty sure that was only ever a pirate server exploit. Reckoning was exploited in other ways back in vanilla.
---
The hard truth: Don’t game for 8-12 hours a day. 
---
Now let’s talk prevention, do rear deltoid and trap exercises, lower back and core, work on shoulders for a good posture. If you don’t already, start working out regularly, and you can build up enough muscle to keep a good posture while you’re gaming. 
---
Also, you need to adjust your seat and screen so that you don’t have a hunched over position. I prefer a seat that makes me adjust my position continuously
---
no, until i see someone banned for this i wont
---
I highly doubt “a lot of ppl have already lost their names this way”
---
I doubt ppl are paying blizzard 15$ to run a bot to snipe random names that may not become available again and also may not sell for more than 15 dollars.
---
like this

---
I'm split between playing with people on 3 different ones so I'm just going on my own , might make alts once they can gimme free stuff later on their servers
---
Pyrewood Village, represent

Blizzard realized they weren't telling a good story and they fixed it. The problem is, what made WoW great is everyone having their own story to tell. If Blizzard tells the story, what do strangers have to talk about?
---
Have you tried Girlcow?
---
MoP launch day was fantastic. Everybody flying around in the biggest clusterfuck of a figure 8 while the few people who could see the barrel you had to click were able to escape.
---
Yea and the people refusing to switch from the overcrowded servers are literally hurting the entire community, blizzard refuses to add more servers until this one fills up which will happen really fast once people get their 6 hour queue times.
---
Oh man.. really
---
Changing seating positions regularly really alleviates the issue completely. The dangerous thing is not moving at all.  
---
Alternatively, sit on a yoga ball to get abs while you grind!
---
As an American it's not worth taking a day off on launch. For us Europeans different story. 
---
So don't worry about it.
---
If you browse fresh there's a complaint about this issue at least once an hour, and I hear a lot of people have had it happen to them as well in the realm discords.
---
My bad... I did an update this morning to have a truly responsive menu with all the filters and it seems that it broke search inputs. It is fixed now !
---
Yup. I've been saying this for awhile, too. It's just sad what a disappointing state of affair the whole MMORPG genre have become the last 8-10 years.
---
This should be THE gene if the 21st century, FFS. It has it all... the massive worlds(like Skyrim), the epic boss battles(like Dark Souls), the community aspect(like social media), the sandbox(like Minecraft), the large scale PVP(like Fortnite), yet the gaming industry have completely failed to realise its potential. If you look what WoW did in 2005-6, it's still pretty much up there in terms of feature set. Heck, you might even say it exceeds MMOs released these days, which is just crazy and tells you how little innovation there has been the last 15 years.
---
Why haven't companies like Riot or Valve tried making something? Why haven't the other AAA publishers tried to one-up WoW and not just clone it like with SWTOR and FF14? Where's the ambition and risk taking? Like I said at the start, such a massive disappointment of genre, and personally my absolute biggest annoyance in games. Just friggin make a AAA MMO already...
---
Mine will go tbc but realistically it will die. After today's (final) raid, I won't ever log on it again.
---
Whats wrong with Shazzrah, Golrmagg and Gehennas? I like them
---
Dude I really hope so, I'd love it. Wish they'd drop an xtra PvP server with 25% increased mob health or something similar for a simple difficulty increase.
---
Pretty sure most were saying that in disbelief
---
Priest tier 5 begs to disagree ;)
---
its just a name.. get over it
---
I'll be playing hunter because I wanna be a night elf, but mage is definitely the superior class. I think it's just the best class in Vanilla. They're great in 1v1, bg, they scale well, variety of pvp specs. You can also teleport everywhere and farm really well. Once you're rolling fire in BWL+AQ gear you'll basically be 1 shotting anybody that doesn't have a fire reflector.
---
Sounds familiar enough where I’m going to say yes.
---
i was always a fan of 19, but im undecided if id rather go 29. not sure
---
Projection
---
I understand that my DS analogy wasn't clear enough but I meant it in terms of people who pay for powerlevel and also raid runs and dungeon runs which happens a ton in retail and if the RMT get their own way it will happen in Vanilla aswell. 
---
My biggest gripe is the idea of some player who put zero effort in to their character waltzing into raids and getting items and all for the pleasure of a few dollars. 
---
My opinion is that you should earn the rewards you want be it getting into raiding or dungeons it still should be earned. 
---
I understand that you feel 1-60 is pointless because the game starts at the end but if you buy your way to 60 you have skipped essentially 80% of the game but as you've stated you don't care its pointless beating that particular horse.
---
If your a hardcore player I can 100% see the idea of 60 being a minor goal or not even a goal. 
---
I can understand people who dont care about the 1-60 journey but I will never agree or understand the people who are willing to fund illegal companies that offer TOS breaking services.
---
Power nap during flight paths. That way you can play 28 hours a day
---
Yea 3% mount speed would just be too unfair for bfa nowadays too....
---
Is respeccing at 40 for shadowform and losing wand spec worth it?
---
You could start playing in any phase and catch up. You will be worse off in world PvP and bg:s but an argument could be made that it's easier for you to gear up as well. If you can find a guild that isn't just starting MC but have been at it for a while and is willing to carry you a bit. Will be lots of gear dropping that few people in the raid will need.
---
That is really stellar advice, Terocitas. I wish my posture was better, but your advice is great. How often do you think I should be doing these rear deltoid/trap/back/core exercises? Every 30 minutes? Hour?
---
Probably the wisest comment I have ever read on this sub. Thank you, @Empty\_Allocution
---
I know it used to gain stacks from sitting. However this was probably before 1.8
---
I'd rather have a few illegally RMTing than many legally RMTing.
---
ACTIVISION BAD CLASSIC GOOD
---
This post brought to you by /r/wowcirclejerk
---
Definitely take the opportunity to stretch and do a few pushups/sit ups while on the flight path. 
---
A great way to stay limber and avoid muscle/ joint pain is to stretch. Traditional stretching works well, but I also recommend qigong. Ignore any yoga like information and just focus on breathing slowly and deeply while doing it. Something like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwlvTcWR3Gs
---
The best stretch to avoid computer neck is the one where you look to the side and then stretch your neck forward and down using the arm in the direction you're looking in
---
I also recommend calisthenics. Convict conditioning is a good book with lots of exercises you can do near your desk with no extra equipment. I recommend pushups, leg raises, and body weight squats at the minimum.
---
Dude you might as well just wait for a fresh server.
---
They level 20’s are gonna be all over your fresh ass in pvp zones.
---
This is exactly why I'll be on one of the other servers, just need to find which won't be a streamer server yet won't be dead from go. Hopefully lots of the peeps from Herod move to other realms. Even blizz is concerned about it rofl. Which is saying something when there's currently layering.. 
---
On another note, I feel like wow may hold my attention again. I've played every xpack, and usually by this far in I quit.. classic made me stay subbed so I could make gold to keep my gametime up for classic without any issues, I made millions and can now play classic with no worries. Feelsgoodman. See y'all soon. 
---
..now just to find something to do until then.. current wow feels so boring lately as classic draws close.. guess I'll make more gold.
---
- vol’jin we need a crest? 
---
- we need what? 
---
- a crest, symbolic thing that presents trolls
---
- meeh throw some shit over there who needs that
---
I recall having to wait 45 minutes on grim batol. Times were bad.
---
Thank you for your post. Do you play horde or alliance on pyrewood ?
---
Everyone seems to be forgetting the huge amount of people who were not involved in the name reservation  because they're waiting for release to resub. I 100% guarantee Stalagg will be high or full on launch day and you'd have to crazy to think otherwise.
---
I do appreciate everyone trying to help the situation but I don't actually think its going to solve anything on launch day.
---
This sounds like a made up program. Your scenario doesn't even make any sense. Does someone have hundreds of accounts with bots constantly trying every sequence of letters or something silly? How is a botting problem so pervasive just for names?
---
we have not been given a damn thing, its a paid product
---
"they get as much as they put in."
---
In the case of Classic WoW, probably not. The game subscription has been $15 and has not changed for 15 years. Name one other company that has kept their prices consistent for 15 years in spite of inflation. Classic is not full of microtransactions and it doesnt cost anything up front either. Its been dubbed by the devs as "a love letter to the fans". Its as close to video game charity as we are going to get in 2019.
---
Who wants to do Molten Core at 8pm tonight ? Im lvl 60 druid orc with specialisation in staff
---
Luckily I’ll be out on a business trip for most of next week. But my gawd is that weekend going to be awful!
---
There were no cross realm battlegrounds, so it depended entirely on if your server had a good faction balance and if both factions queued for BGs at roughly the same population and times. Otherwise, one faction would be stuck in queues until enough people from the other faction signed up for the BG which could be hours.
---
My kid *loooves* fishing, I plan on "allowing" him plenty of time to engage in it :)
---
There will be pugs for all raids pre AQ40 a couple of weeks after they've been cleared the first time. Especially MC is good to PuG due to how easy it is. Guilds will run about 20 people that make sure that it will be a succesfull run. In return they will reserve the most desired items (Strikers mark, Band of Accuria, Onslaught girdle etc), Thunderfury bindings and all BoE items. However you will be able to roll on most of the items that drop. A common way of distributing loot is "hard reserve, soft reserve". Hard res items are strictly for the guild members while soft reserve is availble to everyone where you get to pick one item in particular that you are after. If that item drops you will only roll against other people that have soft reserved the item.
---
While you were drinking beers and partying, I studied the server blade.
---
In TBC they stacked, worked out to 109%, while the TBC trinkets were 110% and a single slot (but required lv 70 and a lot of gold/lw mats or exalted with netherwing).
---
*cries in camera zoom*
---
Same locations yes
---
It literally just needs to spam create character.
---
Well, the way it works is that it is constantly making requests to the classic wow website, and checking the time left. And if the hour has changed since last time it checked, it will send out an email to everyone that wants it. 
---
So to answer your question, it "runs", which is just it sending out emails, when the hour countdown changes on the official classic wow website
---
You have pvp gear which is same for everyone of each class.
---
From my experience, having played both on PvE and PvP realms, pugs for raids on PvP realms actually tended to be more common and successful than on the PvE realms I've played on. So that's definitely not a good criterion for selecting the server type. Better make the choice based on how much/little you actually like ending up in an unplanned PvP battle.
---
that was amazing, makes me want to paly shamman lol
---
6pm release for me. I plan on staying up as late as possible then sleeping without an alarm. Once I get up, it's back on the computer. Repeat until the following Monday, when I'll hopefully be around lvl 45, then go to bed at a decent hour to go to work the following day.
---
Gul'Dan and Firetree alliance queues were also really quick, usually under 10 mins. There were occasionally times, usually on the weekends, when Horde would absolutely dominate and people would just stop queueing, meaning there were no BGs at all for an hour or so until the premades broke up. Similarly, the Alliance queues would occassionally go up to 20 minutes if there was a dominate Alliance group
---
I think I read something about EU servers being in Amsterdam a while back, but that was for retail.
---
[A detailed analysis has been done.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498619347778928661/609396365763543060/Warlock_vs_Mage_dps_comparison_v1.3.pdf) Thankfully, I won't ask you to eat your hat.
---
There are some BoP.
---
Specifically the pre-raid BIS for mage and warlock are like this. I believe you can buy the recipe, but you must have tailoring to equip it.
---
For warlocks at least, they "need" tailoring into P2 as well because their actual BIS set (Bloodvine) requires tailoring 300 to get the set buff.
---
Hahaha didnt think anyone was gonna see this comment
---
Like I keep saying. Server discords are cancer and if you want to actually talk to people you add them in-game or guild server anyway.
---
Just practice what customisation options you want before you delete (there really aren't that many, won't take long). That way you can delete, already know what you're making, and the name should only be stealable for 20-30 seconds tops.
---
Only being half full to start with so like forcing a unnecessary tinkle trip to the bathroom u feel me
---
I thought it saved the position in browser cookies, seems to be bugged, the easy solution is don't sleep.
---
OK. So I'm not the only one who pops a ZQuil and turns on MadSeasonShow and falls asleep to his "Remember when..." Classic videos.
---
Nah this was great. Well done
---
This is kind of annoying since clouds tend to drift. The farther the cloud goes the higher my ping gets which can be an issue for me since i live in a very windy area.. blizzard please go back to physical servers...
---
Min. 30% bc of runspeed
---
Probably pve and pvp on the side. Not sure yet classic is a different beast i’m Not sure if I have time to pve raid, but i’m A midcore raider in retail
---
Twitch app is still not my choice for updating addons - some of them get updated to the retail versions which often are not compatible with the Classic client. I wish they'd just let you choose the game version for the addons manually.

How do people just constantly throw this "fact" out without zero plausible evidence.

Most of the people I know are already subbed.

That and the manual way doesn’t sync your add is between your different computers. Really happy with the twitch app for this.

---
You can listen to the limitless number of idiots who claim that's not the case. They would be wrong. Horde as always been favored. 
---
"extra quests" and "lore" is not the same as horde's extra world buffs and their shorter proximity to gather them.

---
When did that get removed? Sitting was always 100% crit back then. I killed lots of poor drinking fools.
---
Yes it is
---
It’s not about DPS, it’s about jumping the threat level to make the mob focus on you. Intimidation is high threat ability that immediately pulls aggrieved off anyone, even a tank.
---
wait you serious :)? did you ?
---
If only they were old enough. Though I've got one who likes watching me play games... She wishes I'd play Stardew Valley more. Maybe I can convert her.
---
I never played any MMOs' before and I though all my progress will get saved... Wouldn't you want to as well, considering you're paying like £10 per month, open beta or not you payed for the game.
---
You can't really proc it by sitting. It's possible to abuse the batching window to fool the server into thinking you were standing when the crit really happened while you were sitting, but it's really impractical and unreliable.
---
Reckoning is pretty much not a leveling build in classic unless you're really stubborn and determined to make it work at any cost.
---
You really don't need a guide to do some basic math. You're not subhuman garbage because you read a guide, but don't pretend this basic stuff is impossible without it.
---
Why not take vacation days?
---
For pve then orc or human superior choice. Tauren is great for pvp with their hit box.
---
Accept the future
---
How hard is it to gear up a rogue? I’m a midcore raider but I’m not sure if I have time to compete with gear hence why I skipped warrior
---
You are right that the vanilla can never happen again. But I don't think anyone ever expected it to. Information was not readily available back then so even our understanding of the game is completely different. You can never recreate the past.
---
Brit here who hasn't really played WoW - my plan is actually pretty much the opposite. 
---
Get a shit sleep on Sunday and wake up early Monday. Go for a lengthy nap Monday evening and be ready to go about 22:30. Crank launch just to be a part of it, then switch over to Oceanic when my best friend finishes work and spend the rest of Tuesday playing with him. 
---
Can't wait!
---
So due to the weapon skills you create more threat or why do humans create more threat?
---
He's not asking at all for Gearscore, what are you on about? Gearscore is counting ilevel. He's asking for stat weights, similar to Pawn.
---
Thunder Bluff is green tho. It's like the place we lived for hundreds of thousands of years. Way more comfortable.
---
It's better to be shot out of a cannon than squeezed out of a tube.
---
Illidian dies at the end of BT, thrall never resigns, Garrosh gets murdered in the middle of the night.
---
Pretty sure it wasn't in Vanilla. I heard plenty of people saying it wasn't in the Beta. No specific source though.
---
Because someone is hogging the joint!
---
&gt;Seeing it like this it makes a good argument for respeccing if you need at lvl 45 or 50 to something more optimal
---
This is the first point, the second being that your first handful of respects are very affordable. If you're not swapping willy nilly, it's very much an amount of money that won't impact buying a mount.
---
We're talking 1-2 respecs here. Not 10.
---
This is comedy  especially followed by the cata talent image.
---
This was posted less than a week ago.
---
&gt; **If I'm using this key to tag a mob as fast as it spawns, might I get banned?** 
---
Yes. Not because of the macro, but because of "Toggle Auto-Repeat" which basically pushes the button/macro for you.
---
General rule is: 1 button press = 1 action.
---
Will you get banned for it? Most likely not, because a somewhat simple and small thing like that is hard to detect, if not flat out impossible. But fact is, if they saw you doing it, it would be considered botting and you'd get banned/warned.
---
i believe the cloak breaks AFTER cast not before unlike a lot of other things. which is what made it unique.
---
What makes you choose HPally?
---
Nope. Gonna devour junk food like frostmourne devouring souls.
---
NO CHANGES REEEEEEEEE
---
I never said there wasn’t a market for names.
---
I’m saying the market prices don’t warrant a botnet that would cost 15$ per name when the success rate of bot sniping can’t be more than a few % and the names that would sell aren’t going to cover the cost of names that won’t sell/ never get sniped.
---
Waking up at 06:00 isn't normal but apart from that, yeah for sure. Fuck giving up sleep for anything, that shit is sacred. Might try to get in at 00:00, see a 10k queue for the lowest pop pvp realm, and just go to bed.
---
Why did they bump this up anyway during TBC?
---
Just keep spamming arcane shot
---
Settings game install/updates just change the folder bro shit.
---
Feign Death and Cheetah are pretty valuable
---
Yup. Popular because of their pvp shenanigans, and welcomed in raids.
---
Mobility. The one thing locks never had in vanilla.
---
&gt; Mind blast may not be worth it if you are locked out of holy in pvp.  
---
Ok, so even if you can't cast from Holy, Mind Blast is just not worth the mana? I also forget that Mana Burn was Shadow school so I could cast that while locked as well.
---
&gt;  game that is centralized around leveling and making money
---
It's not though. The very vast majority has always played WoW for it's endgame
---
You have to repair after dying once?
---
True.
---
I had friends and guildies ask if stress test characters would get saved, really fuckin surprised me
---
I think what OP is trying to say is that nobody will post on classicwow because they will be too busy with the game.
---
Not particularly. Like they're welcome, they have a niche role in raids, but you're not really any more or less loved than other healers.
---
Yeah you will get prompted to choose a directory when you install any Blizz game from the launcher.
---
Ahhh shit my heart!
---
There is a show in Gothenburg also next year, that's atleast closer than britain

Retailers just don't want Retail's current slow death to accelerate.
---
Those "NO" posts are simply defensive mechanisms for people who don't want their game to die.
---
These people think fun is zero-sum, otherwise why would they bother posting about a game they never intend on playing?
---
Alright, that make sense I suppose.
---
Would be cool if they instead of releasing tbc, kinda forked off instead.
---
Whew thalnos is staying at high. Glad so many people are afraid of the br community which is a non issue.
---
Nop
---
Quality talent spec..
---
Hi dense! Im confused.
---
The rule is one action per toon per keystroke.
---
Multiboxing 20 toons? Each one jumps when you press space. Thats fine.
---
1 toon jumping all night from 1 button not fine. 
---
Or in this case, casting shadow bolt. If he's going to be at his keyboard doing this he will pry never be caught. But is it bannabe, still yes.
---
Yeah they've already basically confirmed that TBC and WOTLK will follow.
---
&gt; you payed for the game.
---
The game that's not only free, but hasn't been released yet?
---
&gt;I can't wait to see the SM runs where the Humans run away at low health and pull a whole other pack of mobs, lol. 
---
You mean like they do in Tol Dagor and Siege of Boralus?
---
I'd argue dwarf if you're going survivability, their base hp is slightly higher than other alliance races and stoneform has its uses.
---
Human weapon skill is however an advantage for threat generation, so it's also a good choice.
---
Nelf has higher agility which offers slightly more dodge as well.
---
Most was holy as it seemed to be superior choice but now with better knowledge of the game most will be disc.
---
It's all about walking from a to b while killing mobs on the way.
---
Thanks for the feed back!
---
I had another baby two weeks ago. We're so busy raising a toddler and a newborn that there's no time to waste! Until Classic releases and I'm on parental leave muahahahaha
---
You can save time by right clicking and rotating your character 180 degree too  , lol atleast that's what I did for the shed guy in human starting zone fk that queue
---
took me like 10 minutes to copy paste his thing and adjust it to my likings and class
---
There is a small amount of hope that i will log on to find out someone at blizzard accidentally switched the servers on early...
---
I get off work at 4.30 pm on August 27th. I am so fucked.
---
Literally no friends that game with me so no.. 🙈
---
solution seems to be to uninstall first then install it again because I was trying to just move the folders since I already had it installed and they were both under the same main folder and the game was forcing them to be linked
---
My friends and I were seniors in hs when wow came out. My most hardcore friend played even at school (he was one of the lucky ones with a nice laptop) and he was always embarassed by it. I never cared about "popularity", but he did, and boy did people make fun of us for playing wow. By this point games werent just for nerds, with sports, racing, and fps games really taking off, but wow, that was for nerds. Even the cool guys with ps2s and xboxes and their madden, gta, battlefield, and need for speed games knew we were losers for wasting so much time in a cartoony fantasy game lol. I never minded but I know it tore my buddy up inside.
---
Wireless multi button mouse and do some exercise after a couple of hours while still playing.
---
İf you go to work in a train or something, you can play on the way. 
---
Also if your work is in an office that you get some free moments, perhaps you can play at work. 4 years ago when nostalrius was a thing , I leveled an alt to 40 just playing at work :D
---
Yeah arms warriors were always the worst. You’d dodge, which triggers their overpower, which usually leads to getting pwned
---
Thx bro
---
This trinket with mithril spurs on a PVP server are either a god-send to catch your PVP prey; and/or escape your predator.  :)
---
Old boots, equip the spurs, and change out when riding.  
---
But I won't tell you how many times I healed MC with the mithril spurs on.  :)
---
"But guys, I want Classic for the cooommmmunnnittttyyy!"
---
I know a few groups of people who will play WoW (about 50 in total) and only a handful of them are currently subbed, like 4 or 5 out of 50. I asked around and got similar numbers from others as well. I assume it's a large enough pool of people to take some conclusions out of it.

Pretty sure that’s what I pay blizzard 13€ for each month...
---
Prep cold blood rogue with cooldowns kills warrior without them landing a hit.
---
Disc is indeed a thing. You want 1 disc priest in the raid to provide the divine spirit buff. Other than that it's typical for the other priests to be holy.
---
Swift Zulian Tiger is the only thing that makes me sad about moving to classic from retail. I love that I have it and others don’t.  I farmed a ton and won’t so lucky in Classic lol.
---
Anyone have the youtube link to that one classic wow hype video that has some of the Hurricane videos mixed in? I can't seem to find it
---
I see huntets try and tag with serpent sting.  Thanks for help killing my mob.
---
The respec costs start at 1g and go up to a max of 50g with everytime you respec. Your level doesn't matter.
---
That’s a fine thing to want imo lol
---
Weapon skill means you get parried/dodged less. More actual hits on the mob = more threat
---
I did read it and thank you so much for the amazingly kind words!
---
We will be able to play what we want, how we want. From a specific class and talent build to how fast
---
one wants to level. There will be many who won’t share a specific style and playing configuration. There will be many who do. It may take little time to find the group and community that matches what a specific person is looking for, but they will most definitely be there.
---
Yes the weapon skill racial is god like.

I have like 12 addons installed but my Twitch App just shows 2. It also says it's up to date, but the addon has a newer version to be downloaded. Seems a bit buggy?
---
I'd rather have TBC than whatever bullshit ideas you have
---
Yeah, that doesn’t work on geared warriors so well. Unless you got a link to a video of a rogue killing a warrior with 5k health without him even getting a swing in, I’d like to see it.
---
Please do look for me at Blizzcon, I’ll be there and will organise drinks for Classic fans :)
---
but classic is all about *com-m-m-m-unitey* no?
---
Read the lore books or listen to some of the old lore podcasts.
---
&gt; If you agree with that premise (MoD is only to counter other Rogues/Druids, preventing them from finding you)
---
Oh, I always put points in MoD to make sneaking around npcs easier so I guess it doesn't really apply.
---
I stopped playing after a dude in the starting zone had heirloom shoulders+helm and zipped past me on his mount. Fucking insane.
---
There isn't a lot of that stuff in game, bit it's stuff like this that makes me love Vanilla. Same with that "quest" in Loch Modan to open the Burning Steppes gate.
---
HYPE
---
He's talking about getting a subscription on the day. If that's bad it will only be bad for the people that didn't sub in advance.

Hunter is slightly faster due to Cheetah 30% run speed at level 20. Warlock has nothing til 40 so lots of walking.

The idea that in any shape or fashion this wasn't done because theres money in it in terms of player retention is silly. THAT SAID I get that the developers love doing this, so its also something good for the company for its developers etc. but I don't buy for even a remote second this is done as a charity in any sense. Nost was shut down, they saw its active playerbase and realized 15$ a month, for that many heads were worth it.
---
That they havn't increased the price, is something entirely different but considering the content its just about a fair considering that people already pay money for the expansion packs every other year as well.
---
it is a company, nothing more and nothing less to me.
---
No thanks, I'm 27 years old with no pre-existing conditions so i'll enjoy my week off with takeaways, beer and energy drinks. 
---
However I've sent this info over my to 72 year old grandfather so thank you.
---
Concidering the changes. I am suddenly curious if you left him in the bank? 
---
Then 13 years later he comes back and the bank is now the throne room with Sylvanas in a different form and acting as Warchief.
---
Stretch your hip flexors.
---
Why the hell is he wearing heirlooms then
---
What do you base that 30% on? I'm looking for insights because I've got no clue what the ratio could be.
---
It's not that it's not the best solution to the problem, it's that it kills the immersion and community aspect that many people liked about vanilla WoW. Hell most people didn't even want x-realm BGs.
---
Literally every video i can find.
---
Grobbulus discord has reached level 3 as a Discord server and now has its own dedicated URL! http://discord.gg/grobbulus
---
That's correct. Thorium shells can also be traded to an NPC for the arrow version
---
It's okay, I have a rich sugar daddy to fulfill all my needs and desires. 
---
He's called Tyrone
---
Because Shazz server is full of retail kids and trolls.
---
Most of the people I'll be playing with played Vanilla, some bc or wotlk at max and haven't touched WoW since. We're coming back literally only because of classic. I think a lot of players are like that and I feel like some of those who argument adamantly against Classic forget that people like me exist in large numbers.
---
Nothing really worth the time since you'll be going for these anyways for hit cap. But I read that as a Rogue you should be able to solo them, just need skinning. I would recommend taking skinning in any case for gold while leveling.
---
I'm a workout maniac, 6-8 workouts per week of calisthenics/lifting and rowing. I struggle with back pain that comes and goes. Have been able to have it occur much less often since I began doing one particular exercise( also helps when you are feeling backpain and just want relief).
---
 The exercise is \*drumroll\*: Dead hang
---
 Basically what I do now is after every workout I hang with straight arms from a pull up bar for around 4 minutes or so. I have very strong grip so ends up being 2 hangs. If you haven't trained your grip much though and have some fat on you don't expect to be able to hang for that long. Can start with like 30-45 seconds and then take a break for a minute or so and go hang again. Try and get at least 2 minutes total time.
---
  Pretty much what a dead hang does is stretching out your back. It makes a huge difference.
---
Yeah I'm planning the same as the OP, I'm definitely gonna need something extra to help fall asleep on that night for sure.
---
Was RealMobHealth working during the stress test? I’d heard mixed results
---
You forgot the /s
---
I think they do.  It's not the same list of stuff when you swap between classic and standard.
---
Yeah I'm fairly new to the role so I don't want to take the piss
---
Please don't.
---
Never again.
---
tauren's hitbox is a double edged sword, you also get hit from further away. orc is probably better because of hardiness and blood fury.
---
Hello fellow doomer :(
---
naxx is the currently planned last phase as it was in vanilla. However we have no idea what blizzard will do if anything after that. TBC servers seem likely if classic goes well.
---
I perfer to rush concecration in holy and then go to retri tree as the increase in strength, able to heal in a pinch and even more able to aoe if the needed is great compare to lower levels in retri offer. Not to mention this allow you to tank dungeons if you want to.
---
Gave FFXIV 3 months. I payed for 3 month. Quit 2 months in, after I realized it is just another easy mode, MTX, instanced, cut-scene stupid ass game like any other crap that is labeled MMO today, that have zero meaning.
---
From someone rolling warrior on classic i can gladly tell you that.................
---
We suck ding balls. We are so incredibly gear dependent comboed with no survivability early means our only chance of winning any sort of 1v1 is us jumping them when they are low or hiring a personal healer making it 2v1.
---
Then you obviously don't know how humour works.
---
Anyone else just logging into the character creation screen and staring at their characters?
---
Tbh T2 and T3 sets are almost all beautiful in Vanilla. Have you seen Warrior or Shamans T3 ? Absolutely gorgeous. 
---
Horde PvP gear looks great too. Epic PvP gear on UD/orc rogue is dope, and blue PvP Horde Hunter set looks brilliant. Maybe it’s just me, but I found the set looks getting (overall) worse and worse from Cataclysm on. Maybe transmog made Blizz devs lazier ?
---
Man how did I forget about Nhym? He made me roll a belf lock and grind the merciless gladiator gear because my 15 year old self thought that he was so cool
---
Rose tinted posters and rude awakening posters btfo.
---
They have videos I watched during vanilla.
---
No they wont i guess. But i thought about that too.
---
To be fair, I do understand where you’re coming from, and I would have said something relatively similar a year ago. I’ve tried to tone down the behaviour you’re talking about. I don’t believe I talk at my guests, it’s definitely always been a discussion, but I know what you mean about the game show thing. Doesn’t happen anywhere near as much these days. Thanks for checking out the show when you did, and I appreciate the constructive criticism.
---
I don't disagree with you. I'm saying that starting with layering and then removing it later only harms the server (in my opinion). Either have it and keep it, or don't have it at all.
---
I'm sure it will be cross-realm, that's probably deeply rooted in the game. Not sure whether or not it will be cross+-language, but I assume so.
---
most likely they will roll out BC servers and then WoTLK servers, i would say 80% of the fanbase would be happy with that progression, and they will also maintain pure vanilla servers for the diehards.
---
Just wanted to reach out on behalf of &lt;Hillsbrad Heroes&gt;, and see if you might be interested in joining the &lt;HH&gt; family!  You seem like someone (well, a group of ppl) who might be a good fit for the guild, and hopefully the guild a good fit for you (guys), also.  We have a recruitment post in this thread, but rather than have you search for it, I’ll simply share that post with you here first, and encourage you to check out our link to the website at the bottom.  But please also feel free to DM me with any questions you might have!
---
First of all: Gold is practically worthless in classic, unless you want to do twink pvp.
---
Second: It's up to blizzard to maintain classic wow, not the community. IT doesn't matter if you report people if blizzard doesn't punish them in a meaningful way.
---
Human is the best choice if you are mix/maxing PVE tanking. The extra threat and hit is superior to the dwarf's racial.
---
You better get to work on that farm then! You have to be a good role model until release.
---
I'll just double up on Adderall.
---
Reassuring.
---
Shoutout to “countdown to classic” podcast. Some of the best material leading up to aug 27th. The rogue segment this past week was hilarious.
---
Easy solution: grind level in Azshara
---
I was gonna play casually as well, take my time, not grind too hard, etc.
---
For some reason, I looked up how to complete Atiesh and the Scepter of the Shifting Sands earlier.
---
Goddamnit classic.
---
Haven't had the same luck as you, unfortunately.
---
I'm gonna play pala so I guess I'm gonna do a power nap when I'm infight...
---
I know the thread. Electriclava is summarizing the wall of no in a way that seems to be pro classic. Of course you get responses like "Vanilla sucked, The End" from Kabookie, but just wanted to point it out because Electric's name and guild are pretty visible so it wouldn't be hard to find him, and the meme makes him look like a advocate of the wall of no. I could be wrong and he might have been posting it to the forums for people to flame, but meh I'm not reading his comment history lol.
---
That's unfortunate timing. My masters starts on the 29th of September so I've got roughly a month to play at least.
---
At the start they are o.k, but in later phases their damage falls much lower than all other specs. As it's pretty much the only spec in the whole game that doesn't actually scale properly (due to the pet). A lot of guilds will pretty much not allow you to raid as BM.
---
What? Source?
---
Classic didnt have cross realm bgs and hopefully this doesnt either
---
Grinding dungeons like it's a bad thing. The main thing I actually loved about legion was M+ just because I could grind  dungeons all day carrying keys. Now I can just run dungeons all day for pre-raid bis.
---
Any class if it's an Orc.
---
This.  It was a coordinated effort to herd people to the RMT-owned discords.
---
Ensiferum is my go to gaming music
---
For a lot of people the content from 1-60 was just filler till you could raid and pvp at 60. People on here like to imagine that's just a modern wow thing, but it was very much a common refrain in vanilla that "the game begins when you hit level 60."
---
I mean, I'll enjoy leveling to 60 once, after that it's just gonna be something so I have to do.
---
I'd bet against that. Most raiders in retail won't stop raiding because of classic. They'll play classic in their free time and raid a few times a week.
---
I guess they could add some kind of seasons for the fresh wipes idea, like in diablo but something that let's you keep your max level toons.
---
like I said both folders were linked together. Solution was to uninstall classic then install and select a different folder
---
intellect is actually really handy for warriors, rogues and hunters because it will allow them to level their weapon skill proficiencies faster.
---
Ye it sucks. Not sure what this vid was trying to say
---
I wish I could see where they're coming from, but every time I play classic I have a great time.
---
Go figure.
---
this appreciation is hilarious to me, I fucking love coming.
---
You can start collecting healing gear while still continuing to level as enhance just start picking some of the healing centric options instead of the enhance options and holding onto random greens with healing stats. You could also buy some basic gear of the auction house if you get stuck. 
---
There are also more quests you can complete at max level to start to fill in missing slots. 
---
It would be a good idea to keep a full healing set while leveling anyway as you’ll want it to heal leveling dungeons, which you can do as enhance (while leveling).
---
My most beloved BC item. Fond memories. Also finding 9 eggs in one session...

You could definitely do one that's a lot more space efficient, but my goal was specifically to have that 7/7/5/3 layout that the G13 has.

You get a decent chunk of xp from the hand ins actually, if you're playing nothing but bgs I remember getting from 56 to 58 rather fast.

With a warlock/hunter/mage, some mechanical skills and a good leveling route you can probably get to lvl 60 in around 5 days played. 10 days played for both characters. That's 1/3rd a month. Play for 8 hours every day for a month and you will have two 60s.
---
This is what I'm hoping for.
---
Yeah, but generally the user side of the app is very bad at providing that information or checking if the addon we downloaded is compatiable with the game version we're downloading it for (it doesn't do this at all).  You can't just click 'download' like you would with BFA addons.  Instead you have to click on the addon, go to version, find the one that says classic, and download that and hope it does a good job at updating to that version..
---
I'm not taking part in any more flamin threads/comments I dont' want to get banned from this subreddit.  Play what you want, gl in classic.
---
So what shifts in Meta do you see, if you keep in mind the 14% percent parry, krit debuff, etc. ?  
---
Following question: What classes, specs, do you see being more valuablue ?  
---
I am searching for quite a while now, but i don't find an answer for following question:  
---
Are there gonna be some specific spell buffs, or debuffs, for any class, in for balancing reasons  and/or making some specs more viable ?
---
Ive been on pvp servers 80% of my time throughout the years but man.. RP-PvP are crazy underrated. Id definitely consider it
---
Is there a site for playing around with equipping gear on your char to see the stats?
---
There are many blues better than epics in classic wow. Robe of winter night vs any t1 robe is a good example.
---
Imo, the only ones that have a bit of truth going on are the ones saying that the new players won't enjoy it. I think a fair part of people who never played vanilla won't stick to it without all the Quality of life improvements and all that. Basically, people who fell in love with a more recent version of the game will have a harder time on the long term
---
Who cares?
---
Short answer is nobody knows and Blizz hasn’t said
---
I mean, for some people it will definitely end up just being nostalgia, and you know what, that's okay. People change, and if Classic WoW isn't enjoyable to you even though Vanilla was it's okay to stop playing. Just don't try to ruin other's enjoyment because of it.
---
Personally I think we've basically got 4 groups about to play Classic:
---
1. Retail tourists - people who never played Vanilla and will have to decide whether or not Classic is for them
---
2. Pure nostalgia - people who thought what they wanted was Classic, but it turns out for them it was just nostalgia
---
3. Vanilla lovers - people who have playing on Vanilla private servers for a while and have decided it's the best version for them
---
4. Hybrids - This right here is going to be the biggest group really, people who have a mix of enjoying vanilla and nostalgia. Maybe some of them will stick around full time, but I expect they'll be in and out as the mood hits them/when phases drop
---
The important thing is that as long as nobody's trying to ruin your fun, and you're not trying to ruin anybody else's fun (looking at both sides here) play how you want, and for whatever reason you want.
---
Yeah, it's sad but that's how the world and statistics works.
---
There are hundreds of thousands of people waiting for this. It's almost certain sadly.
---
Why would you seek out a server discord for some kind of Q&amp;A?  Just Google that shit, all the information you could ever need for any class or spec in Classic is easily available without the extra step of finding a server discord *then* finding the info you need.
---
It just makes no sense, as any given discord isn't going to have all the info you might want or need, you're better off just using a search engine.
---
8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of work, 8 hours of WoW. That must be that "work-life-balance" everyone is talking about
---
Every single person I know who is playing is someone who quit before legion. Most of them quit right after cata. 
---
In what would do these posters live in where someone will dislike classic wow and then immediately go to the “””real””” game where it’s stupid-level easy and has so much content (in terms of playable hours), but it’s all so bad that it makes it not even worth pursuing.
---
what if we could just... i dunno, fly around the world? that would make our so much easier
---
Naxx boss solidarity
---
The anticheat only detects programs that LATCH onto the WoW client. Everything else is protected by your computers firewall. A mouse software program is the same as mouse clicks from your mouse, they cannot detect this. I am literally using it right now in retail and im not banned. You just need to open up a onscreen keyboard and have the mouse click the inputs on the on-screen keyboard for you.
---
It is a joke. People always say pvp is the true classic experience, however there have always been pve servers making either statement invalid. 
---
But there many types of players, including us “a bg here or there but fuck getting ganked all the time when i can only play 4-6hours a week.”-type of people.
---
I'd say more than once could be considered "keep" ackshually.
---
a: Your sense of humor sucks.
---
b: The fact you analyzed this shit post to death and then responded like a fucking robot to my comment is just awkward and I hope you're less socially inclined irl.
---
House of chickens pvp server
---
Classic wowhead has this exact tool
---
Correct. Only amendment i would make is there are a few safe zones on a pvp server you can /off and not be killed if you want (starting zones &amp; capitol cities)
---
Time to rewatch all of madseason

---
I think it'd have a bit to do with both. A lot of people still play retail despite those complaints because there's nothing else to play.
---
Haha.. you have no idea... Ive been on a boat in Alaska for the past 100 days.. I have one week left and will be home hopefully right when classic wow launches... Haven't seen civilization in a long time..
---
No.
---
100% wrong in utility build.
---
it does affect PvP realms as well. If you are sitting in a "safe" area, like your home city or leveling area, then the other faction cannot attack you, but you can attack them. If you attack them, you will get PvP flagged. Once PvP flagged, the other faction can attack you at will.
---
I'm in a bunch of discords and essentially every 'community' discords are exactly like that.  The smaller ones dedicated toy gaming groups are just fine but basically every large discord turns into a shit festival
---
You can't reset like you would vs a rogue because mages can block your trap and just keep pressuring you before you can get to 40m
---
lol alliance arent the good guys dude
---
Totally possible, although my eyes might fall out of my skull if I did 60’s in a month. Takes a bit of time / grinding
---
Nah not at all. The previous blue post already addressed the fact that a modern Medium server is larger than the biggest original Vanilla servers, which had a very vibrant player base. When I think back on my Vanilla days, I’d rather play on a server with 150% of the normal population than one with 400%.
---
Nope, raids are hard, don't worry about it
---
We'll see.
---
Either they:
---
\- Take the servers down some time before the launch.
---
\- Let us sit at character screen and then get booted of the server as they go down/restart them.
---
\- Be able to sit at the character screen and just hit enter world at launch.
---
confirmed that no unarmored versions will be available
---
never underestimate the ability of people to fuck up
---
Noobs

I love me some Ocarina of time. That one game totally justified a 3ds.

Because nobody knows what I like and enjoy more than some random stranger on the internet!
---
You can login into your account. This will lead you to the server select screen.
---
You will see the servers but they will be in grey (because they are still offline).
---
You can sit on that window for aslong as you want waiting for them to go live. When they go live the servers will turn green and you can enter to create/select a character and then play.
---
IF There will be queues, there will be two of them.
---
Queue 1 to even login into your account.
---
Queue 2 to enter the selected server.
---
Needless to say: You should login early into your account to skip that first queue.
---
It is always on if you roll pvp. On pve servers you must check it manually.
---
They aren't buffing stats. Raids will definitely be easier since they're mechanically much, much, simpler than what today's playerbase is used to (also people generally know the fights, etc.)
---
Being able to get to the point where you’re raiding on a level 60, a level 70 and a level 80 would be awesome. It would be a shit load of work but you’d be on their servers and paying them monthly.
---
Is there a MoveAnything addon working for classic?
---
Similar experience. I played classic when I was in like 6th or 7th grade and it was definitely a social stigma even to people who gamed a metric fuckton. Had friends I couldn't convince to play with me despite them putting 1000s of hours into runescape or morrowind because of this

It is 100% relevant to whose responsibility, that’s the point of the post.

I pick up trash, my degree is in biology, pretty big fan of nature. But when I’m in a place I pay to be in, I expect that the place is attended to by owners in some fashion.
---
No, not really. There is rp element to gender face etc., they make for more immersive experience. Realm name just sounds cool, which doesnt add anything.
---
Druid is a monster at leveling and as feral you can tank any 5 man no problem. I actually was in a raiding guild back in the days of retail classic that had a feral druid MT. It works, but this guy was hardcore and scoured the world for just the right items to make it work. It's not for casual play.
---
can't dual wield 2Hs in classic
---
Ooo, I had completely forgot about roguecraft. Thanks.
---
Warchief's room is default location for all boosted characters - so maybe all characters, that are in locations that are being changed, due to patches, are flagged to spawn there.
---
*Screaming in shared sympathy*
---
Raids will be very easy, yes. No, they are not buffing them.
---
Also doesn't help that we have full debuff slots and 1.12 itemization.
---
What else do u want from them? Like stop whining about everything Jesus christ
---
Not trying to scare you away from Shaman but make sure you're ok with having to manage a bunch of totems before rolling one. Some people find it tedious.
---
TBC was cool in many ways, but in many other ways it did a lot of damage to the game aswell.
---
First of all, I agree that it was really cool walking through the dark portal for the first time seeing this "new world". However, as soon as the novelty of Outlands was gone, having these two separate worlds (Azeroth and Outlands) turned out to be a huge mistake in my eyes. Outlands made Azeroth old and irrelevant, thus giving max level players almost no reason to be in the old world anymore. That's very, very bad in my book.
---
Second, flying really ruined how the entire game used to work. I have to agree with the other guys who replied to your post, flying was definately a huge mistake and should never have been in the game. To me, flying is the first big step towards the entire "convenience"-thing that Blizzard over the years has implemented in the game which so many people dislike today. Flying allows for players to skip absolutely everything and head straight to their goal (be it matherial gathering, heading to some instance, finding opponents in the open world, etc.) and that's just not how World of Warcraft should be played. Sure, some players (maybe a lot) most likely disliked having to spend time going from A to B on a ground mount, but that's part of the game!
---
Third, Blizzard throwing the towel on faction balances: Giving horde paladins and alliance shamans was also a huge mistake. I'll admit that I know absolutely nothing regarding how hard it must be to make balances like this, however, I personally would much rather play a version of WoW where one of the factions might be slightly better because the balancing is a bit off, than a version where Blizzard says "Fine, we give up - we choose the easy and fast way to make people stop complaining and make all classes available to both factions". The two factions are different, and there should be a visible difference between them (not just racial spells). This, to me, is the start of the terrible idea that "all classes should be the same and able to do the exact same thing in a raid". 
---
Those are the three biggest mistakes in my opinion. TBC did a lot of good to the game aswell:
---
The classes were much better balanced than they were in vanilla, and pretty much all classes and specs were viable to play (I can't remember this 100 % - there might have been a couple still not optimal for PvE, but it was much closer than it was in vanilla). 
---
The instances were absolutely awesome. Karazhan: AMAZING. Zul'Aman: AMAZING, one of my favorite instances of all time. Serpentshrine Cavern, The Eye, Mount Hyjal and Black Temple were all really, really good aswell, but the crown jewel was definately Sunwell Plateau - in my opinion there's never been a raid that could compete with SWP. It was perfect. And these were just the raids; the dungeons were generally really cool aswell. 
---
All in all, I think TBC did more harm than good to the game. TBC started the entire "all previous content is irrelevant" and "we need to make the game convenient and easy for everyone"-philosophies which really did a lot of damage that Blizzard hasn't been able to revert.
---
You’d just have to delete one of your Herod names, and then try out the combinations you want on Stalagg. It’s be a low chance of someone taking your names on either server in that 10 minute window, unless your name is Thrall.
---
Bit of ESO, going on a second date with a girl I like, work and playing heroes of the storm with friends
---
No, they opted not to include the unarmored mounts, in the interest of not creating a time gated reward, since players back then did not know those mounts would be removed.
---
Erm no
---
The discords are all a disaster. The two firsts main discords for Herod imploded when one turned out the admin was modding e-thots in return for pics and the other the mods kept undermining eachother because they couldn't agree on rules and it came out it was controlled by proxy by the first guy. I left both because of the shit shows and idk if I will even return to them on launch. Better off without.
---
BC raids were great though, it was flying and daily quests that started the downward spiral.
---
Unluckily (or really luckily for the world) being the NEET type of nerd still isn't mainstream
---
On pservers the tryhards were blasting through MC within the first week and would complete a full run in about 1-2 hours,
---
So yeah, mechanics wise classic raiding is like driving a Volvo from 1970 compared to a Lamborghini (retail raiding)
---
For prime time, its completely reasonable to have hundreds of people fighting over the entrance to MC.
---
Its not like there is much else to do.

---
it is not against ToS to own two accounts to play both factions on the same server.  I'm not sure on transferring stuff between the two sides, though.
---
Good point, was just saying that it wasn't the addon creator's fault since they can set the appropriate version on their releases. Hopefully the Twitch App will actually check for the correct version some day soon..
---
I’m personally excited for the return of the Barov Peasant Caller.
---
Because it isn't a server specific subreddit?  I wouldn't go and join the Herod discord then wonder why no one is talking about Grobbulus when I actually play on Stalagg.
---
Mostly because I'm fucking bored.  Once the game is out, I'll have zero reason to use this sub, as I'll be you know, playing the game.
---
That's because there's a direct correlation between exercising and having a fast reaction time.
---
You've been i*n a coma...*
---
Seems like a no brainer. In no scenario is 4 PvP servers going to be to many after tourists leave. It's like 16k people. Obviously for the whole of Europe there's going to be that many people playing on English speaking servers in phase 2.
---
 I wrote some time ago that I thought 6 English speaking PvP servers would have been appropriate. Stand by that. 24k people phase 2 is hardly crazy to assume.
---
Doing some meal prep so I’m not eating like shit for launch week. pasta salad, lasagna, chicken and rice, chilli. Then I’m gonna load up a bin of clif bars and other various “healthier” snack bars. Got a 8L jug of water that has a tap. I think I’m set
---
No reason, in the original song it's 5 golden rings. I thought Molten and Golden sounded pretty close making it more fun to sing-a-long
---
I bought a DP to VGA adapter so I can play on a 4:3 aspect ratio monitor for the full nostalgia effect.
---
Mostly because my wife has been trying to get me to throw it out for years and I just need a "I told you I'd use it" moment. Originally bought as a panel for an arcade machine that never got built, can't bring myself to pitch it since 4:3 LCD monitors aren't exactly common.
---
I personally enjoy having a red light bulb in one of my desk lamps. So I’ll sit in the blacked out room with the red light like some demonic cave dweller.
---
You can expect whatever you want. You can also leave whenever you want.
---
Or you can work to make your and everyone else's experience more positive.
---
Thankfully for me, people like you tend to just leave eventually.
---
Sitting does not work.
---
I took Tuesday off
---
Not really, I'm confident I'll be happy with my choice but if not I can always level another.
---
No it's not. Item availability is. Nice try though.
---
these people probably play rs3 too
---
its not a thing NPC vs you, but player vs player it is a thing.
---
Everyone says they’re gonna tank until they physically have to level a warrior to 60.
---
Bought account most likley
---
Quit at the end of wrath. After I killed LK I felt the storyline was done. Everything after that felt forced. Can't wait to get back
---
Anyways else notice Garrosh Hellscream?
---
only vs npc
---
I’d have paid more.
---
You can have cleave groups for something outside of dungeons you brainlet.
---
Equally important : never patronizing these services.  If theres no demand for them, they'll disappear.
---
Obviously they forgot how to count but it would be interesting to see DK, Monk, and DH transplanted into a classic setting with appropriate talent trees etc.  Not on a true Classic server of course but if they ever do these “classic plus” servers people mention.
---
Didn't expect anything else really.
---
If you roll gnome you have to make sure you have pink hair. It's always embarassing being killed by a gnome with pink hair.
---
I didnt think it would until last confirmation. We never knew the number of servers before and it seemed like they would be stuck doing it. But they’re actually willing to make herod wait for hours so whatever.
---
We need all of us alive, to slap hard the face of Activision, Blizzard and every other company that destroyed true MMORPGs.
---
A long week, indeed, but it will all worth it.
---
He may be talking about in group pvp but yeah I've played druids at 60 in pvp and it's not all lolipops like this but faerie fire is really annoying
---
Onnn the fifth day of classic my true love gave to meeee
---
Fiiiiiiiiiiiive
---
MOL

4 hour queues

3 talent trees

2 faction choices
---
And a trip hooome thanks to chroooooomieeeeeeeeeee
---
I like it, gj.
---
The thing i love about this post is the "all this work could of wen't on improving real wow" . If real WoW was so good why would they need to improve it? While i won't be one of those shitters who stoop to their level and call retail WoW trash because it does have some good aspects to it. It just feels like Diablo with slightly more players and not in a good way.
---
Not too bad, play on release, level to 10. Get a day of rested while you're at work. Come home, play until downtime, go to sleep. Wake up and start your holiday.
---
I hope you enjoy it!
---
People misunderstand what grinding means.
---
You don't grind a dungeon you do two or three tiems for a quest. Unless you're farming a specific piece of gear like Ironfoe, it's not a grind. Mythic+ is unironically the biggest dungeon grind you could imagine. Endless dungeon runs with endless gear, repeted over and over with no skips.
---
Gear is not the end all be all in raiding. I was a raid/class leader almost all my time in vanilla I raid lead casual guilds and hardcore/semihardcore guilds I have never taken a single piece of gear any other player that he would use for pve. If you have close to 100% attendance you will get gear anyway. What you need to look for is sett rules when it comes to loot no matter the system and if those rules are followed. If you don't like the rules then quit/don't join the guild. When I say that you might want to look towards a more hardcore guild what I am talking about is your attitude, best way of keeping a guild together is in my mind to have similar attitudes and goals. And to be honest your attitude probably lends itself better to more hardcore guilds.
---
Very similar situation here. Best of luck.
---
Tempted. But its easy money..
---
Orc shaman ele resto should be a hard matchup for s rogue tbh. But yeah high skilled rogues are terrific against all classes tbh
---
I can't seem to get this to download  
---
I use the Twitch App  
---
clicked all the buttons,   
---
did a search directly in twitch, can't find it
---
Will do a thorough house cleaning so i can skip doing it again for 3 weeks or so.
---
From the company making the Diablo mobile game probably, lol
---
I mean, the game isnt out yet. I don't see how anyone can say how good it will be now.
---
I know it's good on p servers, but thats not the same with layering etc.
---
How about warlocks? They cant do tribute runs but is there any alternatives for them that is better than tribute?
---
Google the requirements. They are not the same low requirements as before, classic has new higher requirements than Vanilla had. It is still relatively low reqirement.
---
Tfw you put vanilla gear on a lvl 85 character for karma
---
Man I would trade anything to be able to be a noob again in wow. I bet all of the very experienced players on here would agree - is there any experience in gaming that has rivaled your first discovery of the World of Warcraft?
---
Enjoy being a noob. Seriously.
---
I mean this problem was created by layering in the first place. You can't cram over 10k people onto one server and not have these types of issues. We will need more servers come launch day.
---
It's still a thing. Attacks against sitting targets deal critical damage. The only confusion here is about if talents like Reckoning, Enrage and Martyrdom, that proc from being critically hit, can be forced by sitting down intentionally during combat.
---
Yeah I get that, they should still change the tooltip.  I don't think there would have been confusion in the first place had it been worded correctly.  The private servers I've played on make it per hit, and I'm assuming they coded it that way because that's how it the tooltip is read :\\
---
I'll use Luna + healcomm and mouseover macros. 
---
I've seen plenty of unitframe add-ons, and healbot too, and I think clique has been updated as well - I just prefer the other option ;)
---
No it’s 11 pm on 27th, no?
---
sure hope so the more people the better for the future of classic.
---
Altough i wonder how many people (like me) just reserved there name on each pvp server
---
I have a preplanned vacation starting Thursday, so at least the work week is short. I'm going hiking upstate so getting in some outdoors time before classic comes out. Also made sure to carry that PTO into Monday!
---
I started working like few months back, I can't do that yet.
---
How condensed a time frame will all this happen in? I’m hoping that the phases for classic won’t be rolled out in quick succession.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it won't get its own section on twitch either.
---
I guess i dont have to turn my PC off for the rest of the levleing phase ;)
---
"and more open up over time"
---
I hope they dont bc/wrath us..  and just release new content for classic.
---
Fun watch.  What addon were you using to hotswap the gear?
---
He didn’t say it did
---
&gt;The private servers I've played on make it per hit, and I'm assuming they coded it that way because that's how it the tooltip is read :\\
---
You're right about that. This is most likely the reason.
---
Why not though? Wow is great. Back at the peak in wotlk you had to have a gaming PC to play. Now anyone can play and the sheer amount of people world wide with access to a functioning computer is probably double or triple.
---
Hunters, 1000% hunters more than anything
---
[From a few minutes ago…](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cs182m/blizzard_devs_reiterate_they_wont_start_phase_2/)
---
Alterac Valley is the best BG when both sides hit a stalemate and are just fighting it out in either faction's main fortress *or* when they're all fighting it out in the Field of Strife. AV is way less fun when it's just a 20 minute race to the finish.
---
Change my mind!
---
This is me. I started during BC, but raiding during wotlk. Haven't been able to enjoy an expac since then...
---
Cigarettes and Mountain Dew. Everything else is for causals
---
Exactly, so why are people being so stubborn if they just filled up stalagg now bliz would add another server and there would be no problems at launch for people willing to change servers.
---
And if u have nothing realistic to add, stop bitching. More servers means more dead servers when people leave. Merge? Who gets to keep their names? People lose names? More people leaving. But yeah, dood just add more servers derp derp
---
Uhm so I know that the desktop twitch app has a ‘mods’ tab and if you go there after tapping ‘rescan’ for locating games, there will be a little drop down box in the right side that says’ folder/blah/blah/retail’ or ‘classic’ click classic then go search for the Addons currently working :O
---
I beat the main campaign last night; It was shorter than I expected. I found the storytelling a little lacking, but I didn't run into any major A.I. issues.
---
I'm worried because 2 months of layering is already way too much (and thats a conservative take on phase 1 length).
---
Now in this interview the guy specifically says it's for the first days, so I'm crossing fingers he's telling the truth
---
You probably had retail installed, there are some shared files so classic is around 5GB on its own.

"Five a tonne ment"
---
They cant anyway, because Ion literally promised it in an interview a while back.
---
The % of people who can go back and enjoy ocarina of time is not 100%. Even some games I liked more I can’t go back and enjoy anymore. It’s the same thing with the vanilla there were just millions of people that played so if even 25% still enjoy it that’s 500k.
---
The main reason you don’t hear ‘oh it’s just nostalgia’ though is because nobody is going to a group of a million breath of the wild fans and saying ‘breath of the wild is dog shit and ocarina is the best’. The classic community is so fucking toxic about being better than retail, and vice versa. Everyone needs to chill and accept that the two games are essentially made for two different audiences.
---
Also reasonable adults, the kind capable of working at large companies making video games, are able to admit they are wrong and move on. They don’t have the super fragile ego that everyone in this sub seems to have regarding classic being the best game ever.
---
If the Tank dies at 1% there’s more than enough DPS left to kill it. If not then suddenly it’s not you, it’s the retarded DPS who didn’t watch their threat/stood in the fire.
---
I've been seeing the STV love here a lot lately,but the real war will be in the foothills
---
To be fair what i said mostly applies to huge discord gaming discords, or thats my experience.
---
Only real "healing" use for Mind Blast is to snipe killing blows in dungeons for Spirit Tap. Obviously this is for when you're leveling and still have spirit tap lol.
---
Raiding in vanilla is easy. Don't pick your race based on PvE. Pick it based on visual preference or PvP. You'll be fine in PvE.
---
Wow there are still wow noobs in 2019 thought everyone had played wow at some point by now.
---
Enhancement is on the edge of viability.  Expect only 0-1 enhancement per raid.  Expect to be required to use an axe called Nightfall.  Roll orc.  If you try-hard and have good attendance, you will almost for sure find a raid group, it will likely not be the best guild on your server.
---
I liked how Morrowind allowed you to ask about many dialogue choices in npc dialogue windows. Most were generic or repetitive, but it was immersive. And once in a while you got lucky and the same dialogue option shared by 100 npcs gave you a quest when you asked one particular npc the same thing. Great game, no hand holding like many modern games.
---
obviously classic is so poorly designed that specs can be overpowered and worthless at the same time
---
oh nice! thank you. Can you edit your addon options from that as well?
---
It's an office job, and I would love to be able to do that, however it's an open office kinda place, and I have a couple of co-workers in, and it just so happens that I got one of those worst desks, where everyone can see what you are doing on your computer basically.
---
Yeah, that's why Edgemasters are gonna cost 1-2k gold.
---
Female orc was easily the best running animation in the game with the old models
---
I just play to kill some time. And so i can decide what to level 
---
Can't wait for classic :)
---
You sure could, if you have discovered all the flight routes.
---
Woah I must have totally missed this. At Blizzcon they announced they were keeping the 16 debug limit cause it was Blizzlike. Is that changing in Classic?
---
No one knows yet.
---
Ex smoker here. Be a vape lord brother you can do it
---
You realize that you are helping to promote these sites by linking this discussion? Please don't give them anymore oxygen.

If it helps, I'm intentionally not playing on 27/28/29 at all. That weekend is for classic. Hopefully some of the issues/queues for those first few days will have died down.
---
Its times like these you learn to wow again ! Its time like these you read reddit again ! Its times like these wow and wow again !

If there are, what, 100,000+ people with names at least that’s 300,000 names taken and I’ve seen like 3 posts of this happening. This is not a large problem. 
---
I’ve also seen lots of people claim these names are worth $500, $1,000 etc but I have et to see that anyone actually PAID that much for a name. It’s like when someone is selling something on eBay for a lot of money, does t mean anyone is actually buying for that much
---
My server is full so I have no problem with this.

If you drink one with ginseng you can ramp yourself up like you're on an energy drink and can crash hard later

I make 200k in IT. Seriously if you couldn’t be bothered to set them up during the stress test and you don’t have beta access... which is now closed... then the answer is no.
---
You don't need to be a facetious asshole. There's going to be millions of more players at launch than there ever was in vanilla. This is the only fair way to handle things lest people who log in later all get fucked in the zerg rush of starting zones. Imagine a 400 person line to kill quest mobs
---
it kinda sealed the deal with me rolling orc shaman instead of tauren. I wanted to go tauren just because of looks alone, but after getting my ass kicked by a bunch of rogues on a insta 60 T2 test realm, i switched to orc and have a much better time. 
---
It wont matter if youre ele or resto or not, they stunlock you, destroy your posion cleanse totem, and searing, and then blind you and vanish. Then restart with the stunlock and by the time you can literally cast anything you will be dead. Regardless if you trinket at the beggining or not. I've only managed to win by drinking free action potion because that stuff basically makes rogues useless.
---
You fail to see the perfection that is Chad Druid.
---
Snowflake
---
You're probably better off trying to start at a weird time, like 5 AM. The people who have been sitting in queues since midnight will have given up and you can get an early start.
---
I think it also has to do with the fact that people answering questions now are a bit more hardcore into classic than the general average player will be. Those people tend to gravitate towards more demanding roles more often. Retail has always had a lack of tanks and healers even though every new expansion was a soft reset giving people the chance to reroll their class or roll. I don't see that changing for classic.
---
I think this is correct, what you describe is the other side to the "one game" problem, in which if you prefer older wow, you cant have it because bliz doesnt support older variants. Retailers dont want the game split and modern wow changed, and old school vanilla hopefuls want the version they prefer made avaliable and supported by bliz.
---
I think its still under development and maybe you're better off using it after its done? Else it would suck if your UI crashes all the time when you just want to play at launch
---
Why are people so bothered about their shitty names? If you started playing retail now you could still find a name you like when thousands are taken. Just use your brain and think of another one.
---
I for one
---
Well OldSchool Runescape is very interesting for a lot of reasons that I don't see a lot of people talking about. They have revived the classic game and have made changes to it, however none of these changes have been made without a community vote. Jagex has introduced a polling system to OSRS where every single change gets screened with the community and voted on. These polls require 75% approval to be implemented into the game. To take this even a step further the "polling booths" are actually IN-GAME at every bank and various other locations. This ensures the entire population of the game is given a chance to vote, hardcore and casual alike. In my perfect world Blizzard would commit to "Faithful Recreations" of both TBC and Wrath but leave the classic servers up and then introduce a polling system similar to OSRS. If we are really dreaming they could potentially do this on the TBC and Wrath servers as well once all of the content is rolled out. Would love to know what others think about this!
---
can you make one of those for "week 1 rag is impossible" ?
---
what do you mean?? thats like your winning move.
---
Good question! :) I guess I'll have to deal with completing my RL stuff before dedicating some extra time to Classic, which I have been waiting for a while to play. It's okay though, time management and priorities, I suppose. Too bad I can't simply skip work and not worry about consequences, because different time zones raid times! :D
---
"Of course it would be nice for anyone with access but it's just not fair". I mean you don't have to play chess you can play any balance games like league, dota or overwatch.
---
Gotta no life it but yeah. Idk how to set a reminder but I'd love to know if you actually pull it off.
---
To everyone saying it is Blizzard's job... Bruh, how do you think they will do that? At only $15 a month, with all the comms they need an AI solution to proactively moderate the game. And even Google keeps fucking up AI moderation. Why in the hell would Blizz be better than Google at AI?
---
Expect them to add it when they have the numbers in front of them.
---
Reckoning stacks can be charged while sitting only when it’s from abilities (hamstring, sinister strike, etc, nothing white.)
---
I don’t see healing as a problem, but lack of tanks could be.
---
offline server trick? can you PM the details for that at all?
---
The flips are being randomized client side, not server side, so there's 0% difference between blizzard servers and private servers.
---
IIRC someone posted a video of 13 in a row.
---
Serious q. Are you autistic?
---
I remember reading somewhere that the drown yourself trick is not working in the beta. You ghost will always spawn in Wetlands.
---
Anyway we talking about saving wut ? 10 mins ?
---
I would just run the normal way. Pick up Thelsamar's flight point and be on my way.
---
Better than drowning yourself and risking failing at it and wasting another 10mins before you decide to do the normal run.
---
First week is syllabus week so you’re good
---
depends what level you run m+ at really, high keys get my adrenaline going a lot more than running BRD for the 50th time does.
---
This will still be a thriving community on people's 2nd monitors while doing run backs from the graveyard or flying between FP's.
---
I hope Asmongold ruins every single server for you whining people.
---
You and me both! Also the outro is very catchy as well!
---
That is a little more complicated. Warlocks can farm eyes of shadow in p1 (or is it p2 because it was 1.4) on some demon elites in blasted lands or winterspring that I think gives similar gph to mara, but it's a big luck thing so sometimes you can win the lottery and get then faster.
---
Warlocks can also do mind control runs using a demon in DME. I'm pretty sure these runs earn similar gold to DMTrib runs, but are lots of fun and bring variety to your farming.
---
When Naxx comes out, Warlocks used to be able to farm trash in Naxx by kiting them around the safe central hub area. You can probably make a deal with a rogue or war to leave their char afk by you as you farm this until a Misplaced Servo Arm drops and then have them pay you $$$$ for it.
---
There are no alternatives that are way better, but you def have other options.
---
Lol right,  I played since I was 10 still far from old , done  everything have had my fun ,  but I'll be vicariously living through the noobs like and old dad or something through his children
---
The ones that ask me to subscribe  and go like their twitter and all that before the video even starts are the ones I insta dislike.
---
The TF2 intro on his latest video was great!
---
No race is significantly better at any 1 class.
---
Probably entire regions will share the same bgs
---
Phase 2 is gonna be really interesting to watch unfold. The 'Honor System' and 'PvP Gear' will be implemented, but there will be no battlegrounds until Phase 3.  
---
I suspect this will mean an insane amount of world PvP in every +50 zone, and if you haven't dinged 60 yet, and are leveling on a PvP server... Well... It's gonna be rough. Like REALLY rough.  
---
I joined vanilla wow after BG's were released, so I'm really looking forward to finally experience proper world PvP in all its glory!
---
Anyone have a few decent ideas for not terrible for you snacks? Im thinking pretzels or something.
---
its not as bad as you think. When raid bosses only drop a few items at a time and there are 40 raiders, there will always be competition for everyone.
---
i wouldn't be as concerned about competition from hunters and warriors. do be concerned about competition from other rogues. if your guild has 10 raiding rogues and they decide to bring 6... well, you can only get gear if you're in the raid.
---
forgot about this one... now i want to roll a mage again :(
---
Still linked to our accounts, time to add phones I think. We’ve moved 5x, it’s amazing we still have them.
---
Yes, the warrior was full warlord geared. He didnt get a chance to touch the rogue though, the rogue would bleed him and keep him in a stunlock while he blinded and vanished away and restarted with more stuns and bleeds
---
Bruh
---
Great advice thanks
---
Well good thing nobody is actually saying that it is then?
---
C R I N G E
---
I can definitely smell BS
---
Gonna watch it now, over breakfast.
---
assuming they dont turn off the servers
---
I feel you, I'll have to plan something similar out. :D Thanks!
---
When vanilla launched it was 8
---
This is actually true in the sense that specs are overpowered in certain contexts (random pvp skirmishes) and worthless in others (raiding).
---
As much as I want to keep the integrity of Azeroth alive in classic...getting upset about RMT in general is futile.
---
Most of the people who will be playing are adults, they have more cash than they have time to trade for keeping up with greased up basement dwellers who can’t afford to keep the AC running in the sweat cave that is their mother’s basement. There will be RMT. People will pay for an extra sub to launder RMT transactions. Just play the game for fun and enjoy it, at the very east realize that RMT will be a lot harder to pull off for these websites than it was on Private servers because of the subscription $barrier.

At this point, we should stop shitting on retail. Its just tll different of a game. Retail isnt a mmo rpg, so we shouldnt hold it to the same standards we do Classic.

Im rolling Horde this time, but when I reminisce on my alliance days, Westfall is what I'm thinking of.
---
OP is obviously being extra for karma but if you think about it, the first levels could be the most important for speed levelers. If you separate yourself from the crowd by 30-60 minutes in the first couple zones, you can keep stretching that lead. And most people definitely aren’t doing 1-10 as efficiently as they can.
---
You mad for not knowing the difinition of botting or what? Get a life
---
It kinda sucks because blizz decided to release the game so late in the year! End of August/September is the busiest time for where I work and it's already been stated that no time off will be allowed during these months. So, as much as I WANT to no life it for at least a few days, I likely won't be able to until a weekend.
---
However, I do have a lot of saved up sick days... so it would be a shame if I came down with a nasty case of ebola.

!remindme 1 week
---
Which is great! But it still isn't my duty to do anything more than I am willing to do considering its a service I pay money for. They chose what they saw as a cost effective route to do it, and as long as other players want to do it, its great. 
---
However I have no belief that it can be seen as a customers responsibility to do anything to keep the game from getting run over by spammers/hackers/sellers etc. That is the responsibility of the company as it directly correlates with subscribers. If the service ever changed, of course the argument also changes with it.
---
Possible to have 2 lvl 60s in two weeks.
---
If played right you'll race from 1-60 in under 4 days /played
---
On every flight path or crafting Q do burpee's or air squats.

Can i have a link to that trick? I really need to test some stuff before the launch

---
gl to you and your piss easy bwl runs
---
Because there's literally twice the amount of levels on live.
---
Having levels 1-60 means that mobs will scale incredibly slow.
---
Fitting an entire expansion in 10 or 5 levels means you need to scale like a god.
---
Also a reminder that most private servers have gimped stats. You will most likely level easier in classic than a private server.
---
Don't forget that in Retail there are also things like Flying Mounts that are essentially god mode buttons. You don't even need to fight through mobs, you can just drop on the objective. Or if you see an enemy coming in you can just press that one button and be 500ft in the air.
---
I think classic will be a triumph and will definitely have a good player base years down the line, that being said I still think the #nochanges memers will change their tune when they realise how easily the game could be improved with minor changes and some class tuning.
---
Yeah for sure
---
Best way to aoe farm as Mage? Does it change as you level?

Is aoe farming viable with elementalist build?

Platinum WoW? Doesn't ring a bell and I've actively searched "WoW Classic" every day for new videos for weeks.
---
This! I was really hoping to see which servers were goign to be which faction, but I guess at the same time if we HAD that information pvp realms would become horridly imbalanced and keeping a decent balance is going to be necessary for fun. Judging by the responses for alliance/horde they may damned well end up close to 50/50
---
I think he is talking about APES
---
Look up posts from 2006-2007.
---
The fact that FD fails quite a bit would be the main reason. Also knowing that you have to make your pet stop attacking, plus FD, and wait for combat to drop to do so.

---
Have you done higher content in BFA to say a statement like classic is harder?
---
Having experience in both I would say that BFA is a lot harder.
---
No one will play in the weekend....
---
You'll be too far behind. better just not play /s
---
How can you tell who is rolling where? Or is asmongold gonna be alliance and that's why.
---
I can’t freaking wait to play my 30/21 Heart of the Wild Druid and tank and heal dungeons and yes even MC!
---
But if you have zoned into Westfall wouldn't be a Westfall graveyard?
---
I kind of hate redridge. It’s beautiful and all, but the quests seem to have huge level gaps, so after westfall I often run to redridge and gain a level, but that usually puts me at 16 or 17 so I’m not ready for like 80% of redridge so I like to run to darkshore / ashenvale. But Loch Modan would be a good substitute for that!
---
I played launch archeage, queue for pro players was 6 hours min at launch and you could be kicked out at any time and be put back into the back due to server issues, or if put back in if you dc'd while playing. They didn't have queue protections for about a week. Forget f2p players, you weren't even going to play unless you went to bed in queue.
---
Oh so you mean you didn’t real my original response stating that duels were the exception.
---
Go on somewhere with your private server shit. 👌
---
It's bad because it gives you a checklist of things you 'need' from old content. Imagine if you subbed to retail and had to go through dungeons, raids and quests etc. from 7 old expansions to get a character up to speed. It was bad enough when warriors and hunters were running nighthold over and over for a year after nighthold ended for 1 trinket. Let's not forget when blizzard didn't disable the old WoD set bonuses and one of the shaman specs (i believe it was ele) was better off using an expac old tier set with 10% of the stats on it because of the tier bonus.
---
There's merit for having things that are useful and interesting, and providing a neat little bonus, but you have to either find a way to mitigate it down the line, or replace it with something better, lest it become mandatory. Replacing it with something better just moves the goalpost, rather than kill gahzrilla for a trinket that gives 3% mounted speed, you kill attumen for a trinket that gives 5%, or you kill sindragosa for a trinket that gives 10% etc. Disabling it sucks away a bit of the fun, but also helps keep little bits of powercreep here and there in check.
---
I'll probably play 10 hour days, 2 hours for my girlfriend, 4 hours for whatevs, and then 8 hours of sleep. I took a week off from work, I will probably switch to 3 hours a day when I'm back at work. 
---
Even as a kid I thought it was pretty stupid playing games for 24 hours, I really think it's best to play in moderation (even if 10 hours sounds a lot to some people)
---
Realm forums (Blizzard forums) are owned and moderated by Blizzard, there is some semblance of control by an authority figure there.  Disord is the wild west, any idiot can make one and run it however they want.  I just can't understand why someone would go to a server discord seeking information about something specific, like a class, a spec, or a gear question.  There are a million better avenues to go on, hell, a class specific discord would be an infinitely better resource.
---
Just my 2 cents, I think a server specific discord is silly and pointless, just like I thought server IRCs were silly and pointless 15 years ago.
---
You're saying that like Guilds that want to clear fast, so called "hardcore" Guilds are a bad thing.
---
But there are just people like me that have limited time and therefor need to be in a "hardcore"-Guild so i'm done raiding MC and BWL on the same evening in 3 hours.
---
No server firsts for me or min/maxing. Fun is my main goal. Thanks.
---
I would prefer to see maybe DK and DH but not monk. We don’t need 3 melee classes. Monks were a mistake
---
Don't forget the 2% glove enchant. That makes 3 items you need to swap whenever you hop on your mount. So worth it though.
---
this thread is worse than all of them
---
Living in North Korea? Because 16-year olds can get jobs. Dishwasher, stocking shelves, turning tricks in the alley, whatever.
---
or by teenagers throwing shit off the overpass
---
Obviously it does have something to do with that. If retail PvP is garbage people don't want to do it. If people don't want to do it they obviously don't queue for bgs. How the fuck is that so hard to understand? Also you have to keep in mind that in Classic theres litterally only 3 battlegrounds to choose from where in retail you have idk 8 battlegrounds or some shit as well as arena where a lot of PvPers choose to do arena over bgs.  
---
I'm arguing this because you are saying that hordes in classic will sit in 15-20 min queues and you're acting like this is going to be a common thing which it is not. At least not for the next couple of years.
---
I love these, please keep posting daily till launch.
---
The one spell off top of my head that doesnt work on them is hunters serpent sting, they are mechanical so i feel like maybe fear wont work? You are definitely right in they are immune to some things. Very annoying to a lower level haha
---
&gt; It was bad enough when warriors and hunters were running nighthold over and over for a year after nighthold ended for 1 trinket.
---
Tell me, how many min-maxers *actually* did that? Hm?   
---
The answer is "some extremely few people" and you know it.
---
&gt;Let's not forget when blizzard didn't disable the old WoD set bonuses and one of the shaman specs (i believe it was ele) was better off using an expac old tier set with 10% of the stats on it because of the tier bonus.
---
That is a game design mistake, *not* intended usefulness of old items. 
---
The carrot is (would have been) like transmog. You don't need it, ever, but if you want it you can run old content and get it.
---
You, too. Thanks!

Human Arms warrior is like a big fuck you to rogues if you are good. If you know a rogue stealth close to you, and you use perception you are 100% getting the opener. That thing was the biggest fuck you rogue button ever on live.
---
Second answer: no one know but more than likely we're going to get Classic TBC and then Classic WotLK. They're the safest easiest options. Classic+ will most likely only be on the table if classic rivals or exceeds retail in subscription count.

Are you fucking sorry?!

Yes, that's exactly what it means.

I just remember a lot of human warlocks rerolling in westfall when they hit a brick wall early on in the form of harvest golems.
---
&gt;Oldschool Runescape started as a backup of a 2007 version of the game, but Jagex decided to develop original content for it due to the game dying with no new content.

That would be better I think, the problem with TBC is that it increases level cap and gives new items making the old content obsolete.

I pvped to rank 11 or 12 on imbalanced alliance dominant server as a ele/resto shaman. So that meant instant queues and the main premade for Horde playing 8+ hours a day. I have a lot of memories of rogues jumping me. I was Tauren. Towards middle to end of vanilla, when rogues had gear, I lost more than I won, but it was close a lot. I think it would have been significantly better if I was an orc. I also noticed, the first few weeks of battlegrounds as a Tauren shaman I was a huge huge target, big and shaman was a bad combo. Alliance would charge into our group and it seemed I was the alpha target a lot.
---
I played since the Vanilla beta, and never missed a day until Cataclysm. I played for a while, but Cata was the first time I ever unsubscribed.  I came back shortly before Mists launch, then quit shortly after, and I became the "Resub for new expansion, quit for most of the expansion, come back right before the next one, etc" type of player.  From a guy who went 2004-2011 playing the game literally every day to a play/quit/come back months later cycle type of player.

Yeah, its totally because the game got better over time.

I can't dismiss "gaming chairs" because my DX Racer has done wonders for my back. I've had it for years and it's still like brand new.

Horde gets the best leveling dungeons in their protected zones though. Rfc, WC, RFK, RFD, SFK, all of SM. Thats..8 dungeons spread over 25 levels that are all in their protected zones. Its pretty crooked.

Oh well, if they dont like it they can reroll Horde

Feral dps was perfectly fine in vanilla, even more so if you're a casual player. They also bring great utility to the group. Don't let yourself be influenced so easily, diversity is one of the great things about Classic.
---
One of the greatest things about Vanilla; I recognized someone in that short clip. Shout out to Mmejean. Thanks for showing me and my friend around Darkshore! We’re planning on going to Stalagg. Hope to see you there!
---
The possibilities are endless, I wouldn't mind another server with all the expansions up to WoTLK but with locked lvl 60 and without all the new OP items.
---
STV and foothills will be bloodbaths phase 1, but phase 2 when honor is involved and no BG's then all the 60's will be ganking 50+ players not lowbies (as much). 
---
Feel bad for anyone trying to go 50-60 during phase 2 before BG's open. Ungoro, silithis, winterspring, and the plaguelands are all gonna be the bloodbaths phase 2 until phase 3 opens.
---
I hope to be able to experience naxx40
---
People seem to have an unreal hate for gnomes for some reason (probably because the laugh and voice and just general look of being a baby person) so I would say it's more embarrassing to be ganked by one.
---
All you had to do is quite the mob as far as possible from the group.
---
So when he runs in fear, he won't reach the group before you kill him.
---
Also save your ranged attack or stun/slow for when he runs.
---
If you need money, they have them in these things called banks. You can just go in and ask for some. If your sneak is good enough you can probably just take some.

Im guessing thats because half the addons download with -master in the folder name and you have to remove that to get the addon to work, which twitchapp cant do
---
Unfortunately I'll be at work day one but logging in and at least getting out of starting zone would be nice.
---
Almost nobody falls in love with the current version of the game though, it’s just a game amongst others these days, a game you play for a while until you’re bored and find a new one to test. The old WoW, on the contrary, was literally an RPG world simulator, and as such was horribly addictive. It didn’t really feel like a game, it’s more as if you experienced spending time in a fantasy world. Even playing it for a while makes retail feel empty and tasteless.
---
I also think people over-estimate QoL importance in players’ satisfaction. QoL is just short term pleasure. Coming back to what I said before, to make somebody stay on an MMORPG for months - if not years - you need to give that person a proper sense of achievement with long term goals and unique Grundy rewards, along with an addictive atmosphere, coming from the RP world AND from social interactions within the game. All these things are fading away from retail for years. If a new player manages to play through Vanilla a couple dozen hours without the QoL, the atmosphere, socialization and feeling of increasing power in his character will completely overcome any interest in retails quality of life “improvements”.
---
Vanilla wasn’t “just a game” like retail. It was something standing out, a community and a world, hence why it was so successful.
---
Not just Thistle Tea, but also Blinding powder requiring Fadeleaf.
---
this community in a nut shell. Guy making sarcastic comment and getting called "facetions asshole" and "dense". Thankfully there's enough players so I don't have to play with these type of people once game launches... Maybe they figure out they're being toxic and ruining the game for themselves.

Difference is, it got to "Hot" this time.  No one cares that it was posted a week ago or that you fill your brain with that kind of info.
---
Simply wrong. 4 Melees buffed by Howl gain more damage than 1 Claw or Bite or whatever spell you use. In addition, if you buff a tank with that, he can produce more threat, which makes it possible for everyone to deal more damage.
---
I mean Nabisco brand is called Nilla, so you aren't really getting anything wrong by thinking you are shortening it lol
---
Do they though? I'm thinking the opposite. They'll downplay classic as "extra content" for BfA and only give us BfA sub numbers if anything.
---
Actually, the Mob AI, the increased number of abilities, and the more varied resistances means that Classic mobs are actually more difficult.
---
Lol, using the launcher. Go into the classic wow folder, make a shortcut of the .exe. Problem solved.
---
Like I said, I was always a huge wc fan since warcraft 2. Tauren for me seems like the coolest race, and after figuring out what class does what, the shamans support qualities are appealing to me. I guess it's that simple.
---
Watching now.  Audio is a bit low but not awful and timestamp links in info don't seem to work.  Other than that looks great so far!  Good work!
---
I haven't played WoW since the first expansion I think it was the Crusader one. I re-subbed early for WoW Classic and started over because I don't even know where to begin with my high level. I re-rolled Warlock, the same as my main. Maybe I called it quits too early but as I hit past level 10 I noticed if I wasn't a certain spec I couldn't use my immolate spell. This honestly was a huge disappointment.
---
Am I really going to miss out that much on a PVE server?
---
I've played on PVE servers since WotLK when my parents swapped to the Alliance and I was made to follow. Since then, I've not had a lot of fun with BGs, which is likely a combination of me being bad, me not knowing the BGs that got introduced after Cataclysm (quit before Pandaria and returned before BFA), and the faction imbalance problem. Historically I've had the most fun raiding (especially as a healer), but I'm rolling an Alliance mage this time around to round out my friends group's composition. The guild I'm joining is rather casual and may not raid at all. Without WPVP, am I going to find myself with a lack of things to do?
---
It might be best, but this is bestest: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25081-StonewroughtUI.html
---
\&gt;there's nothing else to play
---
Oh please. It took me multiple tries, but I ended up loving ffxiv, especially during shadowbringers. In fact, I enjoy it so much, that I won't be only playing vanilla, I'll be on both games for different reasons. The issue isn't that there's nothing else to play, the issue is that a lot of long term wow players can't handle something different.
---
Let's teach him a lesson.

---
They're good noob stompers.
---
Yes a good player will kite you and you have basically no chance, but you will kill any clothie in 3 hits if they're bad (or just busy fighting a mob).
---
This is all the same shit that was said about OSRS and now that game is about 400% more popular than the original
---
They are super strong but they can be a little boring to play, in my opinion.
---
You only have a handful of spells you can use in shadowform and most of the time you go oom very quickly.
---
One of the things I disliked most about being a shadowpriest was BGs, or specifically dying in a BG and ressing. I'm the kind of guy that likes putting all or at least the most important buffs on me before I run out, and if you do that with a shadowpriest its annoying.
---
You have, Fortitude, Inner Fire, Shadow Resist, Shadowform (a must), and if you're a Troll Shadowguard. That's 5 GCDs and by the time they are all cast you need to drink because you will be oom.
---
Of course, a lot of people say don't bother with buffing yourself as you res, just run back into the fight, but I dunno... I feel like having that fort + inner fire + shadowform just makes you super tanky. But even if you cast just those three spells you'll likely want to drink anyway cause you'll be at least at half mana.
---
I look forward to 5e entertainment streams can get pretty wild by 24+ hours without sleep XD .
---
They’re not a bad thing. They’ll also tell any enhancement shaman that they cannot raid as enhance, even if they aren’t raiding in the same group.
---
Who gives a shit? No changes, right? More than 3-4k concurrent players would not be an authentic vanilla experience.
---
You can't do DireMaul at 18 but you can surely do Van Cleef :)))))
---
That's encouraging to hear. A subscription model is far and away the best method of paying for a game we want to remain consistent.
---
They changed the way water looks at some point. There's a ton of new graphical options in the Classic client but water is probably the biggest stand-out. You can just turn it off, though.
---
lol you brought me back to farming for a week straight and selling everything i could to get my level 40 mount because i didn't plan for it and spent gold haphazardly and without purpose in my early levels and thinking an epic mount was a virtual impossibility for me( i did eventually get it thanks to a loan from some guildmates )
---
It's not an automatic switch to flag yourself off of PvP though. Maybe it is if you don't attack anyone, but once you're flagged for PvP to unflag from PvP you need to wait 3 or 5 (can't remember) minutes of no pvp action before you're not flagged again. 
---
This way you can't attack someone and then immediately flag yourself not available for PvP. They get some time to find you and try and kill you back.
---
Youre way overthinking this rofl
---
work work
---
i think group 2 is going to be a very small group. the whole reason theres nostalgia is because they liked the game. nobody gets nostalgia glasses about getting to play a shit game that they hated.
---
OMG there’s a discord!?! Thanks!
---
Submit heretic!  Man if classic wasn't coming out in a week, I'd play poe again.
---
Most guilds have a main tank/off tank who are part of their core because you have to funnel gear to them. If you're joining a guild there's a good chance these spots are filled already so it's more likely that you'd be recruited to dps. I'm sure you could find some guild somewhere looking for a tank if that's what you want to do.
---
In vanilla, raids will run two primary tanks with dps warriors tanking 
---
 on certain bosses. I didn't raid on private servers, so I don't know if the strats changed (they probably have), but in MC there's quite a few bosses where we'd have dps warriors go d stance with a shield and tank ads (Garr, Sulfuron, Majordomo). 
---
The only boss we ever respecced prot for was Patchwerk, and it was only during our early kills because our healers couldn't keep our offtanks up when they were fury. I do remember that we had warriors tank 4 horseman as fury.
---
I was actually looking through kill screenshots from MC through Naxx the other day and it was anywhere from 6 to 9 warriors a raid. 2 prot, rest arms/fury (we ran a lot of arms until AQ40 because we didn't know better).
---
I’ve been practicing my beer intake. Trying to find a balance of buzzing but coherent but then end up drunk and reckless. Also I can’t drink 1 or I’ll want to sleep so I usually have to chug 2-3 and then if I take the 4th too early I then am drunk and gameplay suffers. It’s a delicate art.

---
Literally what you do in classic lmao
---
They’re living rent free inside your head.
---
In b4 a 9 month phase 1 to "weed out" the tourists.
---
you have to realize these commenters are just selfish people who are upset because they think the return of vanilla will fragment the playerbase and shrink the population in retail, and ultimately take blizzards focus away from the version of the game they like. Because of that selfish underlying reason they just can’t accept that some people don’t like that game and loved vanilla wow. 
---
Personally I saw a stream with someone playing retail the other day and I saw a pandaren dancing. It looked so embarrassingly stupid I had to turn the whole stream off.
---
As long as it sticks with the original vision, no flying crap, no teleporting for convenience, no daily quests and shit.
---
Idk. A inflated gold economy could be a bad thing unless izzard regulated the gold sinks. 50g meaning nothing to the playerbase is just dual talent specs with more steps.
---
Nope. But it does mean you don't have to worry about switching out items when mounting.
---
I always have an army of alts to expand my tradeskill capabilities.  Even if some are only lvl 35 to max out production tradeskills (tailoring, blacksmithing, enchanting etc..).  Alts are fun anyway.  Just don't warry about it and plan on having an alt..o
---
And if you're in the US, it will probably never get much better.

Every distraction should be valued this way.

You are currently #10,237 in queue.

Estimated: 970 minutes.

Thats an interesting twist, I recommend my plan though;
---
Stay up night from sunday to monday, go to sleep mid-monday, wake up at 11PM and get your shit sorted, play til' you drop.
---
I am still using my original one from the year they were added (2008).

---
We were lead to believe sharding would only be during launch and only in low level areas, but here we are already accepting continent sized shards ("layers") for all level ranges for an indeterminate number of months.
---
They said Herod will have *queues* of 10,000 people. How many players are actually on that server?
---
We're not even talking launch here, this is pre-registration.
---
What if half of players don't quit like Blizzard expects? The whole idea of turning off continent sized sharding (layering) is that enough people will quit playing that the server population will be small enough to fit on a single shard.
---
how much is some?
---
It takes me about an hour to make that much money in real life. 
---
Versus waiting possibly even longer to just play the game in my limited free time. 
---
“Time is money”
---
If you don’t see the value of time versus money spent and value time more than money then you’re failing at logic, or you’re very poor.
---
I'm gonna do Stockades and DM, because we are at a LAN party. - Was jsut interested in if it was "worth" it to go to darkshore after westfall.
---
I have close family visiting from overseas from the 20th - Sep 3 so I can't no life as much as I would like to during the day. I'll probably just play all night and live on 3-4 hours of sleep then switch to what you're mentioning around the beginning of Sep.

The discord Pink Panda Boosting and the site " Pandaboost" or whatever it is called are completely different entities. You can go on the site and then the discord. You'll see that the branding is not only entirely different but the discord says GOLD ONLY in the very first page in gold.

If they were going to make a site that did take money, why would they change the branding but not the name? That would be incredibly stupid

When does classic release so i can plan my sickdays accordingly?
---
You sound like a child
---
Best bet is to lead them into some obstacles you know you can jump over but that they might not be able to
---
Possibly zygore
---
Well done. Thanks for sharing. Been living off of this kind of stuff until release.
---
Vanilla guide
---
There isn't one, the guy is making shit up.
---
They said TBC etc _could_ happen if the interest is there.
---
The point of leveling isn't just to level. The point is also to get better at the game. Having that additional pressure of enemy presence gets you there quicker.
---
Zygor guide?
---
And video game companies are known for keeping their promises!
---
Conversely there will be some people who will get in an accident and as a result will be stuck in bed with nothing to do but play the game
---
4K you say? sounds amazing
---
Yall are crazy. Most people will absolutely get bored with Classic. Can we stop pretending that there are infinite things to do that will keep casual players engaged, or that most people won't burn out on the leveling grind. Classic is a niche game, and thats perfectly fine. It doesnt need to be some smash hit to be healthy. Just enjoy the fact that we have it and stop reaching to put retail down.
---
What's so bad about continent sized shards?
---
It's only going to be in for the first few months, the most important time for guild and economy development.
---
That is the common consensus, but who knows really.  I will be very interested to see the actual stats on attrition.  
---
I mean you think you do (want to quit before max level), but you don't? Maybe?
---
Virgin commie: “you won’t like it because it’s STUPID difficult to reach the pinnacle”
---
Chad ‘murican: “that’s exactly why we like it”
---
It’s a fair point tho: why would you want things to be harder? Even stupid hard (e.g. high lvl gear with useless stats). It’s like, I can’t explain the why I want that in a rational way but I sure as fuck know that getting my first epic at lvl 17 from a quest reward feels empty and hollow as fuck
---
Thanks! This is exactly what I needed.
---
Depending on what server you play on, it's hard to say if there will even be a devilsaur mafia. The reason why these "mafiosos" existed in private servers was because there was only one server. No matter what time of day it is people were going to be on. On an east coast server, you likely won't have people in china on your server playing during the off hours. So even if the devilsaurs are camped at peak hours, you'll likely be able to find a time when the general population has gone to sleep and there shouldn't be too many people.
---
But it's hard to say honestly how bad it will be.
---
Who needs this for a 15 year old game LUL
---
Not really tbh
---
Oh it'll be pretty bad. Blizzard said that if Herod says at current pop it will have server queues of 10k. [3k queues have a wait time of 4 hours](https://i.imgur.com/mNlfYpN.jpg). There could, no exageration, be queue times of 12 hours to play on the most crowded servers. Combine this with the fact that the statistics that are available suggest that only about half of the people who will play classic have subbed already, and you start to see how challenging it will be just to actually log in. Layering and dynamic respawns only help when you're actually in game.
---
Yes, flying mounts ruined so many aspects of the game that made it great.
---
Even if they could hold that many people, what the fuck is anyone going to do in a 50k online population server? if 10% of that population decided to afk in major cities thats 2500 people in ironforge and orgrimmar. 2 5 0 0. Go try visualizing that number.
---
Also gloves enchant
---
Pretty sure they could all proc off of eachother. That was changed in BC.
---
So why i ask. It doesn't make much sense.
---
Not really. Most of it is catch up gear when you compare the level required to make it vs whats available from quests and dungeons. The advantage to lw is at end game, when you can make very specific pieces of gear that are used in certain fights, as well as certain bis preraid items.
---
But that's a completely different and if it keeps you entertained for 5 years, then awesome!
---
I've never played / really known about Rimworld so I won't comment. But taking Minecraft, the longevity doesn't come from the core game on beating the final boss. It stems from your imagination and what you choose to build, essentially just being a medium for your art. People build machines or worlds of their own or remake LoTR etc. It's no different than being a Lego creator or a clay modeler or painter. 
---
It's just fortunate that its insanely cheap as it's all digital. 
---
What you've said are great examples to counter the price, the difference is it's very niche and is more of an art than anything else.  A lot of people will be able to play Minecraft for 5 years and be happy, building their imagination. A huge amount of people wouldn't.
---
Aww you should have done it during the last stress test to save yourself some time.
---
For sure, flying really ruined the scale of the world. I think that's the reason why the BFA zones are so small compared to Vanilla, the devs know flying will be out sometime in the future and don't want to make areas as large as they used to. IMO, it ruins the whole fantasy world experience. I miss large zones more than anything, I can't wait to play Classic for the first time.
---
My alarm will be set for a 1/2 hour before launch. I'll have a full day's sleep and be ready to go.

I have dropped WoW for a decade for God's sake. I don't get this sentiment that so many have against flying. As many have pointed out, flying itself is not the problem, it's a part of the game's mechanism in the expansions. Flying in AZEROTH is.
---
Newbie here, Whats layering?
---
You forgot **People crying on reddit**
---
There are players who never played WoW at all and will want to play Classic. These people don't know of the QoL updates so they might have a great time in Classic.
---
Melt faces with shadow priest.
---
Good thing I'll wear hoods!
---
Inertial dumper is offline?
---
&gt;Funny enough layering was allegedly supposed to prevent the server transfer exodus
---
No it wasn't? it's to prevent dead servers in the long-term for the majority of realms.
---
If it's only one friend I'd suggest rolling on East coast and looking for a guild new friends there. Or maybe talk it over with your friend.
---
Tons of game are full F2P with no pay to win these days, so it definitely hasn’t been the “cheapest” thing for a long long time. I’d argue it’s like *the* most expensive way to game
---
Pretty much. I've moved on from Herod to Fairbanks. This whole "it's a dead server" is a mouth breathers response.
---
Teleport to Moonglade and then hearth back to Westfall, etc.
---
The less you talk about it the better
---
Ah, sorry, when I was talking about faction imbalance I meant the quantity/quality of players on live, not in classic.
---
Just don't leave your pet on aggressive in dungeons / raids and you'll be fine.
---
DM isnt out till p2 so DM is DM till DM is out
---
I haven't played vanilla wow but from my own research it is a good idea to to have craft/gathering combination to be self reliant when crafting gear. Especially since crafting gear will be good before you have raid gear. So Leatherworking/Skinning should be good.
---
Where did the apologists go that were parroting "just two weeks" run off to?
---
And it’s just as terrible as I remember the Curse app being too. Ahh the nostalgia.
---
K bud
---
Your pvp flag eventually falls off after entering a safe area.  I think it is a 5 min (?) buff or so.  So when you walk into a newbie area or major city you are still pvp flagged for a short period of time.
---
I don't know of any good aspects in Retail.
---
Both
---
Maradoun: 48+
---
BRD: 55+
---
Stratholme: 58+
---
And yet, Shazzrah and Golemagg are still not locked.
---
Stupid Blizzard is still stupid.
---
There will be no queues at launch. Because the servers will crash.
---
so what are you going to do? NOT PLAY IT LUL?
---
Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?
---
&gt;think 
---
Hope*
---
he had a petition from 2 years ago to bring vanilla wow to blizzard's attention, people are being passive aggressive, like a toxic woman would be, rather than being direct and toxic like a man.
---
Since it never gets brought up anywhere, I wanna talk about the PvP gear.
---
There were two versions of the ranked PvP sets in vanilla. The first version lasted until patch 1.11 (Naxx) where it was replaced by the second version. The second version is what Classic will have from the start. The epic set (R12-13) is comparable to AQ40 loot in terms of stat budget, but it will become available when the PvP system comes online in phase 2. Assuming the phase lasts no less than three months, people will begin to have this gear toward the end of it, before BWL even opens, and the gear is on par with T2.5 for most classes.
---
If you're ranking hard and remain amongst the top earners every week, you can hit R13 in under three months. At that point, several players per week will be hitting their full epic PvP set. Per faction, per server. Depending on population, as much as eight or ten players on each faction could be hitting the epic ranks each week. It doesn't take long before everybody who's aiming for those ranks will have it. R13 is a hell of a lot easier than R14.
---
This gear is insanely broken when available in the earlier phases. It was designed to be good enough in a world where Naxx is out, but we'll start to see it when MC is still the latest raid. By phase 3, all hardcore PvPers with time to rank up will have it. Whole guilds. Numerous full premade crews on every server wearing gear from phase 6 in phase 3.
---
Examples of the difference between the two versions:
---
https://itemization.info/item/16453  
---
https://itemization.info/item/16442  
---
https://itemization.info/item/16480
---
If you have the opportunity to rank up to 13, the rewards are so absurdly overpowered that you absolutely should. If you've ever considered doing it but never got around to it on pservers or whatever, do it this time. If you're serious about PvP and think you can compete with the best without having this gear, think again. They'll have like 30% more health than you without sacrificing any DPS stats.
---
Whereas pservers had the original PvP gear until the appropriate patch, Classic will have the Naxx version from the beginning, so if you can spend 2½ months grinding hard, you can set yourself up to be the best geared motherfucker on your server for a long, long time. It isn't Blizzlike, but it seems to be the way it's gonna be.
---
I played retail with the same computer, leveled a character till 120. Everything was fine expect bigger cities(15-20fps)
---
Not even Blizz knows what is going to happen at launch.
---
screw my preist definitely rolling dk, what's a bis list look like for DK in classic? DK prio on THUNDERFURY?
---
Nah... TONS and TONS of people that played Retail Vanilla WoW played Private Server Vanilla WoW.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=layering+wow+classic
---
I hope you know classic wow has lesser aggro radius, reduced hp of mobs and damage of mobs from private servers. Private servers are like fan made hard modes of classic. People will ln. Be disappointed. I died once as a warrior 1-10 because I aggrod 3 mobs. One was named, another was a random mob and a 3rd was from the dynamic respawn. It's not harder by anymeans. It's just more time consuming. 
---
On retail you are a champion/hero elite fighting randos leveling up. You shouldn't be losing to then. 
---
On classic wow, you're a militia fighter fighting the world. You should be losing to the mobs terrorizing the world. You're just the farmer who decided to.
---
Honestly just take breaks, stretch, and stay hydrated.
---
How do these people explain all of the Vanilla private servers that have maintained high populations for years?
---
Wearing the best possible gear in the game from Naxxramas, you will do slightly more damage then the warriors were within a Week of hitting 60.
---
I know I'm late to this post but I want to say I've never watched podcasts before but I really enjoy your show. You do a great job keeping it interesting and have honestly answered a huge amount of my questions. Keep up the good work!
---
Warlocks can fix this.
---
You jest but I could see us getting classic releases of Cata and Mop as well. They might not be as popular as the first three installments of WoW but they're still constantly brought up in conversation. Cata was the last oldschool expansion. It still had talent points, the raids were pretty solid and it was the last expansion to have real Legendary items. MoP was polarizing with it's setting but it too had a bunch of great raids and I think most people tend to agree it was the pinnacle of class design as ability pruning hadn't started yet.
---
If you math it out:
---
21.62 workdays per month x 8 hours a day = 172.96 hours a month
---
[$1120/month](https://salaryaftertax.com/us) minimum wage after tax.
---
So there's a lot of Americans working for functionally $6.47 per hour. That means they're __already__ working 18.5 hours for ATVI shareholders every month.
---
DM wasn't even DM before DM was out lol. Chew on that for a while.
---
what i'd like to see for retail is a sort of paragon mode. you unlock it when you reach max level. (so most players have it unlocked already) then, when you create a new character, you can choose a hard mode. possibly even a hardcore option ala diablo. you'll only encounter other players that have this mode enabled as well.
---
you may also apply this to dungeons as well. basically unlocking heroic/mythic difficulty for leveling dungeons.
---
this can grant bonus xp, prestige titles or whatever encourages you to use those modes.
---
Can you please stay out of my layer? Thanks
---
I'm having trouble with this site listing many add-ons that are broke.
---
played many melee classes and didn't make this simple and stupid errors like you seem to have, maybe retail is the game for you?
---
Since I have game time I tried logging into retail to dink around. Everything felt wrong after playing classic for even a little bit where it all felt right again. 
---
Is it 26th yet?
---
I fought for God. Who do you fight for exile?
---
Who needs porn when I can just stare at my NE’s delicious night-hole every time I play?
---
"Ori, Lost In the Storm" from the Game "Ori and the Blind Forest"
---
Oh fuck, its that bad?
---
Bringing back race/class life quests would be top shelf
---
I am trying to decide between hunter and rogue for when classic launches but I am worried that bothering of these classes will be way overpopulated and I'll have trouble finding groups and gearing up at 60. Are hunter and rogue going to be too overpopulated?
---
Any news on addons like DBM? I remember hearing that Blizzard will curate addons and block the ones not within the spirit of Classic WoW. I hope they'll get rid of it.
---
Well tbh the more people that have "Accidents" the shorter the queue!
---
hehe
---
Why do so many people like PvP? All of the PvP servers are the high pop servers in NA and the Normal ones are trumped by even the RP-PvP. I love raiding so I feel joining a lower pop server might hinder my ability to find a competent, serious guild.
---
I continued to play it after that but I really missed the old levelleling, with quests that sent you all over the world.  The new style of quest hubs just feels so formulaic and stale.
---
Mages will always be self-sufficient and sought after in both groups and raids. It is also amazing that your pvp and pve spec are pretty much identical.
---
Honestly, one of the comments in the screenshots does make a decent point - it would be (I won't say better) nice if Blizzard have invested the resources in making retail better instead of working on classic. However, they have with every expansion delivered (at least for me) mostly disappointment, so, I would rather them not "work on improving" retail, but just release something that we all (surely most of us) know is good.
---
Will it be possible before r10 gear?
---
Troll master race
---
yeah but nobody plays retail for the leveling
---
yeah glad I never played a private server and dont have bad habits or expectations.
---
Yep. I started at release and quit during wotlk after our first Lich King kill. I resubbed last week and logged into a few of my old characters.  It was weird and confusing. I was sad I no longer had a friends list, then I logged out to wait for classic to start. 
---
It's going to be classic or something besides WoW for me.
---
Case in point, the truth is usually the exact opposite of what women say.
---
Two!
---
Ah yes that's why it would takes months to down individual bosses.
---
Casually filthy.
---
Am I the only one around here who still believes #nochanges
---
If theres DK and DH I’ll be disappointed.
---
The twitch app have not been able to find my world of warcraft folder since bfa came out and i have reinstalled both the app and wow
---
I'm here for the community aspect. Also, I personally think, that WoW got too overloaded in the past years. I'm looking forward to an a bit more decelerated WoW experience.
---
You can mail up to 10 items now, previously was 1 and super annoying.
---
AIGHT BRUDDA! Welcome to your new home :D Fellow shaman\~\~
---
The sheer amount of ignorance and arrogance in these replies, holey FUCKIN shit.
---
When did they start adding expiration levels on items?
---
Ah, right, it would be Dun Morogh.
---
I booked a trip with my GF from 25th to 1st of September... After the flights were booked my brains had a strange feeling that something was off and I slowly realised that I won’t be able to play in the first five days. I brought the topic up once and was told that its better for me to be sitting on that plane...
---
Even if people will quit Classic after some months, it is still a good thing for WOW. The amount of oldschool people I have known throughout the years coming back for Classic is quite insane. The chance of them trying retail is big if they get tired of Classic.
---
I’m confused.
---
Because Blizzard cares about keeping promises. rofl.
---
Most of us are also players coming back, some even played private servers for years. But we have some guys that never played vanilla but plays retail, gonna be a joy to watch them struggle :D
---
the minimum is to reach level 20 with my Rogue, maybe even getting further.
---
Sorry, I'm out of the loop on this one.
---
Russian realms and translation, new macro and addon api(Modified legion), auto loot without shift key, actions now use on keypress, now wow can run with more cpu cores, build in voice  chat.
---
We are all lucky to have such a high quality piece of content at this stage in WoW classic’s life cycle. Hopefully you are the first of many such high quality content creators. Thanks so much!
---
How long do you plan on that taking you?
---
I like the undead male running animation for warriors
---
The hunter gameplay is actually much more complicated than people give it credit for. The rotation is also way more intricate than one button classes like mage or lock.
---
This is what will destroy WoW Classic. Everyone I know is no longer a kid. 
---
Most if not all of my friends that plan to play Classic are well-educated adults and at this point, in there life and are far more mature then the uneducated, toxic, trolls that seem to infest these forums.
---
What do you mean you have to funnel gear to them? Is it because they’re a part of the core group that they’re entitled to freebies? The rich get richer!
---
Ahk. I’d love to tank eventually. It appears that will take time and I’ll have to work my way up through dps / off tank roles.
---
Yeah I’ve read in a few places that warriors often tank in arms or fury for threat purposes. 
---
Thanks for the reply, very helpful stuff
---
I'd like some more info on the priest farming stuff!
---
.. asking for a friend ofc.
---
For me personally, world pvp was at it's peak in vanilla. The game makes you stay in the world to do everything. The oppurtunities for encounters is therefore really high.  Also, pvp in vanilla takes some thinking at times.  It really becomes a thinking man's game. This all being highly subjective. World pvp in vanilla is my #1 reason I'm so excited! Getting to 60 is going to take forever because I will be in groups doing battles in remote areas of the world.
---
Best classic video dont @ me
---
If blizzard had any intention of fixing retail WoW we wouldn't need Classic.  
---
But their reaction to even the idea that there might be something wrong with retail that needs to be fixed, is the same as when people asked for vanilla "You think there's something wrong, but there isn't."
---
But there's a cooldown, and then the rogue will strip aggro again, and again.
---
Maybe Im missing something but it doesnt seem to me like RMT would be a huge issue on retail considering you can buy gold? Like whats the difference
---
Because I couldn't find an image of a white soccer player from Brazil that also had transparency and this picture is only about the Eastern Time Zone servers. This picture also has a white girl stroking the ball chin of a blue zombie and a white guy hanging from his hand. It also has Steel Reserve in it, which itself is a meme and people could argue Im making fun of myself. I thought it was pretty clear this was all lighthearted. Guess I was wrong in 2019.

For the record I have had a great time playing with Brazilians that can speak English because they get phased to Tichondrious all the time. I have also had a really bad time with people I can't understand (Just like the people who speak Portuguese and not English have  a bad time with people like me). That doesn't mean I'm racist, it means I like to communicate with people in a Massive MULTIPLAYER Online Game. I wish they gave you a server for Portuguese. Since they aren't though, I am glad you claimed one and think that's really cool. Hope to see you on my team Horde side in BG's if they do cross realm (rather they didn't, but I don't run Blizzard). Not like we have to worry about boss mechanics or threat. :)

^This, no free lunches
---
Yes, there are people in this subreddit who are extremely toxic when discussing which game they like more.
---
Exactly, go to the cinema 1 time a month and you are already at the same price for only 1,5 or 2 hours. Or go bowling or do anything else like going out for dinner. 
---
Compared to the time most of the players are going to invest in the game, 15/month is not much. Even if you can just fit a few hours a week, it's still no big investment.
---
Funny story I have a Mac Mini 2011 at my parents and the graphics API has changed so much on Mac that u need a card that at least supports Metal in it.
---
If I convert it to a Windows 10 machine, my integrated gpu is still 1 generation too far behind to run Classic WoW. My parents like in the hometown where I work so that would have worked fine. But nope. No dice.
---
Not only that but it totally ruins the pvp for us who love world pvp.

I quit because the RPG I used to love where each class had strengths and weaknesses died, where the dungeons felt unique and not just a cookie cutter template, where the world was huge and the threat of death was everywhere, where a fight between two feuding players could turn into an all-Out brawl between to guilds, where a faction meant something.  Retail lost me a long time ago, after Cata to be specific.
---
It’s going to be great going home.
---
Are you trolling us at this point?
---
Unless you’re a no lifer, playing what I want to play and having fun is more important than tipping a meter.  
---
In my private server experience, outside of the core must haves, no one gives a shit what you are in a 40 man raid, or someone LF1DPS for a dungeon run.
---
Warrior tank can do berserking to drop fear, this wotf not very good for tanks.
---
Just having some fun. Don't be so jelly
---
I beat our realms rank 14 warrior in duels with my rogue that had mostly green and blue agi/dodge gear.  
---
It is fairly easy, especially if you use expose armor and disarm. Not sure if it was a bug, but with enough dodge and evasion up, warriors would regulary miss their overpowers.  
---
And as people has already stated, it is easy to control their range with crippling poison, sprint and stuns. Meaning you can build up energy and attack them when you have full energy and they have low rage. Can also restealth without using blind against them, because you have a sweet spot where you are outside their hit range and it is still to close for them to charge.
---
When was that published? I still have my original game booklet where it says druids can use polearms 😂😂
---
It’s more like just because you hired a cleaner to come in every two weeks doesn’t mean you should turn your house into a dump
---
I used to love taking them to work/school with me back then. Surprised they are still in one piece!
---
The quote on the bottom is cute. Pretty sure I don't enjoy myself on retail and then not enjoy myself on classic I'm just going to go do something else entirely.
---
Yea and it’s elites
---
No, but OP is talking about his open beta character.
---
The AH becomes vastly better when it's too expensive for people to create a monopoly on specific items...
---
I’m as anti-layering as you, but i can’t agree that the merging of realms is a better option. I just think they’re overestimating the drop off. They’re likely going to pack realms with 20-25k people, and pray that almost 85% drop off or play a minuscule amount by 2-3 weeks. 
---
But let’s also not act like there are other solutions, if they don’t drop off. There will be queue times, and then new servers to migrate to to *avoid those queue times*. I would be one of many transferring off of Herod to play on a decent population, as well as help Herod be closer to normal in the process, while avoiding a queue.
---
Chills? Check. Goosebumps? Check.
---
Motivation skyrocketed? Check.
---
Anticipation with slight erection? Checkmate.
---
The song is by Avenue Q, and the Bert and Ernnie video is hilarious.
---
I think a major problem is that every expansion is the same. It's some very clearly defined story that you're going through instead of finding some obscure character in the middle of nowhere, off in some distant land and helping them out.
---
That hasn't been the way the game has worked since classic. BC was all about Illidan. Wrath all about Arthas. Cata all about Deathwing. Mists all about Garrosh. Warlords all about Garrosh again in a sense. Legion all about Sargeras and the burning legion. BFA all about Sylvanas.
---
What if they gave us an expansion with less cutscenes and stories, and made it more about creating an additional new world to explore? Like, the other side of Azeroth - and there are no "scary endgame bosses who rule the whole thing."
---
I never claimed I want fair gameplay. I'm talking about the fact that a select few were able to get a 3 month long beta to level before everyone else got access
---
If people don't quit then they'll open new servers and offer free transfers to the people on overcrowded servers. You know, like they've done before in that kind of situation.
---
Its not about being better (although it is) its about not being spoon fed until I'm bored
---
I’ve never had that issue. I’ve even had flip contests with other nelf friends. I’ll have to test it in classic.
---
They’re actually really embarrassing. Anime avatars chatting in their dedicated anime channels. Not WoW related at all. It’s a yikes from me.
---
ROFL.
---
Cross realms will be absolutely fine.
---
There are so few servers that the community feeling wont go away
---
*laughs in Warlock*
---
So you only played PvP on private servers? Where they tend to ban people if the camp too much?

I love absolute posts like this, children with little understanding of how an industry like gaming works.
---
WoW was a sweet spot for its time taking traditional MMO elements and making them more accessible for a wider audience. They still maintained a large ethos of work for your reward. Modern day WoW caters for an equally large, but more profitable, audience. Benefitting from RNG based mechanics and minimising the socialisation needed to succeed in it.
---
It's absolutely ridiculous to believe there isn't a market for the traditional model where work is rewarded and success is earned. Unfortunately the reason they fail to see that is that the populations don't massively overlap. Younger audiences are primed to getting regular RNG based reward, that regular dopamine fix. The fact there are multiple gaming populations within a gaming community really shouldn't be a suprise. These reactions are very obviously classic acts of self-reassurance to supress any visible doubt they have about the direction of retail.
---
By the time Sulfuras becomes available, money shouldnt be an issue anymore.
---
It's pretty straight forward.  The reason why layering exists is overpopulation.  The time they can remove layering is when the population dies down.  There's some server player threshold where they can remove layering easily.  If the drop off doesn't happen soon enough, they will try to push people onto other servers so they aren't too packed when layering is removed.
---
If there is no BGs how is it just about hours spent? I am not sure I understand. But I want to
---
More so than before
---
39 Shadow Priests and a Bear Tank.
---
But so is retail? So why complain lol.
---
I wouldn't recommend waiting at the grey server list. I did that for the name reservation launch and they didn't turn green - I had to relog.
---
It seems better than the rest thus far. Still made by power hungry no lifers though.
---
Tier 1 is pretty awful for DPS warriors and is decent for Prot, so it will be funneled to tanks. Also, having a geared main tank/off tank makes raids a ton easier. They get a ton of loot priority the first few weeks of raids which is why you hope they are part of the core, so they don't take the loot then leave the guild.
---
You don't have to work your way up, you just have to find a guild that needs a tank if that's what you want to do.
---
Fury tanking is a thing in later raids, but we never did it in vanilla and never had threat issues (I had thunderfury and our dps weren't anywhere as good as the dps in classic will be).
---
Five of you're willing to spec balance.
---
some of those are definitely against ToS but gallywix is actually legit.
---
Pretty sure they already said that. I only expect it to get it’s own button after it becomes wildly popular again.
---
There has never been a open beta for classic wow.
---
He's talking about his stresstest character.
---
 So actually the question should be rephrased, have you ever seen a MMORPG which let's you keep progress from a weekend long stress test?
---
Idk probably the same reason they enjoy talking and interacting with people during the dungeon run itself. 
---
I really do enjoy the social interaction of the game. All that LFG and LFR does is take that away from the game.
---
Classic has multiple times more content than current WoW. So "most people" AT LEAST won't get bored sooner than they were with retail.
---
Are there numbers for how many unique users reserved a name since the 12th of August?
---
Witcher 3
---
I don't really remember any time they've promised something and gone back at something. Sure, they often hint at things that never happen, but outright lying? Maybe I've just suppressed memories I don't like
---
my issue is not classic taking too much space, it's the useless 80gb from retail that I wasn't going to use. I found a solution now though
---
As much as I’d like it to, It definitely won’t be. MMOs these days are a niche market compared to 15 years ago when they started blowing up. There will definitely be a significant, stable population I reckon but you’re lying to yourself if you think it’s going to be as big as it was before
---
To be fair if a few months down the line they opened a new server an offered free migration depending on the lag I had or how bad the ques were at the time I could be inclined to move.
---
Should have used www.iswowclassicout.com dude!
---
Same here was my main game from vanilla-wotlk. Then quit within a few days of maxing in cata. Then did what you said, always came back for an expansion, but never stuck around.
---
Many will wipe on geddon. I expect many to wipe on the first firelord.
---
10k. Just like Nost. 4k is dellusional.
---
They need to clone the Herod server and force everyone to pick a side, that way everyone can keep their precious names.
---
I played 1.12. I don't like my life then as much as I like my life now.
---
So... It's not nostalgia for me. The game was just better. There have been a lot of changes that pissed me off, like changing weapon speeds to be all the same instead of being able to min/max based off of swing speed. I.e. your weapon maybe has higher DPS but if you're using abilities that are "deal weapon damage+X" you do a lot more damage with a lower DPS, slower swinging but harder hitting weapon.
---
Stuff like that was super fun and it makes it feel like you're beating the developers when you play the game in a way. And that is a lot of fun!
---
Same thing with some classes being OP. It's not that I want to play those classes: I want to counter their OPness.
---
I am so excited to play the game I enjoyed in the first place.
---
Dang he mad
---
Take my damn upvote.
---
Do you not raid?
---
As a former rogue, this makes me happy that the 6-8 kiting days against warriors will be a thing again.
---
what you describe is literally reddit. that's all it is, and ever will be
---
People gotta get that bomb out on geddon and kill lava spawns on firelords. I expect people to mess those up the first time.
---
Just don’t venture into the anime channels. An example of how whoever makes these channels really sets the tone with the kind of discussion they want in there.
---
I think he might mean it won’t be any different from retail interaction-wise.
---
Personally I want to be able to recognize names as I run past them or group with them, but with a server population as obnoxious as Herod’s you’re not going to recognize *anyone* on a consistent basis.
---
Go to the wow tab there’s a drop down menu near the play button that u can select classic
---
When BFA launched my server literally died for 4 hours.. Considering there's probably more people for classic and less servers.. can't wait to see the posts here on launch...
---
Let's hope they are prepared
---
I have a huge exam on the 30th and then another one on the 4th... thinking of just giving up on my master's :D
---
An authenticator. You would use a code it generates, in addition to your password, to login. Even if somebody has your password they cannot get into your account.
---
Yeah, my guess to why they try to reinvent the game each time is because it's a lot easier to sell and hype people up about it. "This is gonna change everything and it's gonna be amazing". If a new expansion instead were the exact same game, only with new quests, zones, dungeons, raids, armor, maybe some new spells to shake it up, then it wouldn't be as big of a event I think.
---
This is exactly what FFXIV does, and while I think it's a shitgame their playerbase just get happier and happier with every expansion at little risk in terms of longterm development to Square Enix.
---
I personally absolutely love the idea of TBC and WoTLK reimagined in classic-style. They could still reuse a lot of assets from the original expansion, only modify it to where there was no flying, no LFG, no changes to any systems. Perhaps they could issue a vote "Which feature or change would you like us to remove from this expansion?" like OSRS does.
---
One quest I always recall - you speak to a gnome(?) in IF who gives you two empty jars and asks you to fill them with ooze from Felwood.  
---
That doesn't happen anymore - getting quests from all over the world for one particular zone.  Everything is clumped together.  Also zones spanning multiple levels so you can do a few early quests, then go elsewhere, and come back in a few levels.  Even by the time TBC came along that was gone.
---
The world feels alive, big and dangerous.
---
*unzips*

Unless you've pulled any PvE mobs beforehand. And you can still lose durability in the normal hitting/getting hit way
---
What can you do on the chat screen to be active when you can’t create characters or log in?
---
Depending on your first language, different words in other languages can be very difficult to pronounce. I'm from Denmark, and we have a bunch of vowels that just makes people go "huh?"
---
Gehennas is no problem for me, but maybe it's different if you're from, say, Spain or Romania?
---
Bollocks, it's nothing you couldn't do yourself or couldn't do in a group.
---
I think you’re overreacting a bit
---
Pserver players have been doing these raids for years though. Pserver players who haven’t done mc in 12 years struggle.
---
Literally took all of about 5 minutes to unpair and activate the app authenticator. It was stressful for those couple minutes knowing how unguarded my account was though haha. 
---
Essentially you use the code on the back to unpair and then go through the app process to have a new one added via your phone.
---
Same bro. Same.
---
Stalagg seems to be the logical choice at the moment. That may change come release.
---
No Blue Plz and the nonsense you guys pulled on TB’s widow when you initially announced the return... no thanks.
---
Depends on your income
---
Disclaimer: I started playing in BC, not vanilla. I have, however, put some time in private servers and the beta/stress test.  
---
Classic WoW is definitely a flawed game. So is retail. Both will have things we wish the other had. For me, retail has great mechanics and rotations (mostly), some very interesting ways to progress, but is lacking in the player progress department. It really feels like getting gear in retail isn't that impactful. I also, personally, really dislike the endless grinding system of azerite power and the insane power creep every single patch. On top of that, it is undoubtedly a much less social game.  
---
Classic will feel rewarding and social. To me, these are the two most important things for an MMO to achieve.  The gameplay is going to be worse, though quite a bit different - monitoring mana and threat is a good change of pace, but I don't think that necessarily makes it more interesting than actually having a difficult rotation to master or interesting boss mechanics to follow. I'm personally okay with sacrificing a bit of gameplay and some quality of life things to get back to the core of the game actually feeling rewarding and social.
---
I’m guilty of playing up to wotlk. I did try to continue to play through out other xpacs but I was never fully invested like I was from classic to wotlk.
---
I think if switching layers was solidly locked down, then it might work. By locked down I mean absolutely no layer switching unless you are in a rested area. You could still join your friends, just group up and go to an inn.
---
Heart of the wild is garbage tho. Sure your stats are comparable but your healing won't be.
---
Don't do it! Your co-workers probably have a better/easier time at work if you are there as well.
---
Hope you got a good PC to handle 2500 people moving all at once.
---
All 3 make you go really fast. I remember passing guild members on the way to MC like just blowing by them. It’s cool to be the fastest.
---
Not Herod. Grob is looking like a lot of fun, I’d probably roll there if i was playing PvP

What website did you find that slideshow on? And is there one for each class???
---

---
Apples and oranges, my dude
---
Oh my god class design is so fucking boring now.
---
All classes feel the same. Resources hardly matter, everything is a "this is your 6 second cooldown, this is your class version of the paladin ranged stun, this is your 5-6 second damage dealing cooldown, this is your 10 sec damage dealing cooldown, this is the DoT that you have to refresh."
---
It's like, literally every fucking class feels like the same three classes now. Tank, healer and DPS.
---
Queues aren't disruptive at all.
---
Dead servers before phase 2 aren't disruptive at all.
---
In my dream, you could make dryad druids and I was super excited but for some reason I couldn’t log on lol
---
The booty of my orc
---
I have to idea what the top dps is doing in vanilla but a min/maxing druid on countdown to classic did 1000-1250 DPS with a feral druid.
---
I think you don’t have a crystal ball to know thats going to happen. I remain hopeful that it does. Modern mmos aren’t like vanilla wow.
---
I played with the guy that made this video.
---
What's something that that've promised and then blatantly went back on? Genuinely curious
---
So what dps does warrior do in molten core?
---
Thanks for the long write up, im definitely leaning towards pvp now!
---
I avoid them. I didnt even have to look. Can't understand the attraction to discord these days. Maybe just a guild one but even then I dont see why people sit in there all day long. Such a strange thing to do.
---
Here's to hoping you have to spend week 2 "enjoying" your alt because some nolifer is level 40 in redridge/stonetalon "playing the true wow experience".
---
&gt; Classic will make no impact on retail, just ignore the massive hype for it literally everywhere, it just anecdotes, people.

How more ignorant can you get?

You are 100% wrong, especially if you look at dungeons where classic mobs will be doing 1/5 to 1/10 of the damage on private servers.

They literally said that at the Blizzcon Q&amp;A last November, there is no conjecture.

I have Arcanite Ripper, but it's Original From Kara and I took that shit for Ret from a Hunter.

Okay, so I am brand new to WoW. I am trying to train my Leatherworking. From what I am seeing, I can craft Light Armor kits or make Light Leather out of Ruined Leather scraps at level 1. But how the hell do I actually craft things? I can't find anywhere that actually tells you how to make things? Am I just that dumb? Like how do I actually make stuff?
---
0/30/21, you need the NS healing touch.
---
The problem with this post is that's it's not happening, and even if it was it really isnt a problem.
---
I mean, the same applies to this subreddit when talking about power hungry nolifers trying to control Classic.
---
Check that your launcher is up to date.
---
* Don't pull more than you can handle.
---
* Be mindful of respawn and patrols.
---
There, that's your difficulty.
---
I mean you're also gimping yourself if you don't throw Redridge into the mix for all of the above.
---
Private server kiting doesn't work the same on Classic due to melee leeway. You ARE going to get hit going in and out of range and if the warrior is geared you can be instagibbed on a rogue.  It doesn't work at all on a Tauren. It was a private server meme
---
There is a lot of truth in that. Vast majority of people won't reach lvl60. But I think there will be enough who keep playing to warrant running Classic Servers for a long while. Private vanilla servers have proven that.
---
Last night I ran Deadmines on a vanilla private server - the first time in 12 years. We met people in Sentinel Hill, ran to Moonbrook, had to spend almost 30 mins clearning the mines before the dungeon and 2 quests outside the dungeon.
---
Then we had a pretty great tun, only one full wipe. After Van Cleef we cleared the exit and re-entered Westfall as a full group then dissolved as we ran back to town. 
---
It was a fully organic experience. Actually convincing me that in this game I'm playing that I really met players in my area and conquered a big threat in a consistent world that made sense. All of this was very rewarding and I enchanced it by reading all the quests and little notes. 
---
It might be faster and easier with LFG but you will not see those others from cross realm and even without cross realm you still dont make friends and connections when stuff is done for you. Not to mention dungeons that are almost faction specific bc you cant just run Wailing Caverns as alliance... Easily.
---
I want to get to level 15 so I'm in a good position to start the dungeon grind.
---
Heya and nice feedback. as you can see I stated that I use 9% hit - since Blizzard stated it is 8.15% in a blue post.
---
Regarding the Tanks, I also state that it will be interesting to see the Trolls, since there has been a lot of testing but nothing is 100%. You can argue about needing thate xtra threat compared to increased heath pool on different fights obviously.
---
Regarding Glancing blows I dont say it doesnt cap out anywhere - I just gave info based on what info I had. as far as I know you can continue to stack +Weapon skill but it decrease dramatically after hitting +8 in efficiensy.
---
I didnt have a chance to play the Beta and couldnt test out everything - also I did the best with all the info that was out there from the very Discords that are mentioned in the Video you reffered to.
---
That new Tool album is gonna be the #1 most listened-to-while-grinding album for Classic players.
---
I'm gonna "get into" some anime 'cause I think 90% of it is hot garbage but there's certain stuff that I've loved.
---
Dude this is great! Def gotta finish it til the 12th day :)
---
So suddenly people are okay with queues as long as we got *both* layering and queues?
---
4-5k is the maximum acceptable for the best gameplay experience.
---
Nost babies should shut it already.
---
The people saying this are fucking clueless, people like grinding. Just look at Osrs, much larger playerbase then the newer game and that game is mega grindy and looks like a potato.
---
Yeah rogues are mean without a doubt. There are a lot of good reasons to play one.
---
One area where server capacity can be an issue is getting to raid zones.
---
BRD on a PVP server is going to be packed with people during prime time. I can see serious lag happening when fights break out.
---
Good news! In classic enh shammies and shadow priests are the bees knees.
---
Would like some info on:  
---
Leveling warrior, spec etc  
---
Items worth getting while leveling, for both tank and dps specs, thanks!
---
Man 2% frost damage or whatever the heckin heck u said is not worth losing cold snap
---
You really should add the app to your phone. As cool as they are, I still have mine aswell, I've read on reddit somewhere this week that Blizzard has discontinued making physical authenticators. So if your physical authenticator finally dies, it can be a hassle to get acess to your account immediately, without a back-up (digital authenticator).
---
Yeah the more I've considered it the more I've firmed on Warlock. Never really played one so this'll be interesting I think!
---
I won't lie, part of me is smiling about the idea Herod lags behind in phases due to overpopulation and the inability to remove layering.  I genuinely feel for the innocent parties there, but the toxic players earned that possibility.  Go look at the WoW forums as well.  Herod has literally become a boil on the ass of NA player base.  The attitudes are disgusting and need to be corrected.  
---
Put bad in, get bad out.
---
amen
---
It wont become as popular. It's a different game now filled with min/maxers
---
Because the one thing this community settled upon early on was 'no changes', even to the point where cosmetic changes such as optional updated character models were scoffed at. Now the same crowd are hyper-focused on the idea of big servers (like the anxiety that moving to Gehennas will leave you stranded on a dead server whereas Shazzrah should be a 'fun' server with tens of thousands of players) because they want the same experience they had on Nostalrius and its successors - but that experience is not at all authentic to vanilla, i.e. antithetical to 'no changes'.
---
It pisses me of to see this community which has been aggressively opposed to any modern concessions and changes is largely in favor of larger server caps than vanilla had, which is a freaking huge change.
---
&gt; Classic will make Retail an empty desert.
---
&gt; Classic will make no impact on retail
---
Idk which class you’re gonna play, but it was lame spamming chat to find a group only to hear “sorry, we already have a shadow priest”
---
But what he does isn't so hard to learn.  
---
Warrior also didnt have engineering, restorative potions or any other things.
---
And yes I will continue to beat this dead horse because I see it as the only legal way to gain a pay to win advantage in the game.
---
At least gold buying is against the ToS.
---
TBC had flying and dailies, but it also had more class/spec diversity it raids, all the raids/dungeons/zones were pretty good I think, the new class/spec spells were good and fit each class/spec well, and tbh arenas weren't all that bad. I'd rather stick with an expansion I already know is decent than give blizz the chance of ruining classic
---
My suggestions would be the write down a string of words or a quest you just finished/picked up. Then Control+F to find it on the page.
---
Yeah I found him recently as Hanky said not the best analytical videos but even his leveling videos (Owlman) are hilarious which I cant say for anyone else I watch for wow
---
It's not the same. Your metaphor fails when you imply that the tables in the restaurant are the same. A public channel in a server is not a different table but the same, private chats are different.
---
A real life example... I was in Erasmus and at a party with around 100 people we had 20ish French. They spoke only french, with other french when all the others were speaking English and interacting with each others. It was impolite and irl nobody liked it, nobody. Being in the server is more or less the same when you are using general or trade. You are in a common place and you have to respect their implicit rules.
---
If you want to tank, be a warrior. if you want to melee dps, be a rogue or a warrior. If you want to ranged dps, be a mage. If you want to heal, be a priest.

This is my favorite metric

Can you switch characters between NA and EU realms? (I will be working in Canada for first month of launch but then returning home . Will I have to restart ?)

Happy cake day !

Classic was and always will be the heart of World of Warcraft. This is when you actually had to know what you were doing. These new expansion they came out with ruined the game imo, just to please the new little bambi players who thought it was to hard... With that being said, its way more than a nostalgic feeling, its the way WoW was intended to be. In these new xpacs it is so incredibly easy to level up, get gold, get geared..etc.  the challenge of World of Warcraft was practically extinct. And to be honest I'm not exactly sure why you took the time to write this post. Its just a negative opinion aimed at everyone who is excited... Hence you are a troll.
---
You are definitely handicapping yourself by not going engineering.
---
Expecting people to do the bare fucking minimum of actually putting on the gear that is useful for raiding as a holy paladin is not elitist.  You get to wear T2 for literally everything else, standing around, pvp, farming, whatever.  You can wear your dress to raid for a couple hours.
---
Just look at that vevmeisters comment history. He even posted on this subreddit a year or so ago with the title " **So why exactly are you people hyped about this?** ", it's been removed since because a mod said it was a bait thread. Some people have always got so angry over people wanting classic, it's soooo odd to me.
---
haha I have the exact same one! I hadn't had to use it for like 3ish years and I moved across the damn country and some how managed to hold onto it "juuuuust in case"
---
I love this idea. Being able to play each xpac as it is if you want to.
---
I was mainly asking tank heals or DPS but since you and another guy both responded with DPS classes I'm taking that as a sign haha. Thank you. I played mage in vanilla so I might be considering a different class but mages are great.
---
I am sorry, but Retail is not relevant here. Retail lives off MTX. Blizzard doesn't give a flying fuck on what people want, unless they ask for more store mounts and pets.
---
That one tauren just scratching himself
---
It doesnt matter what youre doin, just as long as you look good doin it- David Lee Roth
---
Then let's make 100 servers! That's probably not enough anyway.
---
i realy hope this wont be the case with all these special snowflake babies around these days
---
The way they described it is that a "layer" is literally continent sized shard.
---
Too busy trying to stay away from the voodoo, that shit will get you!
---
Made me reconsider.  It's tough decision, do I want stealth to ambush, or a clear dots.
---
I don't think difficulty is the right way to explain it. In terms of boss mechanics retail is far more difficult than any vanilla boss ever was, and through mythic + they've created dungeons far more difficult than anything ever in vanilla. 
---
IMO they've damaged the game in so many ways, I honestly could write a 10 page essay on what's ruining modern WoW. 
---
You have a choose your own difficulty option on almost all content, this is not in line with the rpg genre and undermines immersion. They've segmented the player population into those who do raidfinder, those who do normals, those who do heroic, and those who do mythics. You can have easy or difficult content in a game, but it shouldn't be trivialized to shuttle as many players through the content as possible, and then to artificially ramp up the difficulty to try to appeal to hardcore crowds. Nobody is pleased with that design, it seems half-assed because it is.  
---
Blizzard seems to view leveling as a punishment and they've made the leveling experience as miserable as possible to reflect that. 
---
Making players do the virtual equivalent of chores before they can even start playing the 'real' game is a bad idea, they should just make leveling and the open world fun again. 
---
The philosophy of only max level matters has been made worse every xpac. They have even gone out of their way to destroy old content to make current content seem more interesting or to drive some new storyline they've come up with that nobody cares about. Blowing up the barrens to make a cool cinematic, not a great idea in hindsight, and yet they keep doing it. 
---
This is starting to get too long already so I'll just list out the main issues without expanding on them:
---
* Gear level RNG. The days of simple loot tables are no more. (gambling addictive psychology)
---
* Trivialized loot rewards (too many)
---
* Replacement raid tiers instead of progression tiers (destroys content thats only a few months old)
---
* Loot boxes (gambling addictive psychology)
---
* Daily quests, world quests (FOMO addictive psychology)
---
* Flying mounts (destroys open world content)
---
* Raid finder, group finder, pvp queues, being able to enter instanced content from anywhere. (destroys open world experience, not rpg like)
---
* Instanced open world zones. Destroying open world content (already bad), then trying to bring it back through 'timetravel' npc mobs who allow you enter the old content destroyed zones (even worse)
---
* Changing old dungeons or entirely replacing them to make them easier for dungeon finder groups (destruction of old content)
---
* Making all open world content soloable. (No community interaction)
---
* Making crafting professions obsolete through increased gear rewards
---
* Destroying old profession recipes to balance new content
---
* Introducing fully implemented mini games, aka pet battles (non immersive)
---
* Micro transactions on a game that already requires upfront purchases and monthly subscriptions (greedy)
---
* Nerfing and changing ALL old items to balance new content (destruction of old content)
---
* instanced arenas and the competitive balancing of classes that it created, further trivialization of open world pvp or open world arenas like Gurubashi (if arenas exist they should be in an open world location)
---
* homogenization of classes (they're all the same)
---
* removal of iconic class abilities (destruction of content)
---
* removal of talent trees (less customization)
---
* automatic learning of skills and the simplification/removal of abilities (non rpg-like, destruction of content)
---
* heirloom armor (ruins old content, non-rpg like)
---
* heirloom mounts (trivializes the open world, non-rpg like)
---
* revamped abilities that are spammable (faster game pace, less rpg-like)
---
"Give me an example of blizzard lying"
---
"Here"
---
"No not like that"

This most likely. I saw a clip of the lightbulb guy and he literally said “If you send me gold in game I’ll say your name on stream” like wtf
---
Warlock was the dps class I was thinking of so I might give that a go. Thanks.
---
I'll post you my list when I get home.
---
This last month or two has seemed [very familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzOHq5WbQ8k).
---
Look the bright side, Gives ya something to look forward to
---
With people like you, who don't understand that layering is not sharding...no wonder stupid layering topics and comment still exist.
---
You guys are so funny I wish I could have a sense of humour like you, meh I’ll just stick to ninja looting BiS swords and daggers and needing on shadowgems
---
You've never been able to do that in retail, so why would you be able to do it in Classic? I mean, I can't point you to a place that says no at the drop of a hat, but I wouldn't count on it.
---
Extremely apt.
---
Retail wow feels really aids and homogenized. Not only heavily catered to for the casual crowd
---
It saddens me that so many people are concerned that their racial choice "isn't viable".  
---
Anyway, good story and I'm glad OP got immersed in the story and made a faction choice based on some faction loyalty!
---
0.3% chance drop from a rare spawn out of the way. I doubt many people have even heard of it.
---
Im saying in theory cause my server is only high right now and not full also I have no idea if it'll be laggy come a few months hence why im sticking where I am.
---
Anyone have any advice for druids on how to take on each class? I know mage you just want to outlast their mana, warlock and shadow priest you run away, still trying to find info on how to beat rogues and hunters
---
Ask yourself if you would have made a similar comment if someone was mentioning their wife, the answer is probably no
---
I'm fairly certain ActiBlizz have plans to fill that void, after the dust settles and all the reviews are on Metacritic.
---
Pretty much this.
---
How did you come to that conclusion?
---
Some streamers also use Patreon, which is another site that takes donations for content. The subscribers or donators are called “patrons”
---
Your delusional lol
---
I never knew if you could or not that's why I asked. Sorry
---
You're going to find there are assholes everywhere in life, it doesn't mean everyone is an asshole though.
---
This is literally what you do in classic until you get aimed shot/multi shot. Then you just press those two, as you would in retail (press two/three buttons).
---
I still have the D2 mindset that potting in PvP is a bitch move.
---
If they ever removing layering, you're going to get the longest queues in history.
---
They can merge dead servers.
---
I can’t be the only one bothered by the Paladin talent tree but two faction choices
---
&gt; I can’t imagine anybody is thinking about BC or WOTLK right now.
---
I promise you that Activision/Blizzard are definitely thinking about it. If Classic is profitable, TBC and WOTLK could have great ROI as well.
---
But they were supposed to quit in 20 min...
---
I never played classic, but for myself I know that classic gamestyle focuses more on things that I always loved about wow. I dont know if I will be one of those people that still will miss some newer features of the game but I know that I will have hella lot  of fun in the first weeks/ month. And if I have  a great game for the next half a year, thats great! Im still very excited!
---
If you really want to then I wouldn't worry for dungeons/smaller raids. The problem, atleast for MC, is that many elementals have heavy resistance to nature which severly limits you in other ways other than "just going oom" more quickly than other caster specs.
---
However, the Ele-Shams that are healing when they know their limits on some fights will always be invited in my eyes.

Two different people.
---
I think they Soul Stone'd The Golden Goose and if it doesn't want smooth are going to lose a bunch of players like myself who are wondering what the fuck I'm doing going back to wow
---
I understand what you’re saying, but I’m going to get just a little nit-picky here. 
---
What you’re saying is true for those who have already achieved something. Looking back, it’s much more rewarding if the journey was difficult. But we’re talking about people who are about to set forth on the journey. And common sense seems to tell us that if we have a choice we will take the “path of least resistance”
---
What we’re doing with WoW classic is we’re saying, as players, we demand that harder path. Metaphorically, Blizzard and retail fanboys are standing there with our luggage packed and the chopper waiting to take us to the top of the mountain. We’re telling them, I’m not getting on that chopper. I’m gonna climb that mother fucker. Of course they’re gonna think we’re being ridiculous. I can’t explain why I’d rather climb, but I know I fuckin wanna
---
To me, that seems like the easy way, but the wrong way. Why go down the exact same path that made wow a pile of garbage? Why repeat the same mistakes? I think expanding the world and staying true to the Classic philosophy is a significantly better move, albeit harder for Blizzard to do.
---
Thanks for explaining TY, I figured most people would know what Patreon/patrons is.
---
Im not a streamer
---
On the plus side at least you're no longer retarded.
---
Lots of people pay others to do things for them they don't enjoy. Do you put your own siding up or do you pay someone to do it for you? Sure, you could do it yourself but why?
---
Well edgemaster gives +7 sword so it can't be more than 1 item.
---
&gt; What's something that that've promised and then blatantly went back on?
---
Sharding. Layering is sharding with a different name.
---
What’s the difference between subbing on Aug 1st and trying to log in on release, as opposed to someone subbing on the morning of Aug 26th and trying to log in?
---
Now you just push a button! 
---
Seriously. It's the small things that add up and make anything worth while. Otherwise you dont have to think and youre just there to push the buttons.
---
Y’all think they’ll release it a bit early?
---
I love MadSeason, he's so chill in his videos.

Does anyone know how this thing works? Does it have a battery? Is the code received through wi-fi? Does an algorithm use a clock to generate the code both on blizzards end and in the authenticator? I've always wondered...
---
He has transcended us.
---
Time spent having fun is not time wasted
---
No, I don't think they want classic to overtake retail, but rather went with classic to boost the total sub count. God knows what they'll do when they realize classic is going to surpass retail.
---
[http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs\_tools/graph/](http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/)
---
There's the info there, it's grown quite a lot. Especially with their mobile app.
---
Why do we have to have this circlejerk every day on this sub?
---
You're allowed to like both Classic and Retail lol
---
Should be pre-raid orders, would increase clientele over the coming months.
---
Your initial post was about "Classic will make Retail an empty desert", then you moved the goal-posts to "Classic will make no impact on retail".
---
There's no point in discussion if you can't even keep your argument consistent for more than 10 minutes.
---
I dont get the logic with this argument. "If no one moves it will be a dead server so I wont move." Its circular and doesn't make much sense. The servers arent even open yet.
---
Classic will be around for years. People will be rerolling all over the place. Just pick one and do your thing. Its not like there are 100 servers to thin the heard.
---
This will be healthy for the very start of the world, this is the exact reason it is being implemented. Nobody would be able to progress their crafting, quests, or anything else if they were constantly fighting over everything. But if the servers are completely capped out once layering is gone? The economies are going to become very strict.
---
Sounds like a joke about the state of retail
---
That sub you bought can actually be used to play retail wow, lesser known fact. In retail in 8.2 they added a world quest which is literally bejeweled.
---
My main concern about BGs is the wall jumping spots (&amp; portal MC), are there any changes planned or will we have to adapt to this?
---
 While mechanics can increase skill cap (such as roof navigation), there are still some very ridicilous spots that can be abused. I think most players won’t know how to deal with this either.
---
And since you need to group for basically everything in vanilla there will be lots of socializing.
---
Druids can do DM Trib as well if they have engineering, which ends up being their better options gph wise.
---
Methods I like in addition to this (but give less gph):
---
Mara runs (I forgot the 3 bosses, but it's the same ones most people do) 
---
DME 2man boss farm (can either be tank or healer)
---
Stealth BRD runs (especially with rogue)
---
Strat orb farming (can either be tank or healer. is one of the lesser options gph wise, but is good to break up the monotony and make friends as it is usually done as a duo or trio)
---
Druids can also farm the eye shadow like I mentioned for locks, but they are far less efficient at it, so it isn't worth it.
---
Recipes will appear at your trainer as you increase your skill. The hardest part for a newbie will probably be to actually find the trainer to acquire the trade skill. After that it is a VERY straight forward system that I can't imagine isn't self explanatory to you.
---
Thank you. Could be a potential lagfest at launch so
---
Personally, I won't get bored with Classic, I just won't be able to partake in endgame. 2006 me and 2019 are completely different. I was single back then and free to do what I wanted. Now, married with kids my freetime is limited.
---
As others have mentioned there are a lot of PvP benefits. 
---
For s priest though I think you’d likely be better off enchanting and tailoring as you intended. 
---
Many people don’t level engineering but end up dropping another profession at 60 to grab engineering.
---
Could you crate a macro to equip this/Spurs/gloves and summon your mount at the same time?
---
what's the difference you fucking manlet
---
if theyre on a pvp server, reporting someone for even camping you won't do anything
---
Eitherway, it will be total mess
---
Is it that much of a false hope? The game got a community similar to that of Warcraft 3 and PoE numbers show that kind of game is still well received.
---
I wouldn't be surprised to see Diablo 2 getting it's remaster once WC3 is done
---
Imagine being a cheater and paypig but only receiving marginal benefits.
---

---
Theres a difference between adding content and completely changing core game aspects.
---
You never had me. You never had your mount!
---
I still play retail so it's discussion in world chat usually with retail fanboys telling everyone "IT'S NOSTALGIA U LEAVE AFTER WEEK HAHAHAH" however the good thing is, I can check their profiles and see what content they're doing. And I can tell you from my experience 90% of Classic haters I've met on retail are LFR heroes and tmog/mount farmers. Of course they're hating on it.
---
Something about resting and recovering. I forget. This video will explain the lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uA-LT6FF8k
---
The Classic FAQ on Blizzard’s website states that cross-realm BGs will be in when BGs launch.
---
Well met
---
Blizzard really screwed up this launch. There should have been 4 EST servers to begin with since there are no CST ones.
---
This is the Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau server.
---
You need to switch region under World of Warcraft section to get back to EU.
---
My only responsibility is my subscription fee and following the ToS. I dont get all the hyperbole over this.
---
Some chill streamer.
---
Playing classic requires complete edition or?
---
Hell, he can still ask for people in General/Trade chat, but apparently that's too inconvenient for him so he is forced to put up with the &lt;Insert Foreigner&gt; whose first reaction to anything dropping, is typing "you need" followed by "?" in the instance channel.
---
Well, I guess Blizzard has forced our hand by giving us this tool. /shrug
---
I really do not think that WC2's plot had anything to do with my obsession with vanilla. The plot of wow classic, The entire lore of the warcraft universe i don't think really matters. We made our own lore and stories. 
---
I think at some point classic will surpass the 12 million mark and we will just have to wait and see. I appreciate your opinions and they make sense. It will be fun to look back on this conversation in a couple years to see who looks foolish.
---
Prove it. I'll gladly watch a clip where they say they are looking into solutions but don't have any solid plans yet.
---
Discord for private and guild servers sure. We didn't have meme factories back in 2004 and we don't need 'em now.
---
Great video.  The chills and memories are so good.
---
True, but pay attention to the vid, a lot of those players are terrible. I hated seeing maydie go down like that, however had he have been a dwarf, different outcome. Regardless that dude is good.
---
Many guilds are likely to sell raid spots later on for gold. Happened a lot in Vanilla. Not really much difference imo.
---
Here are a few thoughts for you.  
---
Bone Slicing Hatchet &gt; Bonescraper  
---
Pick up hawk eye in MM tree, it adds too much utility for you to pass up  
---
I also would recommend the 2/31/18 build depending on how much +hit you have. The surefooted passive is amazing, especially for early raiding when you may sacrifice stats for the hit-cap.
---
That was an idea not a promise. Layering can hold more people which is why they went with that one
---
Sadly there's not much point in argueing because you're not looking at this from an objective standpoint. We both think Classic WoW is the best thing ever, but unless this game hits worldwide headlines and blizzard starts doing some crazy marketing it really isn't going to happen as much as you may hope.
---
I really do hope you prove me wrong though. I really do. None of us can know for sure until the game is actually out.
---
Except you missed nothing because FFXIV is the same game it was since ARR with the difference being leveling is worse than ever and story better than ever.
---
There is nothing else to play depending on what you enjoy. I can't stand FFXIV aside from the story.  I am not saying FFXIV is bad, it is a good game. However not everyone likes that formula and quite frankly if you don't you are in a bit of a pinch because the options are then very limited for good MMORPGs.
---
No really? The only duplicates are the first and third entry, and based on the countless amount of threads here asking what people need to play Classic, I’d say the third entry is 100% warranted.
---
The Atiesh Discord seem pretty good.
---
ElvUi is pretty much a full UI solution. It is super vast and has tons of modules. Anything you can think of, UI wise, will probably be in the core ElvUI package.
---
There is also support for custom modules that can be made and shared with others.
---
Around 600.
---
"Empty desert" wasn't my post Bucko. I think you need to go outside and chill a little bit, you're starting to lose it. To state that Classic will make no impact on Retail when literally the entire WoW community was waiting for it to release, it's...Yeah.
---
I agree with this, played a rogue with lw/skin as I leveled in classic and the gear was almost never worth making compared to what I got from quests or the AH. It ended up being a big time/money sink that in retrospect I wished I hadn't bothered with.
---
There were occasionally blue items I could craft that were very nice, but gathering the mats was not worth the time I spent, and I couldn't afford them off the AH. And then I just ended up vendoring them a few levels later because a green quest reward was better.
---
I would say that the only armor-crafting tradeskill that's worth it while leveling is tailoring, because a) you don't need to fill another skill slot with the gathering skill and b) you can make bags. Something like tailor/mining/herb is ideal while leveling because you can almost certainly AH all the mats you gather and make bags for yourself.
---
Blizzard, or at least the WoW devs never outright "promise" something, as far as I can remember but they know how to use semantics, which is why many people are often upset with them when Blizzard doesn't do what they said.
---
Requires a sub.
---
Holy shit that's dedication right there

No.. They said it was one of many ideas. Not "this is happening"

From what I know all classic servers are actually located in NA. Networks today are much faster, so I don't expect any lag no matter the server location.
---
I just said people mistrust Blizz, that doesn't necessarily include me :D
---
I wouldn't mind the inclusion of TBC zones/dungeons/races, but I really really dislike flying, so I wouldn't mind that gone. I think Classic could be used as a fresh start, a new foundation, but I suppose I understand why people are afraid, that Blizzard might do the same mistakes again.
---
Still have my Blizzcon Paris one!
---
Could you give me names of other 2 items?
---
It's fine prior to the introduction of flying.

After that though, campers could control an entire zone as long as they wanted, flying at 310 speed and 1 shotting you before you even saw them .

I just want to log in and play.   
---
Just hearing the original logging screen almost made me tear up from nostalgia, i can't wait to just play!

Thank you for reminding me that this video exists.
---
3 items? Could you give me names of these items:)
---
Yes that's what I've been reading about locks and shammies but I'm torn because my shamans name is too good, captinplanet
---
You'll get pushed out of guilds that want to go more tryhard/competitive but there will probably be a more casual guild willing to take an Ele shaman. It's basically a tradeoff, if you play a non-optimal spec you can't expect your other raidmates to play optimally either. From personal experience resto shaman is really fun in raids though, healing in general is more interesting than doing DPS because you're reacting to things and making quick decisions instead of spamming your dps rotation.

---
About changing strafe to A/D, you might not want to do that if you're melee. Turning with A/D and strafing with Q/E still allows you to easily circle around an enemy with Q+D or E+A, without having to turn via mouse.
---
Although not great for crafting gear for yourself while leveling (this is mostly due to some recipes requiring weird items to craft and it usually just being optimal to make a bunch of the same item to get to 300 LW). Once you get your LW high enough you will be able to specialize dragonscale leatherworking which has really good hunter gear in the 45-60 range. Some pieces often end up being close to best pre-raid gear, and can be advantageous because they're obtainable solo without grouping for dungeons.
---
That is fair. I'm going to stick to my belief that at some point classic wow will grow to become bigger than it ever was. Eventually I think that they will start creating content that was originally planned before BC but got scrapped.
---
Preaching to the choir here.  It’s not 2006 anymore.  Almost everyone knows classic has the hybrid tax.
---
Careful, you're right on the verge of giving some folks here motivation to level irl.  I hear it's even harder out there the rewards that much more meaningful.

Even in their worst state of MC locks are doing about 300 more dps than the best ele shaman
---
You should do whatever the fuck you want and find people to play with that let you do whatever the fuck you want (they exist). Stop making these threads.
---
People keep forgetting this basic concept. The world has a finite space. Players have been saying they don't want changes. That means resources, mobs, etc etc can't spawn more frequently/densely to compensate for more players. This means there HAS to be a limit to how many players there are or there HAS to be "layers" or "phases" but we as a community don't want those because they would fracture the community. So we need server caps. It's healthy for the game. 
---
Anybody who has ever played an mmo who thinks they need to have 3999 other people simultaneously in that world for it to feel alive is lying to themselves. 
---
As you said 2500-3000 was maybe the "high/full" of old servers. Even medium pop servers felt ALIVE in the old days. Blizzard is saying these new "medium-high" are way more full than even the highest of old wow servers. There is a reason they are almost begging people to change servers.
---
Then you are retarded &lt;3
---
Yeah if the post had said that we would be in a different situation. I’m going off the post, not your added ideas
---
Not Vanilla, but in WotLK, I had a guildie who would swap trinkets constantly while raiding.  He usually had the wrong trinkets equipped half of the time, and we’d hear him complaining about his own errors during/after the attempt
---
Agreed. A method to switch that isnt on the fly, or a hefty cooldown, would be nice.
---
But can totally get away with one button and be fine
---
MC had a lot of loot added later on. If they are going after timeline Majordomus shouldnt have loot at all. And the loot table of most bosses are really slim
---
It’s such a minor thing that doesn’t alter the landscape of the game though. Although more recently they did promise reworks for Shaman specs after BfA launch which didn’t happen.
---
I'd like to give a special mention to the long, boring trash clear after twin emps.  People would start to lose focus or afk at that point of the night, doubly so because it was just trash, and god forbid you actually wiped, the ride/run back was so long and gave people plenty of opportunity to blame each other.
---
Perfect. So let's all learn Mandarin. It is the most spoken language in the world. That way we can all speak the same language.
---
I suppose you think everyone should learn English because it's the only language you speak. I know a lot of monolinguals but the English ones are by far the most snobby about their language. Somehow they are proud that they only speak English.
---
Have been a troll main for 5 years and something that always bothered me is most of the hairstyles are too small and as a result the  troll head looks too small. For both female and male I use the "full" style almost exclusively.
---
Horde are a big chunk of endgame players in every xpac and PvP servers tend to lean Horde. Horde is a much safer bet if you are playing on a pvp server.
---
There aren’t specific items I’m thinking of, you can enchant boots with Mithril spurs and there is a riding enchant for gloves.
---
Lol the raids were easy as fuck compared to modern raids. I played since classic (thanks maxim magazine for sending me a free 30 day trial) and this is hilarious to me
---
Wow classic was just tedious not hard
---
You created your account at 6:02 am?
---
I still use mine that I got at Blizzcom 2009. Crazy that was fucking 10 years ago. Works fine.
---
There's also Gehennas, Don't forget us!
---
Cool
---
I was in the camp that despised MoP, but I like to think I've mellowed a bit over the years. I still have nothing but hate in my heart for Pandaren, even, to some extent, the entire setting of Pandaria. But, the gameplay was fun. The dungeons were good, the raids were good. The classes were mostly good. If they were to re-release MoP down the line as a continuation of the Classic re-release, yeah, I would play it.
---
aw man okay well plans are canceled then I'm sorry you're right this isn't special anymore ;(
---
don't fucking remind me lol
---
Level 20 ish zones are contested
---
Don't get me wrong, I loved TBC at the time and HFP took my breath away. But I did notice a marked drop in world PvP once I got my flight form and it was quite noticeable how dead the rest of the world was when you occasionally went back to Azeroth.
---
You're right in saying that things didn't get really bad until Cata, but the seeds were sewn in TBC.
---
I so wish they’d also make WotLK servers. I loved it. I’d resubscribe to WoW in a heartbeat.
---
Oh darn. One exception. I guess Paladins and warlocks getting mounts for free is instant gratification too? Or "bUt iTS cLAsSiC" it's cool?
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Why would I imagine that? I did it already, I don't have to imagine
---
beyond the lag, the game world wasn't designed for a population that size. The economy would become inflated with multiple times the amount of gold being generated by the playerbase via quests and loot
---
Low effort troll
---
This triggers me
---
It's not that we see no evil, we'd just rather play a challenging version of the game.
---
that is like the average playtime to get to level 60 :S
---
Of course Blizzard schedules release when a lot of colleges are starting up again, well played blizz
---
Masters students typically have night classes hence not being able to raid in evenings. What I was trying to say basically
---
yeah... after that it went downhill quick. i tried every expansion, but it just isn't the same anymore. everything is so washed down to cater the casual player that i just can't enjoy it as i used to.
---
classic will bring that back for me. so kids and people under 20 without any dedication can stay on fucking retail. please, stay out and let us enjoy the real world of warcraft at its supposed to be.
---
“Just a few small changes to make things better” is how you get retail wow. We’re here for vanilla, not “perfect wow” (because we already know blizzard is rly RLY bad at attempting to make “perfect wow”)
---
The Xfire intro *reeeaaally* took me back
---
Get online, get level 15, tame wind serpent. Maybe fiddle with some professions.
---
Im just waiting for that sweet honor grinding lol
---
I mean it takes me less than an hour as well, but that doesn't mean I would want to spend that money on this lol.
---
If you haven’t already I would look up a video on this since it’s gonna be a big crazy long grind just like Thunderfury.
---
Yes - they said original cap was just a technical issue.
---
Source - video interview with a dev
---
Exactly, with flying mount, dungeon finder and arena, TBC is closer to Retail BFA than Classic. 
---
All the above kill world pvp, Azeroth and social aspects of the game. 
---
Why go down that road again?
---
Those gut shots. Each one hurt me.
---
One day you will realize the real world doesnt work the way it does online. Social media is lying to you kid. Your virtue signaling days are limited so take solace in feeling superior to others that are more crude than you while you can. The truth will hurt when it hits you.
---
I know it's pretty popular but never knew how extreme it was tbh
---
nah it will be filled with 
---
look at this nice que!
---
layering sucks
---
i got my first EPIC (its a green)
---
killed this RAIDBOSS OMG(hogger)
---
just got to level 40 here's my ride
---
look at all these friends i have now
---
etc
---
So is RMT basically paying people to raid content for you?
---
That's unsurprising, after the puzzle daily quests that Dalaran something gave last expansion. I've popped on retail a couple of times to kill time before Classic, but mainly just grinding out more Northrend Loremaster while queueing for Temple of Kotmogu, I'm only 3 wins from the ToK Master achievement so I might as well get that done before I never log into retail again lol
---
You are always PvP-flagged if you're in a Contested (Yellow) or Hostile (Red) zone.
---
There is nothing stopping high-level players from non-stop corpse-camping you. So if you have any intention of actually playing the game, consider a PvE server.
---
The few instances of world-PvP 40vs40 slug-fests aren't really worth the hours of time you lose because some lvl60 rogue is angry that BGs won't be released until phase 3.
---
Combat is typically the go-to for PvE I believe.
---
That's a fair point. Perhaps instead of having us switch on the fly we could specify talent builds that automatically apply in dungeons/Bags/Raids/The Open World?
---
Or maybe the retail-esque switching is just the most elegant solution, fuck, I dunno!
---
Which is what they should do IMO, at least if it's just with Shazzrah and Herod which are looking to be the 2 'big' servers in NA/EU respectively.
---
Like, people, this time around they've warned you of the overpopulation and the queue, if you insist on sticking around anyway then don't be surprised when it hits you in the face.
---
You have a server, or realm in WoW's case. On that server is the world, the continents you play on in the form of Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor. Let's say the default is layer 0. A layer is a certain amount of people from your realm and acts like a virtual server copy. Imagine a big bubble as the server and each layer is a smaller bubble inside that big one. Once a certain player threshold in layer 0 is reached it creates layer 1, 2, 3 and so on and puts people in those. It helps thin out the population on a continent in order to offer a smoother gaming experience while still keeping server communities intact, as   every layer only has people you can meet on your own server. People the layers on Herod will never meet someone from Stalagg in the world or instances.
---
Some people, especially on this sub, are skeptic or even straight up hostile towards the idea of layering because they fear it will destroy the server community as it allows for more people to access farmable high end resources like Black Lotus. They also fear it will destroy server communities because they think it is sharding, which takes people from the whole region you are in as well as sharding singular zones or even subzones. And the third fear they have is that layering will last indefinitely, despite the classic devs as well as Ion (head of the retail and classic teams) repeatedly saying it will be removed by the time Phase 2 rolls around, if not earlier.
---
it has nothing to do with difficulty.
---
If you think you should play whatever you want, then do it in a battleground.
---
If there are 39 other people committing to the raid group. Managing their real life responsibilities in a way that allows them to show up for the raid. Guild leader and officers taking care and managing all the shit that come with running a guild. Everyone spending time and money into getting ready to help others and themselves to clear content.
---
The least you can do is not play badly on purpose.
---
I can't DPS with a Stick on a Warrior just because I want to. Show respect to your guild by doing what's best for everyone.
---
No one forced you into a role. So don't pick a class that suck in the role you choose just because you want to do whatever the fuck you want.
---
Did nost devs actually work with and help blizzard?  I remember seeing a picture of them with blizzard but I wasn’t sure if that was a meet and greet or not.
---
Duuuuude! You have no idea how long I’ve looked for this! My brothers and I watched it back during vanilla, and have quoted it ever since!
---
THANK YOU for helping find this!
---
Try binding abilities to mousewheelup and mousewheeldown, helped me out a lot.  (you can bind zoom to shift+mwheelup&amp;down)

Everyone denigrating nostalgia, but nostalgia is an incredibly powerful emotion and shouldn't really be underestimated or undersold, here. People with means will cheerfully part with millions of dollars pursuing it, and being able to evoke it is not a small achievement.
---
Maybe the most essential scene in Mad Men had the following to say about nostalgia, and it's fairly relevant to the question of Retail vs Classic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus

Fairbanks hit high pop a few days ago. From what the official discord channel says it's split about 55:45 horde having the slightly larger pop.

WOOOOOOOO!
---
I'll never understand why English monolinguals are so proud to only speak one language. I know a guy who will yell at people to stop speaking French near him even if nobody's talking to him. So we just speak French around him now.
---
m+ was one of the main reasons I quit during legion after coming back after quitting in cata. I don't want to endlessly run dungeons. I just view them as stepping stones for raids so the fact that I had to run maw of souls a million times for AP really fucking bothered me.
---
dont understand the whole "no changes" sentiment from the private server community when it sounded like their servers had a lot of changes
---
Remember wotlk? When humans got every man for himself, and literally every min-maxer switched to alliance for the free trinket slot? 
---
That was fucking awful being horde.
---
Engineering significantly benefits you in combat whereas alchemy can easily be done on an alt
---
But is it only "asfd" or could you be asjfbejf" and "kdgnw"?
---
On a bit of a tangent have you seen the post of foot tacos?
---
There are two servers for the Oceanic region. Neither of them will be dead. In fact I think the PvE one will grow significantly once people get a taste of STV on a PvP server
---
Account sharing and I'd assume mass-world hopping.
---
I have no idea how it works either personally, I just know it's being done. Looking at a site right now for time-lost and while they don't give much info regarding the process apart from it using account-sharing, it's a 1-30 day process where the user shouldn't log in.
---
It was a good one.
---
That was also the drop for me. Every zone shattered! Also hate wod even if I only played for a week. The alternate Timeline fucked everything over even more since Im a guy who cares for the lore.
---
Never played private server. I just can speak from my experience which was on the Stormrage server back in 2005-2006. No guild cleared Naxx but we were competing with multiple alliance guilds in AQ40 and I remember all their pallies running around in T2 and T2.5.
---
All of Majordomo Executus loot was added in patch 1.4, which is associated with phase 2. It's at least somewhat likely that Majordomo simply will not drop anything in phase 1 and you'll have to wait until phase 2 before you can get anything associated with the Priest and Hunter quests started by Majordomo loot.
---
You know why they let shadow priests in raid groups at all? Do you remember the reason for shadow priests in raid content? They had a passive that buffs shadow damage dealt by the party. You are literally only allowed in bc you buff the warlocks. That’s not really class identity. Hell, you can’t even cast your highest damage spells in a raid environment bc they heal you and generate too much threat to be worth the damage. As s-priest you’re 75% of a whole afflic lock with a 10% damage boost to the non-watered version of your spec. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m as excited as the next guy, but goggles with rosy lenses in them are very chic on this sub
---
Yeah, true.
---
Wow okay that sounds so unreal to someone who has never experienced that. I wonder if this works out today still with all the deceiving and betrayal people seem to find normal today.  I remember once during late wotlk someone created a saphiron 25 3D run (?) where the black and twilight drake mounts drop and snatched them both as loot master and everyone was just stunned at how rude this guy was. Fast forward to nowadays I think people would get over it in a minute or two.
---
Yeah on my server this was a real pain in the butt. If you were doing lower level stuff and had nobody available to help it was impossible to complete some quests.. but I get that community feeling, I heard many people miss this a lot.
---
Fair point. 
---
But I also think it’s reasonable that the community assist Blizzard with reporting scammers, bots, etc rather than just expecting Blizzard to catch them all.
---
Uhhh orb of deception?
---
If you have a subscription you can definitely preload/reserve character names aka choose faction, race, and class for up to 3 characters.
---
You are calling for a new continent, new raids, new dungeons. Just the way you personally want it instead of how a majority, and the devs want it
---
you underestimate the number of people who didn't care about name reserving and wait with their subscription for launch.
---
I assume they will need both types of servers.
---
Why bother with faster midn blast?
---
Almost nothing made by Engineers can be used without Engineering

What is the deal with lfg chat or whatever it's called. I played vanilla and tbc and always just advertised in the zone the dungeon was in. The same goes for global chat. It feels so wrong to me. When looking for a group will I have to participate in it or not? And how big do these channels get?
---
I really want to Priest heal as ice been healing since LK. Question is, should I level as holy (going solo) the whole way or is it easy to level as shadow then pick up holy as a dual spec?
---
Whatever you say, super chief.
---
The game has only gotten more elitist over time, and I say that as someone who was as super elitist asshole from BC through Wrath until I chilled the fuck out after Cata came and ruined the game for me.
---
Back in Vanilla, if I wanted to do a dungeon, I'd find a tank, a healer, and some more DPS, or I'd hop in a group that was advertising they were looking for a DPS, sometimes they didn't want a hunter, and I'd be out of luck, oh well.  I look at that like I go to the pub and ask for a stout and all they have is IPA's and I go home without having a pint, except its less sucky in game because I didn't waste time driving to the pub in the first place.  But if I did get into a group or get my own group going, I have way more incentive to keep the group together even if the run gets a little rough and we wipe.  Nowadays people are so fucking quick on the vote kick if they even *think* someone did something wrong, its insane.  DPS is pulling before the tank can even hit the mob?  "Bad tank, kick".  Not even a full fucking sentence, just as few words as they can string together to hopefully get the point across.  People will kick you if you say "I haven't played in a while, I don't quite remember the path through this dungeon".  You want to talk about fucking elitists, even the most casual shitter in 2019 is way more elitist than the average player was in 2005.
---
You're worried about stuff like gearscore or raider.io, that shit doesn't exist in Classic, and anyone who tries using it as some kind of benchmark is just going to get laughed at, because that isn't the spirit of Vanilla WoW and you can take your gearscore bullshit and shove it up your retail ass.
---
The OP didn’t talk about anything being grindy or “time consuming” now, did he ? He mentioned that he died because of aggroing too many mobs or having them outdps him/ heal themselves to full health. And that is true, Vanilla mobs around the world are more dangerous than in retail. Now life + hits harder = more DIFFICULT to kill. That’s literally what Heroic mode was initially about when it was launched in BC.
---
As for Mythic, it would be important to note that most of the playerbase does not play it, contrary to leveling in Vanilla, hence why for most people the game as a whole can feel harder.
---
Also, Mythic difficulty is so extreme it’s not even interesting gameplay wise, and it eventually boils down to RNG to an extent. How many pulls did Method have on bosses like Archimonde M, 800+ ? The best players in the world, who definitely have all the “skill” needed to beat any encounter in the game, people who have literally YEARS of /played have to attempt a boss 800+ times to even kill ? I mean at that point it’s not even a matter of “skill”, it’s just about having serial wipes long enough to memorize all the game mechanics of a single specific encounter to perfection, and then to have a random perfect pull and get the kill. 
---
Some people may like this sort of “difficulty”, but to me it’s quite tasteless. You can’t even kill a single boss in Mythic without having shittons of addons telling you what to do at every single second, so much for “a game”. I’d much prefer having less mechanically challenging bosses on which nobody has any sort of info - like it was done during new patches in Vanilla - than that.
---
Zug zug
---
Exactly, with flying mount, dungeon finder and arena, TBC is closer to Retail than Classic.
---
All the above kill world pvp, Azeroth and social aspects of the game.
---
Why go down that road again that make BFA a big pile of shit? 
---
If we start with TBC people will ask for every next expansion until retail and spread the player base.
---
So does my fathers! We both got the core hound authenticator, I eventually replaced mine with the phone app but he kept this one and still works!
---
The dungeons are going to be way less challenging than high keys tho, which I think is why retail players see it as more of a “grind”
---
I think maybe I'm thinking more about random gear in TBC. That shit was bonkers.
---
Reminds me of Napoleon's tomb.
---
Well I haven't heard that number before, but I'm glad so many people politely pointed that out.
---
I believe so. On the first stress test I was able to make my character before the enter world button was enabled, and it ticked on while I was in the character selection screen
---
some things that people deem "suck" are actually good for the game.
---
I played the stress tests on a 2012 Macbook. I had to reduce the video quality, otherwise it was very pixelated and rough on the edges. But once the settings went down it ran fine, just not going to play as crisp and clear as like a 60hz+ monitor.
---
No, normally it was any and all.
---
I'm starting to think of renaming my Herod Rogue to "Movetostalagg" and ganking the shit out of the starting areas.
---
Technically the ones about it lasting X time and everyone quitting haven't been PROVEN wrong yet lol, but Yeah probably wrong.
---
im thinking someone didn't play vanilla....
---
It's easy to have dumb opinions on the internet because you don't have to admit when you're wrong.
---
MEET ME AT XR, BITCH
---
!remindme 1 year
---
Why would people here care? play the game and show, not tell.
---
I agree. The moment you step into that direction, there's no coming back. Classic should just stay classic forever. Release TBC and WotLK for those that want it.
---
Once everybody gets fed up with classic, just reset the servers or make seasons like they do on diablo 2 or path of exile, so the hype gets renewed every 1 or 2 years. Every good fresh private servers was always hyped, it will be the same thing on classic.
---
No. I will be playing PVP. Why?

Yes. This person is probably one of her close followers that’s bitter about it

With the pops as they are devilsaurs are going to be 100% camped by whatever big guilds are around and that's if Blizzard decides cross-faction mafias are against the ToS and starts banning for it. Otherwise devilsaurs will be completely controlled by trolls who will jack up the prices and gank anyone else who dares to farm them.
---
Moderating chat channels is a much harder problem than their bot detection method (which, in the US, is mostly just making sure you aren't running bot software)

I’m going to try to ignore it, I know I won’t but will try. Last thing I want is to burn myself out before release.

Didn't they rehire a handful of Vanilla devs for Classic?

---
&gt; however none of these changes have been made without a community vote. 
---
That is just not true at all. They have made plenty of changes without polling it, and they've gotten plenty of backlash because of it. The dock in Draynor, the house in Lumbridge, the ten million changes they've made to serpentine helm over the years. Jages *loves* picking and choosing what changes get polled and what changes get added to the game without warning.  
---
That being said, a poll system for WoW just wouldn't work, because listening to community feedback is what got us to the current state of retail in the first place, and Activision wouldn't support a system like that either. Imagine if the same scenario for Warding in OSRS happened in WoW. The Classic team spends months of development time and money developing an exciting new profession, only to get shot down in the polls. Activision would be like "Lul like we give a fuck what they think, we spent money on this shit, you better put it in or were not funding any further development."   
---
A poll system might work for an indie MMO developer like Jagex, but it wont work for a AAA company like Activision-Blizzard.
---
the blue post that is pinned on the official forums, that talks about a new server being opened because the other pvp servers where full, mentioned this

 [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835)
---
If it does really well (which it might, we'll see) they may well give TBC the same treatment they did with Classic. It's relatively cheap for them, since the content is already made. Much cheaper than developing a new expansion. If it continues to do well, then they may add WotLK on top, as well.
---
WoW is not designed like, say, EVE Online. It's not player driven. If they launch Classic and leave it alone once the last phase is out, it'll shrink to near nothing. The game demands content. So, yeah, continuing on with expansions makes sense. They may set up some kind of transfer, since the people who love Classic, and just Classic, would likely complain and once again go to private servers if there was no permanent Classic option.

getting my first epic at lvl 17 from a quest reward feels empty and hollow as fuck
---
I remember when I returned for a very brief moment in WoD when I clicked something on the ground and it turned into a reward: "Rare ring of awes-POW!!! EPIC ring of awesomeness!"
---
... I literally stumbled over a rare ring on the ground and it also got rolled into an epic on the spot... yeah no thanks.
---
Tales of the past one trough three, but yes illegal danish close second. Art of war: Blind is awesome too
---
But, can you clear a raid will 40 meme specs
---
Holy shit, nice to see so many PoE bois around here!
---
Mained priest in vanilla and relatively early, Heal rank 1 became my go-to healing spell and by FAR my bread and butter. Of course the entire toolkit is to be considered, but Heal rank1 was the one I knew I could always cast without hurting my manapool.
---
yes, set up a wardrobe macro.
---
Play what you enjoy people.  
---
This time around there will be a lot of guilds accepting anyone and everyone, and not every guild is hardcore min/maxing. A lot of people seem to miss mentioning how much of a pain in the butt it is to have 40 people on at the same time for raid night(s). Even PUGs will want the extra body regardless of class. Sure they might prefer a mage over your Boomkin, but they are not going to cancel raid night because you applied and a mage didn't. 
---
From what I have seen on this sub, most people playing the "meme specs" (terrible name btw) know that they will be at a disadvantage compared to other classes when it comes end game raiding. Doesn't mean they won't have a blast leveling, doing 5 and 10 mans or even pvp. Raiding is a small slice of the game, and there will probably be a TON of people that don't raid because of outside responsibility. You are paying to play this game, play it the way you want. Classic WoW has a ton to offer you outside of the raiding scene, and it's more important to be enjoying yourself doing it. Otherwise, what's the point?
---
&gt; All the would accomplish is ruining yet another version of the game
---
Lets talk about this again once naxx has been out for half a year :)
---
And the server can put them on ignore and they’ll be lonely.
---
Get to level 10 without complications. Or at least 8.
---
That is correct. I am not a fan of the mods here at all.
---
It would be fun but it feels wrong to me to betray the horde. I could never attack taurens in pvp either
---
Yeah, I get that it makes sense in the context of the song, but in the context of the meme/reference, it doesn't make any sense.
---
What's so "5" about Molten Core?
---
I think most of the tourists will be picking rogue, hunter, or mage. So there should be a large drop off of those classes at 60 which makes me doubt you'd have those problems. I've also noticed a lot of guilds are still looking for rogues. I'm not really sure why that is, but if you get into a guild you shouldn't have any issues with getting leveling or dungeon groups.
---
The thing to remember is that these voices have not magically gone away. They are still out there. And with the nature of gamers being what it is, they are going to be grieving, clogging up chat channels and doing whatever they can to ruin the experience of the classic servers. 
---
Remember the individuals you come across who purposefully wipe you instance groups. Let other people know. Let your server know. Black list these individual at the first chance you get and let everyone else know what they are.
---
Ah not really the mods but the entire base of this sub. The amount of smugness and control people try to exert on Classic is disgusting.
---
If and when TBC releases you can level a paladin. But to suffer through vanilla in the hopes of TBC is not the way to enjoy yourself. Play what you want, how you want as long as you understand the limitations.
---
You can heal any dungeon or situation as shadow until 60. There's no need to level as discipline or holy unless you want to.
---
Leveling as shadow is much better for solo and leveling, and you'll be able to heal any situation just fine.
---
Using Hogger as your example is incredibly poor, as a single quest and dungeon are not the same in any sense. 
---
I began playing a couple months into the game so maybe some called it VC beforehand but literally no one did when I played so if that’s the case it was somehow entirely abandoned. 
---
It’s not a good idea to call it VC because there many times when you run single bosses in BRD and possibly other dungeons (I.e Barman shanker runs). It should follow the same naming convention of literally every single other dungeon in the entire game. But like I said it’s really not a big deal because everyone knows exactly what is meant by either, though the overwhelming majority will likely continue to use DM.

Best PvE spec is Combat Swords. I think there is a Seal Fate build that competes with it or edges it out at the very high end of content (like with Naxx gear). That said, it also depends on your gear. If you get some really great daggers, combat daggers will be better until you get good swords.
---
Best PvP spec is Subtlety with a little bit of combat. Rogues are very cooldown reliant in PvP so Preparation and Premeditation are amazing for PvP.
---
No build will ever be optimal for both, but Combat swords is perfectly fine in PvP, especially for BG's. Frankly, any rogue build will do ok in PvP if you're good with it, as the class is just generally good for PvP. Just learn how to pick your fights and when to engage and disengage from combat.
---
Dungeons are pretty easy to find groups for in classic in general. Rogue is both heavily desired and heavily played so it's kind of a mixed bag. That said, leveling and getting geared takes a long ass time so pretty much only the most dedicated guilds are going to be raiding in the first month, so you've got plenty of time to meet people and find a guild along the way. If you want to raid it shouldn't be too hard to find a guild in the first phase, but if you want to raid consistently, definitely find a guild and don't just try to find pugs forever.
---
must have bobs too! Bobs most important for streamer, that and coloured hair for the kids.
---
Ok that's the best thing I've read all week.
---
implying that you need to be tank spec to round up and aoe down entire zones
---
The difficulty is part of that. Without the difficulty the world becomes smaller as you can ignore more of it. Without difficulty the impetus to interact with other players for mutual gain isn't there. Without the difficulty the investment into ones character via RPG elements isn't there. Classic WoW is kind of like XCOM in that it's difficulty out in the world forced you to go more indepth and as a result become more engaged.
---
I'm certainly not as excited about having a job as I was back then

Hey there Malusch, this guide should help you get gold and level tailoring in a profitable manner.  Although it does have a higher upfront cost, by the end you should be profitable so it should give you a way to continue to profit off of tailoring.  I plan to make an enchanting guide soon as well, so hopefully that will help you with your journey!  Keep an eye out for it here or subscribe to our email newsletter :)
---
Who’s wasting apm on porn when there’s leveling to do?
---
i think your real two options are mining/eng or mining/blacksmith tbh
---
You're a long way from being the first to make that suggestion. Today.
---
What makes you think Blizzard won't fuck up the game if they produce additional content for classic?
---
Judging from everything Blizzard and Activision has done to WoW over the last **10 years** it is incredibly naive to believe Blizzard can add content to classic without ruining the game.
---
The playerbase increased from Vanilla to TBC and Wotlk and after Wotlk subscription numbers declined heavily to the point that Blizz won't even release them. TBC and Wotlk were well received and successful expansions. That is a fact and if those two expansions get re-released they are imo definitely going to be a massive success aswell.
---
Don't fool yourself. Blizzard isn't releasing classic for the veteran classic lovers. We are a very small minority in the grand scheme of things and Blizzard won't earn enough money from us. Subscription based MMOs are not profitable enough these days.
---
Blizzard release classic to earn money from the players that never experienced classic. The ones that are currently subbed on retail and on the edge on unsubbing, the ones that unsubbed recently or years ago.
---
I promise you Blizzard will release a cash shop in classic in a few years simply because of the insane amount of money they earn from it.
---
Maybe I am pesimisitc, but again, judging from everything Blizzard did to WoW there is no reason to trust them one bit.
---
World enlarger
---
Then go work for them and save them the trouble. Or write an addon that does the same thing. Any simple solution can be easily circumnavigated by the sellers, or greatly limit player communication.
---
A lack of layering is going to be crucial for world PvP. As many beta videos have shown, layering provides a backdoor to escape a gank in a way that breaks how the Warcraft universe should flow. Thankfully Blizzard has confirmed that Layering will be gone before the Honor system (Phase 2) so I don't have much of a problem with it being in Phase 1 to allow us to quest without 1500 people trying to tag the same mob.
---
You're definitely the one out of touch on this. Podcasts are bigger than ever.
---
It's very unlikely to.
---
But part of what layering solves is also overcrowding in specific locations, so over time as people level up there should be a better spread across all zones in the game. So even with population staying the same, layering *does* become less necessary as time goes on.
---
I mean, they basically already did this with the announcement of Stalagg. They stated that queue times are going to be terrible on Harod and suggest that you change servers. Why do you not think the exact same thing will keep happening once the game goes live? Do you not read Blue Posts?
---
Tell me where the god touched you
---
I know i won’t. You know.. bible studies and shit.
---
I'd totally buy one of these if they made new WoW Classic editions, and then probably stop and use the phone authenticator again in a week or two.
---
Hey, got a couple, so in your honest opinion:
---
* Which website provides the most profound and confirmed pieces of in-game-information on Blizzard's classic version of the game (1.12)?
---
* Which website gives me an overview on the majority of avaiable and compatible addons for/with 1.12?
---
* What is the best way to install and configure addons to prevent any major hickups from occuring when 1.12 is launched beforehand?
---
And more specificly:
---
* What is the formula for required experience-points to reach next level on any given level in 1.12?
---
* Is there a website or tool listing all quest, that you are then able to filter by more than one property (e.g. zone and required level)
---
* I know this is asking for a lot, but: Do you know of an even more detailed guide than Joana's, especially on the analysis part?
---
I hope these questions were simple enough and thanks for any help in advance :).
---
Ummm... The game hasn't launched yet.
---
As much as I love Tales of the Past, it comes in second for me. The voice acting in Illegal Danish is S Tier. TOTP 1&amp;2 has pretty awful voice over work.
---
&gt;"We want to deactivate Layering ASAP"
---
And yet, people are convinced that layering is going to remain for months and months and months right up until phase 2 launches.
---
Jeez.
---
Plenty of people.  
---
Riposte is not in any of the rogue cookie cutter pvp builds, so people often go with weapon enchants instead of weapon chain incase they meet that 1 in a 100 rogue with riposte.
---
No, they’ve said they’re going to stick with Vanilla-like server populations. From the latest Blue post about server congestion:
---
&gt;While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so.
---
No such thing as a dual spec. You will have to pay gold, up to 50g each time you want to change specs. 
---
The common practice is to level as shadow and finalize spec once 60 depending on your playstyle and role.
---
Best bet is to get into that a few days after launch when initial rush is over :p
---
Okay and a priest is unable to use a spirit weapon?
---
Priests will always make better use of mana.
---
Guilty :(
---
Cross server BGs are a thing, though. :l
---
I'm going mining/skinning as I level and then swapping skinning for blacksmithing once I reach cap
---
I mean on retail there is a massive amount of world PvP right now. I can't even go to certain zones because or alliance gank squads on sargaras. mechagon is literally off limits for horde most the time. 
---
that said, phase 2 classic will still be prbbaly the most insane experience
---
Yeah I don’t think I’d be able too either
---
Not one bit.
---
Imagine playing Runescape 2 or 3.
---
Where did all the conspiracy theorists that were parroting "Blizzard are just lying" run off to?
---
No normal sleep for me, 72 hours to start, 6 off 18 on for the rest of the week!
---
Okay. Bye!
---
&gt;the American dream. Work is proportionally rewarded
---
ahahahahhahahahahahahaha
---
Chat block seems to be a 2 second fix , am i right?
---
Does anyone know if [EzDismount](https://github.com/Voidmenull/EzDismount) will be updated for Classic? Or another addon with similar features already exists? The two biggest features I can't live without are auto dismount when using spells and auto cast when drinking. Thanks!
---
Maybe a few minutes
---
There is no dual spec. I would level as shadow and if you wanna heal later on you can respec holy.
---
I know I was actually in chat with the whole raid saying "where is the horde I don't see them" and they just kept saying we're right here run! Haha
---
dead in a month
---
Hun I'm in the real world. I can tell you that being toxic in the real world gets you no where, it gets you no where in your job and it gets you no where with friends and loved ones. 
---
Wanting to be able to enjoy yourself without people going around being twats and ruining it for other people is not "snowflake" behaviour, it's what the majority want, it's just the vocal minority that think it's cool to be edgy, like you.
---
yikes dude none of that has anything to do with communism, don't project your fears onto something you apparently don't know much about lol.
---
Sure. But these individuals will think nothing of leveling characters so they can also wipe WC and DM groups.
---
When i was raiding during down time we would sit there and gamble, so theres that.
---
I keep getting vague sentences that don't really provide any insight. I'm asking what they said they were going to do, and ended up not doing. 
---
Enh Shaman and SPriest reworks for BFA I'm unfamiliar with, did they not get a rework they were promised?
---
You’ve obviously never played on a dead unpopulated server.
---
Emerald dream raid
---
How fucked a warriors in especially world pvp alone? Is it possible to have fun or will they just get abused? My friend only plays a rouge so I have no pocket healer. Thinking about leveling a warlock instead so I'm more indepentend and also can be a havoc in solo world pvp.
---
\+ spell damage and + healing are some of, if not the most desired stats and are hard to gain as a low level.  this makes the armor that I've outlined in the guide very desirable.  If casters are willing to pay 35s for some level 20s  "\_\_\_ of the owl" items, they're going to pay much more for + spell damage.  Additionally, less inflation leads to lower material costs, as does added supply from everyone leveling, gathering, and AHing the materials needed.  No matter what, these items should be profitable from very early on.  
---
I don't disagree with your cooldown gold makers, however, if that's the only way you plan to profit off of these professions then you're missing out on a lot of ways to make additional money.
---
Yep greech knows it!
---
Thank you for the detailed response. I'm going mage. I think it will be a better experience in battlegrounds, and in leveling. The only issue is the boring PvE rotation but oh well. 
---
Maybe an alt rogue for ganking though. We'll see!
---
Gotta be insanely confusing for a new person unfortunately.. no wonder we get so many “what to buy for classic?” Posts.
---
I thought the fixed the layer "abuse"? I might be mistaken.
---
But even so, I think world pvp will still be a thing. It really depends on how many players there are per layer. I hope they keep it somewhat high.
---
As you said, the important thing is that it's gone before the honor system gets added. And being able to quest without a hundred people trying to do the same thing will also be welcome.
---
Very cool metric for estimations.  Be careful with it though, it's likely going to trigger a bunch of people who don't know how statistics and probability work.  As I recently found out, most people on this Reddit don't believe in math and their own interpretation of one obscure quote from two years ago is far more valuable than any actual statistical analysis of recent metrics.
---
I'm going to add this into my data pool to play with the numbers.  Thanks!
---
If terrorists use fear as a weapon, does that make Warlocks terrorists?
---
With that being said if a carryover announcement is made you can then level up your paladin before it launches.
---
It's a trade-off between keeping rare things rare and giving individual players a bit too much power to distort the economy
---
I was thinking ‘5 - 40 man raids’ would have sounded better
---
thats a horrible analogy. in classic everyone has a fair chance, despite it being hard and grindy. the reality of the american dream is that its not realistic to expect to live it.
---
I've not heard anyone report that it works differently, I imagine that would be big news. But no, I've never personally tested it.
---
Do you happen to know if anyone made something similar for mage?
---
Thank you! First hand experience was definitely what I was looking for. I have a 166hz ultrawide and a gaming rig for when I sit in my office and play. That said just wanted to have a lay in bed and play option or travel option.
---
Last I heard they backtracked and apologized but she never accepted it or retracted the tweet as far as I’m aware.  Either way with how big a part of WoW Radio TB was she should have been consulted before hand anyway.
---
And yet he's already bored
---
You'll never heal like a priest, but you have other utility. IMO druids were the most fun class in classic as they had a super high skill ceiling and just so many options and so much random utility, especially in PvP. The feral/resto hybrid build is crazy cool. It's great in PvP and you can build to be able to off tank and heal in raids so long as you accept that you will never be the best at either.
---
If you want to just be the best healer, though, stick with the priest. Also, you don't have to be a dwarf priest. They're better, sure, but very, very few guilds are going to turn away a good priest because of their race. Good healers are hard to come by.
---
I accidentally timed my vacation with the release of classic.
---
&gt;by IP
---
We have more advanced ways now, like device fingerprinting. IPs are not that reliable nowadays, but they have a historical gravitas to them because it's a level above account bans.
---
When I get my Warden Staff and a few other toys, nobody is ever one shotting me, lol
---
Could care less about her but TotalBiscuit is why WoW Radio succeeded at all and his legacy is important.
---
Who's the bigger baby the "snowflake" or the one triggered by the "snowflake"?

So I didn't know about that 10,000 number, but I have played games that were made in the last 5 years. I've never seen a week of queue times or something, like you're implying. I've played the recent xpacs, had hours of queue times, and the next day had less than 5 minutes. not sure what video games you're talking about (outside of older games or actual server crashes).
---
If their servers from 15 years ago had that amount of queue times, yeah, we'd have some big issues. 
---
I hope people are distributed more evenly, but I still think, if you plan on playing a lot of classic, then choosing a server just for good launch quality is shortsighted. Those servers might be dead a year down the line.
---
no you didnt
---
Does anyone know if [EzDismount](https://github.com/Voidmenull/EzDismount) will be updated for Classic? Or is there another addon with similar features that already exists? The two key features I can't live without are auto dismount when casting and casting while drinking. Thanks!
---
Ah damn.  That was cool of them.  I missed out on all of the private server golden age.
---
There really isn't a guide to keybindings, it's all up to you when it comes to remembering where everything is and what it's set to. If you have access to retail atm try logging on and rebinding some of your totems to modifier keys like Shift+[key] or Ctrl+[key].
---
Not struggling to find group? Mages are one of the best dps and have good aoe and crowd control making them highly sought after in dungeons and raids for dps
---
Make sure one of them is mining or alchemy. So that you can get easy groups for alchemy lab or dark iron bar smelting.
---
And late game feral min/maxed cats do 1000, upwards 1150. If the person is skilled
---
LEGEND OF MANA! Holy hell! I’ve been searching high and low to figure out what rpg I used to play on PS1. And there it is.    
---
They’re even considering making a HD version of it.   
---
Very exciting indeed!
---
Quick! Someone link that old vanilla Paladin forum post
---
“There’s actually no difference between bad things and good things”
---
I agree. After playing the stress test my thumb nail actually cut through to my skin from jumping so much and I didn't even realize it lol
---
Alchemy makes leveling a warrior super easy and is always useful. It really is the secret sauce.
---
Alchemy lab runs will be easier to get together as a tank.
---
I'm so hyped for Classic. What am NOT hyped for tho, is all the trolls that will be roaming around, trying their best to destroy it for everyone. Sadly, I think there will be A LOT of them in the first weeks, maybe even months..
---
I fear that too many people will go for skinning, so I will go with herbalism and mining. Herbs for teh moneyz™ while leveling and Mining to keep the mats for leveling BM when I hit 60, bcause I want to be able to forge my FR gear. Afterwards I'd reroll to BM and Engeneering whilest farming ores with an alt. It's a long term plan tho
---
Communism asks for people to give according to their means and receive according to their needs and then provides people with the basic societal structure to pursue and fulfill their abilities, does that seem like something that is fearing growth and personal challenge?
---
Brainwashed Americans 😭
---
I respectfully disagree with your point on the target audience, though I must confess I've no data to back my view up.
---
But I'd wager my left foot that Blizzard has lost more subscribers since Cata than retail's gained them. Hell, they lost me at the end of TBC (not that that has any bearing on things). I'd wager their goal is to sucker us back in and keep us subbed another six years in exchange for the minimal effort that adding the future expansions will cost them.
---
You're right, though, I don't trust them. But I can dream that they'll swallow their pride when the subscriber numbers conclusively show that vanilla WoW's refusal to make babies of their customers yielded the superior business model. I hope we'll shatter their hubris and force them to relearn their old lessons and imitate the past.
---
You probably want to be level 10 before you go across the pond as a Druid. For Bear Form and Teleport Moonglade. But if you don't mind the journey back to Darnassus for your bear quest, then go for it I guess.
---
Ya have an updoot
---
LOL, I can't remember that honestly.. I must have been so excited that morning, that i couldn't sleep.. That or I waited up all night for my mom to wake up for work,  so I could beg her to actually pay for a monthly subscription.
---
I wondered about this. Maybe even a day or two? But I think I'm just wishful thinking here :)
---
Theres no druid trainer in dem mountains
---
What about multiboxing so you can play both factions of the same pvp realm
---
So that you can gank your friends
---
So you admit you're wrong while trying to say you aren't.
---
Someone got the Eye of Shadow on the Beta, so it might be in at launch, but who knows. You're definitely right about it being from 1.4 and based on what Blizz has said it shouldn't come till phase 2 like you said
---
When someone makes a question for proof, and someone makes an assertion of proof, and then someone else replies trying to disregard that proof, it is not a stretch to assume the second person is on the same 'side'/agrees with the first.
---
What are you talking about? Classic's development team has been more responsive than any Blizzard team in at least half a decade
---
Class design was sweet in legion.  I looked up changes on bga launch and decided not to play it.
---
You mean you're inferring. Anyway tank spec DOES make it a hell of a lot easier to kill the entire zone, especially when lesser geared.
---
I would quest in Teldrassil till you get bear form, then do Dun Morogh. You will have to save your hearthstone cd to use after you use teleport to Moonglade to learn new skills every two levels, though.
---
&gt; professions? I think I settled with herbalism / alchemy, probably the most standard of choices, but I think you'll be fine as long as you don't do double gathering combination.
---
I'm thinking about double gathering but then when I'll be max level I'll be too lazy to gather anything, did alchemy had transmutation back then where you were creating a valuable gem once per day for nice cash? also engineering had googles that let you notice stealthed people better but I think it was in TBC.
---
I’m honestly kinda confused why they keep advertising the release as August 27 in NA. Just say August 26 on the NA ads. It’s coming out late afternoon/evening August 26 for us.
---
I guess I should say that it's the cheapest way to play if you want a *complete* game, rather than shelling out more for maps, DLC, etc., every couple of months, and dealing with bugs that the developers didn't have the time or budget to fix prior to the launch date.
---
I hope they open more RP servers for eu, only one rp-pvp isn't enough. Goldshire will be way to overpopulated.
---
I saw a YouTube video saying it did, yes.
---
I think the overall population of this subreddit will thin, but people who love this game will stay.
---
Do we actually need a guide like this? Jesus christ.
---
my prediction is they'll open 1 more pvp realm before the release and 1 after (EU)
---
Source?
---
It's a Hassel and a half to run there. You will die alot running through the wetlands. But other than the class trainer you won't have much trouble. Also class quest will take you back alot. It's just going to be spending alot of time traveling.
---
enjoy the queues :)
---
I agree. During the stress test my nail actually cut through to my skin and I didn't even realize how much I was jumping, I don't even have long nails haha.

I took a bit of artistic licence and it seems to have been controversial decision, lol
---
Are they really? I figured the whole #nochanges shenanigans would mean no cross server?

On one hand faster queues are better, but I'd rather sit in a queue longer if it meant a better hate connection with the opposite faction.

Big sadface from me =(

I’ve played since the start. DKs are busted, DH’s are gay, and monk is super fucking ultra gay. Seriously I abhor those classes, would never want to see that shit in classic. Endrant

You have to actually suck horrible at the game to get camped.

Mechanically, gnome is so much better it's hilarious. If you care more about looks than mechanics, play whatever you want.
---
Not saying that WoW isn't worth the value, but there are incredible games out there that you can waste months with and which are totally free. NetHack, the greatest game of all time, is free, as is all of its derivative works.
---
Start a group so 5 people can tag it and move along.
---
Honestly, Legion was far from perfect but it was such a nice upswing that I returned with BFA prepatch, hit level 120 on the first day and went into the end game with huge enthuasiasm. I wanted to give it a chance, I wanted it to work in a new and different way. My rose colored goggles fell apart around the time first mythics came out. Everything felt so shallow and fruitless. Before, even when WoW was at its worst, I saw those thing as something that sucks but will be fixed in time. BFA showed me that Blizzards entire design philosophy with that game si rotten to the core, and harder they try to change things, the worse it's going to get. Luckily the greed that resulted in shortsighted decisions to maintain the players is now bringing us Classic since Blizzard must surely see that the number of subs has dropped, and diversifying their golden goose might be one way to save it.
---
It COULD of been cool of they implemented mounted combat.... That was always my opinion.
---
Yeah, because so many alchemists need to craft flasks so often..
---
You get to join toxic guilds.
---
The /r/classicwow equivalent of /r/pcmasterrace "its not much but its mine" when people get their first mount or their epic mount.
---
They arent wrong, though. Sure, a good number of people like being stuck in time... but eventually every person will hit their personal progression point where they hoped to progress to and no longer find enjoyment in the game.
---
Of course, where that wall is.. is different for every person. I've seen it happen in other games that officially offer locked in time or progression based reboot servers.
---
The real hitter will be if they offer a BC server or WotLK server. Even moreso if they offer them from the beginning (play through each expansion in a linear release timeline).
---
It'll be interesting to see what happens, but I dont think these people are inherently wrong, but maybe a bit... premature. It mostly depends on how quickly they'll release content, I think.
---
NGL i actually enjoy spamming FoL.  Something oddly satisfying about it

Stalagg was flickering between medium and high? That's a good sign, I've been checking it constantly and I've only seen it at medium.

I see plenty of armour on my gnomes. But let's look at the pros and cons:

Pros - Best mount in the game. You're tiny and annoy people in PvP. Maximum swag on your /dance.

Cons - ????

Ideally you would have engi and alch

I will wait to see how bad ques get launch hour. Probably will sub a little after that though.

To name a few. I went from "nah prolly not gonna play classic" to basically looking at class-specific quirks and tips because I'm so hyped to try Classic
---
You have peaked my interest. Do you have to talk like you’re in the medieval times all day long?
---
The 5% intellect isnt anything incredible but it is still a bit handy to have. Gnome racial is better for PvP imo, its like a mini hand of freedom. 
---
Yeah you can't see their armor as well but I actually like gnome models and how armor looks on them.
---
Notice she doesn’t acknowledge that “apology” and attempted backtrack?  If all was well wouldn’t she have tweeted so?  I’m not convinced given how much of a shot show TB’s original departure from WoW Radio was.
---
At max level if it's 1v1 you're okay against a lot of things, especially if you're specced for PvP. While leveling, I would generally try to avoid world PvP if you're alone. They are already the hardest class to level, and I personally wouldn't want to add to that difficulty by trying to fight.
---
That said, even without a pocket healer, a warrior and a rogue together can be quite a team. Lots of people will be leveling solo so just ganging up on them can do some work, and if you manage to hamstring them and stay in their face your rogue friend should be able to finish them off pretty easily.
---
Just bring bandages and food for both of you at all times and it shouldn't be too bad. Plus you guys could always run into a healer somewhere that you can team up with.
---
Dibs on the 196 hours thread.
---
I feel that. Good choice. Embrace the shadow...
---
Horde - PvP East - US
---
LF1M DPS. Preferably Warrior or Shaman. 
---
Playing 12-16 hour days (Have taken the week off). You don't have to play 24+ at launch or anything like that. Just looking for someone capable of putting in a lot of hours.
---
It doesn't really depend on class. Depends on their gear and on how much loot competition occurs.
---
But normally, "pure DPS" &gt; "meme spec", *if* leader is ready to wait. "Pure DPS" includes hunters even though their DPS is "normally" lower.
---
WA
---
It really is more of a journey or destination point of view.
---
WoW, like EverQuest, used to be very much about the journey.  Latest expansions have been 20 hour grind of 5 zones to just start the time gated RNG treadmill.
---
They are getting rid of all layers before phase 2.
---
Lmao. "You dont know what layering is". Alright tell me what part i got wrong. "Duh go read the posts about it."
---
Get the fuck out of here.
---
Ah yes "accidents"
---
I think a lot of wow players should go queue on everest this week!
---
JK mates be safe hope to see 25k queue on Herod just so we can smile at how much Blizz still underestimates the classic community.
---
Is there anything Discord does that realm forums can't do?
---
&gt; Does an algorithm use a clock to generate the code both on blizzards end and in the authenticator?
---
Yep, you got it. The current time is combined with some secret unique value that both the server and the authenticator know to generate a random number. But since they both know the seed, they're able to generate the same "random" number.
---
&gt;Using Hogger as your example is incredibly poor, as a single quest and dungeon are not the same in any sense.
---
They are both single quests. That is why it is actually the perfect example. If you get your first question to venture into the Dead Mines you have no idea its anything other than hogger. You learn pretty quickly and get a big suprise but why would you call a quest that wants you to kill a single boss a whole areas name. Open your mind a bit. It won't hurt you and you might learn something.
---
I'm be on vacation for launch week. Plus side is that most of the server issues should be hammered out. Down side is that I won't be part of that day 1 madness. Oh well, 15 days for me!
---
Team lead of Vanilla said it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izCBaGfGJCg (It's long but it's in there.)
---
&gt; where exactly do all the players that are on these servers go
---
They quit.
---
Not everyone who starts playing is going to make it to 60 and keep playing continuously. Every single private server has demonstrated that.
---
N****dale had 14k online at launch. Just a month later, it was peaking around 9k. Just as an example.
---
I 100% agree why it’s bad. But the realm populations are insanely high. If more and more players arrive and the tourists stay, it’s going to be impossible to get rid of it.
---
It loads way to fast to be authentic.
---
Well, to be honest, there is one poster in the lot that is right.  
---
Classic is kind of "stiff" and many things are not viable. That's kind of a bummer if you wanna play some specs. I mean, I'm gonna play warrior so I'm fine. But the people who roll enh sham or druids might be annoyed.
---
Ah perhaps I miscommunicated what I'm gunning for; I'd like them to leave existing trees untouched but add an additional tree for each class that's radically different but no more powerful.
---
E.g. Paladins might get a DoT spec.
---
But yes, perhaps asking for balanced content from Blizzard is a bit much.
---
For example:
---
Gnom: Dont like red hair, 2/10
---
Dwarf: Looks like Gandalf, I like Gandalf 9/10
---
Nightelf: looks scary 7/10
---
Name: nearly always the same, I like Trilokk the most. 7/10
---
I don’t like how they messed with the timelines, but I didn’t mind going off to explore different worlds and continents. What was the major problem with that?
---
The raid lockout does. Once you go into a raid and down a boss, the moment that boss dies, you are saved to that raid ID. You cannot go into a different raid at that point, it will bring you into the ID you are locked to. You can do a different raid with other people if your guild is not doing that raid that week, but you cannot go into an MC, down a couple bosses, and then try to go into a different MC the same week to kill the same bosses you just killed.
---
So herod is gonna slow everyone down. Boooo!
---
Hey everyone I have a totally uninformed opinion without any supporting data that Blizz has, but I do want another shot at getting my stupid name so please make a half dozen more servers.  PS I will be back to complain about my dead realm in a few months.
---
This isn't playstation.
---
Going to collect a list of classic e-books and try to get through some of them.
---
look at all races and ask your self what you most want to play. Maybe also ask your self what sides races you would prefer to play with/around.
---
Something to classic is also ask your self this: do you prefer to play with shamans or paladins on your side? Would you prefer the shaman or the paladin as your enemy?
---
Wouldn’t it make more sense to post on your realm discord?
---
No it isn't. 
---
I just started playing Warframe a few weeks ago. I wouldn't dream of voting for changes that I didnt understand. 
---
Most new comers will play classic for a few weeks and then leave. Why should they have a say in the future of the game?
---
I've been watching any and every classic wow video I can. I'm glad that I'm not the only one lol.
---
You can probably free up 5min to fix Elvui after a few days tbh xD it will help you in the long run if you prefer it
---
Also who decides the majority? 
---
If you read forum posts about what people want to do months after Naxx is out or in the following years, the upvotes tend to favor the classic+ ideas over doing TBC and Wrath. I know I personally want exactly what you described, but with no gear squelch. So Nothing is better than Naxx gear, but we have lots of side grades. More crazy long legendary weapon/armor quests. More long attunement chains. It would be awesome if what raid your guild chose to do was actually a choice, and it was affected by like the elemental damage resist sets you have and the elemental damage your casters do + what attunements you've done.
---
People think or want it will to be TBC and Wrath because they either dont trust Blizz anymore or because they don't think Blizz is willing to shell out the $$ for it when it will have less monetization, which are both kind of cop outs.
---
No that's not how it works.
---
It's more than a minimal increase. Escape artist is one of the best PvP racials and 5% int means more crits and mana pool. They are definitely the best caster choice for both PvP and PvE.
---
In the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) App select World of Warcraft, and then aboe the Install/play Button there will be a dropdown menu to chose version between retail and classic.  
---
Pick classic and then press install and you won't have to download any of the retail assets.
---
The game is about 5 Gbs as u/letsimprovethegame said
---
cringe and black
---
Look up to check for anvils and pianos get sucked into quicksand.
---
Look down to be be careful not to sink into quicksand get crushed by anvil.
---
Try to outsmart it by looking up and down quickly get blown up by acme explosives factory on your right.
---
Death is certain.
---
I've been thinking about that lately. How long do you guys think the queues are going to be? Waiting 5 hours in queues everyday the first week is hype sure but I kinda don't want to wait longer than 1-2 hours. I'm looking at the full servers. Especially if a friend I'm supposed to level with arrives and now we gotta wait 3 hours and all that. Maybe I am asking for too much here but I am rolling a full server either way. If I've learned anything from wow is that the people make the server not the world.
---
Note that not only tryhard pvpers go Shazzrah. But it is indeed more popular among those with pserver experience. There'll be some tryhard PvEers and some semi-casual guilds too.
---
Those characters all have gold caps on them and are specifically named so that advertisers can mail gold to them. Changing everything is not really in our best interests. We are aware of the site but if PPB was breaking tos our names would be very different. It was a discussion at one point but as our accounts have nothing to hide - classic people seem to be the only people who care?
---
WarCraft 4?
---
&gt; There was pretty wide consensus that leveling should be harder than private servers
---
The consensus was that if you level through questing only, you will be slower than pservers, but if you level optimally through dungeons it will be significantly faster.
---
Great to hear that you’re moving with the times tech-wise.
---
Out of interest, will you also have a YouTube channel? Or be using any other platforms?
---
Sword spec proc + WF proc, that's gonna be fun lol

---
Enjoy!
---
imagine using edgy insults when your entire argument against me is that I use edgy insults. You're pathetic.
---
There's a difference between happening to cross a low level and going to low level zones to seek them out
---
I'm also really getting worried about streamers, I feel like streamers might ruin the game for a lot of people. I watched a vid on why to avoid servers with big streamers and I'm re-thinking playing a pvp server because of this.
---
I hear finding Mankirks wife is a big part of Horde life?
---
100% true WoW felt casual AF compared to EQ coming from EQ.
---
WoW was more competitive though, in a different way, than EQ was.  My server in EQ had 5 years of two guilds dominating everything, content was opened up to people expansions behind us, at a point there was no competition.  This never happened in WoW, new content meant fierce competitions for server/world firsts.  PvP ranking climbs were insane and very competitive because of so many people pushing the bar.
---
When it came to punishments being doled out though, there was no comparison to EQ.  I laugh when people say WoW leveling is hard or grindy, imagine doing it with no quests, 10x more exp needed, never able to solo, exp loss on death and the possibility of permanently losing all your stuff.  Way more people didn't make that cut, than the WoW 60 cut, lol.
---
Sounds sketchy lol. Thanks
---
Anything outside of meta and an intresting challenge is ”bad design”. This is why they never shouldve listened to player feedback
---
They can, but you need atleast improved blizzard, frostnova and shatter. Do not take frostbite for aoe farm.
---
It will be even more effective if you go deep frost. CoC iceblock cold snap and barrier. Why would you not go deep frost for aoe farm?
---
Nice, I really appreciate the description you have given me here.  It helps make my choices on which to use a bit easier.  Looking through all of the addons is a bit overwhelming and it's hard to know which ones are useful as there are so many that seem very similar and in the end might be personal preference.
---
Crazy isn't the right word.  Overly cynical is probably a better way to put it.
---
I downloaded an addon and extracted it to the proper file location. When I logged into the character reservation screen the red addon button was not there in the bottom left corner. Do I do something wrong?
---
Turns out taking quotes from multiple people on the internet doesn't lead to one consistent statement.
---
Who knew?
---
What the fuck is a RAF reward mount and why is it in my vanilla
---
No shit, sounds stupid as hell though. Thought that was obvious
---
Ion: Each layer with have a capacity "similar to original servers at launch" https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=243
---
the difficulty is still there in other forms of content than quests or rep grinds but people like to world quest and complain that the game is easy
---
You wouldn't want to do that on server wide discord lol, you make a small discord of the people you trust duh.
---
I should really make a list of things that are totally gonna bite me in the ass next week 😂
---
I'll probably try posting on those as well, but a lot of people playing hardcore haven't picked a realm yet due to the cluster fuck thing going on, at least on EST side. 
---
Or if they are hardcore and committed it's likely it's likely tentative commitments. I don't think anyone wants to log into a 10k herod Que.
---
Yea I remember WF totem in TBC, heard it was no joke in vanilla although I avoided pvp on my pally so I never really remember experiencing it.
---
There is no Raf in Classic
---
I agree. I also like those aspects of the community.
---
It points out his IRL toxicity while he was judge jury executioner of ingame toxicity through the system he developed.
---
Thats the point.
---
It splits the playerbase, the equivalent of an FPS releasing map packs. It's unhealthy for the community and the interaction between lower level players and higher level players. It diminishes the feel of a "living, populated" world. It also wastes the opportunity to explore content that was planned for Vanilla but was cut to facilitate Burning Crusade.

---
What spec need for 40 characters? Few pcs?
---
I have been paranoid for a good 20 days now
---
Back when we ran premades we had a druid always sit on blacksmith because he could call rotations and hold it on short notice the longest. Druids can be fantastic in AB if you know how to use them
---
I guess he posted in the wrong reddit lol
---
Deathknights were risen from all races that were around back then in the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
So mostly Human and Highelves, Dwarfes etc.
---
If you care about classic races for Warrior / Combat Rogue just go Human for their Sword skill bonus.
---
I agree, and I recognize my post didn't do a good job recognizing that aspect of the problem. 
---
I view Classic as a labor of love more than anything, exactly because it is not conducive to the more lucrative forms of monetization. I'd feel more secure in the current model if Blizzard felt more secure asking for an adjusted sub fee. Without doing that, I wonder how long they'll be able to fend off the vultures that want to start milking Classic for every dime they can. Would it kill the golden goose? Yes. Does that often dissuade the pursuit of short term gains? No.
---
Just say you said 5 molten cores cus on that server 5 different layers were doing molten core lol
---
lul these people sweating cause classic will the the last ounce of people last on dogshit bfa.
---
Dare I ask what was said?
---
Good point. I might end up Horde just to avoid the shaman WF train.
---
Except they never promised reworked, they released "as is" due to lack of times and said they wouldn't be revisited until 8.1 if they were. They *never* said that a rework would happen in 8.1, they only said it *might*.
---
I'm on mobile but you can refer to the June 14 Q&amp;A for BFA for a source.
---
Respecs go 1g/5g/10g/15g/20g up until 50g which is the cap.  Respeccing twice before 60 is perfectly fine, anything more will start getting out of hand quick.  Leveling holy is very easy, just not as fast as shadow.  The speed difference isn't really noticeable before 40 but with shadowform 15% damage - shadow power 10% spell damage and spell weaving 15% shadow damage the speed greatly increases.  The 30% from shadowform / weaving will also affect your wand damage if it is shadow.
---
Different kinds of hard - the logistics of 40 man raid guilds is something else, C'Thun was probably the hardest thing I've tried in WoW, so amazingly complicated with 40 people (and blatantly overtuned at AQ release).
---
I would think that now at a higher age the time would pass faster, and it kinda does, but not when classic wow is just days away..
---
Play [Combat Dagger](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0xfoLZMIVbbEz0boV). Lowest APM dps rotation, afaik.
---
I'm doing this... Gonna be playing with my brother who is an hour ahead of me, so I'll just keep my work schedule more or less, though I've taken the time off. Should be fun, but it's not gonna be at the expense of my health!
---
/r/wow
---
Nope. You can bypass the B.Net app by launching the .exe directly. You will then be promoted with login credentials.
---
thats not how u burst. the damage has to arrive at the same time. firenova-warstomp-chainlightning-shock is your max burst combo.
---
Still waiting for [the Bard](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Bard_(April_Fools))
---
BTW has any1 tested if the macro that rotates herb tracking with mining works?
---
I mean WoW has extremely simplistic customization. Can't really rate it like it's unique or something
---
Does anybody know of a *good* keybind guide?
---
As a little context, I'm not planning on using clique for the time being. I'm rolling priest and my plan is to use alt and shift modifiers to downrank/uprank heals, e.g. bind Heal (r5) to E, (r3) to shift+E, with (r1) at alt+E. It seems the general consensus is that three ranks of the major spells is enough.
---
Any thoughts, feedback? If there is a specific guide for healer keybinds that would be much appreciated.
---
Honestly, a couple of years ago, when an hyped up vanilla pserver launched, me and my friend played for a while. In the end we both quit. I quit because, due to the high population, even at lvl 30 tagging a mob was so difficult that it wasn't fun anymore.
---
My friend however stopped because he felt retail (Legion, at that time) was better.
---
People like different things and it's fine.
---
I, for once, will try Classic again but I know I won't reach max lvl simply because I'm a moba player at hearth. And when League of Legends Wolrds come, God knows you're on the ladder trying what you watch on TV.
---
Warriors become much better at 60 and the better gear they get the stronger they become, they scale VERY well. That being said, play smart, know your class, bring a healer if you want, not needed but useful.
---
People are ok with phase 1 layers and phase 2 ques for those who refuse to accept possible free server transfers. People aren’t ok with both at the same time.
---
When Orsini makes an executive decision, you don't question it.
---
Lol..... Jesus Christ this sub has the dumbest questions
---
The new popularity of VPNs will make IP bans tough to enforce
---
&gt; N****dale had 14k online at launch. Just a month later, it stabilized around 9k during peak hours. So roughly 30% of the players at launch ended up quitting in the first month.
---
Eh, this is false. I played ND for a long time, and about 6 months ago (When I stopped playing to take a break for Classic) it was still maintaining 13-15k. In fact, I believe sometime in May it hit 18k at one point.
---
Yup!  If not for cute factor alone, 5% int is pretty juicy!
---
Check out Grim Dawn
---
I shall try to explain their attitude to you. They have been playing retail wow for well over a decade now, being fed achievements, mounts, pets, transmogs etc. 
---
They are attached to their characters, massively so. It’s why so many mmos failed over the years: to abandon WoW is to make void all that effort. So when something comes along to threaten retail wow, the above is their natural reaction, because they are actively looking for any and all reason not to worry about their game and stay put.
---
definitely pay to win and should not be allowed in classic
---
There are free private servers where you can try out all the classes etc. 
---
No better way to prep. 
---
Google.
---
The video I stumbled on that made me play WoW. As a bald human mage. 🤣
---
I even raided as a pom pyro mage.
---
100% true. Allowing more people, especially significantly more than old vanilla will destroy the experience moreso than simple things like dual spec or summoning at meeting stones or font corrections etc
---
My wife is going on a trip. Her sister booked her flight. Said the times for the return flight are wrong cause it departs at 6pm and arrives at 7pm. It’s a four hour flight over 3 time zones. Yes it’s really that hard for people to grasp time zones.
---
Just started listening to this at work myself a couple weeks ago, heh. The production value is definitely very good, Josh is a good speaker and doesn't have any annoying ticks, his scripts are good and he keeps conversations going very well. Not every discussion topic is interesting but since everything is divided and timestamped it's easy to go through and grab what you want to hear real fast. Overall a great resource and he's had a lot of really cool guests on.
---
The biggest problem most people have with FFXIV is the weeb culture.
---
I had stuff happen like people in an LFG dungeon suddenly started weird roleplaying with stuff like "Oh healer-chan please caress me or I can't tank no more"
---
This is super weird and annoying to non weeb or non RP players.
---
___
---
ESO I stopped playing mostly because that game felt like it had no progression at all, even the opposite your gear even degraded with higher levels. New gear felt like it changed absolutely nothing and the dmg numbers were quite the same from lvl 1 to finish before getting set gear etc.
---
Bullshit. Every other AAA title costs more. 60 plus 60 for a season pass for 1 year and then 60 fot each season pass after that..then pay 60 for the sequel because everyone abandons the previous game. Or the f2p model where half the games are pay to win with the rare actually free game sprinkled in.
---
Wow is cheap.
---
This is getting harder to wait each day.
---
Oh, well I guess that leaves you know, Stalagg, and the other West Coast PVP servers that won't have any noticed difference in gameplay latency due to spell batching.  
---
The options are there, people just ignore them.
---
Remindme! 6 Months
---
Boo this man!
---
Yeah so this doesn't reflect my launch experience of an extremely popular private server at all. People weren't usually taking fair fights, why would they? Usually people try to jump on you when you're half hp fighting a mob or when they outnumber/outlevel you. Stv was the biggest bloodbath I've ever seen and while that did have a certain appeal, the time spent actually progressing the char was vastly reduced.
---
Why? 5 seperate classes. Warlock spam fearing. Hunter spamming concussive shots and traps.
---
Not every skill hit but with 5 people attacking and chaining CC abilities no 60 really stood a chance. Plus the Pally had a hard time closing the gap on any of us.
---
It wasn't that you needed 8 geared tanks, it was that you needed 8 tanks with 4 pc dreadnaught so your taunts wouldnt miss on the tank swaps. That means every piece of protector gear had to go to your warriors, leaving hunters and shamans in a real bad mood, and if you either didn't get enough or didnt know you needed to be specific with them, you had to either accept that 4H was out of reach until ypu got it, or poach 4 pc T3 warriors from other guilds. That's badly designed.
---
As Effarrdee said, the patch we’re playing on had them, so we will have them. (And It has been confirmed iirc)
---
Imo it’s a mostly good thing. And I’m sure we will still see people from our own servers.
---
I’m really hoping it gives our own server priority before moving onto more, but we will see.
---
I never said I was better. But a lot of us are playing classic to relive the experience. It wouldn't be fair to allow new players to ruin that experience for the rest of us. What the fuck are you even talking about BGs for? It's completely irrelevant. There are already a ton of younger people that are way better than me at the game. This isn't about skill or knowledge. Sorry but I'm not going to continue this conversation. You're an idiot.

Do you think a few wPvP engagements being ruined outweighs all the other positives that layering brings? No one said it was perfect, but it will benefit the 99% while probably only inconvenience the 1%.
---
The most recently created, all will have queues
---
I would also say mages. What mages have going for them is their incredible arsenal of kiting potential. Mages can also spec in to the Pressence of Mind + Pyroblast build called the ”3-minute mage” to do some incredible damage.
---
If you dedicate some time, I still think you can play most classes/specs if you get really good dungeon gear. Do not underestimate the power of blues.
---
Most importantly is to have fun.
---
nice we’ve only seen this post 500 times over the past year.
---
Really?  I read that it's basically alternating Aimed Shot and Multishot with auto attacks in between.
---
If you were like 8ft tall you'd have bad posture too. 
---
Hell I'm 6'4" and my posture sucks.
---
You don't need that. 
---
You simply do not.

Lol :-D
---
Dope, thanks!
---
As long as I do not have to sacrifice 50 GB+, I‘m pretty happy.
---
I think blizzard was right to look at vanilla, see that only about 1% of players made it to naxx, and think something needed to change. Even in TBC very few guilds made it through sunwell. Though at the time I was very much against how easy WOTLK was, it was probably the best balance between casual and serious players the game ever had with raiding. TBC for me was peak dungeons. I don't recall the questing and level, but I still recall it being somewhat difficult. TBC or Vanilla might have been better in that regard.
---
Heck, we all know the fights by heart from WotLK!
---
RemindMe! 6 Months
---
You're probably right, I'm going PvE so raiding is where I'll be spending my endgame mostly. I may just have to roll something different til then like you, thank you.
---
I can't even play current WoW anymore. I log in and sit there like do I really want to just do world quests? Can't wait to play classic!
---
Technically, yes, it's not cheating, but that's because Blizz would rather get more money from the same idiot. Multi-boxing is like clocking in at work under two people and getting paid twice as much, it's unethical and no one likes you when you do it. Don't be a scumbag.
---
Gnome: 100 points for being a gnome. Minus 99 points for being a male gnome instead of a female. 5 points for having red hair, 4 points for matching eye color to the hair color. 10/10
---
Blizzard was right to expect the servers to die down. This massive hype train is going to come to a halt when 3 weeks later the majoirt of people left because getting to 30 wasnt very fun.
---
Retail. Go start some world pvp battles.
---
I hit all my league goals before I wanted to and now I'm struggling to find something to fill the free time I have until Classic.
---
yes we all can enter the queues at the same global time even though the local time may be different 😁
---
I can recognize this is sort of a "take it or leave it" thing, so I don't blame you at all. And its nice of you to do.
---
However, its worth mentioning for others that a virus scan has literally 0% chance of catching malicious addon code that would be run in-game. So sure, it might catch a keylogger or something, but something that deletes your gear or mails your gold away or something would never get caught by that.

That's gonna be a LULW from me

What a clickbait (didn't click btw)
---
If Vanilla was bad, why did the subscription count increase instead of plummet off a cliff? 🤔
---
any further than it is currently. Since their cap might be set up to 10-15 maybe 20k people, this is the number they are talking about. Not 2500 like it was back then
---
Time zones are one hell of a concept
---
Other games have tried it and it never really took off. It always feels awkward in comparison to standard combat mechanics.
---
Spend this time with your family and friends. Once Aug 26th hits they may never see you again.
---
Thank god I'm a default ui for life person.
---
I don't like the bald spot on gnome (4/10).
---
Dwarf is a good option always (unless it's female) but feels too beefy to be a caster (7/10).
---
Nelf with this face is as ugly as it's animations (0/10). I would never play that toon.
---
what date and time does classic release on mars?
---
I would have chose more correct 5 count than just what sounded better. Within reading the post I already thought  it would have been better with a "5 hit reck(oning) bomb". But hey, keep it up.
---
Which is precisely why i don’t want layering. Hard resetting the communities in that way is not worth it just to fix launch day issues. I wouldn’t care if I had 4 hour Qs every day for weeks, i would still happily jump on a no layering on launch server.
---
&gt;They still work
---
[So do mine](https://imgur.com/XlQ9vu6). I've had an MMO problem over the years...

I did so I could downvote it on youtube too.

It’s confusing because blizzard has always done times based on their own region. 
---
Even in NA I get told it’s coming out on the 27th but all the articles don’t mention it’s the 27th for a timezone 8 hours ahead.

Don't worry dude, I'm pretty sure with your outlook on how to play Pally, no one is going to be giving you any T2 anyways, lol.
---
I'll be sure to ask the moral authority on all wow matters from now on.
---
If you haven't seen Veep on HBO you should watch the whole thing this week so when you background watch it while WoWing you're not constantly falling out of your chair at the hilarity.
---
i see what you did there 😏
---
Wryyyyyyyyyyy
---
&gt; At its peak in October 2010 the game had 12 million subscribers.
---
I thought I had read 15m but 12m was posted by blizzard.  These accounts still exist, well minus the banned.  It’s possible more than half come back to try it.
---
We’re trying to play World of Warcraft. Not Warcraft.
---
And before any actual launch lol
---
I'll take any confirmation of that still being the case I can get, personally. Glad to hear and thanks for sharing.
---
If you are playing Horde on Gehennas I've made a subreddit called Gehennas\_EU
---
Bobby B is tired of seeing this thread constantly.
---
Hopefully this doesn't translate into "We just won't start phase 2 then" because the servers are still heavily layered 8 months after launch. 
---
I take this information with a grain of salt and heavy suspicion.
---
Wasn’t thinking about raid times. But they’ll have to adjust for central.
---
&gt;That is a completely valid point, and has NOTHING to do with layering. They should have had 3-4 more servers of each type for sure. But, they still needed layering.
---
I disagree. Without layering the servers would be more restricted on the amount of people being allowed to play on them (while running the risk of having dead servers and all that). Layering ups this cap, and will cause higher que times when it is removed than a standard vanilla server would.
---
This isn't lambasting layering. It's here to stay we have to deal with the consequences. I just want a way to make the current situation better because of it.
---
please respond

Do kill quests in group. Be wary of loot quests, as drop rates can be low, especially when you 1) are competing for spawns and 2) can’t progress faster with a group. 
---
Unless there’s a bottleneck you HAVE to deal with (I.e. class quest), skip it and move on to the next area, and replace the missed xp with a bit more grinding.
---
That alone will get you ahead of 90% of people.
---
The main problem is that all the developers with any vision are long gone. The lead dev is a lawyer. Not a game developer. Ion is in charge so he can use lawyer speak to explain why every xpac you get less while store sales go up.
---
But it's not.
---
I don't play Retail hence why I don't see anything good about it.
---
And apocalypse now is based on heart of darkness which is referenced in the alliance war campaign in Nazmir
---
The immersion part is mainly because you never really bump into anyone in the world anymore. Social, conflict or teamwork became rare to none.
---
Yeah but maybe she just doesn't have the energy to deal with it/or cares enough. True, maybe they should've talked to her beforehand, but I doubt there was any malicious intent behind it. Maybe they wanted to garner some interest for their relaunch but either way, we're talking about 10+ year old content here, there are probably plenty of people who just randomly uploaded one or the other episode on different sites without any kind of credit or care. They apologized and it now links to her archive, there isn't anything else they can do. I don't think it's any reason for them to "fall on their sword" over something like this, when most people are just really excited to play classic again.
---
BFA felt small even before flying.
---
The problem is that they *are* small, and theyre so packed in with shit theres no open expanses to make it feel (and actually be) bigger.
---
Not sure I want to.
---
Meters or feet? Lol
---
Only reason to pick human would be for looks, gnome clearly have the better racials.
---
You can\`t Serpent Sting in a competent raid because of the debuff limit. Additionally, your rotation includes multishot, leaving you with 1 open slot to do something else. Normally this is rapid fire during the first rotation.
---
"The important ones " and panda land is in that class ....clearly bc and wotlk are better
---
You're probably right
---
Man, I remember running the second tier of the Forge of souls 3 dungeons every day to get my gun drop as a hunter. Finally, it dropped and the rogue ROLLED NEED AND FUCKING GOT IT. Everyone was mad as fuck he left the group and zoned into the next instance.
---
No need to be a dickhead tbh
---
yea my mind is truly blown
---
Yeah, I’m one of those elitist dicks, you’re right, and me and allllll my elitist friends will be on classic again, not taking cat druids.
---
Is it a reference to AN or HoD, or both? Read that book years ago so don’t remeber it so well.
---
so what sort of report function are we getting for classic? lets hope there is nothing automated.
---
 Talk shit on disc or listen to podcasts/news. Maybe some it's always Sunny in Philadelphia
---
Should be easy with layering. Logging in will be the real challenge.
---
Lame, weak, stupid, dull, unskilled. Take your pick, they all fit the mold for dh and monk
---
Just a lot of shady shit. Asking for donations right after TB died then went and told the world how poor they was and how much debt they were in.
---
She gave up on their kids and moved to Korea the last I heard. 
---
Always seems to have a life threatening illness, she apparently had pneumonia last week. I think she’s got huge mental issues.
---
xrealm battlegrounds were in vanilla.  they're still anti-vanilla.
---
nerfed AV is in vanilla, anti-vanilla.
---
trivialized raids in vanilla, anti-vanilla.
---
addons in vanilla, anti-vanilla.
---
just because it was in vanilla doesn't mean it was a core part of the spirit of vanilla.
---
A lot
---
Personally I don't think the addon is a big deal at all, if Blizzard disagrees and it truly does disrupt the Vanilla attitude then they will ban it.
---
I think too many people have these rose-tinted glasses on thinking its a wonderful community building experience to spam "LF1M tank for Mara then gtg" for 2 hours just to finally get one and your healer leaves - it's frustrating and annoying, and has nothing with building a better community. This addon isn't going to magically make groups immediate and easy and it's not like you aren't still grouping with people on your server, which is what I would consider the community aspect.
---
Agreed. Who celebrates 6 months?!
---
That will likely be pinned down by the #nochanges crowd.
---
I'm against this addon. That being said, addons have been around since vanilla, so your point is wrong.
---
Druids and Shaman cant use any ranged weapons- including wands, bows, guns, throwing weaps. That slot will sit empty until a later phase when they add totems, librams, and idols for shaman, druids, and paladins.
---
I’ve never played vanilla, therefore I don’t have any nostalgia. You’re just hating on this game to be edgy. 0/10
---
rofl thats fucked up holy shit
---
"The most important ONE." The Vanilla one is the most important one and bought at full price, the others were on clearance for $8 before they were taken out of the shop forever
---
Play whatever race that is most visually appealing to you.  No one wants to spend hundreds of hours on a character that they don't enjoy the look of
---
Yep, they were probably huge assholes and lack the self-awareness to notice and change themselves.
---
Very well done.
---
They can only be used by priests, mages, and warlocks. So no you will get no utility from a wand.
---
I love when people list "reasons why you'll quit playing classic" but they're actually things I'm coming to classic for.
---
Grinding dungeons? Fuck yeah, sure beats doing one +10 a week and moving on.
---
Gear drops with useless stats on them? How's that different from retail?
---
That’s amazing! I was expecting something more creative from blizzard though, they often know what to say. And such enthusiasm from a 12 year old should be encouraged:) are you working anywhere near the gaming industry now or went completely different path?
---
The form is different, but the spirit is the same. Blatant lying to the customers about the state of the game. I would not be surprised if layering is here to stay.
---
Multiple and conflicting?  It’s one story...
---
The most elegant solution in my opinion would be to let 'lock in' two specs at the trainer and let us switch between them (at the trainer) for a discount, like 5 or 10g a switch. Would stay kind of true to the spirit bit take some pressure off of some classes, especially priests and warriors.
---
Are you me?
---
A solution is to find an active guild, and group with them. You won't be completely shielded but for the most part should be good.
---
I think the solution for you is simple, don't play with addons. But in no way, shape, or form, is the use of addons anti-vanilla. This is just absurdly incorrect.
---
It truly isn’t cheating though. I can fully understand it being annoying but it isn’t cheating
---
You made the right choice friend
---
Thats a wotlk thing
---
Stay in retail my friend. Classic appeals to real RPG gamers.
---
Yup, it was possible to calculate from your map coordinates what your speed was.  Not difficult to write an addon to do that.
---
Dude yes. I’ve played a ton of modern WoW. I was there for BFA’s launch. It was really fun. But you are absolutely right. All of the classes have this basic rotation. You have your long cooldown ability. And your abilities that you use in between that long cooldown ability. 
---
As a mage you don’t even have to worry about mana unless you are an arcane mage. And even then as long as you follow rotation. Its not an issue. 
---
The game is just so streamlined. Mages feel more like archers than a class that needs to plan what they are doing because they have limited mana. You could get rid of the mana pool and they would play exactly the same. 
---
A lot of classes have this feeling. The game functions more like an action adventure with barely present RP elements.
---
That is an unfair assessment of something as complex as an online radio network. There's a long list of names that contributed to and worked their asses off to make sure Warcraft radio was a success, please don't throw their hard work under the bus.
---
What is layering? I’ve seen that talked about a lot lately but I have no idea what it is.
---
Huh, why not? I've had the movie on my bucket list for a while now and decided to watch it today?
---
It was added in wrath, so newp
---
\&gt;Let us pretend nostalgia makes a game good though. 
---
TRUEEE. Thank god, vanilla is a good game and it isn't because of nostalgia.
---
\&gt;All this work could gave went into improving real WoW. So many people too stuck in the past.
---
Tbh, I think I speak for a lot of people if I said that I would be fine with not getting vanilla if blizzard only made retail an actual good game. Like imagine if they made a new  expansion with the old design philosophy, that'd be lit tbh.
---
God we don't want a poll system.  That's how we got LFR, Flying, heirlooms, and "balanced" aka homogenized classes.  The vocal community wanted "QOL" changes and cried on the forums till they got just what htey wanted.   And those of us who were happy about the game and didn't realize people were crying for bad changes just sat around until suddenly the game was fucked because of the vocal minority.
---
That's actually where they should have gone you think you do but you don't.  But instead they just did that stuff RIP
---
You probably spend all your time feeling bad, dont you?
---
It honestly looks better, because if you read the first part we don’t know who you’re talking about so it’s more surprising
---
This spec is inferior to both Mm and Bm, unless you achieve round about 1000 agility (Full Naxx+ World Buffs)
---
IMO the best fix for AV would be to designate attackers and defenders for each match just like push modes in team FPS games.
---
Unless you're on a RP server.  That's not very paladin like.
---
They had one son and that son was hers from a past relationship so I don’t know if she abandoned him but if she did... oof.
---
My beloved Carrot on a STEEEECK!!  I never waste time getting this little gem.
---
LFM ZF, have mallet!
---
Unfortunately neither shaman or druid can equip wands. You'll generally be melee auto-attacking when OOM, but should hit harder than the cloth/wand classes.
---
Down voted to hell

This one was helpful.
---
I’m a teacher and the first day of school is launch day QQ
---
But in all this negativity there’s one huge plus that you are not pointing out : people like you are not playing.
---
I'm tempted to try levelling two characters together, leaving one gathering rested XP while I play BTW other.  I don't care about getting my first level 60 as fast as humanly possible, so I figure I'll save time in the long run if I stagger them this way.
---
Sounds like it's not for you and that's ok.
---
K, feel free to not play.
---
Is it going to be the original “Win”fury or will it be post-nerf?
---
Im gonna be playing warcraft 3 for even more nostalgia
---
I thought all this for a long time too. The thing about wow, is the game play has never been incredible. Wow is really about the socialization,  and it's why a lot of people hate modern wow. The developers thought people played the game for the game play. It was always about the community. It's why retail is doing poorly and why classic will do well.
---
Playing an actual RPG beats everything of that.
---
Is there any class-specific classic subreddit? Where we could for example learn tips and tricks about certain classes?
---
How do I get to show my faction and class along my name? :(
---
There’s some debate among speed levelers if dungeon leveling will be faster. I think some 5 man teams will be spamming dungeons.
---
Not to be that guy, vanilla is not a good game because of the viability of the specs/classes.
---
The birth of Killjoy!
---
Todd Howard you’ve done it again.
---
this is bad logic. 
---
But i agree with the gear, it does look like a pile of shit. Though, it is simple. And people like simple. It will grow on you if you play it long enough and then bfa gear looks too flashy and too cheap, like not everyone can be the hero bruh. There needs to be peasents with peasent gear.
---
I bet you like store mounts.
---
@6. How are you going to summon to SM with only two people and without a warlock?!   
---
*laughs in classic*
---
Thats funny. Some of the things listed here is why I think Classic will be a success.
---
Youd be able to grab all the feral bear talents with the HOTW spec except for Leader of the Pack (3% melee crit to you and group). You’d also be losing +10% damage and omen of clarity compared to a pure feral tank. 
---
So it’s definitely not 100% optimal for tanking but if the group doesn’t mind, you can get by most of the time.
---
Frost mage for myself
---
It was definitely a joke
---
I apologize for not making this clear enough. My desire as far as my plan is to primarily do dungeons and raid with a side bit of PvP every so often.
---
I have limited understanding, but I'm not sure those changes are intentional. I know from the few servers I've played on, they had to work on scripting and other things that didn't work without official Blizzard support.
---
Well, I took 2 weeks of from work and I planed to reach 60. It will probably take between 8 - 10 hours to reach 20.
---
Planning to roll an Orc Warrior, which seems like it will be a pain to level with, but luckily I will have a pocket healer which should make the leveling a little bit easier.  Which class are you going to be playing?
---
Quick Mount Equip add on - Check
---
I highly doubt 06.00 will be that busy.
---
Where do you find what timezones they are? I'm so confused. I'm CST and just wanna be with like minded people, casual fuckers you know?
---
You seriously calling people autistic for wanting to play ranked PvP? 
---
I was onboard with your post up to that point, fucking casual.
---
And you're a pro, right? 😂 Get in the bin you neckbeard.
---
Kael deserved better.
---
Nice larp. Good luck getting invited to a group.
---
You can try logging out and then back in.  Only way I can think of
---
https://i.imgur.com/oXMoHWb.png
---
It's the first one I remember doing that was open sky, and I loved it for that.  First non-dungeon dungeon for me.
---
I honestly think they would not need to ever put up Cata Servers. The first 3 games really do just feel like a complete trilogy.
---
I played on PVP servers for 14 years.  I had a blast.  But the thing with PVP servers, is that they are fun....until they aren't any more.
---
Getting chain-ganked and camped is novel at first, but after over a decade of dealing with it, I just want to play the game in peace this time around.
---
I agree. 70% is probably a bit too much. I'd say more like 65%
---
I don't get the rush of leveling. Half of the fun of Vanilla/Classic is the journey to 60.
---
Even the slowest of levelers will be 60 and decently geared by the time Phase 2 comes out.
---
Are pets just not worth it to have in raids because of incidental damage killing them?
---
Cross realms in classic only applies to battlegrounds. There is no cross realm dungeon/raid finder in classic. Nor are there cross realm auction houses. So a dead server will still feel very dead in classic.
---
TBF, most expansions include many large storyline bosses that are fleshed out by patches as the timeline of the expansion goes on. Nothing about Classic’s final bosses is unique to Vanilla. Blizzard has been pretty consistent since Vanilla that they roll out a patch with a main villain and storyline, you play that out, and ultimately face that boss, then everything we do finally leads us to the “final boss”. Through the years they’ve just removed a lot of the freedom to explore the world in a fluid way and made the game very linear.
---
Execution-wise, Blizzard has gotten much better at storytelling (feelings on the BFA story aside) but the game has lost its curiosity and wonder by becoming so linear and forced.
---
Calm down dude. Keep it constructive.
---
Almost every guide I find for warriors/rogues tells me to buy early vendor items, for example 2H for warriors and a sword for a rogue, but from my private server experience, you need lvl 10 to be able to learn 2H for warrior or swords for rogue, is that true in classic too? Or are you able to use 2h and swords from the get go?
---
Why do people hate Gnomes so much? They’re probably the coolest Alliance race to play, and the most embarrassing to be ganked by.
---
Once again thank you :D
---
Don't threaten me with a good time!
---
That would be very interesting to see.
---
Here's hoping "enough" people quit (not too few not too many) so we have healthy server populations once layer sharding is turned off.
---
I don't hate it. I just don't think it is conducive to the atmosphere I hope to achieve in Classic. If Blizzard doesn't ban it and people use it I won't go crazy, I was simply voicing my hopes for this situation. I don't see how you got "hate" from that.
---
Well gameplay wise he was harder to down then illidan (at appropriate gear levels), so at least there's that.
---
Thats a false equivalency and the toons arent out progressing anyone. You're making an argument that doesn't make sense. Say 5 people who lived together and oooled their in game resources whats the difference and how is that cheating?
---
Well said!
---
Seems like you are all afraid of hardcore guilds comoetitive scene
---
Obvious troll but will still respond
---
&gt;Bosses barely have any mechanics
---
Vael may be the most tank and spank boss ever created but it's still an interesting fight and requires proper gear and optimal play
---
&gt; Classes are boring and broken
---
Unsure how you can say the classes are boring when we all had tons of fun playing them back in the day.
---
if by broken you mean imbalanced then I'll agree.  They aren't well balanced so some classes will always do higher numbers than others.  However unless you're a min-maxer that really doesn't matter, as long as you have fun.  The tradeoff for imbalanced classes (honestly you mean speccs because every class does really great stuff) is variety.  The classes are unique and individual moreso than on retail.
---
&gt; Visually the game looks abysmal
---
I'll mostly agree with you here.  Objectively the game has lower specs for all the visuals.  Some people simply don't mind that at all.  I play RimWorld a lot and that game has super simplistic "bad" graphics.  I play my old PS1 games more than modern ones.  Graphics are nice but not the most important thing.
---
&gt;Raiding requires 40 people and a guild to even partake in
---
It does not.  My intro to raiding was ZG and AQ20.  20man raids are a ton of fun.  But even if we forget those so what? "can you imagine organizing that sort of stuff" why yes, because plenty of people did exactly that.  I prefer smaller raids because I feel like my contribution actually means something, I feel like in 40mans I could go afk and things would still work out, but that's just me not everyone else.  Bigger raids are harder to organize 100% true but that doesn't mean they don't work.
---
&gt;Everything takes forever
---
Yeah, it does, this isn't a problem.  The slower nature of the game is fun for me.  I remember LFD and instant que pops on my priest and druid followed by zero-communication rushes through the content and everyone instantly disconnecting at the end.  I can't say I ever met a friend in LFD.
---
Old pre-LFD dungons?  met tons of great people trying to track down extra party members.  Had fun conversations while waiting.  Being friendly was rewarded.  It was all around a good time and I don't mind it at all.
---
And you're still off because meeting stones don't summon in vanilla so waiting for a second person to travel there to summon doesn't work.  You either need 3 people counting a warlock or everyone flies.  Once again not something I mind.  If I don't want to leg it to an instance I won't be doing that instance.
---
&gt; There is no new content coming
---
Yes it is?  Maybe.  Blizz might release TBC servers and in that case likely you'll see some way to move your vanilla character to TBC (that'll be a clusterfuck).  But I'm absolutely not worried about a lack of updates.  There is plenty of content already in game I'll never finish all of it.
---
&gt;The problem is, some people have no idea what negative things Classic will have in store for them
---
I think the issue is you have no idea what things are actually negative.  Just because you don't like something doesn't make it negative.
---
&gt;You are all blinded by your nostalgia.
---
C'mon dude we all know this isn't true.  People have been playing private servers for years so there is obviously a market that actually enjoys the game in the moment, not just looking back at it.
---
People doing PVP server tend to take pride in the suffering they have to overcome. So they figure those people not suffering are not as "though" as them for avoiding the suffering.
---
I am going PVE this time. I have much less time now than in 2004. I can also suffer plenty outside of game :/
---
Hopefully they keep faction ratios in check to a degree, because that's how you get lopsided servers.
---
WTS "Iol" on Herod. Looks like lower case "lol". Playing on  Stalagg if you want to trade good names on there.
---
Main warrior, Druid alt used to Alch/Herb and funnel free action/flasks into my warrior.
---
Thank you for your nice reply :)
---
It's true that players in full T2/T3 didn't have much reason to do the lower level content, however, if Blizzard had made the choice (and I don't know if that was even possible in terms of lore since I'm not interested in lore at all) of expanding Azeroth with new zones instead of adding a new world - and here I don't mean like adding an island such as Northrend, but actually adding "attached zones" upon the existing ones thus forcing people to run through level 1-60 zones to reach them - then the T2/T3 players would still be visible and making Azeroth seem alive. But, the way they did it was to create a detached and isolated zone where the max level players would all be stacked together. That was the point I was trying to make when I said Blizzard made Azeroth irrelevant.
---
I definately felt TBC as a letdown, but maybe that's because I'm kind of sensitive towards changes to things I already like (which can be a problem some times lol). But I think you're right that post-TBC were even bigger letdowns (mainly after WoTLK I would say). 
---
Have a nice evening :)
---
PvE is great, you get to avoid all the annoying teenagers who just want to speed run running out of content. With cross realm BGs, you'll be able to PvP as much as you want too.
---
I always loved this video...
---
Brings back memories of my favorite WoW spell in the game at launch.  Original "Blastwave".  
---
For me, the feeling of power when you cast Blastwave and the visual effect truly epitomized my vision of a mage in WoW.  It shows how well the dev's back then combined the visual and visceral effect of that spell.
---
It's sad that the later dev's ruined the spell by making it look like an umpire calling someone out at first base, and making it a worthless spell to use.
---
No. You just wouldn’t be able to create he character without a subscription. You can still get to the login screen.
---
this post is hilarious my man good work
---
I mean we likely would do this even in a DKP guild but we're not fucking anyone when it comes to loot
---
This guy has to be a troll
---
My advice if you want to get ahead of the pack, disable all of them but Questie and anything you need for your class (swing timer, shot timer, Druid mana bar, or energy ticker).
---
I'm not dreaming about it, but I am talking about it non stop to anyone that will listen. Coming from a 41 year old I get some "really?" looks.
---
well yeah its fine for dungeons, but its not for mc.
---
10,000 player login queue is only like 4-5min wait time.
---
Getting into Herod during reservations I saw queue numbers as high as 30,000 and the wait time never went higher than 10 mins.
---
I think it depend on how often you use those. If you spend 80% of your time casting that heal, then your playstyle is going to rely on your pinky finger. And trust me, it's quite tiring. If you spend most of your time doing that heal, then put your ranks close to your moving buttons, as it will induce less movement.
---
Been there, done that.
---
Questions for Paladin players:
---
How expensive are Symbol of Kings? And how much do you need for an average raid night? 
---
And how slow are you when doing solo content if you specced holy for raids/dungeons? I know it's slow, but how slow? 
---
And is a Holy/Ret hybridspec viable if you just want to raid and do dungeons casually?
---
Warriors suck ass against basically everything 1v1, do you see them needing convincing?
---
And you'll probably still be broke by the time you finally down KT.  Vanilla WoW costs a lot of gold if you want to experience everything the game has to offer.
---
I’m moving in with Dee
---
Delete this.
---
If you just plan on getting to R10 and staying there with some MC/ZG casual raiding, you're better off with a Shadow Priest. Warlocks tend to shine late end game and do everything you do, only better.
---
*Warning: If you decide to go Shadow Priest, be prepared to drink a lot. They go oom quick on their own even faster with Viper Sting / Mana Burn.*
---
Not only undead racial but also tremor totems for days
---
Yea exactly. Just assuming a lot of non reddit people have the same mentality so between them and reddit peeps, and just being closer to launch everyday, I expected it to be high by now.
---
The big vanilla server was literally peaking at 10-14k players concurrently online, not to mention the 1-3k players concurrently online across multiple smaller projects.
---
Do you understand what concurrently means and how that is just a fraction of total playerbase?
---
Win what exactly? Some pointless wpvp encounter?
---
Ty! I was gonna go thalnos but what yall told me I'm going stalagg!
---
Damn your post took a nosedive. TBC Arena is great. You’re just parroting what you’ve heard other people say without comprehending it. TBC didn’t homogenize and in many cases made specs more distinct. Resilience is necessary if you want PvP fights to be more than “tunnel the squishy till it blows up from unhealable damage”.
---
Not just a joke...
---
Hopefully we see that automated Right Click Report and Vanilla's absolutely brutal World PvP are compatible.
---
Exactly this.. ive done the Pserver scene.. and at first when youre all leveling up its a blast.. you have your little rivals.. and blah blah.. then people hit 60 and get BiS gear.. and sit on flight paths making it impossible to go anywhere.. or do anything at all  
---
so ya.. it starts fun and ends shitty..
---
No, In early days warlocks were on imp duty and always had imps out for blood pact. The optimal DPS spec you can get involves sacrificing your pet however it may not be the standard on live servers due to threat management being difficult for that spec
---
Which non-gathering professions actually generate money?
---
I NEED tailoring as a mage to get robes of the archmage, but will tailoring make money? Or should I drop it after robes and get something else?
---
Thanks for the elaborate reply, friend!
---
How's it cheating? How would it give you an advantage in game? Both for PvE and PvP, you're better off having 5 player controlled characters than a multi boxer.
---
Some of them are humanoids.
---
Are you basing the plentiful resources on Nost spawns? Nost had increased spawns to support 10k. Do we want classic servers to all have varying spawn rates based on population? That not classic.
---
&gt; If they change respawn rates even more 
---
they haven't changed it at all
---
unless you meant "even more people", then never mind
---
Pride is a hell of a drug man
---

Compared to pvp servers, how easy will it be to rank up on a pve server in phase 2, while no BG is available?
---
My thought is: it will be easier to rank up on a pve server, because there is less competition. So a few HK will be enough to be on the top of your server!?
---
Am I wrong?
---
LG
---
Ya we'll see how it goes down
---
Me and most people I know didnt want to spend money just to get their name.
---
I still don't understand the water strider thing. I mean, I understand why they introduced mount equipment that can give any mount water walking. I don't understand why they *removed* water walking from the striders. Why not just let them keep the ability and forbid them from using mount equipment? That's how the sea turtle works with its swim speed increase.
---
Can’t base it off that. People logged in. Got their names and logged off.
---
The passion that went into this by the legacy community, the Nost team and Mark gave me chills when they finally announced classic.
---
So happy this is finally happening!
---
&gt; gameplay was totally fine with 10k people online
---
oh fuck off, no it wasn't
---
I did quiet well as my alli lock back in vanilla. I went human for stealth detection to expose rogues before their opener and conflagration was an absolute blast to play!
---
Yeah and what people have told me is what will happen, on my server atleast, is that there will be an alliance gank squad on 1 shard, then all the horde will slowly move to another shard. Then theres me who has no idea how any of this shit works getting killed by people that I don't even know what class they are or what spells they're doing.
---
T6 was very pleasing. But T4 and T5 were very.... unique
---
Yep, because ppl created characters and logged out or not?
---
sounds right
---
Yeap tank.
---
The game was not then nor is it now "easy-mode." The difficulty in the game is customizable, which is an issue for players who lack either the ability or willpower to play on higher difficulties. Even in WotLK, you had hard mode Ulduar and Heroic ICC, which a small percentage of player base was able to do, and now there are M+ and Mythic raiding. Classic WoW was not challenging, it was grindy. You could accomplish everything in the game with time spent. Retail actually requires skill to accomplish the really notable stuff.

I played the stress test on a 2012 Mac book air. Set to classic graphics I was getting about 30fps
---
I'm definitely not saying I am 100% sure I can stick with this plan, but I think it would be awesome if I did :D
---
Normal sleep pattern (8 hours, at night) is the best.
---
Haha! Planning to pocket heal my Orc Warrior friend with a Troll Priest. You can use [this guide](https://classicwow.live/leveling/horde/duo/orc/warrior/troll/priest) for leveling in case you need directions, they are working on a save progress feature for the guide.  If you want I can share a collection of resources, there are some external sources that for all classes, but it was mainly written for Priests.
---
The addon/interface doesn’t show up for some people so this is a decent alternative.
---
What's the point of looting ashkandi if not to slice casters in half in open world pvp.
---
The thrill you get when leveling in contested zone and always looking behind your shoulder is what trigger me the most. Pve is getting quickly boring and repetitive, while preventing rival horde guild from raiding MC/BWL is way more fun.
---
It’s also got that many players when the only players signed up to play are the most hardcore who spent $7.5 to reserve a name. 
---
Those who have signed up at the point are those most likely to not quit.

---
I think it's better this way tbh. My brain instantly went to hunter in the first picture anyway so it had the desired effect with being much simpler
---
I was thinking about not beeing able to skin the mobs because of other leatherworkers in the group, but i guess you'll be doing a speedleveling routine :)
---
I played horde in classic on a alliance dominated server and believe me.. you want to be on the side with less players.
---
Always targets to kill is more fun than having to search for them, instant bg quees are more enjoyable, too. You should just pass strangle for lvling and that’s basicly it. I will always pick the faction with less players in that kind of games, it’s way more fun that way.
---
Hunting down 1-2 ppl with 20 others is boring as fuck, while killing as many of them as possible out of the masses and maybe even get away with it or just come out as winner in those fights is a completely different lvl of fun. U need some friends to play with if u don’t play hunter/Druid/rogue though to make it enjoyable.
---
Does blood pact stack with power word fort in vanilla?
---
Dont troll, dont have a non rp name. Ganking is the same as pvp realms.
---
Yep already migrated from Herod to Stalagg.
---
That's super interesting information, thanks a lot for testing this!
---
I find it quite curious that you would put a warrior with a good weapon up there. Figured the "most gear dependent class" would be weak in that position. Is rank 10 just that strong of a set?
---
Yeah I remember the rainbow days, but Kara was SO worth it. I would even raid it without caring about gear just because I loved the fights and the atmosphere! I even managed to get Attumen's mount too so it was worth it.
---
Exactly.  The bootlicking is read in here
---
Because the game is not new? lmao
---
Always remember, the amount of min/max'ers you see online is far, and i mean far more numerous than the amount of actual good players.. they can try and find every advantage available, even go as far as have entire abilities that you dont have access to.. But 90% of them you will beat by just being somewhat reasonable at the game.. goes for pve and pvp.. Nohandsken was outdps'ing a large portion of the hunter playerbase a few years back.. and the man is a fucking quadriplegic
---
Have you read The Wow Diary by John Staats? It should answer many of your questions.
---
Vanilla noob here- why is AQ considered T2.5 and not T3?
---
lol let´s bore the players to death until enough have given up. It might even work for the tourists.
---
Quality content
---
have you not played on Pservers in the past 6ish years?? its 100% what i described.. you have 60's of the opposite faction sitting in every lowbie town imaginable and ruining everyones leveling experience.. hell ive even heard them saying "im trying to make every new player quit"  
---
but yes.. im incorrect here
---
so what do we do if a new meta emerges that wasn't in vanilla?
---
all the raids only get run by 40 druids because they discover something that existed in vanilla, but didn't become popular until classic, completely changing how everyone plays the game to only druids.
---
Holy shit, listen to yourself it's a fucking laughing stock. Someone makes a character in a game and does something within the game, completely within the rules and guidelines put forth by the game, and you seriously think this is a bad thing that is on the same level as actual, real harrasment that causes physical or mental harm to someone? Yes, this is god damn hilarious how daft you are and a massive crybaby.
---
"OH no, hes planning on ganking a streamer, boo hoo, such harrasment, someone pwease, call the cops!!" That's what you sound like lol
---
There's nothing to debunk here, Champ. You're just a tender little snowflake who thinks ganking someone is this horrible form of harrasment. Stop trolling and actually make some sense. The fuck are *you* talking about? Lmao
---
Kevin Jordan, original Blizzard Vanilla WoW developer, emphatically stated in an interview that "greifing," "camping," disrupting escort quests, killing flight masters, etc are all part of the game and part of what make Vanilla alive.
---
Those moments of absolute frustration and hate make juxtaposition for the moments of glory and triumph.
---
Hopefully the Blizzard Classic WoW team understand this, because we can't expect the retail Tourist audience to understand it.
---
Nice. Thanks for the quest items! Added to my check list.
---
In general, it all works, but takes getting used to. Especially when you have lots of skills (in classic it will be easier, at least for leveling). My current controller doesn’t have two additional buttons (L3 and R3) so i had to remap some and I just use touch screen when i need.  The only thing I didn’t figure out is how to Shift Click (but probably you can map it easily in settings).
---
To set it up is pretty easy.
---
For android: try directly Nvidia GeforceNow if you have a beta account (it’s free for now, which is great) and you can use your ps4/xbox controllers
---
Another option for android which I tried is Parsec and renting a computer through them (from Paperspace). Setup takes few minutes and works great (you also pay per hour, which might end up being more cost efficient)
---
iOS: i have only tried Shadow so far. Set up is super easy, but in my region it’s expensive (you pay per month). Currently ps4 and xbox controllers have some buttons not working, but apparently it’s fixed for the next update
---
The lag and entire image depends on your internet. In shadow i have the bandwidth set to 5mbs and it works great most of the time, but my internet is mediocre
---
Monster didn't exist in 2004. You're ruining my immersion.
---
Do you have high blood pressure?
---
Exactly why my discord name and ingame name are the same, makes it easier to get in touch with me.
---
This is the classic experience
---
You still need level 10 and 10 silver for the weapon training. Guide probably just not taking that into account, or else it’s talking about post level 10
---
Nice!,
---
My wife and I haven't subbed, yet. I imagine that there are a lot of people who won't bother until launch.
---
I think that works out well. Everyone isnt a Jack of all trades that can just fill every roll with a single spec. You want to primarily PvP? You'll have to respec and commit to it. Same for PvE, farming, or whatever else be it. It adds an extra rpg element
---
&gt; Do you understand what concurrently means and how that is just a fraction of total playerbase?
---
Most of those are the only people playing, and they play constantly.  So the concurrent playerbase during peak hours is basically the active population.  All the other 200,000 accounts or w/e are dead or duplicates.
---
Not too often. I've run into 40-man multiboxers but it's pretty rare, and if you know how to fight a multiboxer, you can throw even a good one off his game. Usually this involves figuring out who his 'main' is and eliminating it, but it's not always as easy as it sounds. Imagine getting moonfired by 40 druids at once. Sure, druids aren't great, but 40 moonfires at once will delete anyone.
---
Again though, it's pretty rare.
---
IDK, it would be a fun exercise to see how much you could strip down the DK trees to fit in vanilla without being ridiculous. They were ridiculous in Wrath anyway, though. DH would take a lot of creativity to strip down into something sensible. Their over the top mobility is so central to them that it's probably not possible though.
---
I mean you still probably should have kept the 27th as an off date lol.  The servers don't go live till 6pm est/3pm pacific.  I just put in for an early shift on monday and took the following 2 days off.
---
:')
---
Hah, me too man.
---
That's why they've have to be reworked for Classic, as in removing a lot of the OP spells. Same with DH and fel rush, it wouldn't fit within the Classic playstyle.
---
PvE is great to sit back and zone out into the game, much like playing the game on it's easiest difficulty setting.
---
PvP creates a sense of danger in the world, it adds an extra weight of value to every single item of resource in the world.
---
On a PvE server if I see an enemy faction farming mobs/nodes I need, there is literally NOTHING I can do about it. I'm in PASSIVE competition with every player on my server for resources.
---
On PvP if I see an enemy faction farming mobs/nodes I need I can actually do something about it. I am in PASSIVE competition with my own faction but I am in ACTIVE competition vs the enemy faction.
---
I would never want to sit and watch an enemy farm things I need and have to shrug and say "First come first serve I guess"
---
Yes but that’s 5 times the man-effort. It’s a 1-1 ratio of players to characters. 1-1 hours spent real time to characters progressions.
---
Multiboxers play for one hour and get 5 hours game time/progression played.
---
And have you ever been out in the world and ran into one person that can shoot 5 fireballs at once? It’s not competitive gameplay, it’s just dumb
---
The only community or impacts is the streamer’s guild / raid so why should we care at all?  What sort of response did you expect from it?
---
DH and monk are so Jon
---
Shh, don't make them think about it too hard.
---
And that's why it's stupid to complain about.
---
because of private servers.. of which ive played 3-4 all the way up to 60 on
---
it's not, import string posted above.
---
I wanna play a warrior, and I played one in vanilla but for the life of me I cant remember how annoying stance dancing was.
---
How bad was it?
---
Madseasonshow I highly recommend that channel to help pass the time and hype up for launch day.
---
Yeah right... if that happens, I'll blow myself
---
Even on the receiving end when you had to worry about afking in a safespot not only for the respawning mobs but also ganks.  Instead you just fly high in the air and afk.
---
I know some classes like druid/mage could still fuck with you but for the restof us that person was now invincible.   I'd rather have a chance of killing someone surrounded by a million guards then no chance cuz they mounted up.
---
How would rank on a pve server without bgs? You wouldnt be able to kill most of the other faction most of the time.
---
How? You can't move.
---
10 druids
---
Bagel bites
---
I dropped off the boat at the launch of Wrath.  I kept buying expansions hoping that I would fee the same magic but not even the glide thing for the Fel Hunters in Legion kept me for longer than a week.  I would find my way back to a private server and then the magic came back.  Ive dropped a 6 month sub for classic and Im not thinking Ill regret it.
---
Incorrect.
---
This stream has been a real reminder of the leveling speed as I check back in the next day and only 10 levels where gained.
---
God damnit, chasing that hit cap is not something I look forward to. But the class is so god damn good I can't turn away.
---
Asking for evidence is a sign of high blood pressure?
---
yes, they are anti-vanilla.  and plenty of people are fine without playing the perfectly true pure vanilla experience.  it's absolutely correct, though.
---
even in vanilla, while there were plenty of people who used addons, there were plently of people who hated addons.
---
"pointless" Wpvp encounters are the **only** thing I want to do
---
20 bux is 20 bux...
---
That doesn't help.  Downvotes are just as good as upvotes on youtube.  Anything you do when watching the video is considered good.
---
The only thing you can do is click on the video, press play, and then leave the page after a few seconds.  As far as I know that is the only thing the algorithm thinks is bad.
---
Interesting Overwatch doesn't work that way so I only assumed the same logic would apply.
---
Historical context is relevant. This was early on, before “crit porn” was really a thing. Pair that with some solid music and editing, and climaxing at a 3k mortal strike -  all of that made it very memorable.
---
I’m just ready to raid capital cities again
---
Change of underwear.
---
Why? When it happens you'll know.
---
Half the specs being totally shit breaks any sense of fun one can have from the game.
---
I'll make sure to guard new, just tell me what to downvote sir.
---
Because you have 5 humans funneling the their efforts into 1 player. A multiboxer only has to put in 1 hour of effort to get 5 hours of loot.
---
which you will need to deal with more then ever now adays... go look at any private server scene to learn what youre in for
---
Bags are a constant source of small income for tailors. Everyone needs bags, their alts need bags, their bank toons need bags.

Nope, your other replies show you eat a little too much salt. I was just checking in on you and your health.

---
It's against the Terms of Service for more than one person to share an account.
---
Arguably for the *exact same reason,* it should be against the ToS for a single person to share multiple accounts: both create an unfair advantage.
---
But one loses income for Activison Blizzard, while the other creates more profit.
---
Guess which one Blizzard bans and which one they allow.
---
I was leveling an alt without heirlooms to pass the time until classic.  The AH really has become cancer for any low level items.

Oh I expect the population to drop 70-90% after hype is over, that's why I'm going to Herod, because i know highest pop server has the most likely survival rate( finding people to do stuff) when pop drop happens.
---
&gt;The meta won't matter for 90% of the player base.
---
Yep...after the world "seconds" (no such thing as a 1st anymore) happen and guilds finish stroking their egos they'll realize no one really cares about it. People have had 15 years to theorycraft and max out efficiency in the game, being the 1st has little meaning to it now (especially when it's already happened in the original game when it was actually new). 
---
People are really overthinking what class/spec to play. Sure, some of the more "meme spec" characters may have a harder time finding a consistent raid spot but after awhile it won't matter.
---

But a 20 multiboxer has to pay 20 tokens whether its gold or real money, in terms of this its the same thing.
---
You can get reported for anything, doesn't mean anything will happen
---
you will not be able to afford a mount at lv40 if you dont spend time making money while leveling (gathering, farming stuff, etc). But you will usually have enough between lv40 and lv45.
---
Slam is a useless skill and can be skipped. You could postpone learning Rend/Disarm/Revenge if you are broke. Everything else is pretty important.

That's the point. Use one of these words instead.

This was really enjoyable to read. As a long time while player, I played vanilla BC and Wrath of the Lich King, when Cabot came out I stopped playing retail like a lot of people and I slowly moved over to at the time what were very new private servers. Not many people knew about wow private servers back in 2010/2011. I've been playing vanilla BC and Wrath of the Lich King private servers for 8 years. Don't you dare f****** try to tell me that this isn't what we want and that we're going to get bored you have no f****** clue what the f*** you're talkin about.
---
I would never go back to retail because I haven't been apart of retail for almost 10 years. I've literally been waiting for this opportunity a large number of people have been pushing this for years and years. I started my own private server back in 2014 that started in vanilla and was going to roll through BC and Wrath of the Lich King over the course of a couple years. Fortunately other people are doing the same thing and they were doing a much better job of it so I jumped on their bandwagon. There's also that other server which used to be called wow Awakening and it's now called project Ascension. This is a little off topic but they basically deconstruct the game so that there's no class has only a single hero you can still choose your race but you're just a hero and when you level up you can choose any spell. So by the time you get 60 you have people that have very interesting combinations of spells. And yes most people have stealth. But it's an amazing feat using a version of the game that is still very popular. They're in vanilla. 
---
Anyways it's amazing to me how ignorant some people can be. If you played vanilla back in the day and you were actually old enough to comprehend what you were doing and how the game worked and you don't want to go back and play, great don't go play vanilla. But don't tell me that I'm not going to enjoy it you have no f****** idea what you're talking about. I can guarantee some people making these comments have never even played vanilla they've just had to listen to people talk about how good it was back then and they're just annoyed by that because they listen to their f****** parents do the same thing talking about how life was harder when they were young and how easy they have it now. So they just trigger the same defense mechanism I'm just call it all bulshit. These kids have no f****** clue and I'm going to laugh so hard as the population begins to grow and grow and grow on vanilla I really wouldn't be surprised if a massive chunk of the subs over the next year are for classic. I bet you after the launch and the big hype slows down but the excitement over the game is still there, I bet you lots of retail players are going to coming quote on quote give it a try.
---
[This](https://youtu.be/XuOYmqSF6OQ?t=18) is what a server with 12k people online daily looks like. I played for over a year on this server and the world never felt crowded (minus starting areas). You could always find groups, people always around to lend a hand in WPVP and always something interesting going on. Yes sometimes there was competition for quests but the world felt alive and it was amazing.
---
Well, they do have to pay for a second account, so technically yeah
---
At least my server has a meaningfull name :-)
---
Taz'dingo, see you soon
---
Could make Death Grip apply like a 10 second debuff that prevents Death Grip from working again. You could kind of get it on the same footing as Charge.
---
Is this a real question? You care if one group is gonna be like 1:30 faster through a dungeon?
---
Leveling is so bad that they rather you insta lvl to 110 instead of spending game time/money to get there. Shame.
---
I had hopes for that new system with flexible zones. It is better than before in my opinion, having to abandon quests all the time was silly. But it did nothing to fix how meaninglessly easy it is.
---
Yeah, OP isn't making an actual scientific theory here, it's a joke.
---
Ah, thanks. I know a little of WC 2 but #3 was my intro to the series. In WC 3 the only “engineers” I could think of were all dwarves - the mortar teams, the flying machine pilots, etc.
---
So what’s better for classic, arms or fury?
---
This has to be some of the lowest effort content on this subreddit. I'd say it's worse than the people posting daily art pictures since it's literally the same picture with an extra tab.
---
When farming it 20 times, yes.
---
That's a conversation to have ahead of time. I recall a Pally in my guild that would off-tank or heal depending on needs. When ZG was out, I recall a druid that would off-tank, dps, or heal depending on the fight but primarily was a healer.
---
You'll want to have conversations with your GM and/or raid leader to see what they think is appropriate given your guilds members, etc.
---
I'm playing WoW to escape the shitty parts of life, like it being pay to win
---
Where did they ever say that?
---
The mankrik server is overflowing with horde.  There is going to be an endless amount of horde raiding guilds.
---
Either level and get to know people organically, or go to the official classic forums and search for mankrik guilds.  
---
You're a healer, so if you are ahead of the curve when it comes to leveling speed, you will likely be recruited quickly.
---
server already ded, fresh one in 9 days
---
Lol what do you mean can’t find an answer. Did you try googling a talent tree? 😅
---
#IThinkYourAnalysisNeedsMoreNuanceButWhatev
---
Might get on my own server tonight and do some testing at different levels for some last minute refinement
---
How do you switch shards?
---
You realize that like 90-95% of the people that play classic wow will quit within 6 months, right?
---
I was inspired by  [u/lane\_cruiser](https://www.reddit.com/user/lane_cruiser/) his [Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cq6fn8/many_people_were_asking_for_a_highres_scan_of_my/) and i couldn't help myself making my own while waiting for launch.  
---
I'm thinking the talent progression next while leveling, but I want to keep it easy to read and I don't know how efficient AoE farming will be in classic (leeway and all).
---
Any tips/things you guys want to see in such a list?
---
If a mage is equally geared to a warlock and they have consumables and trinkets is the mage really just minced meat like everyone claims at equal skill? What about at the highest level of gear?
---
No, actually it can’t. I’ve played every expansion religiously since beta. WoW is the best game ever made and easily my favorite, but people will say whatever they can to discredit facts they don’t like.
---
But you actually could? Finding weapon upgrades for weapon types you had skilled up enough could be tricky sometimes. It would cost some out of your saving for a mount budget, but you could usually buy one with the money you earned by playing.
---
Is the word "master" still in the file name? If so, remove master from the wording and try again.
---
Your argument makes no logical sense. You are the one that doesn't seem to understand.
---
I played through Cataclysm and used to be able to see my character on the blizzard website. I can't see him anymore. Is this because he's been erased?
---
Probably feels good at both ends.
---
MoP pvp was actually really good
---
The classes were the saving grace of that xpac
---
Watch me find a two krol blades again so i can afford my mount :)
---
Yes but we can report it when we see it -- losing a character in vanilla was a HUGE DEAL.  Lost server reputation, lost gold, days of play time.  If people start getting banned then it'll be a good deterrent.
---
I'll probably play at night and sleep during the day. I'm kind of already on a schedule like that
---
&gt; What if populations don’t fall nearly enough or even the worst (best) case scenario, the populations actually INCREASE?
---
Enjoy your queue! Can't say they didn't try to warn you.
---
Imagine thinking new content will never be added to classic. Phase 6 will release and the game will sit in limbo for eternity. Blizzard will gladly lose money just for the autistic purists who want a private server experience.
---
Most of the time I din't even use macros and had my stances bound to ctrl + 1, ctrl +2, crt + 3 and knew which skill was wich number. So ctrl + 3 + 3 = pummel ctrl 2 + 2 = taunt etc
---
Potting in Duels is a bitch move. That's coming from the D2 mindset.
---
Potting against enemy players of the enemy faction? Absolutely fair game. You're using resources you've accumulated to defeat them, and if they use it in you, well that's one less potion in the enemy factions inventory.
---
I think you put the furry tag on the wrong side there bud.
---
There is no competitive pvp mode in vanilla wow, you don't lose anything if you die.
---
That's what most people here are missing.  The lack of an automated way to find a group is to encourage players to make friends and join guilds.
---
Im thinking you have never played a mage?
---
Is there a discord for bloodsail bucaneers?
---
It was available in original WoW. #NoChanges
---
and thats fine youre allowed to like PvP servers and all that comes with it.. ive done it so many times now.. and am burnt out on it.. its just frustrating in the end
---
Doesn't matter if you're in a zerg or a raid. Winnings, winning
---
I've had mine since they launched first wave, 2008. Damn thing still works!

as a rule of thumb, think late night TV, not Pornhub.
---
"XxBrianxX I'm going to be honest that buff smells like pure salt."
---
But... #5 is one of the reasons why Classic is so good :p
---
I hope they are not. Playing with 250ms (NA - Eastern Europe latency) would be terrible, especially as melee.
---
Was there anyone in the beta who can confirm or deny whether the eye of kilrogg pulls mobs towards you in instances? And also how big was the aggro range for it?
---
I am doing my part and not playing on launch day. I scheduled my flight home instead. It's going to be crazy no matter what features they have. I'm looking forward to getting in the day after so that the speedrunners can be out of the starting gates.
---
So they were raided by Interpol at some point and Steve Bannon is a former CEO. What a lovely company.
---
Pretty clever, though the novelty might wear off and become a "regrettable tattoo".
---
don't forget to craft greens and blues to disenchant
---
?
---
Haha I like this answer the most
---
If you play on a PvP server then you WILL get ganked, no doubt about it. Sometimes so bad you will either have to leave that zone or log out for a while. Over time this never goes away but if I'm out leveling an alt and someone starts messing with me, they don't know I have a full PvP geared beast I'm about to log in to and do some griefing of my own. Also when guilds get bigger you can just holler for help and bring raining death down upon the ganker.
---
Yea I just meant you don't lose anything by dying, it's just a casual mode. Just either run away or get a couple of friends and kill em.
---
Horde are the type of creatures that would rather die in battle than surrender.
---
I'll have to give that a shot, thanks. I never considered that
---
What is that orc?
---
They would just join another guild. Retail players like to raid because raiding is fun in retail. It's not just because they have a roster and it's convenient.
---
Imo it takes away from the classic wow experience.  Multiboxers have no reason to group up which removes them from the social experience.  Waste of 2-5 spots on the server imo.
---
I want to have at least 1 wholesome experience with some rando doing quests.
---
Where do I go to look for guilds on Faerlina? I'm a Troll Hunter?
---
My first ever character in vanilla was a troll rogue.  I used to always eat those deviate fishs to look like a human ninja.
---
Sorry but claiming that getting ganked, even with your definition, happens only once a das reveals that you're delusional and haven't actually played on a fresh high pop pvp server. Now I don't know how it exactly plays out with layering, but stv will be a quitting point for many.
---
Where can I buy that mouse pad?
---
All 3 realms will have big guilds and enough to do just pick whichever u know people on or fancy the name more
---
They arent mutually exclusive
---
&gt; Ha, you don’t even know how SINS worked.
---
Oooh!  This should be rich.  Why don't *you* explain it to me!
---
Check out Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning!
---
this.
---
also druid is the best choice here. leveling is very fast and the moonglade portal is very handy for the mooncloth xmute.
---
In my experience some mobs that dropped cloth on pservers drop it at a much lower rate in Classic. It could be that I was just unlucky, though. If you've got some surefire spots in mind, it'll probably go pretty well. I'm gonna try and get my tailoring up to craft bags/make a wand, too. Part of me really wants to hang around the lowbie area selling these things to make a pretty penny right off the bat, but the rest of me wants to get out of Dodge ASAP so I don't fall behind the other no-lifers. I might still grind out a level or two, though... Gimme that cloth...!
---
OP literally read what you posted. The company that owns them no longer has anything to do with RMT
---
Where's the audio originally from?
---
iirc they spoke about that at the last (?) blizzcon and said they don't want it to be in there, because it changes the feeling of classic
---
even when they raided a funeral all them got reported but no bans.
---
No need to fight. We should unite against our real enemy. The mage class.
---
Always play with your RL friends when you have the opportunity.
---
More so depends on PVP or PVE. 2H Fury &gt; Arms even without enough hit rating for DW Fury in PVE.
---
How was is not?
---
Peoples time is pointless now?
---
I've never leveled a warrior in vanilla, only in Cata and onwards.
---
I want to follow a simple leveling guide and icyveins [has this 31/20/0 talent setup for leveling arms.](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/classic/arms-warrior-talents-level-50-60.jpg) 
---
Are there any flaws with these talents? I notice there aren't improved heroic strike, but isn't that a really important skill?
---
Is this guide good to follow?
---
can horde and alliance talk to each other? 
---
Like what if you get ganked and then the ganker says "you suck dick".
---
&gt; Just stop being mad at him for having a fuck ton of gold.
---
If that's the case, sure. But I'm not sure why people in these circles insist on everyone being "mad" or "jealous" about it. All I said was that I found it funny that in a topic regarding the *possibility* that there's some shady business going on, the one defender is someone heavily decked out in high gold / expensive items.
---
Especially since I did look over his achievements and he doesn't really have anything that stand out. Perhaps he spends all of his days farming gold, but you'd have to be willfully ignorant about it if you don't think it looked suspicious in the moment.
---
I had a dream that me and my buddy who used to play 13 years ago had bunk beds and were playing on our laptops, passing back and forth a 2 liter of doctor pepper. A few days later i took off work to go on a "vacation" the week classic launches to go across the country to make this dream happen.
---
You can ask any price for an item, doesn’t mean it will sell. No one in their right mind would ever buy anything for those prices...
---
Because people who are bad at the game and cant handle getting ganked roll pve. Its pretty simple.
---
dude just stick an accent or two in the name in move on.
---
The group finder didn’t kill WoW, it was the fact that it was cross realm that destroyed it... this addon will have no effect...
---
there are lots of things that have been changed
---
Can you complete your first classquest in another races starting area? IE Dwarf hunter petquest at level 10 in teldrassil?
---
They are usually much lower pop. During character creation the RP and RP-PVP realms were solidly the least populated.
---
To be fair he is specifically doing a solo speedrun (on a new server, everyone else is lower level so you hardly see anyone on the video).
---
If people actually take their time they will be better geared and have much more variation due to dungeons and possibly crafting.
---
It hurts, because it is true 😂
---
If you want to raid tank you better roll warrior.  Druid tanking is niche end game.  Pally tanking doesn't exist end game.
---
Now dungeons/lbr/ubr pally/druid tank sure go ahead.
---
They lost SOME subscribers. They're trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator to enable the largest amount of potential subscribing players possible. They may lose some of the more dedicated, hardcore players but overall the number of potential 'clients' is greater.
---
That being said, subscriber revenue has been declining YoY, so you're right, they've shot themselves in the foot without actually realizing it.
---
yes, please tell.
---
&gt;competitiveness doesn't exist as an abstract concept itself
---
k
---
What's the opposite of a selfulfilling prophesy?
---
I think its pretty clear theres only one person here who doesnt understand how things work...
---
I think the chances are a lot less depending on how you look at it. RN there is a lot of hype around classic a lot of retail players hopped over to reserve their names to try it out but my bet is that most people quit really soon when they aren’t spoonfed everything like in retail wow. So maybe they do have to open new servers but that will depend on how many players are left.
---
Man, Pablo is a scripted response asshole.
---
Considerably different than the years before.
---
10/10.
---
&gt;d
---
its CRAZY, almost like....retail?
---
I played in vanilla and I loved wPvP... but I worry, just as in BfA, it'll just be lopsided :(((
---
Honestly, I don’t think you will make money since no one has any. Last stress test I spent maybe 30 minutes skinning and had plenty of silver for skills and professions just censoring scraps. I plan on jumping from beasts to humanoids for variety.
---
Nobody cares about PvE servers, and faction imbalance there is pretty much irrelevant.
---
That is your opinion. Many games I consider the best I have played got shitty graphic, or non. Football manager, is considered one of the best, if not the best manager game, and got graphics that look like something straight out of the 90's, but millions of people love it.
---
Account scammers HATE him.
---
OMG, I will mass report everyone I see that kills a lowbie.  Thanks for the great idea.
---
If I buy a subscription in EUR on my account that I created back then with the German WoW version, will I be able to play on UK and Chinese servers?
---
Yea but that's extremely hard to do. I've seen people even say things like "they should add TBC content but keeping the mechanics the same as vanilla". That'd be nearly impossible to do. The expansion was designed around the game balance at that moment and things were continuously tweaked to work with it. You can't just raise the cap to 70, add new dungeons/raids, and hope for the best. 
---
The only way you'd come even close to successfully doing something like that would to keep everything at 60 but then things would have to be remade from the ground up to accommodate the class "balance" that existed at lvl 60 in 1.12. 
---
You could just make brand new content that's designed for classic but that has a huge amount of issues that would come with it.
---
So I guess it is something to do if you really want to, not for profit.
---
Same class, just different Faction.
---
Switching from Dwarf to Troll.
---
Just stealing computing power from BFA because you know a lot of tourists will be over from there anyway so BFA will be more dead and we can use the computing power.
---
Well I mean technically healing spells do get an extra +2.5 yards that other spells don't, if you're a Tauren healing another Tauren. I start out my video with a range comparison between an Orc healing another Orc and a Tauren healing another Tauren, the total difference is 5 yards. You don't get 5 yards increase if you're casting spells or meleeing other people, you only get the +2.5. It's an aggregate benefit that (like I said earlier) has been largely ignored as of late.
---
Curse of recklessness by the locks for the win...if they’re smart
---
It helps order alle the incoming dmg,healing and outgoing. And it looks cool !
---
I was gonna do skinning and then pick up enchanting around level 10, just for the extra silver, but my leveling partner will be taking skinning, so we'll be trying to pool our money to have mounts at 40 and all that.
---
You'd make a little money if you sold wands for 10s/ea -- not a lot, but enough to keep going for a bit. Alternatively, trading a wand for 10 linen cloth (or 20 linen, or whatever) could be nice. Depending on the starting areas, people may very well have 10+ linen by level 6 or 7. But it does slow you down to sit around and wait for people to show up and trade with you, and all that stuff...and I can't imagine my leveling buddy's gonna wanna wait around.
---
Did you play ultima? Add losing all your loot ontop of that. And sometimes your entire toon if couldnt find a rez on that fuckin island
---
Let's be real, most players will quit near level 30.
---
For those of us not using diapers, we have to have something to do while we poop!
---
holy cow that site is a lot of work ... thanks a ton :)
---
It’s not a lot of money for me and playing on a private server just isn’t the same
---
And why can’t you do that today? 
---
The prices for the items are dirt cheap.
---
exactly why i dont enjoy it
---
7k people on it so its pretty much alive dont know if there is a new gehennas discord though
---
“No ragrets”
---
&gt; Why do people hate Gnomes so much?
---
&gt; most embarrassing to be ganked by.
---
You answered your own question.
---
its a quest reward tho so its easy to get
---
not like an ordinary dungeon drop that might not drop or u lose roll
---
I guess it is because u didn't logg in for a longer time. He will still be there if u pay a sub.
---
It's a mouse pad
---
Around 50%
---
How do you know it is overflowing?
---
Where can I see these numbers?
---
Found the original on:  [http://playvanilla.blogspot.com/2019/01/classic-zone-preferences.html](http://playvanilla.blogspot.com/2019/01/classic-zone-preferences.html)  I did some changes to it to make it more comprehensive.
---
There's no reason to think that.  If there are too many people to cut layers when they want to launch phase 2, they add servers.
---
They don't want to add servers now because they have no way of knowing how many people will want to stay past the first week.  But if the number of players JUST BEFORE PHASE 2 is so high that they need to chose between keeping layers or adding new servers, then they will know that there's the sustained demand to justify new servers.
---
They aren't.
---
&gt;Life isn't fair.
---
I'm sorry, I thought we were playing a goddamn video game
---
Okay, I thought so. Thank you!
---
Sure, you just end up being that 1/4 of the 40 man raid that gets carried
---
Okay that's good to know. For some reason, it just seems like mage is always brought up in this area so I was curious. I'm a bit more sold on mage now. Just deciding between it and priest.
---
I think it’s gonna be bigger than you think.
---
I only played og runescape. 3d runescape scares me
---
I definitely did that in vanilla. It is not recommended, especially before your level 40 mount.
---
The guy is one of those Trump cult followers. And no I don't mean just conservative, one of his earlier videos is a 10min rant about liberals. He is basically the_donald in a nutshell.
---
They promised the return of difficult dungeons in Cataclysm. Then nerfed them to ez mode not long after launch.
---
R10 gear is amazing for Warrior. High stamina and strength with % crit. You're looking at 4.5-5k hp with plate while most other classes are &lt; 4k hp and not plate.
---
But it's the weapon that really makes the Warrior. They start hitting hard around the Arcanite Reaper range and only go up from there. Here's a [good list](https://classic.wowhead.com/weapons/quality:3:4:5:6/slot:17/type:1:5:8?filter=34;2;250#items:0+18+19) sorted by phases.
---
You will get mass reported and banned.  As it should be.  ahahahaha
---
You’re wrong. Multiboxing is not viable at all in bgs. You might have noobs try it but they will quickly realize it doesn’t work.
---
I was a tank in legion and the fact that basically every affix was designed to specifically fuck over either the tank or healer got old pretty fast.
---
&gt;Pretty sure blizzard have already stated that they are unsure if they want to go on to do TBC/wrath or start a runescape sort of ordeal...
---
I would like to get a source on that, because so far I only heard, that they might consider TBC is there enough interest.
---
I leveled priest, rogue, and shaman all the end game. Rogue was a blast to level, stealth changes how you view the world completely. I saw more of the world on that toon that either of the other two.
---
It says the sites are owned by Affinity Media who used to own IGE but sold their shares in 2007
---
Okay cool. I am tempted by all the fun stuff and the portals and all that. But also deciding between this and priest. I never played either before and I've never played vanilla.
---
hell yeah man u are exactly the kind of mentality player im hoping to run into in classic, thats how i feel and i played more than u, i guess im the dumb one since i kept going after WOTLK. legion wasnt bad, but it was rare, bfa is the mess that sent me to classic. I actually logged in last night to test which packs were linked or not in mc, moment i finished there i was walking to bwl and like damn i cant handle this no more and closed the window. Classic cant come sooner
---
If a particularly stronk horde group made it to throne room can the kid be killed?
---
Going to do both! I'm going to level up a class that I've never played at 60 before as my main, and then I'll level up a "nostalgia" character as well as my 4th or 5th alt.
---
&gt;The only possible way I could see working would be to have "sub" servers grouped. One group would be 3 servers, 3 separate populations, all share the same names. If someone takes "Tank" on realm 1, it's taken on all 3. Then when population dies down, merge all 3 with less of an effect
---
I can get on board with that. Honestly none of these are ideal but preventing layering from having a detrimental effect equivalent to server merges is something I think this entire sub needs to get on board for. I want classic to come out asap but I honestly think we needed more time after server name reservations.
---
They had some nice lore quests in WoTLK but the leveling was easy.
---
Unintended effect of transmog unfortunately.
---
Completing my addon set up (which I mostly did already during the stress test), getting from Teldrassil to Northshire while picking up all the flight paths and then finishing up the quests there. After that I'll start up my leveling professions and make my bank alt and that's it!   
---
It's not much, but it's a start, I don't intend to rush anything though I'll get more in to it during the weekend.
---
Got ya, I guess that makes sense. I never played vanilla so maybe I'm just thinking of how the rotations are in later expansions.
---
You clearly did not play the beta or any of the stress test. Castsequence works, please stop spreading misinformation.
---
Both games have their merits. Please don't let this sub turn into WoW's version of /r/2007scape where half the posts are "DAE RETAIL BAD??"
---
It's definitely not common. Most people I think morally object to the idea. Or they don't want to fork over the extra cash.   
---
I quit playing WoW after Wotlk but I explicitly remember running into multi boxers pretty frequently in 5v5 arenas as 5 ele/resto shamans. I also remember a guy running 20+ shamans in AV in vanilla. But, it doesn't happen in just WoW you'll find multiboxers in EQ, GW2 and other MMO's that I havn't played I'm sure. 
---
It is definitely more of a principle/moral issue though. It is the only form of Pay2Win that's allowed in this game.
---
&gt;massive grinds and endless raiding to get gear
---
It's an MMO, that's kinda how most of them work.
---
Wait, this is actually great.
---
Would it be too much to add dungeons and raids?
---
This blog sucks
---
Tbc :)
---
Classic's patch is the best it was
---
mained a lock since tbc and leveled one on several servers, don't think I can go through that again so time to switch it up. Caster focused hybrid druid this time around (once i hit 60 ofc).
---
For someone supposedly against elitism, you sure are doing a lot of name calling over a preference of group making in a game.
---
Fortunately, I'm a bear druid and I have a guild already, so I'm not too worried about groups.  We also already have a shadow priest, so I guess you'd be out of luck there, sorry.
---
delete this
---
No DKs until phase 2, so I see no reason only alliance should "help" him.
---

I heard that faerline is the streamer server and thanos is the BR server should I go to herold or stick with thanos which seems like it will be less crowded? or try one of the PST servers even though im on EST?
---
[Hah!](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tenor.co%2Fimages%2F9c226510caec8eb250420f13b7093c9e%2Fraw&amp;f=1)
---
I don't understand, why would there be queues when they have layering? Isn't that what layering is supposed to fix?
---
Mains priest in vanilla, will level a priest but am duo leveling with a warrior buddy and I will be a shaman.
---
Eh I mean Blizz can always do more but its OUR community.  So if we want it to be better we should also chip in.
---
I think absconding blizzard of their responsibility or apologizing for their lack of efforts in these cases is sure a bad thing.
---
But us helping out isn't shilling for the company either.  I'll drop my reports and shun those I know cheated because I want my community to be better.  If you don't want to because you don't think its your responsibility thats fine.. But you may be a part of the problem.
---
Where can a dude go to look for a guild or should I just wait till release?
---
I would just wait to launch and look in game, but there is a discord server link out there somewhere
---
It's not their game
---
Did you say no mages?
---
The first night of the last stress test, I logged in shortly after it went live. I was around 1900 in queue, and it took roughly 30 min. People will likely stay logged in longer on live servers. I wouldn't be surprised if you sit in queue for 3-4 hours the first days. Then God forbid you DC after that.
---
This happened in Burning Crusade, in Vanilla there was only 1 nerf from 50% to 30%.
---
His name is thrall
---
How exactly do tank-swaps work in classic? From what I understand, raid bosses are immune to taunt, so how do you do it then? Do you switch to battle stance and use mocking blow or does that also not work? If not, is it done with one of the tanks stopping to use any of their abilities so the other tank would get agro?
---
I have a lot of friends who played vanilla, but I never actually played WoW before a few weeks ago (tried out the free run to lvl 20). If I'm being totally honest the game felt clunky and unintuitive. I heard there is an add-on that will help with quests not showing up on maps, which will be nice. But idk man, I'm hoping I can enjoy it but from the stress test it wasn't great.
---
They did not, a naxx geared DPS class did about twice as much or even more than ret paladins. Ferals can do a lot better with power shifting and MCPs but they aren't top tier either. Oomkin is just straight trash like ret.
---
True you don't need optimal, but given the choice people will take the better classes. Ofcourse I'd rather take a memer who I enjoy playing with than some idiot loot whore zoomer who happens to be a dps class, but if it's similar players, DPS classes have priority.
---
i re-subbed about a month ago in anticipation for classic.  i stopped playing in TBC.  one of the things that bothers me the most about retail now is that the mob levels are scaled to your own level.  like zones are now lvl 10-60, 20-60 etc.
---
Take it as hearsay. I read in a comment section that some one had gotten it, but wasn't able to verify it anywhere. It was a I knew a guy who knew a guy type of scenario.
---
Not even got a rough start at uni this year haha
---
Even 50% quitting almost instantly like that seems ridiculous. Not to mention there will also be new players joining while other players are quitting.
---
But I do think individual players will reduce their play time to more moderate numbers than what they spent in the launch week. That always seems to happen.
---
That's what I'm debating. I can sit at my computer all morning before it drops hitting spacebar but knowing my luck I will get booted to the last of que.
---
Hey, it's a \*\*dream\*\* ain't it?
---
Didn't say it is currently in effect.
---
Are you red shirt guy?
---
Describe the mage class in a couple (1-3) sentences.
---
Yeah. I also suck at pvp as a whole.
---
World of Lovecraft would be awesome though.
---
In addition to what Totemicfoolery said, enchanting and alchemy can also be good sources of income, but both of them will require a pretty hefty up-front investment before they actually start making money.
---
My plan is to level with skinning and tailoring (as tailoring does need a bit of leather now and then, and the rest is good for gold) and then drop skinning for either Enchanting or Engineering.
---

Easily warlock. OP, fun mechanics with strong resource manipulation, great class fantasy and class quests, and great utility.

Hi, /u/LarryLongfellow

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cs58ip/what_do_you_think_are_the_best_duo_classes_specs/). 
---
I think the Chinese servers are different due to local regulations. The game is released by a different company than Activision-Blizzard.
---
You know what I mean dude.
---
None of those people will say the graphics in the game are good though...
---
just a basic duck duck go image link.
---
THE GREEN HILLS OF GO FUCK YOURSELF
---
I will move to a new server only if can keep my name if I have to change it I will not move.
---
Lmao, pics!
---
What a loser. I kinda feel bad for you.
---
Yeah feel the same way, they will be WAYYY to many people on Herod and i think they will not take the free transfer to a “dead” server.
---
Not so much for dungeon blues though, they are bind-on-pickup and the modern trading system is only for raids in Classic.
---
I would be interested in an heirloom item called "Rose-tinted goggles" or something that would just nerf the hell out of my character during leveling so that the mobs around me would be a genuine challenge. Perhaps you could even select a difficulty level like with mythic keystone dungeons, with +0 being retail leveling and +5 being significantly tougher. I wouldn't even want to get an extra reward for wearing it, though I suppose the devs could implement an achievement if you make it all the way to level 120 wearing them. 
---
That would be a completely opt-in system that could cause a leveling challenge!
---
I would wear them in a heartbeat.
---
Is it ok if I ride with you all and my most important skill is spread and share fun during the run?
---
(not a druid)
---
Spoiler they aren't
---
If you have no friends or sth to follow.  
---
pick where your name is free, thats how i would do it.  
---
mb check out witch streamer you like the least :) and try to avoide his server.
---
Note that time in queue doesn't scale linearly because people close to getting in are far less likely to drop out of the queue. When you're #100, the 99 people ahead of you are likely to wait it out. But if you're #10,000, you'll move through quickly because plenty of people don't have the time or patience to wait that long and will drop out of the queue if it looks like it'll take forever.
---
Still gonna be one hell of a queue for Herod, though.
---
Please explain more to me about how Blizzard is going to do something about a game that isn't out yet. Also, while doing so, please ignore all information that Blizzard has actually stated about said topic. I love this shit.
---
Why do you think he is our current leader?? It’s got nothing to do with his heritage
---
&gt; You lost me here. How are mini games bad for rpgs?
---
If the game is shit you won't play it. If the game is so shit you are have to substitute the actual gameplay with something else e.g. minigame, you are just wasting your time.
---
Instead of reset, progress the existing servers to TBC, and make new classic servers.
---
Or progress with new content for Classic, instead of going forward to TBC.
---
Oh god the onyxia attunment escort quest.... never again
---
I was under the impression that the quests can be taken, but are exclusive (you can only complete/take one set).
---
But I'm not 100% on that answer sadly.
---
Lol. It works. 
---
There’s ways to make them follow without the follow command, they have broken a lot of these tricks (like following a certain vendor companion) but a few remain.
---
And good boxers don’t even require following, they understand terrain/wall movement from other games and use it to their advantage.
---
Most just don’t care to do it, I don’t find enjoyment in it because it feels unfair, doesn’t mean it’s not possible and is still being done.
---
Definitely curious on this too
---
Former druid tank here. Only Off Tank is pretty demeaning in classic. It's a damn important job. You can't just switch specs between fights. People will learn to have a druid OT.
---
That being said, I use to MT Molten Core, ZG and BWL. You have to wait until you can get  a cores though. It takes patience.
---
Oof
---
It isn't the most painful process to get it removed via blizard's support as long as you have the proper identifying info. I had my phone stolen years back and it was pretty painless. Dunno if they changed it however.

2. They said only layering/sharding, whatever you want to call it, in starting zones. But now it's expanded to the entire 1st phase.
---
Right. And I'm not arguing that there isn't legitimacy, but rather that I found it funny that someone who was that invested, and part of the community that was under fire was vehemently defending it with the same avoiding nonsense of just calling the others brain damaged (or similar) instead of giving anything concrete.
---
If he got it legitimately he got it legitimately, I just found that he looked incredibly out of place.

Not even a single letter

Bear Tanks are great for AQ.

What addons are a must have, or highly recommended? And what do they do?
---
Every page of this guide has probably been posted on this sub.
---
Agreed! 
---
I think it's awesome. It has already helped me reconnect with many lost friends!
---
&gt;Dont post questions on reddit that you can find the answer to in 5 seconds on google.
---
Harsh. 
---
Last time I checked the author said a classic version was unlikely. I probably wouldn't have checked again before launch as I have (had) all my addons decided on. But now it turns out I get to use my favourite bag management addon! Because of a questions a random dude asked.... 
---
Random dude... have an upvote!
---
Maybe a dumb question, but with everyone concerned/anticipating long queue times around launch, I always thought this was an issue layering and/or sharding was meant to mitigate or even eliminate. Is this just not the case?
---
Most of the classes were gutted with the Legion pre-patch. I was tanking on my DK at the time and pushing dps during Mythic HFC clears was the only really enjoyable thing. Keeping Breath of Sindragosa up for extended periods of time through clever cooldown usage, positioning and knowing phase-changes was actually a bit challenging. Then they removed it for Blood, removed multistrike (runic power generation), removed Empower Rune Weapon and made the spec boring as hell.
---
Still use mine to this day.
---
\*doesn't include the number of people who dislike pvp, but roll on a pvp server because their friends are there...or they 'put up with' the pvp in order to be a part of a 'large server'\*

Make it every 5 levels. You get to say 12 times ding.
---
IFUCKINGNEEDIT
---
Very true. I always leveled rogues and couldn't believe the change when I tried the hunter. Never before have I felt like I had *enough* agility.
---
Most likely, yes. I agree with you. But to make it even worse by refusing to go away from Shazzrah when you haven't even fucking started your character yet is just dumb.
---
How can it look straight out of wrath when wrath didn't exist when this tier set came out..
---
raw nuts are really good, some fruits too
---
Only boomers are going on pve realms.
---
I still have mine in the closet.  I just actually saw it yesterday for the first time in years.  Even though I don't need it anymore, for the longest time I had that glued to my hip in fear I wouldn't be able to log in anymore without it.
---
&gt; I played pretty heavily from BC onward and mained a mage. I had a ton of end game toons, but only ever tanked with a Pally and Druid at 70 and up. Are Pallys or Druids viable end game tanks in Vanilla?
---
If you mean naxx and aq, yes (with the right amount effort)
---
The next time you feel like throwing your money away could you just send it to me instead?
---
Thank you Josh, really. The podcast is now a part of World of Warcraft history. You've earned your place among the legends such as Leeroy Jenkins or Red Shirt Guy.
---
&gt;Plus, just thinking realistically, the only precedent for classic WoW at this point is old school runescape. It came into existence because people wanted runescape as it was at a specific point in time. Within no time at all people were begging for updates and alternate timelines/quests/stories/etc. Now the game is completely different and nothing like how it was originally in 2007.
---
Pretty much. I started playing OSRS shortly after it launched in 2013 and I was pretty actively following the subreddit for at least a good year - people were very anti-changes at the beginning, and people were actually *joking* about adding stuff that eventually ended up making it into the game. 
---
I'll just use the Grand Exchange as one example. The idea that the GE could make it into the game seemed laughable - there was a significant number of people who felt that it severely diminished player interaction and that it was one of the big catalysts that sent the game downhill when it was originally introduced to the main game. Anyone who posted a thread suggesting that maybe they could implement the GE in some way was heavily downvoted and met with severe opposition.
---
But, over time... attitudes started changing, and you could visibly see people becoming more relaxed about it in their posts. You'd hear a lot of "well I guess using a 3rd party website to find people before messaging another player "meet me at V west" isn't *that much player interaction*", and eventually the tables completely flipped to where people were being *made fun of* for opposing the GE. Eventually in 2015, a couple of years after release, the GE was actually voted in and somehow passed with over 75% approval from the playerbase, which would've been practically unheard of in 2013-2014.
---
I'm not sure if Classic WoW will end up in the same boat, but I wouldn't rule out the possibility.
---
like all dungeons, full on melee cleave with paladin or shamans as healers.
---
Yeah, that’s definitely how I felt about cataclysm and panda land tbh. At least the most recent xpac, however bad, is referencing wc3 quite a bit again. The rexxar campaign basically is where Bfa picks up as far as Kul tiran marines are considered. I subbed around 8.1 though after beating jaina, just not having fun.
---
I would think that this has to take time to develop. By the time a rogue gets geared up enough to hang out and grief people, so many others will already be leveled up and focusing on end game as well. It took Vanilla a while after release to ramp up to 10mil subscribers. When I started there were plenty of lvl 60s though only a few had even one epic. So even if tourists are coming on with release, they won't be getting steamrolled right away, it will be after the other faction gets to end game and is bored that this will start happening en masse. In between that, the PvP battles should be a bit more balanced on equal terms.
---
For multiboxers, they can spend a few days on retail and pay for all of their accounts for a few years Due to tokens pretty easily. It’s free.
---
Lol yeah this, I don't know how people haven't figured that out yet, I've heard rumours about every PVP server including the RP one
---
No, you can't be viable in every aspect of your life. We all have our weak points and our strengths.
---
So you're out questing, you hear a rogue go into stealth around you, and you feel nothing? 
---
I'm a Vanilla vet, but I'm not yet so jaded

Exactly, it got added when they updated mc and ony loot tables in a later patch
---
Well, there's a FAP potion, so...
---
Wrath? It was like that until the end of WoD
---
Because drinking cans of monster/red bull is actually going to do that much for you, you will look like a tauren by the end of the launch
---
Very glad to see that someone agrees that retail is grindy as fuck. 
---
The only comments i saw lately on this subreddit is that retail is casual shit and not grindy at all.
---
You obviously don’t play bfa then because that same shit happens with sharding
---
This is what is actually bringing me back to classic, ultimately. The sheer fact that the gear grind actually has an endgame, and that your hard work will always be valid, instead of just wiped away every two years. Once I realized that in retail items from previous expansions were essentially garbage compared to literally anything from current content, I just didn't see the point in playing, my gear will never really matter.
---
I doubt it will be anywhere near half, but we can hope.
---
Remember that a LOT of those will drop off within the first month, so I have no problem with layering at the start.
---
Think I'll create a couple of throwaway chars and mess around at the start, but not actually pick a server and main until numbers are a bit more accurate.
---
The USA is all about working people into the ground, I s2g. My husband is a PM for a construction company and you'd think that would mean he busts his ass in the summer and has winters to laze about a bit, but they still expect him to get in like 45 hours a week in the wintertime...even though the amount of work is a small fraction of the % he does in the summertime AND he has a company phone so he can be reached anytime. He had to haggle in a work performance review to get his third week of vacation (which he should have had anyway, having worked there for 10+ years) and he's so stressed he's probably going to drop dead from a stroke by the time he turns 50. Sure, it's probably something more specific to the field we work in (we work for the same company), but I've worked at places that were a lot worse, like never getting any vacation days at all (Subway, tutoring for a college), two days after the first year (Honda, via a temp agency; after 5 years there you didn't even get a full week of PTO, though in their defense you got paid for the week of July 4th and Christmas and you didn't work), or an indeterminate amount of time after a year, but not anything particularly good, either (call center work). 
---
Some government-related jobs give you a good vacation stint, but most people I know get only about two weeks a year. And when I say 'weeks' I mean 'work weeks' -- so 5 days per work week.
---
If I had 40 days off a year, I don't even know what I'd do... Maybe visit my family more than once a year...
---
This sort of epitomizes Vanilla. They stuck an arena in the middle of the jungle somewhere out there in a massive world. You’re never really told much about it, it’s just there for you to venture out and find.
---
But then I don't get your point. Why don't you just multibox if you planning to farm 20+ hours by gathering for wow tokens. The choice is on you, it's not about pay 2 win.
---
I can easily see why it wouldn't work. Imagine hunter vs. warrior on mounts, and if you think the warrior needs a skill to catch up the hunter if they are moving at the same speed, you'll get same combat mechanics.
---
Real Money Trade   
---
Paying fiat money for ingame services such as gold, boosting, powerlevelling, etc.
---
Why is everything numbered 1. ? That’s the real tragedy here.
---
Im swedish so maybe our use of insane(galen/galet) is a bit more loose yea :P
---
SET MOUNT TO *LUDICROUS* SPEED
---
What are layering and sharding?
---
The problem comes if you're incentivized to use it because others do. Where you'll have greater difficulty finding people without it, essentially making it obligatory if you want to run pugs. I can't control it if a large amount of players use it, which in turn makes more people use it until everyone has to use it. "Don't run dungeons if you don't want the addon then".
---
OH SHIT secret new class being released for Classic confirmed
---
It isn't a deal-breaker, you will get a little less dungeon gear if all else is equal, but you can avoid grouping up with other cloth-users for the most part.
---
There is also the option that one of you can level tailoring and with some extra cloth donated from the other guy you can keep that profession relevant to your character level much better than people leveling alone. You will both still want to level first-aid but you shouldn't need it much while playing together so only the minimum of cloth is used.
---
I reckon amassing the strongest class buffs/debuffs is where it's at and at the same time you reduce much of the loot competition when doing so.
---
My main is going to be a warrior, which I kind of mained in retail in legion and beyond, but I consider my OG main to be a rogue which I played in BC and Wotlk.
---
I really want to tank and feel like I'm useful.
---
Anyone did the beta test / in the know see how bad the ping was playing Pagle (or another EST server) from the west coast? specifically in norcal?
---
It seems the pst servers may not be that great, esp pve ones. and that most are in est pvp, followed by est pve.
---
Its against the rules but it will happen.  Blizz stated they do not support wowtokens for classic gold.
---
I hope you get banned for being a salty bitch
---
\*Sir, the players are predictably burning themselves out and blaming us for their lack of fun.\*
---
\*Quick, re-release Classic and start the cycle over again.\*
---
\*But Sir, they're going to burn out even faster this second time around!\*
---
\*JUST DO IT!!!\*
---
It works as long as you are doing mobs farming or dungeons if you can manage to tank and heal your toons well enough. Multibox questing in Classic is going to be painful. 
---
You’ll be able to kill mobs quickly enough but any quest that asks you to collect “x” items means you’ll have to kill 5 times as many of the mobs that drop it. Respawn is slow and it’s not like retail where nearly ever kill yields a drop. You’ll end up having to spend a lot of time there and will also be competing with others who tag the mobs.  
---
Also, since questing is much more linear, you’ll have to complete these types of quests to open up the next part of a chain.
---
Hi is this the bis line
---
Atm some kind of survival mechanics would be alright.
---
I don't know who to trust at this point.
---
Well see you in 6 months, I say 1-2 millions 
---
RemindMe!  6 months
---
Because in a RPG, people often choose a character that reflects an idealized version of themselves. That invariably involves being very tall and physically fit.
---
Gnomes are obviously not characterized by either of those two traits. This is coupled with that fact that humans subconsciously associate being small/short with being weak.
---
So an Alliance player, who wants to feel powerful, feels that there's a stigma with being a small Gnome.
---
Conversely, when a Horde player's avatar, which again is the idealized version of that player, is bested by a tiny little pipsqueak Gnome, it irritates that player.  So they lash out and talk trash because it damaged their ego and self perception as a powerful character.
---
Because both sides have a rationale for their negative opinions, you can find a lot of hate on Gnomes.
---
The ultimate irony is that when you play "flawed" characters like a *little* Gnome, you have way more fun. This is because your character has an actual flaw/quirk that makes them different and more interesting than the sea of generic night elves and humans.

If it is still working you can login to you blizz account and unpair it using the code it generates (pressing the button).

You only need the code on the back of the Authenticator no longer works.

Because beyond the cost of the 10 tokens is pure profit.  You think they farm their 10 tokens then log off?  Or keep plowing... It's pretty easy to understand.

Blizzard PR team is a bunch of retail babies confirmed

Yeah, I was hoping for non cross server BG myself, but I guess I will settle for the queue times not being 2 hours like they were sometimes for us.
---
Freaking awesome!
---
Its not pay2win because this is a game and in the end you dont win anything.
---
Horizontal progression is only viable for a certain amount of time. If the game ends up with 10-12 tiers, it will be broken.
---
I'm personally hoping they will take us through WoW history. At least the Burning Crusade at WOTLK.
---
Maybe with some servers remaining in vanilla, and some servers progressing.
---
Nah.
---
What is more pay to win though: multiboxing or paying people to follow you and destroy your enemies?
---
I interpreted the post that way as well. Hopefully they address it with a little more of a concrete statement in the ama.
---
SEIZE THE GAP
---
What do you win tho?
---
Just roll a hunter, tame a low level mob in the starting zone, have it sit out in the open, and hide behind a tree. newbies will think it's another random mob and flag themselves attacking it.
---
Raiding as a resto Druid is pretty much spamming tank 4 healing touch and giving inner care to priests.
---
I am so glad DotA championships are going on right now and literally end on the 26th lol
---
yes fuck new generation and new people
---
I am not asking if I can main feral or balance. I am wondering if I am a resto druid, how often do i need to step in and off tank during a raid?

Will using special characters in my name impede me at all in game? Example: will people not be able to easily whisper me in game or add me to friends or anything?
---
Get engineering. It's good for all classes in pvp, but especially vital for warriors. 
---
As for gear, you can look up bis lists online and pick stuff that has a lot of stamina on it. There's not many options in phase1, so just get whatever dungeon gear you can get your hands on. You can buy an Arcanite Reaper as your first 2hander, should be a few hundred gold.
---
They end up fucking.
---
Nothing felt dangerous on nost because of the crowd, and ironically despite more people being around you all the time, you didn't really have to be social to be successful. In a lot of ways it felt like retail.
---
Example, back in 2005 when doing a quest that involved clearing out a cave of mobs, I had to play everything super cautiously because I could very well be the only one there. I would find a corner where nothing spawns that I could pull things to so I was safe from respawns. I was constantly forced to keep an eye out for patrols. And when I finally made it through the cave, I had to be even more careful on the way out in case anything spawned on top of me. If another player showed up it was a huge relief, because even if we didn't actually form a group, we would watch out for each other and toss out heals or help out if one of us accidentally pulled two. If we did group, neither of us would leave until the other was done the quest, to make sure nobody got stuck trying to solo clear.
---
My experience on nost was the opposite. I'd go to the same cave and there was already two groups in there clearing it out with no fear. Didn't have to say a word and as soon as I walked in I'd get an invite if one of the groups had fewer than 5 players. Instead of standing around in a safe spot we'd stand on top of a spawn point to make sure your group got the tag before the other group. People rarely said anything in party chat, at most they'd give a "thanks" before dropping group as soon as they finished the quest.
---
I'm sure at max level it was a bit better (I got sick of the crowd and quit around level 45) but I can't see the max level experience making up for the quite frankly ruined leveling experience. Yes the higher pop was nice in cities, and world pvp was super active at all levels which was fun, but I think you trade a lot of the true classic experience away in a 10k+ pop server.
---
There is absolutely going to be people coming back strictly for nostalgia’s sake, and there absolutely will be a drop off of people that don’t end up liking the game.
---
We just have no idea how big that drop off will be. 
---
Either side of this making definitive statements are stupid since the game isn’t out yet, and we won’t know how it turns out for a while.
---
I love these!  Great job!
---
Yep, I'm certainly a hybrid while I know a vanilla lover who is going crazy waiting. In retail, I just finished an amazing transmog for my dark iron dwarf shaman. I get to feel like I'm running around looking badass while being a badass. That won't happen in classic. I farm old raids for mounts, and enjoy pet battling - neither in classic. I like the cinematics and feel the story is better told today than in quest text.
---
I played the entire expanse of vanilla, and enjoyed it as a paladin. I reserved two characters and will have a ton of fun when it comes out by playing horde this time. I'm not quitting retail though, the games are fun for different reasons. Enhance shaman is a lot of fun now, but guess I'm going back to healing for classic! Haven't done it since Wrath, but at least the dungeons and raids are mindlessly easy to heal.
---
You don’t think having 50x a server population on one server wouldn’t be a problem? When would layering ever end then? There’s needs to be a limit  so that we can whittle it down to one layer per server before phase 2.
---
They were. There was a while documentary made about Chinese gold farms of wow and diablo3. 
---
They were usually free hk's.  We made a meme out of one particular guy (well one character that I'm sure was played by multiple people at the farm company. His name was 'wowleader' iirc.  We took him to MC one time and gave him gear lol
---
The only "big winner" in terms of crafting income is enchanting. And only *if* you spend ages farming the best recipes and then enjoy spamming chats and being available to make a name for yourself as an enchanter. Probably not what you had in mind.
---
Both blacksmithing and tailoring have a time gated recipe that makes money just by being limited in supply but high in demand at first. I've never used leather, but I'd be surprised if leatherworking didn't. 
---
If you spend a lot of time marketwatching and bid sitting, you can make money off any of those. But then again, you can make profit without a profession at all by playing the AH anyway. If you're not a big AH watcher, the timed recipe is probably what's going to make you most of your money. Tailor's probably best for that so keep it imo.
---
Apocalypse Now isn’t “based” on Konrad’s Heart of Darkness though, it mostly just used the same names for the main characters. Heart of Darkness is about a colonial expedition to XIXth century Belgian Congo, in Africa, in which the main character tries to find a Belgian ivory seller to actually help him, and has nothing to with desertion or war.
---
nobody knows what phase 7 is going to be.
---
Thanks!!
---
im 22.. try again
---
Yeah they are right. Who would want to play one of the most fun and addicting games of all time when we can just do World Quests instead
---
So you run into a corner, and now all of your characters are facing slightly different directions while facing a wall. There is no way you’re getting 10 yards out of that corner without all of your characters drifting off in different directions. 
---
Sure, if someone happens to walk by you can interact with target and blow them up, but if the enemy team just avoids you your team basically has a bunch of people afk.
---
Yes. It's very annoying to whisper someone named Légólàs. Don't do that.

---
Taunt in vanilla gives your the threat that the top threat person has and makes the boss attack you for the duration of taunt. If you do not generate more threat than the previous top person it will go back to them, or whoever took over top spot.
---
Oh boy I can't wait to join an RP server to no-life level instead of RPing.
---
That's already on the map.
---
It's a spy
---
That's funny because rogue was the third one I was deciding between but I think I maybe crossed off the list. And oh yeah I'd be going priest to heal. I've never gone healer before and have always been interested in it. But I worry I'll spend all the time leveling up to realize I don't like it and wish I had gone mage so it's tough.

No, you can put rejuvenations on more than one target. However as below states, the target can only have one rejuvenation on him regardless of how many druids are in the group.

Actually, my stock portfolio has gone up by 12% in the past month. Thank you very much
---
You make good point but you’re just talking about leveling at launch. That’s what layering is for.
---
And yes, the endgame was a lot of fun on Nost with crazy wpvp and guild rivalries.
---
and that worked on beta? fucking weird
---
Played Mage and Warrior back in vanilla. Starting with a warrior again for maximum nostalgia
---
Just make a level 20 Warlock Summoning alt and park outside entrances to raids offering summons to people on your main in trade chat during prime raid time.

You can sort it and change fonts for different heals, dmg intake and outgoing. You can also completely hide some sources if you don’t care to see what hots are healing you for instance.

---
What is going to be considered 'high' DPS? It's been years since I've raided and used things like Recount.
---
In general, you will have a higher % of 'adult' population rolling on PvE servers than PvP servers. By 'adult' I simply mean population who are burdened by their roles and responsibilities in life (often having jobs, children, sometimes both). The last thing you do as a time poor 'adult' is sink in hours to discord, which is essentially the same as 'insta-gram influencers' in that it's a form of social media (in a different form of the forum-like structure of reddit, or other mediums).
---

---
+ The world still goes round without you needing to see/comment/like/subscribe on every single post.
---
For what it's worth, I'll be +1 Remulos (and I'm sure as hell advocating for my friends to join me).
---
I tried Cataclysm. I tried Warlords of Draenor. I tried Legion. They sucked. The game has sucked since WOTLK
---
I am back for Vanilla when the game was great. It probably peaked at WOTLK IMO, and I hope that they will do TBC and WOTLK in time. But, I am thrilled for Vanilla. I cant wait to earn my rewards.
---
It's only hard if you're doing it wrong.
---
Ok thanks I probably wont use it
---
Yeah but that's any online game imo. My favourtie thing to do is to find a fellow faction member getting ganked and jump in to even the odds.
---
It's not about suceeding. It's about why would you bring someone who does 1/5 the dps of the optimal spec AND rolls on his gear? You wouldn't.
---
Maybe it’s just me, but when I played Tauren I much preferred them with helms hidden in almost every case. Not because of clipping issues, just because, damn I like the way they look. /moo
---
What if the multiboxer got enough gametime to fund his account from BFA gold? Doesnt it stop being pay to win then? since he isnt paying anything :D
---
I've seen people with foot pedal keys too :D
---
This project is a karma goldmine
---
but i didnt
---
I never understood why everyone on Reddit fucking hates cClassic WoW. Like, they want it to fail. Why? What did it do to you??
---
finally my veng DH can be the best tank
---
Yea that one sucked.  I think they want blood to be the easy tank, spam buttons with less reacting.

---
That sounds pretty cool, but I wonder how many would use it.
---
Let me explain: I (and I suspect tons of people) have a hard time doing something a much harder way for "no reason". Of cause the reason is that it would be more fun that way, but as soon as there is a much easier way with the same reward it becomes hard to get myself to actually do things the hard way. (que rant about whether it is okay that hard games like Dark Souls isn't accessible for everyone etc.)
---
They have effectively no downtime if they let the priest get the last hit for spirit tap while the lock lifetaps up. Mage still has to drink during leveling. 
---
Shadowweaving should also add quite a bit of dps for the lock.
---
I used to be a night elf priest and now I'm rolling a troll priest. Both picked because I saw them as the laid back priest healing option.
---
Funnily, For the Alliance was actually said first in terms of released games. The High Elf units in WC2 said it when they moved/attacked.
---
I might do like a guy here suggested and stream to have my 1-60 adventures recorded/downloadable, so I don't wanna watch/listen to anything copyrighted and get the recordings muted... I'll be leveling with my brother with open mic on in discord &amp; speakers (I can't wear headphones/buds, they give me earaches), so we'll just have to chat to pass the time I guess! :')
---
For alts, though, I love the idea of listening to audiobooks.
---
I'm actually thinking about building an intellect set for my hunter just for leveling up weapon skills (because I know myself and eventually I'll want everything maxed out that I can).
---
Yah.   Automated system will take care of you.   If nothing else, if a 100 people report you, then blizz will get rid of you just because you are a toxic lil shit.  100 * $15 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 * 15.
---
PSA: Can we please not gatekeep? Sincerely, you do not own this sub FoxFactChecker.
---
100% still get that feeling.
---
Long time WoW player, I played on a server with Malseph and a handful of other multiboxers. It's detrimental to the gameplay experience for everyone except the multiboxer. I can list a dozen experiences if anyone needs reminding that it's borderline cheating.
---
It's only borderline cheating because it by all means looks and feels like cheating but for some reason in the ToS, it's not.
---
Yeah usually a multi boxer will have 5 of the same class (easiest) or 2 classes total. More than 2 is rare. 
---
With the 5 classes he literally just presses “cast frost bolt” and his program tells all 5 characters to cast at the same time. 
---
If he uses two classes you have to basically have UI set up for two sets of spells (like a top bar and bottom bar) and then cast spells for each class individually. 
---
There’s a few more nuisances but that the gist
---
Weird seeing how Boomkin is great in PvP !  
---
I'l see myself out
---
Priest
---
It's also hard for people to /who you
---
Why is it relevant to you?  Will it you some schadenfreude-esk feel good feeling to watch something others like fail?  Are you so up retails ass to just not want the competition?  What’s your motivation because this is the second thread I’ve seen started by you about how classic will fail.
---
Yeah I mean I have a full time job and a family so I won't be able to play until late at night anyway. The first weekend is where I'll grind it out for sure.
---
I know why he's using it, but for the viewer of the video its not very pleasing to watch due to not knowing what form he is currently
---
The medium servers today will be full on launch day
---
I mean I enjoyed the lil of classic I played but mainly as a novelty. It really is worse in almost every way. The world felt bigger though because no flying, that's about it.
---
Kinda would like to do the same - a final goodbye to the current WoW which I quit way back in MoP but I just can't be assed to waste space on my SSD for even a little while, lol.
---
You can disable any part of the UI. as for the MP5 ticks, I don't believe it comes as part of this UI, but I personally use `WeakAuras 2` The nice thing about ElvUI is that it's highly customizable.

Just use dbm classic
---
I hope we can get them to reverse the decision at some point.
---
Regrowth is mana in-efficient and is generally only used in PvP situations to get off a quick heal and then a small hot to go with rejuvenate as you kite.
---
Orc scum
---
That was a fun place to gank.  Probably my favorite zone in Azeroth.
---
Classic wow isn't competition for much of anything....   Mark my words, within 6 months there will be about 50k ACTIVE NA players.
---
it's NEET to be a neat.
---
I was hunted by an orc warrior the other might lol

And if I wanted to PvP I'd go play counterstrike. No I dont really mean that just trying to show why your answer is bullshit. You dont want to pet battle? Don't pet battle. Simple as.

I just want a panel after where she pops back out and says it’s a joke and tips him in a wow game card.
---
yikes. I can get people nostalgia bashing or whatever but let's not pretend bfa is good.
---
I remember my first PVP server.
---
You're acting like multi boxing is something common. I played wow hours a day until the end of wotlk and not once did I lose anything to a multi boxer.
---
It's damaging because they suck at implementing it.  You phase through layers with no rhyme or reason.  Oh your fighting someone and about to win?  They just disappeared.  Where is your guild mate?  You both agreed to meet at the bank, but he's invisible.
---
You see a skirmish in the distance and run to help, but you're in a different layer half way there.
---
Then there's the whole thing about you'll never see the same people.  With no layer, everyone is visible to you.  Every interaction with a player is a chance to build a relationship.  You'll see that person tomorrow, working on quests in your zone or moving to the next zone with you as you both level.
---
With layers you might never see him again.
---
I'm thinking Druid, Shaman or Priest.  Change my mind.
---
like a spirit staff? yeah totally necessary to have as a hunter...
---
You'll be your own floating death vortex at the same time as forcing your own dynamic respawns in your area... Not bad.... Not bad...
---
You can find a bunch of vods on youtube from people who streamed full raids on private servers. You can usually see a dps meter on the screen. Should probably assume a 20% +/- because we don't know if the numbers were correct.
---
Everyone knows about tidal charm it’s gonna be highly contested :)
---
Please invite my friend to group, his name is Illïdônæå.

https://willitclassic.com/view/XljRN8QtvZHRT0IcvEyo
---
At some point didn’t they say they’d stop collecting reasons people quit?  I think they got slammed for that at the time but in retrospect maybe it made sense.
---
In short:
---
If there are too many people in your zone the game will create different layers to spread people out. You wont be able to see people on other layers out in the world unless you group up with them to join the same layer as them.
---
Google / Youtube knows more.
---
Real talk though:  I think trading the combat talents for assassination is better
---
Honestly same. Iirc it was only that way due to hardware limitation. That limitation is gone now.
---
&gt; It's not about suceeding. It's about why would you bring someone who does 1/5 the dps of the optimal spec AND rolls on his gear? You wouldn't.
---
The "optimal" dps numbers of these days is greatly overkill. The necessary dps to take down a boss is abysmally low. 
---
I will concede that during world progression (1week) these sub optimal spec can be a detriment.
---
I think lock pally is actually better for leveling. In PvP, mage priest is hands down better.
---
AFAIK the layering / sharding occurs while ingame. Login servers are before you hit the ingame world.
---
me likey!
---
yes, since classic is based on the new engine, this addon actually works
---
Well, he does exactly that in the video you linked
---
thx for the feedback and always nice to hear what people think. thank you for the thoughts as well and I will try that in another guide. regarding the Arms PvP spec its many different specs and has to do with gear and style. But Moo is a very competent Warrior - and I salute all he has done.
---
No idea about BFA, but when they initially discussed sharding for Classic it was only going to be in newbie areas.  So that is the context I am working off of.  Sharding in a non-newbie area would be as bad as (and the same as) layering from my perspective.
---
it looks like one, and if you said it came from wrath, say compared to the T2 or T1 ones didn't look anything later on
---
if anything, it should be considered to age well.
---
But only until the next good warrior meme right? Or mage.. Or shaman.. Hmm, druids look fun.
---
This is precisely how I feel.
---
my thoughts exactly
---
Can't see it being longer than 2-3 months
---
5? At least double it.. and then some.
---
I listened to your deep dive and pvp forum/ranking system discussion with kargoz and others. You did a great job even though I’m not a warrior.  I’ve learned a lot and look forward to watching your stream once classic comes out. 
---
Two things; will you be maining a warrior or priest?  Also, I know someone already said it but your stream volume was also low.  Thanks for all this work and doing the stuff for the community
---
You'll still have Southshore vs Tarren Mill battles on a PvE server. I wouldn't worry about it too much.
---
Not really, but after I saw the survey I needed some context to justify the upload.
---
There funny thing is, there almost wasn't PvP in the game. It was something that was decided on later after a lot of internal argument.
---
Don’t you sometimes worry about your life? Just out of curiosity
---
Depends on your class I guess but Omen Threat Meter is useful for anyone.
---
Possibly some addon to auto accept / auto turn in quests but not a must have at all.
---
that would be 200 million
---
Gotta love that FD freeze trap combo
---
Death Knights completely broke the game's balance for years. Are you kidding? How could you want that?
---
Its not about me believing in something man, my whole point here is that we dont know yet. They literally havent said anything regarding this topic
---
There is no limit like that.
---
What /u/Cainelol was answering is whether multiple druids can put rejuvenation on the same person, and the answer is no.
---
Sixteen bucks for a pizza??
---
I wish he would upload again, and give his soundfile package to the public. : \^(
---
Let’s just say I hope I’m one of them
---
I agree with a lot of the points you made and think this is a good laundry list of the things that went wrong with the game each time an xpac was released
---
\&gt; Raid finder, group finder, pvp queues, being able to enter instanced  content from anywhere. (destroys open world experience, not rpg like) 
---
I can't agree with the PVP queue aspect though. I don't think you should be able to just click an interface icon and queue for something, but I did like being able to find the NPC in a city and queue for a BG, or take a party invite and be able to get queued as a group from someone next to the NPC. Unless you are only talking about the group finder button.
---
I think a lot of the problems with the game were solutions to the game just getting too big. Too many continents with too many zones with so much everywhere that the game had to get easier add new gameplay mechanics.
---
Never. Unless maybe all other tanks are dead and you need to taunt off the main tank so he can drop debuff or w/e.
---
People I know still insist that "no one knows how classic really was" and "they'll learn and quit quickly".  No, we just like immersive RPGs with communities, unlike the predefined faceroll solo adventures that MMOs are now.  Instant gratification pleases some people, but has no lasting impact.  I don't miss most other MMOs, where I do content with people without having to say a word, get a guaranteed reward, then never see their name again.
---
Playing in the stress test was a mistake, because I don't really want to do anything else.  I didn't come across a single rude person on the PvE server the entire week.  That's something magical in the age of whining and microtransactions... something I haven't seen since Vanguard.
---
Vanilla WoW is 1.12 with the API from back then.
---
WoW Classic is 1.13 with an API with greater similarity to that of 8.x than that of 1.12. So he's not entirely wrong and neither are you.
---
Parts of the modern API have been removed to simulate the API limitations of 1.12.
---
I was convicted once for 3 years, but I've started a new "Life" and would love to be a part of the Blizzard team!
---
You blow things up very quickly, but you sit and drink a lot too. Your quality of life is the best because you can sell portals and make/food and water which you can also sell for tips.  You can use the same spec for PvP and PvE and be effective and wanted for groups while at the same time have your independence soloing.
---
I was planing the same at first. But my guild needed me at release to get the guildname. 
---
But Will most likely play around 1 hour at midnight and then stick to the original plan with going up at 06:00 :)
---
We all have our story, don’t worry about it and just do you
---
Yea I did a support ticket last week to clarify for myself for classic and the GM confirmed it is not allowed... now whether you’ll ever have any action taken, who knows. Would be a bummer to get swept up in a ban wave though.
---
Sorry for off-topic but those debuffs above nameplates are weakauras, right? Or is it neatplates?
---
I wonder how many more times we will see the meme and if it will die after a few months of classic.
---
Raid bosses arent immune to taunt.

&lt;The Undecided&gt; (Horde - Shazzrah - PVP - EU)
---
**About us**: We’re a guild of old and new friends alike, with a core team of players who have end-game raiding and PVP experience in every expansion since Vanilla. We have all decided to completely swap over to Classic and are incredibly excited to be able to reform our guild and re-experience the magic of the original game that got us all hooked. While we all love the raiding element of WoW, many of us have an equal passion for PVP which means we will certainly be organizing regular PVP events and raids.
---
**Our Goal**: Our primary goal is to be a serious progression raiding guild on Shazzrah while simultaneously building a large community of skilled, mature, and socially minded players as we believe a good community is at the heart of anyone’s potential enjoyment of Classic WoW. 
---
**Raiding days and times**: Wednesday/Thursday/Sunday – 19:00 to 23:00 UK time
---
Loot system: Loot council
---
**Plan of action**: Build a large community of players to make the levelling process as easy and enjoyable as possible. Once 60, most of our core members will aim to to start forming dungeon groups as soon as possible in order to gear up and get ready for raiding.
---
**How to apply**: If you are interested and would like apply to be a core raider then please submit an application using the following online form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VVB1W8lxuCA7S5__EtVELs57f0NwtiwYNQDebhuDjy8/viewform?edit_requested=true.

As a heal priest you can manly Play with mouse
---
PvP server - Zones (elwynn, ashenvale, the barrens) are either "contested" or "faction controlled". 
---
Contested - upon walking into the zone you will be immediately flagged for pvp - which means until you exit into one of your "faction controlled" zones, you will be attackable by any member of the opposite faction at any time.
---
Faction controlled zones - in the beginning zones and capital cities (stormwind, orgrimmar, ironforge, undercity, darnassus, thunderbluff, elwynn, durotar, trisfal glades, mulgore, dun morogh, teldrassil, westfall, barrens, silverpine forest, loch modan, and darkshore) you will not be flagged for pvp, and members of the opposite faction will NOT be able to attack you UNLESS you manually turn pvp on yourself or CHOOSE to attack the opposite faction. 
---
For example both an alliance and horde in stranglethorn (contested zone) will ALWAYS be flagged for pvp and will ALWAYS be able to attack eachother in this zone.
---
Now if an alliance player was in durotar (horde controlled zone),  the alliance player WOULD be flagged for pvp, but the horde wouldnt be. So the alliance would not be able to attack horde unless the horde CHOSE to attack the alliance.
---
Same thing with a horde player in elwynn, the horde CANNOT attack the alliance while the alliance players can CHOOSE to attack the horde. 
---
If you choose to attack the opposite faction (alliance attacking horde in elwynn) you will be flagged for pvp for 5 minutes, after 5 minutes of not attacking an enemy player your pvp flag will automatically expire and would be unattackable by the enemy faction again.
---
Also all of this only applies on a PVP server.
---
On PVE servers there are no "contested zones" and the only time you flag for pvp is upon entering a battleground or attacking an enemy faction npc, or by manually turning it on. 
---
Same 5 minute rule applies.
---
So for example in stranglethron vale on a pve server - neither horde or alliance can attack eachother unless one of them manually flags for pvp - you have to make the CHOICE. Only exception is enemy capital cities. If an alliance walks into orgrimmat on a pve server they will still be automatically flagged indefinitely until exiting into durotar or any non enemy capital city zones.
---
I took a fat shit while writing this im so bored i need classic right fucking now
---
Imagine attacking a random enemy and suddenly the rest of his party shards in and rapes you. That is BFA :)
---
I made a post already about some meal/food ideas, but for the rest:
---
\-cleaning house. Yesterday I tackled the dining area (it's more a play area for the cats, so it was mostly washing out litterboxes, vacuuming, de-fur-ifying the cat towers, etc), kitchen, bathrooms, and some laundry. This week I'm gonna hit up the living room, bedroom, and the rest of the laundry. Then I don't have to feel vile for not cleaning while I'm off work.
---
\-Get caught up at work. We do things in 'monthly' batches which means the first day after the end of the month is a hellish mess because there's tons of catch-up and stuff to do. But if I get things caught up pretty close it shouldn't be too bad to come back to it.
---
\-Gonna go to the grocery Saturday or Sunday morning so food doesn't go bad too quickly.
---
\-On Monday (26th) I'm gonna try and scramble out of work early to grab a nap, and before servers go live, hopefully refill and wash out all the cat's water fountains, fill up their food dishes, run the dishwasher, and vacuum one final time. Then it's into the shower so I can start fRESH, test my setup, and gossip with my brother on discord until servers go live. :D
---
nope.. death cant come soon enough.. tired of this planet and the people who inhabit it.. dont give a shit about this life

---
how do people balance raiding with pvp, given that it costs more every time you want to respec? would you just farm so much gold that the cost of respeccing frequently wouldn't be an issue?
---
1. Click on the download button on the top left.
---
1. Unzip that file
---
1. Drop it into &lt;Your WOW Install Dir&gt;/Interface/Addons
---
If `Interface/Addons` does not exist, you can create it manually.
---
Probably tbc
---
If you add a mobile number to your account then all you have to do is log in and have a code sent to your phone
---
I think for the game to fail it would have to lose money for blizzard and that seems pretty hard to imagine considering how many people are resubbing for it
---
That's pvp content and you can't say otherwise.
---
Everything is either a JoJo's reference or it is referenced in WoW.
---
That’s funny.
---
Identical to the one I bought on amazon..
---
50% of the player base will be gone in &lt; 6 months and won't make it past level 40. The server queues will be gone and those that enjoy classic will still be there. I feel bad for the people rolling on low - medium pop servers that are like that on launch week.
---
No kidding.    Forgot about the ret pallies.
---
Spirit is good for everyone. And staves can hit hard if you need to melee.
---
Where did you find it?
---
Multiboxing should be illegal. It's an extremely scummy thing to do and abuses game mechanics
---
You can ignore the prot tree and still tank just fine on your way to 60.
---
I owe you a ten second Mechanostrider.
---
Yeah. Iirc it was purely technical limitations that limited them. However for locks it's not that bad. The ds/ruin spec has higher single target dps. And while the sm/ruin is better at multi-dotting trash its not like the ds/ruin spec can't do that. Also really only the tank group needs the blood pact buff. So it all kind of works out. But yeah the debuff limit really hurts some other classes/specs
---
o k i e   d o k i e
---
&gt; I took a fat shit while writing this im so bored i need classic right fucking now 
---
Nice.
---
I'm doing an entire paradigm shift. Going from Orc Shaman to Human Paladin. 😅
---
There are some classes that can do both pvp and pve in the same spec. Like PI priest and SM ruin warlocks. It's never 100% optimal for both, but close enough. Warriors and rogues are hit the hardest, they have no chance at doing both. 30-0-21 shaman can work as a heal spec while you have raids on farms and your guild allows it.
---
Private servers are not vanilla nor classic. There are plenty of videos that demonstrate how wrong they got shit.  Look em up.
---
Nah saurfang facts is where it's at
---
Never. You *can* do it if you take the initiative and make it happen. But you will never *need* to do it.
---
"My wife's boyfriend" xD
---
I love the superjail homage
---
fingers crossed about horizontal progression. No need for gear better than Naxx gear.
---
Yeah it’s mental. Hunter skill cap is through the roof and some of these private server guys have mastered it entirely.
---
As someone who plans to level a warlock, I approve this post. Hunters are terrible
---
Alright, thanks.

---
He sounded like he was from North America, so the 26th.
---
you win
---
Looking for an addon that will let me move/resize the player buff/debuff icons in the top right.
---
If you want the "optimal" spec for pve and/or pvp, than allmost every class has to respec. 
---
But you only really "need" the optimal pve spec while progressing, once your raid has more gear and has the raid on farm, you can raid with pvp or hybrid spec without a problem.
---
I will raid as arcane/frost mage at the beginning, but once we have MC clear and are waiting for BWL, i will spec pvp frost and raid with it.
---
He makes a great point about splitting up the already small niche playerbase for TBC classic.   This leads me to believe that TBC won't actually happen.
---
Anything works in 5 mans. Going in Prot tree pre raid is pointless for 5 man dungeons.
---
just a sub . my account only goes to warlords and i played the stress test last weekend
---
Never. You *can* do it if you take the initiative and make it happen. But you will never *need* to do it and no one will ever expect you to.
---
14$ on amazon
---
prefer not to
---
Like you can enchant gear on your main from your alt. better off with just a lvl 5 disenchanter

---
"Tell me about your childhood, specifically your relationship with your parents."
---
Are MonkeyQuest and Questie similar addons? In other words: Should one only download one of the two? Or do they both have exclusive perks so you'll want to have both?
---
I've been watching addon ones lately.  Wish Blizzard would open back up the stress test so I can configure them.
---
There might be class quests that you could potentially miss in your 'own' capital city. You'd also not earn that rep if you are questing somewhere else.
---
But overall no not really any disadvantages. In vanilla you have to travel across many zones to find enough quests etc so shouldnt have a big impact at lower levels at all which starter zones you did.
---
Last time I got delivery for a medium pizza and a soda it was 30$
---
Just a heads up if your doing this for mount rep you can't ride the ram or strider as a nelf
---
I think the opposite, the gear in Vanilla and TBC is the only gear that looks good. 80% of the gear that comes out is exactly the same " lets give warlock,mage and priest the exact look but with a different color"
---
**Sharding** is a system retail wow uses where each zone creates new copies of itself when there are a lot of people. So for example if 500 people ran into Winterspring they would actually end up with \~5 copies of winterspring with around 100 people in each. It can lead to a situation where people are popping into or out of view when you run/ride/fly between zones and can be pretty weird.
---
Sharding will not be used in Classic.
---
**Layering** is a system made for Classic where the entire world makes a copy of itself when it is very populated. So if 20000 people log in at launch they might end up with 8 copies of the world each with around 2500 people.  
---
It is still kind of weird, but running between zones will not cause any issues so it is much more immersive and doesn't ruin world-PVP as much.
---
Also, the layer you log into the first time will be the same you log into every time in the future on that character, this means that you will see and interact with some of the same people as you level day after day.
---
In both systems you might get moved to a different shard/layer when you join a group.
---
Layers from layering will be gradually combined as less people are playing the game, by the time more content comes to the game there will only be one layer left on each server.
---
Run fucker dont walk... noo dont attack that passive group. Omfgggg come on!!! Dont stop!!!!!
---
Yeah that's my state of rage right there for escorts.
---
Doesnt give me a price and says no shipping to germany ....

Then why are you bitching? You're basically out here crying without any real knowledge about how the game works. Lmao is right

How much did you pay for wich size ?

Looks so cool. I’ll also be playing a mage. I’d love to see this guide when it’s complete!

lookingforgroup is the channel to use for like "LFG RFD" or "LF HEALER MARA" etc its nothing wrong with using that channel because it existed in vanilla.
---
&gt; the game is so hard that if you let shitters in your groups you’ll never finish anything
---
Ah, definitely trolling.  Got it, reported and moved on.
---
No troll and yet, here you are, definitely trolling
---
Pick up quests for stockades, and run to t, after get quests for brd and run that one. I know it's a bit out of the way, but it gives a really good wand for your 3 casters from one of the quests
---
I mean, let's say development started in earnest in 2000 and the typical career lasts about 35 years. If we expect a range of experience, a good half of the devs should have retired due to age.
---
I got off drugs about 2 years ago but yeah it’s going to save me sooo much money staying home.
---
Should be possible. The only really big differences in Classic will be the scatter shot sharding DR with freezing trap and melee leeway messing you up.
---
Well, with 60/40 Horde Alliance ration world pvp indeed is going to be onesided and dull. 
---
So, whoever you cited might be right.
---
if i play rogue and go stealth can I wave at another player? or would it de stealth me?
---
You can get them bigger, and I don’t think they ship to Germany?
---
Just saying it’s the same map.

Blizzard’s Warden got nothing on Superjail though
---
I still have mine and it still works
---
Like 14$
---
Just pay subscription to play.
---
 Solo / duo leveling really depends on your guy's speed/synergy/hardiness from ganking you have. 
---
Have fun. I wouldn't really recommend any guides, just play the game, quest, try to hear and level. If you make it to sixty, try to get into a bunch of dungeons, then raids. Pvp along the way.
---
You'd think people who are hyped for the re-release of a 14 year old game would be a bit older and mature, but if only half the shit you read on here is true oh boy
---
except yours has spelling errors.
---
TBC Arena is awful as private server players have discovered. No one plays 3's which the game is balanced around, because they have no need to. Instead they roll the OP comps in 2's (there are very few of them). There is a reason TBC private servers are dead. All that matters is the PVE And the PVE scripting is mediocre.  WOTLK Arena became ok. The game suffered. Cata/MOP during certain patches it was at it's height. The game suffered more.
---
BG's have sucked since vanilla. Healers became unkillable gods and all that mattered. There is a reason you stack almost HALF a high rated BG group with them. This has been noted by people like Venruki who has said things like "people can actually die".
---
This your third thread about this, we get it
---
Some people just can't understand that someone might enjoy something they don't. 
---
I had someone in retail trying to argue that playing classic was "wasting time".
---
Wasn't The Maul Arena also in at launch? Or is that coming in phase 3 or what have you?
---
Kids who played that are adults now are just salty that they dont have the time for it

---
The amount of abilities there is depressing.
---
Does modern WoW have controller support yet?
---
Without great lows there cannot be great highs. There is only bland
---
Well we all have our own estimates but my point is that it's a very cheap game to produce in comparison to a game with new assets and everything, so it wont take a ton of people subscribing for it to turn a profit
---
Wow, that is super helpful.  That is such a hilarious coincidence!
---
You can find this image, with corrected spelling, and have it printed somewhere like vistaprint.   I got a 3 foot by 4 foot for $25.
---
Ironically, if you read this thread, the PvE community doesn't exactly seem very friendly or above hurling generalized insults at an entire segment of the playerbase.
---
They haven’t seemed address what will happen if players don’t drop off. What happens if there are still 30-50k people on one server when it is time for phase 2 to release? 
---
In the blue post mentioning Herod they stated that even with layering that realm is looking at a 10k que at launch with their current subscribers. 
---
It seems like they are banking in the numbers to drop drastically of the course of a couple of months. When, in fact, the game could continue to grow during that time. What if there isn’t a drop off and instead more players?
---
Fuuuuuuuuu :'(
---
Where the hell are you living to pay so much for a pizza? I live in Germany and I pay like 8 € for a medium sized one

xD
---
Is it really that hard to pay a super fan in classic gold to sign off on classic content? This is just awful
---
Point them out!
---
If the server cap is 10k, let's say layering would create 10 layers of the world each with 1k players. This is to combat overcrowded zones.
---
If 40k people are trying to log in, the server cap will still be 10k, it doesn't matter how many layers are created within it. 
---
Layering is meant to solve overpopulation in zones, not increase the server cap.

&gt;Why Blizzard's Classic WoW Will Fail

&gt;No Troll, legitimate reasons why I think Classic WoW will fail

&gt;Why Classic WOW Will Fail Part 2
---
In the last two hours. We get it, you like downvotes.

When I played we always joked that only Chinese gold farmers played hunters

tbh phase 1 with just ony and rag wipp be the most boring part and when people start seeing mass pvp over world dragons it sh9upd be insane
---
I dont know what foot is in cm and im too lazy too look it up :D
---
I mean, then remake it, and ill pay for it. Or don't do it at all.
---
when you install you can play while it downloads, loading times are bad. could always load in while its downloading, say goodbye and then uninstall
---
Imagine having that much of a boring life that u sit on a sub solely to talk about how the game will fail
---
You actually said something true for once.  Classic numbers will be inflated by retailers who come over and see what a superior game it is and abandon retail for it.
---
Crooked Hillary
---
Oh lord clicking abilities and everything, bravo
---
I would assume it would be BC.
---
The returns come after the tokens are farmed.
---
You spend the same amount of effort covering the cost of your N account(s), because for every extra account you have to farm N*X hours more.
---
However once the tokens are farmed you now farm at N times people with one account.
---
It should be obvious why this is bad.   
---
For N=10 (and assuming herb nodes always have 10 uses) that means once the tokens are farmed you farm at 10 times the speed of others. *Without putting in any extra effort.*
---
The waves of nostalgia leading up to Classic give me goosebumps. Excellent playing friend, thank you for this.
---
The latest version (17.0.5) worked for me during the stress test - https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/move-anything/files
---
Makes sense. When you summon them they say one of the following,
---
“Why do you call?”
---
“Send me back” 
---
“I don’t like this place”
---
“What do you want from me?”
---
It's only partly that.  It's also "people will go back to work, school, start playing their other games again and fall back into a more normal schedule so that rather than peak hours being 85% percent of the realms total population it's more like 25%"
---
Elemental Shaman (31/0/20) due to burst damage, naturally high hp pool, and mail + shield. 
---
Lightning Bolt + Chain Lightning + Earth Shock + Fire Nova Totem all hit within seconds of each other for 2-3k damage with green gear at 60.
---
Other classes that excel at R10 tend to struggle with survivability and low damage pre-R10.
---
You've misunderstood my friend

Same here, I'm not sleeping until I see level 30
---
WoW's esport has professionals that make less than fast food employees. The announcers make more, which is why people like Venruki and Ziqo don't bother. The only GOOD Arena is 3 v 3. All other forms of PvP in WoW is broken. BG's are awful and healing is stupidly OP. 
---
And yes,  if you think Arena, which has destroyed the game completely through homogenization in a laughable attempt at balance in a MMO was good for the game? I think you are autistic. So do the people who made WoW.

What kind of self-respecting rogue doesn't log out for 5 minutes after using a cooldown?
---
They have 2 Nost devs though
---
Damn auto correct.
---
None... I'll go to work as normal... come in, and hopefully not have much of a queue, if I do I can crack on with walking to the dogs, helping the Mrs, cook some tea... then hopefully play a few hours before bed. I'm done with all this preparation stuff these days. It nearly killed me doing WoD, esp playing on Draenor EU, and having to wait until about 4.30am before the server finally got up and running. Will just be a normal day for me, just with Classic available. Super boring I know.
---
Yeah classic definitely needed balance back then going too see s lot of mages  and rogues
---
Because no one in the history of wow has played Hunter emphasizing efficiency in any capacity.
---
Would be cool if Blizzard made their own cloud gaming
---
The combination of the anticipation for Classic and school starting this week makes for the slowest week ever
---
I decided rolling dps and not to be a healer/support this time (raided as shaman in 2005). But man, whenever i see your guides something inside is pulling me back. Must...resist... :p
---
I'm sure i'll still be confused about my main final choice in august 26. &gt;.&lt;

---
Loved my shadow priest in vanilla. I felt unstoppable in WPVP. So much fun.
---
It essentially caps out at 50g/respec. The problem is for some classes 50g is a lot harder to earn than others (from a time/effort perspective), as you're aware. I used to go through 200g/week in respecs (but that was trivial change for me, all things considered).
---
You either put up the gold to be a specialist, or you go a jack-of-all-trades. 40 man raids rarely ever succeed or fail based on an individuals talent-point-allocation and there is more than enough 'slack' built into the majority of content that it will not matter. As long as you're capable of doing your job for as long as you need to (e.g. healing until the fight is over) then you're fine.
---
Think about the 50g cost in context of whatever consumables you intend to use during a raid. At some point in time the 50g is trivial compared to the cost of everything else you're blowing through.
---
They're not gloating. They are fighting against cognitive dissonance. They're trying to convince themselves.
---
Don’t be a twat.
---
There's a bunch.  That image is posted here frequently.   One that stands out is arathi highlands and strangelthorn vale.
---
So why doesn't everyone multibox?  Why is it still an extremely niche thing?  If its so lucrative, I should be seeing groups of 5-40 identical characters out running around on top of each other every time I log in, but I don't.  I haven't see a multiboxer out in the wild in months, much less in any kind of instanced PvP.
---
That is fair, the "true" experience can be subjective I suppose. 
---
But WoW was always developed as a PvE game first and foremost, hardcore PvPers seem to forget that.
---
&gt; Why does daytime weekend raiding seem to not be as popular as nighttime raiding.
---
Because people have kids and families.
---
There was 3 posts on the front page with this same joke
---
Ya this one kinda blew up on me. Thanks dude!
---
i feel bad for the people that will "prove retry is not meme"
---
 its not gonna be easy to rerroll on classic
---
To each their own.
---
I have a friend who will try it out for the first time. He only picked up gaming a few years ago.
---
Oh right, I did forget and sadly can't quote since the original thread got deleted, but the reason I brought up BBB and the money specifically was because he did admit to having bought BBB with real money.
---
I basically asked him how he got ahold of the BBB and if it was with real money to which he responded that he did buy it for real money but that didn't matter, as TCG mounts are bought frequently.
---
Didn't pursue any further than that and ended the discussion there. But it was still nice info to see that there's BBBs going for gold from reliable sources!
---
Hunter. You have to keep stocks of ammo, pet food. You can drop aggro with feign death which really is a life saver. I like to be able to solo most of the stuff. Different pets with different benefits. Not overly gear dependant, mostly only on ranged weapon, the pet does a lot of the dmg anyway. Can just take on multiple mobs and really never die unless you get ganked. You have an edge in wpvp against most of the clases. Has aspect of the cheetah which is pretty nice pre 40. You can grind effectively to get gold for mount at 40. Pretty good in dungeons. Not much competition for gear except for rogue sometimes.
---
will the race/class availability be the same as the original WoW? So pally is only for alliance?
---
[bloodsail.classicdiscord.com](https://bloodsail.classicdiscord.com)
---
The lead in quest can start from Dolanaar, Darnassus, or Stormwind.
---
Fair enough, honestly when levelling with a group it's not a huge deal if you don't have the skills right away.
---
Yeah I suppose. Ive played enough wow in my life to realize that no matter what someone will be buying gold. Dont really care anymore.
---
You have turned to the dark side, and you must repent for your sins. How about we schedule your return to the light on August 26th/27th?
---
Don’t you have a “why classic wow fail” thread to be posting?
---
You have a different opinion than me!??   TROLL!!!!!!
---
I don't think he's bitching. We are talking about WoW on a WoW subreddit.
---
It’s how it worked in 1.12. 
---
Melee is a big disadvantage because being hamstringed from 15 yards away is not fun for a hunter.
---
I was thinking of:
---
On the first day of cata, blizzard gave to me:  One Azeroth respec...
---
What on god's green earth makes you believe there will be more EU players than NA players?
---
Warlock.  
---
Hence why I am playing a warlock again, it's just a blast in every aspect of the game.  
---
Plus I'm on a PvP server, so I get to Soul Fire gnomes on a regular basis and send those little potatoes back to the shadowrealm from whence they came.  
---
Stupid gnomes.
---
You can, the main disadvantage is time. You've gotta walk to undercity, wait on the zeppelin, then go from org all the way over to the durotar starting zone. 
---
Biggest exception is if you're a class that isn't available to that races starting zone there won't be a class trainer. But I think all the classes available to undead are available between troll and orc so that won't be an issue for this specific example.
---
Lol you fuckin loser
---
&gt;change my mind
---
Alliance base backdoor
---
Just go the standard Arms spec.
---
Can't wait to get to experience the world anew again in classic and form social bonds and make friends by following a guide and path to a T!
---
Is layering just Marketing for instancing?
---
Randy played a Hunter though (though Humans can't be Hunters lol)
---
What kind of drug is wow being compared to in this picture?
---
Or just use raptor strike. You can melee before level 10.
---
I don't think that matters. Lets say they even pick up 100k subs. Which I think may be on the low end but, this forum has 200k members for argument sake. The poll with 50k responses indicated nearly 1/2 of respondents do not have a current wow sub. So there is our 100k who will sub. That's mostly from the US/EU market, so I'm sure it will be higher as they also have the asian market which may be even more numerous than that but still.  
---
100k subs at $15 a month and even if they only stay 6 months is 9 million. Yes, I know various things cut into that but still as a fast looking at the numbers sort of thing I think its a solid win for bliz.
---
&gt; I remember guys in BC and Wrath who would get the gear they wanted and then apply to a better guild. That’s very difficult to do in classic
---
I think this is just you misremembering Vanilla. This happened all the time in Vanilla. BWL guilds took people who were getting geared in MC guilds, because they kept losing people to AQ guilds.
---
Neither do most of the complete frauds that populate this sub.

&gt;Private servers are not vanilla nor classic.

I'm not sure if you are agreeing with me or not, but that is what I am saying. Private server numbers are way higher tuned for dungeons.

I work on Tuesday as well, but the game will be there when we get off so
---
So you're the one that defended them!
---
I feel like I remember copy/paste being a thing?
---
2H Arms, keep a one-hander and Defensive Stance for tanking.  Stacking Def and speccing Prot are fun and thematic but not necessary until you're looking at raids.
---
kill it with fire.  Anything that automates the LFG process in any way, anything that auto-spams chat, any custom "gearscore" tool.  I don't think it even comes down to specifics of what the particular addon does-- if they allow this TYPE of addon, we'll get versions that undermine important things about the game.
---
I think I'll report you anyway until blizzard changes the rules about it.
---
Yes, shaman = horde only and pally = alliance only
---
And layering will have the same problem. People will jump to another layer until they've found a safe one with their faction in majority. Other faction will do the same. So basically every layer will be dominated by one of the faction, murdering few remained opponents and forcing them to jump to another layer as well.
---
They really need to turn off layers as soon as possible.

---
Did not know that.  Fixed.
---
Of course. Vanilla was new at the time, so accepting its flaws was easy. Now you have retail to look to which has a lot of things vanilla can't provide. The playerbase is also a generation older, generally with less free time.
---
If you assume the next expansion will have more vanilla-like mechanics, you could see a big exodus
---
If you end up with tier 12 then that seems to be level 85 gear, how are you understanding that as horizontal?
---
You can certainly stick to horizontal progression forever, plenty of other games do it.
---
It could and it is a possibility that the game grows in popularity as time goes on. I don’t know why everyone is expecting the majority of people to get bored and leave. 
---
Keep in mind with Herod’s current player count the devs stated that you should expect ques up to 10k. That’s just from people who were dedicated enough to download the client early and reserve their names. 
---
Many more people will be coming.
---
Can confirm. I played stress tests and set up castsequence macros on my shaman for things like weapon buffs and lightning shield
---
pretty sure its coming with phase 2 and dire maul

be aware that you world of warcraft folder might have more versions of wow, i had the same issue until i put my addons under _classic_ folder addons.

Mained an undead warlock, going to play an undead warlock.  
---
I just can't quit man, it's like crack.
---
multibox=MB
---
I don't get how you see it as pay to win. 
---
For starters I don't think it's wrong. It just makes sense that if you want to play 5 characters at the same time, then you can pay for it. 
---
In general the game can be divided in: Leveling, dungeons &amp; raids, bgs and world pvp.
---
Leveling: I don't have the experience but I'm pretty sure it's faster leveling 1 character to 60 than MBing. If that wasn't so, then every server first 60 will be a MBer. It is true that by MBing you will get 5 characters faster to 60 than by having only 1 account.
---
Dungeons &amp; Raids: It shouldn't affect you at all that someone multiboxes. Again I don't have the experience but I'm pretty sure it's way faster for a 5 man grp to clear a dungeon than a MBer, unless of course the group is really bad. As for raids, if you're in a guild with a multiboxer and have a problem with that you can convince the guild why it isn't optimal, if they don't understand that you're probably better off finding a new guild. Other than that... (In dungeons)They will get the gear they want in the character they want, which makes for an advantage. In raids idk how it would work.
---
Up until today I thought multiboxers in pvp were against ToS, but reading the thread I see they're not. I'm still not sure if I'm ok with that. Specifically in world pvp.
---
Battlegrounds: I'm imagining something like AV, a huge clump of druids spamming moonfires or something alike. Of course they will own single players or a small group (2-3). But Bgs are about strategy, so you should organize and be able to take them down with less players than the spots the MBer is taking up. If they are in your team and you're angry about it... well idk what to say. I guess that sucks, as I said I thought it wasn't allowed.
---
World PvP: You're pretty much fucked alone. There's no chance 1 player alone can win against a MBer. If you can, avoid the fight. If you need to quest/farm in the same location i would try to get a group and camp him until he gives up. As I can see from this thread, you'll have lots lf ppl wanting to join you!
---
In conclusion: I convinced myself that maybe it is kinda pay to win. But only in some aspects (Leveling multiple characters, funnel dungeon items to desired characters). But in other aspects it will hurt the team more than help (Raid or BG). I think I'm still not against it, mainly because I want classic wow to do good. The more active accounts the better. But I wouldn't want anyones experience ruined for it.
---
I've made an edit to the original post regarding him to make sure I got my point clear, if he is a good player then by all accounts it wasn't my intention to target him as hard as I did.
---
It depends heavily on the boss and raid. But high dps in mc/bwl is averaging 600ish, but with speedruns you can approach and even hit 1k dps avg.
---
And then u get forced to summon imp cus the damn buffs haha.
---
im going to right click report people using multiboxed accounts just to abuse the system because why not

Different gaming eras, different audience different communities. I am more interested in seeing how the classic community will be a few months in. People have the crazy idea that classic will bring and maintain millions of players as if a few million 35-40 year old boomers who did not touch a video game in 15 years will come out of the woodworks holding a baby in their left hand and a white monster drink in their right hand. I am more than sure that after the initial hype a lot of people will leave , some will be curious some will be nostalgic folk some may be reminded how the game was and others may not like it all but the servers will maintain a healthy population that would keep a good economy and server activity.
---
I do believe that classic will be a huge success for the initial few months but a 2004 mmo is no longer the game or genre that will fit into today's gaming audience
---
All I ask is that they don't need on daggers vs my rogue, and I promise not to need a ranged weapon over them just to use it as a stat stick.
---
They are going alliance 100%
---
There is a cap over which weapon skill makes no difference.
---
Wrath had battlegroups, hence all instanced PvP was Xrealmed anyway.
---
True, but it's an ambiguous statistic to include. That way we would have to involve all the people that *don't* play on a PvP server because their SO / friends / family is playing on a normal / PvE / RP server.
---
Give us something to go on. Some preference in your play style.
---
&gt; rather than shelling out more for maps, DLC, etc., every couple of months
---
I mean. You're paying a subscription cost. You're still paying for DLC every couple of months.
---
It's just that if you don't like this DLC, you can't not pay for it. If you stop paying, you stop being able to play at all.

I 100% plan on multiboxxing in Classic.  It is going to make it absolutely miserable for anyone solo that I catch in the wild.  10 instant cast dots from 5 warlocks is gonna be dirty.  It also makes leveling REALLY easy.  Multiboxxing trivializes encounters and every outdoor quest.  Never have to look for a group.  Never have to worry about other players.  Being able to do everything 100% solo is a must have for someone with a busy schedule.

He's a child, let him have his five minutes. Oddly enough, he proved everything that was said about the character of pvp players. What a crazy surprise.
---
Yeah, I tried this in the beta. Equal level mobs in Senjin still would either kill me or almost kill me and the ones I did kill took forever and left me at like 5 hp.
---
Meanwhile I could kite them with ease and usually kill them before they even reached me. The only downside is those fucking Makura in the water.. they hide so well..  and aren't even considered beasts so track beasts doesn't help.
---
I'm already planning to make a business just out of wands. I've practiced that on an "undocumented server" and boy these sell like hotcakes it's actually insane.
---
With that being said wands are truly useful only for priests, warlocks are never truly oom anyway and mages can use wands during leveling but rarely need them either since they nuke/drink monsters over and over. It's really good on priests because you can frontload all your spells and then regen like crazy with your high spirit and spirit tap.
---
Got Emote, Lead, Sport on Golemagg. Pm if you have cool names on Golemagg and want to trade!
---
This guy lol
---
There's a really good chance you could find a guild that is after casual raiders to fill in any vacancies that may pop up. I remember back in Vanilla we had a few people from a non raiding guild that would often join us for raids-they wanted to experience end game content but didnt want to leave their guild/friends so it worked out well.
---
You will just have to put your name out there, make the right friends and hope for the best
---
&gt; most MMOs are good with 3k subs
---
What?
---
What about now? Are you going to play alliance again? What do you think of the Alliance after playing them in the past?
---
Priest was my first character, leveled it to level 28 before I ragequit. Told my friend he was an idiot, this game sucks etc. 
---
I was leveling only using autoattack and grinding since I did not know what quests or a class trainer was. WoW was my first PC game, before that I had only played Sonic and that Crash (animal) game don't recall it's name so I was completely clueless.
---
That’s probably fine.  But something like “hairytiddyfungus” probably wouldn’t be RP appropriate.

---
I *know* it'll be a shitshow, but I just can't imagine myself not trying (as long as I have a choice). Sometimes the shitshow queues and initial server hiccups make the best memories. 
---
Like when Diablo 3 released and everyone was getting Error 47 or whatever number it was, my very first character to ever get into the game was named Errar and I still have him! And Legion was a little nutty but super fun to be part of the rush.
---
It is called [ISBoxer.](http://isboxer.com/)
---
To be honest, the Actual job often sucks.
---
I’m definitely in agreement with you. We made the switch to Stalagg a few days ago. I don’t understand how people can shit talk Stalagg and at the same time ask for more servers because Herod is too full.
---
i think a large number of people who start day ome wont make it past 40 but i also think double the people planning to play will see every content creator making content on it and decide to play
---
Multiboxing in BGs is kind of not worth it anyway - a team of 10 players will easily wipe 1 multiboxer on 10 accounts.
---
The main problems with multiboxers are out in the world where one multiboxer can gank other players or lock down resources.
---
Can we look up if names we want are already taken on the servers? I want to see if my names are available before I pay for the sub. It would be pretty lame to pay up just to be told I can’t reserve my name anyway.
---
My wife has been thinking about what class to play. She's utter garbage at the game, is hunter easy to play mechanically? Not just the leveling.
---
Could almost be related to Affluenza. The psychological condition that Young affluent kids tend to be highly depressed and suicidal.
---
Wow has turned everyone into a rich kid. You don't need friends or anything to succeed, you literally just walk through the game and one shot everything to max level. There's zero challenge and thus zero reward.
---
Is there a way to set up your ui and addons beforehand or is it too late considering the stress tests are over?
---
I feel like this is an important point that isn’t being considered by many people. I know if I didn’t plan on playing classic I would still have saved my name on a few servers.
---
betcha! Transfers would ruin the game they need to just use their fucking brain boxes and make 50+ servers atleast
---
With that attitude, you won't every have full anything. I'm not spending additional time in the most boring raid ever (MC) because my guildies refuse to use the best gear available so they can look "cool." Go play with action figures.
---
What's the appeal of classic to theorycrafters? Hasn't the game already been "solved" by now, or is there a belief that some classic optimizations have yet to be discovered? I'm personally excited to be a part of the classic community, but as a theorycrafter who never quite made it to endgame the first time through I have to wonder what I have to look forward to at 60 beyond following guides. Without any promise of fresh content it seems that your fate is more-or-less decided from the moment you make your character.
---
I just spent this weekend visiting family so I won’t have to do that again for a few weeks at least (they’re all in a different city so I visit once a month or so). Next weekend will be tidying and shopping/stocking up. I’m going to try not to be too unhealthy and make sure I have proper food, but maybe some Doritos too.
---
I wouldn’t book the Monday off work since servers open at 11pm.. but Monday is a bank holiday in the Uk so I’m off anyway. I might try and sleep for a few hours in the day so I can play for a few hours at launch.
---
This is neither funny nor related to classic wow in the least. Why is this content allowed
---
Don't they have something in their own language? Like orc have Lok'tar ogar.
---
Female Dwarf ret pally.
---
Totally agree. Yes an initial drop off as ‘Retailers’ go home but then a steady climb.
---
Not a must have but definitely recommended due to the sheer amount of customizability.
---
&gt; Weak Auras. It's one of the most customizable and useful addons to have, since you can basically track everything. If you know how you can have the functionality of, let's say PallyPower, over to even the simplest of buff and repair reminders. And you can even use custom sounds and icons.
---
and
---
&gt; https://wago.io/classic-weakauras
---
&gt; I haven't really looked at it that much, but there are already a few class specific ones. Most, if not all the WAs on there are player made, so expect the amount to increase once classic officially launches. Since only a relatively small pool of players had gotten access to the Beta the accessible WAs is small.
---
&gt; But you can just download retail WoW if you want and use a trial account if you don't have a sub and toy around with the addon a bit and see what it can do. Weak Auras is at its best, in my opinion, if you can make your own. I think one of the best examples is this one from Legion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEPwFlYjEg
---
&gt; Each time a spell crits it makes a chicken noise.
---
From an earlier recommendation today.
---
Same! I wanna play Alliance on pvp server and feel like we will be outnumbered greatly
---
Honestly that just looks too congested to me.  How are you supposed to recognise anyone?  That's almost as bad as sharding.
---
What this guy said. And the lock can kill a mob while the priest regens mana and wands. Lock lifetaps at the end. Priest heals up lock. Rinse repeat never stop.
---
I hope you get your revenge. Let everyone know how it goes.
---
I rolled where I wanted to and if friends want to come with me, that’s great. If not, that’s the breaks. Fortunately 3 or 4 are rolling with me. 
---
We’re all pretty casual these days, so it’s not as big of a deal.
---
I think it might grow a bit as well. There will be people coming back, enjoying it and then telling their friends about it. Some of those people might not like current content but missed out on the whole Vanilla thing.
---
I assume I will be banned for harassment. In about 2 months I will be the leader of redridge.
---
Orc is 25% Stun Resist
---
I agree there isn't a limit to how many warriors can invite to the raid. But most guilds will set a limit due to gearing issues. It's a lot harder to gear 16 fury warriors compared to 8
---
Um...what?
---
I enjoyed it. Druid healing output is strong and flexible. You might lose on hps meters to a pally because all they do is wear out their FoL key on the main tank. Druid is a fun class.
---
Holy shit thats sad
---
too many syllables
---
***LOK'TAR OGAR!***
---
I mean, good positioning avoids your being in range of their frontline so no death grip
---
When I look back at the experience of others in Vanilla, I am a first time player, I chose alliance due to them being the underdogs, and the fact they have the best capital cities.
---
If I were to main a warlock for pve what is my best go to spec?
---
So, you didn't read what I wrong is what you are saying?
---
What server you rolling on?
---
I kinda assume base resist is 5% for same level target.
---
I do not have any source to it other than experience and how a lot of things in game started at 5%.
---
Orc racial in that case seemed to be 25+5%
---
I've seen a few other crazies suggest this, but they're usually smacked down pretty quick.  Nonsense.
---
I don’t think lag is going to be the problem. 
---
I think the problem will be queues and maby that it’s just to many people everywhere.
---
You got to level 28 with only auto-attack?!? How the hell did you keep playing if you thought that's what the game is like all the way?
---
Watch OP's video at the same time you watch the end of [this video](https://youtu.be/B1tL6rFsyAQ?t=1652)
---
The gist of it is that RP-PVP realms are just like regular PVP realms with a slightly better community. You won't find any RP there, if that's what you're looking for you should roll on HL.
---
The warlock shouldn't be rolling on any gear with int or spirit, essentially he should stack shadow DMG and stacking stamina (since life tap is a thing) whereas the priest should get priority on int and spirit gear, obviously some stam is nice for wpvp
---
Just an example haha. The point being it was consistent because they were throttling logins not that the server was full.
---
T1 for Druids is also pretty bad for healing. [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)
---
oh cool i guess. wont use it but hey free xpac lol
---
Same here.  I realised it was time to quit when outside of raiding the only thing I enjoyed doing was transmog farming.  All the other stuff - world quests, islands, warfronts - were soul-crushingly boring (and easy)
---
water only and OMAD
---
Gl bro you guys got this!
---
A warlock comes with a tank so the squishies (not sure if that term is still around) don’t have to worry about taking all that damage.
---
Hope they're wrong.
---
if the system is easily abusable and i can literally temp ban someone for a few hours by reporting on different accounts, i’m gonna do it
---
&gt;now wow can run with more cpu cores
---
Wait, is this confirmed for Classic now? Sorry if I'm behind, but I remember hearing fairly recently that Classic wouldn't use BFA's multi-core optimizations, at least at launch.
---
1ft is ~30cm so its around 90x120cm^^
---
As someone who was forced onto Stormreaver, a PvP server in vanilla, I both loved and hated WPvP, I experienced stranglethorn vietnam firsthand and I've hated horde and gankers ever since. It really is rough while levelling, yet it's also fun at times if you are evenly matched, or just not getting pounced by some sweatlord rogue. Overall, it makes mundane world activities/farming much more intense as any given moment could be potentially fatal and it does instill the feeling of Alliance vs. Horde far more than anything in PvE ever will.
---
Are you genuinely challenged? Can you not tell the difference?
---
I’m on my phone so I can’t find full clips but here are a few including at the start of the vid, just read description and look up the timestamps of Stormlingx:
---
https://youtu.be/z3Noj-ACoX4
---
You can report people for pvping on a PvP server?
---
No, There, I just saved you 12 minutes.
---
Never play alone. Find a good mate, preferably a few, level together and go PvP together. Solo PvP as warrior is ... challenging your resilience to dying a lot.
---
Its also timing those shots right so that you dont lose autoattack dps. I know it doesnt sound that hard (and it really isn't) but compared to what mages and warlocks do in raids, it's rocket science.
---
Cheers! I'm happy it works out well for you! :-)
---
Working out, prepping for college, which starts the same day as Classic, and Hunt: Showdown 1.0 pre-release tomorrow should kill some time.
---
Eeeee twist is this is right before Dennis spills his cereal!! The omens have doomed us all!!!
---
I didnt play until BC. How are druids healing in 5mans?
---
Classic is still DX11
---
Layering is suppose to help with population by making one server take a lot more people than what its prepared to take in terms of gameplay (so you can have Elwynn forest with 1k people and layer that amount to less so its not s complete shit show)
---
But it doesn't make the servers have infinite capacity. Nor would they want that, since at the end of phase 1 layering is going away. So even 20k people on a server would be too much.
---
Everyone and their fucking dog knew two PvP realms wasn't enough, except Blizzard, and look what is happening.
---
 "Blizzard knows more than you" was a thread on here that aged just about as well as milk on a hot day.
---
Fair enough, I'm just get triggered by reddit and most of it's users who treat the Chinese community unfairly. Sorry 'bout the locomotion, peace.
---
blizz should simply allow more layers per server so Herod players can actually play. they do not know how many players are still going to play when phase 2 hits so their hardcoded maximum number of layers is subjective and based on unknown variables. just add more layers and see what happens and offer better solutions down the line
---
You are over-exaggerating, and you are right, I don't give a shit.  I am sure all those quests I am doing on my own is going to infringe on everyone's play time.  Get a clue dude.
---
What's the advantage in two characters? All it does is make grouping easier and given that the social element is so large in classic that events out. And again nothing you cant do either. You've no proper argument. You're making arbitrary rules, athletes dont all wear the same shoe, football teams literally buy players. You play the rules that are there or you get a scrub mentality like this and whinge when people dont follow your rules. Pfff
---
vinland saga by chance?

---
TLDR: 1.11 was when Innervate was made baseline. Any serious raiding Druid before that patch needed to play Resto for Innervate. Cat form specifically received major buffs in 1.12 on top of that.
---
It's NeatPlates
---
There's still the initial cost of buying 10 WoW BFA copies, then the initial cost of buying 10 months of subscription to get them rolling. Some people don't get into multi boxing because they cannot afford the entry fee. Some people can't afford computers that can run 10 accounts all at the same time either.
---
Then there's the other group that just simply don't want to play the game like that, because it does feel like cheating. I've played MMOs that simply claim multiboxing is cheating and ban it, WoW just doesn't take that stance.
---
Just installed teamwiever so i can log in remotely

I actually really enjoyed hunter, but...
---
Buying ammo is annoying
---
Having to seek out and train entirely new pets to learn a higher rank of a spell is annoying as balls
---
Pets get hungry every 2 seconds
---
Pet loses nearly all its happiness if it dies, making instance wiping painful as hell
---
We aren't worthy of such finery
---
Yea, it wasn’t until BC that they started making some buffs occupy the same “slot”.
---
Well yeah, that was 2004. In the 15 years since then, a new generation of Gamers have been raised on mobile games and games that hand you many rewards often in an effort to keep you playing.
---
Not everybody has the mental capacity to go against the way their brain has been rewired in order to appreciate the effort reward system of vanilla
---
What exactly are you trying to achieve with a post like this on this forum I wonder??
---
No paid faction switch in vanilla or classic. Is this a thing in retail?
---
I still have that same one, I always wonder if I should just move to mobile authentication or if it'll be a pain in the ass when I go to use the fob one day and its dead and I *have* to swap it.  Anyone have any experience with theirs dying and having to contact Blizzard to sort it out?
---
There's quite a few recipes that need leather so it's useful alright
---
shitbags like you and multiboxers are why Final Fantasy XIV is going to hell with bots.
---
fuck you, fuck multiboxers, fuck anybody who supports that shit to ruin a game experience for other people because you want that worthless digital gold so badly.

if you multibox, i am going to assume you're just another Chinese Gold Seller, and i hope your credit cards get banned.
---
I’ll never forget the four gnome mages who were syncing up and destroying everyone in AV back in the day. I was just a kid, and I didn’t even know what was going on until I looked it up. Shit was wild as fuck.
---
Mages def do. Frost pve and frost pvp are wildly different
---
Hmm
---
I had the unfortunate experience of trying the game for the first time since Cata when WoD came out....yeah wasn't fun. I got a sub for classic and considered playing BFA, but I watched YouTube videos and I just decided to wait for classic, not worth 50 bucks.
---
Here's hoping it's either a Bard or Tinkerer class!
---
Sweet, ty.
---
39 warriors are beasts if they have a healer. Pendulum of doom, Scarlet gear, gloves of holy might, assault band
---
I believe both will happen. Initially a pop drop but over the next year it will steadily rise up. But I don't think for a minute that it will go below 2-3m subs.
---
Easy to play hunter, hard to be a good hunter.
---
Hard to play hunter in the late game as every class seems to gain so much power &amp; you're not.
---
That was so mean. Depending on your perspective, that video is either hilarious or infuriating.
---
It's not that vague. It's going to go to absolute shit the moment Phase 2 drops. And yes, ganking will get bad in STV, but it won't be 60s doing it. They will all be hunting in the Plaguelands, Winterspring, Un'Goro, in and around BRM, Ashenvale, and at the occasional Hillsbrad zergfest.
---
I'm going to love it, dont get me wrong, but if you're leveling between 48 - 59 when Phase 2 drops you may want to consider instance grinding. It will be ugly.
---
At first I thought it was going to be like 100 lvl 1 newbies all herded together but the fade to black lasted too long and I realized I was about to be tod howarded
---
MMOs aren't new anymore, and there are quite a few competitors this time around. There wasn't Fortnite or league to compete with. Huge open worlds where thousands of people can meet isn't as amazing as it was in 2004 when a lot of people had only even had internet for a few years. Times are different. Not saying classic can't grow, but to say that things are the same now just isn't the case.
---
But there will always be alternative ways to acquire ingame goods for real money, therefore ingame gold equals certain amount of real money. If people multibox for gathering, that means they going for the profit, so saying pay 2 win for farming is invalid i think. However these alternative methods might be illegal. 
---
Though the topic has mixed views, many people mixing retail in the topic...
---
updated!
---
Hunter has the highest skill ceiling in the game, imo.
---
Exactly, the entire roadmap for Classic is based on this concept that it’s playerbase will massively die off in a period of 1-2 months. I have zero confidence that they have a solid back up plan if the player drop off is significantly less or at the very least slower than they expect.
---
As alliance this is less relevant. SW and Darnassus both have moonwells.
---
ZG is phase 4. Phase 2 only adds PvP ranking, DM and world bosses, I can totally see this getting released rather quickly to give something to the PvP players out there. DM was just gated behind P2 to make MC progression a bit harder for the better guilds, but those will have it on clear by 2 months in anyways. Players will have through P1+P2 to gear up from MC+Ony for BWL. That means the only reason to delay P2 is making sure that every reasonably active player on PvP servers has a chance to get 60 before the ganking madness starts.
---
If I had to guess, it would be 2-3 months for P1, P2 and P4, and maybe 4 months for P3 and P5 (where a new full raid tier opens). That would mean full content unlocked after roughly 1.5 years, which sounds plausible. Total lifetime of classic would then probably be around 2 years before players start dropping out in larger amounts due to lack of new content.
---
updated with working discord link!
---
Ret paladin.... because I want to and people are telling me I won’t get into raids.
---
You can send mats and have a guildie do it if thats an issue
---
What’s your metric here?  I would argue for a 19 mage being better than a 19 warlock by a long shot.
---
29 hunter is still gonna be up there in the top.
---
39 shaman are nasty either elemental or enhance and they have ghost wolf pre mounts so they can compete with some of the movement speed of druids.
---
49 all the classes are good and the bracket when twinked out looks much like a micro version of level 60 pvp.  I don’t know what you have against 49 mages.
---
But that's practically the only form of world pvp in retail. Back in vanilla most world pvp was 1v1. Not some gangbanging where you have no chance of fighting back.
---
We believe in you. Also we only expect flawless execution.
---
Username checks out
---
You didnt mention playing with a group. I'd lean hunter because the other classes are not great to level solo
---
Lol exactly
---
It’s stil not live and that was not my point. Check the Shadowmeld spells and you will understand.
---
Well I'm sorry you feel this way. I enjoy these games and thought this was a good time to talk about them.
---
Thanks guys
---
God I need this fucking game.
---
Yeah, they totally didn't suspect two realms wouldn't be enough, **that's why they had extra realms ready to flip on**.
---
Yeah, they were totally caught unawares. The difference between you and every fucking dog and Blizzard is they are smart enough to know not to enable too many servers. Too few is easily remedied. Too many is a massive fucking failure by their part.
---
I don't know the specifics of how/why as I'd never had an account restored before, but sometime late Wrath I was hacked, and lost about 200k gold and another 150k worth of mats in the bank, and somehow when Blizzard restored my account, I got all the gold back, all the mats, and a second identical set of mats was waiting in my mailbox.  Ended up doubling my gold off that.
---
I'm just excited to have the old wooden auction house back
---
I had full lawbringer back in 2006, and frankly I couldn't give a fuck what your impatient, selfish toxic self has to say about any of it
---
Autism.
---
Nobody needs it but if people want it then Where's the harm? I've got a one page crib sheet which I'll probably never look at but it builds the anticipation!
---
&gt;WoW's esport has professionals that make less than fast food employees.
---
I could care less about esports. The entire esports community is pretty cringe IMO.
---
&gt;The only GOOD Arena is 3 v 3 and that is only without melee cleaves which break most of the skill needed. All other forms of PvP in WoW is broken. BG's are awful and healing is stupidly OP. You sit there doing boring pve rotations now
---
That's all your opinion, don't see how someone having fun in it makes them autistic.
---
&gt;And yes, if you think Arena, which has destroyed the game completely through homogenization in a laughable attempt at balance in a MMO was good for the game? 
---
I think homogenization was bad for the game, but if you think that, along with the changing of talent trees was solely due to Blizzard trying to appease the arena community, I disagree. Balancing has almost always been around PVE and raid performance (or M+ for the last few years). 
---
Sure, giving everyone an interrupt and half the classes ability to stealth, bubble, etc. was due to arena... But that's on Blizz. They're the ones trying to push Esports to gross as much cash as League of Legends does. In terms of Burning Crusade, someone who enjoys PvP, be it BGs or WPVP enough to be willing to jump into some form of ranked play to test their skills doesn't make them autistic.

---
Yes. Skinning is almost passive gold, and can help get you a little bit extra before 40 to get your mount, and a little bit from 20-60 to pick up all your skills. But it isn't really worth keeping at 60, unless you plan on doing a lot of grinding (and even then, it's meh unless you are REALLY un-optimally farming).
---
Tailoring can be rough while leveling. You lose out on the cloth for bandages (if you need them, which locks definitely will, mages not quite as much, priests not at all); and it's also passive gold you are missing. On the plus, you get bags; but that's only really worth it if you are ahead of the curve (which, you won't be if you are leveling profs most likely). The gear will likely be worse than what you get from leveling, but it can fill out some weaker slots that are behind on upgrades sometimes... That's about it. Really, there's no reason why you can't go herb/skinning or mining/skinning, and drop both for whatever you want at 60. Just mail the cloth to a bank alt while you level.
---
I don't think much has changed in regards to node farming, multiboxing and the ingame economy since 7.1 but feel free to prove me wrong. I was arguing general principles btw, not the current state of bfa.
---
[rats! fooled again! please buy me game](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/752/286.jpg)

I also buy the level 3 white bow. You're not likely to get a different one before level 10.
---
I've also subbed six months for the first time since 06. I am stoked.
---
It's more efficient then wing clip hunter nonsense that thia sub keeps spouting.
---
hell no.
---
no, even on a pve server if someone is flagged it's there own fault.
---
When it came out World of Warcraft was better looking than other MMOs, easier to get into than other MMOs, the first MMO from a developer/franchise that was already super popular, pretty casual compared to other MMOs, and after some patches it was more polished than other MMOs.
---
None of the above is the case for Classic. I can't wait for Classic to come out and I expect to play it for a long time, but very few of the things that made WoW huge remains.
---
It's like mah credo
---
They removed pvp servers on retail lmao.
---
Sounds like a pretty good plan. The main idea behind getting Skinning on a brand new server is to vendor the leather (since no one has any gold to buy it off the AH anyway), but it should ease the progress of leveling tailoring a bit.
---
Ah that’s good to know, thanks. But is it still worth it to drop skinning then? Sorry about all the questions
---
This looks awesome! But don't you get the spells at these levels regardless of your spec? Why is frost written at the top?
---
I tried to get my gf to play alliance with me, she said "sure, i'll make a blood elf."
---
Yes, this is me. I never gemmed our enchanted my gear in bc. I meleed in WC when I ran out of arrows and thought no one would even even notice. I asked when I would be able to equip a shield. Of course my pet was on taunt. I couldn't trap anything.
---
Any gathering temporarily is fine. Even selling to vendor is valuable copper when you have nothing.
---
Keep in mind skinning and mining require an additional 80c investment and bag slot (knife/pick). That does not mean they are bad just additional info to remember.
---
AWESOME. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Ooof. No thanks.

This is blursed.

is everyone playing retail a litteral toddler
---
My god, you're right... I'm dying
---
I start work at 7am :(
---
I don't think leveling paladin is suffering of any kind in vanilla :D Isn't it fastest class in matter of leveling speed ?
---
don't worry, enjoy The journey!
---
Just curious has Titanpanel made a port. Again im guessing these are on Wowhead (any classic ports)?
---
Unless it has to be overcome lol
---
Any proof of that?
---
Name checks out, lol
---
If you want, I can log in and see if what you want is taken. pm
---
The problem is that in retail wow real difficulty is only available for the top players (mythic raid, high keys and arena). For the majority of players and casuals overall there barely is any difficulty progressing your character which is a real shame.
---
Retail wow honestly feels like when you are cheating in a game and everything becomes super easy and you get tired of it in a couple of days.. But don't get me wrong I think that for hardcore players I think retail wow does have some really difficult content.
---
&gt; Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.
---
That's from the overcrowded realm post on the forums. While they may only allow 5k onto a realm at a time and the rest will stand in queues, the outcry from the community and the resulting cancellations of subscriptions from people who don't want to move to a new realm or can't because their guild is on that server, Blizz will inevitably allow more players in just to keep the subs rolling.
---
What cata talents thing?
---
During vanilla I've only ever played mage / hunter.
---
I want to roll warrior but all the memes about it being living death to level to 60 is scaring the shit out of me.
---
Just how bad is it?
---
Please think about it one moment
---
You're welcome to disagree, that doesn't make you right.
---
pserver =/= vanilla though.
---
It’s not even said yet, that alliance is the lower pop on ur sever for sure.
---
If:
---
Only in strangle maybe.
---
But everyone will have a tough time there so..
---
Don’t worry i always enjoy playing on the lower pop side, and it won’t be a high imbalance.
---
I ran a test.  Can fish 10 at once with about 75% efficiency.  People HATE seeing me do it.  Its like they think I put pineapple on my pizza or have the toilet roll go under.  Chill friends, its a game!
---
Real talk, I'm only in there for pre-game hype and to chat and make early enemies with some alliance dogs. Already got one boy i cant wait to find out in the open. But yeah once the server drops, i wont be going back.
---
Female night elves hunters are the Male Undead rogues of the alliance. Both are race/class combos which attract surprisingly many deranged people.
---
He's referencing orks from Warhammer 40k, their battlecry is waaaaggghhh! If you have the time read up on them, their lore is hilarious.
---
 Fun tidbit I believe originally the Warcraft franchise was a video game adaptation of Warhammer Fantasy, but Games workshop (the owner/producer of that  franchise) pulled out at some point in development. Hence we got Warcraft with green orcs and alliance.
---
I just wish gnomes could be priests... so I'm stuck with dwarfs
---
This is awesome!

---
Correct. At +15 you will do no glancing blows against a level 63 mob.
---
I bought a second hand weights bench and weights, dumbells and barbells and set up in the garage. No way I'm hitting the gym when Classic hits so this way I can easily do some 20 minute workouts couple of times a day. Stave off the RSI and back/neck ache.
---
Gold sellers made more money on classic servers these past years than they have made on retail
---
The legend of "Sexy" the hunter in the Redridge Mountains--Naxx geared and constantly obliterating any and all who attempt to quest or traverse the area--comes to mind.  Seemingly never leaving, sleeping, or eating, his body fueled only by killing the lowbies and all townsfolk so that even picking up a quest is all but impossible.  
---
I'm curious to see how this kind of thing plays out on the official servers.
---
It’s an incapacitate, so no.
---
No Carapace Spine Crossbow for hunters?
---
i am running cartographer on a sandbox private server of wow classic.
---
there are no lua errors, but i am not knowledgeable enough to know if the sandbox is causing issues, or if it is just cartographer being ungodly outdated.
---
the fog of war removal works great. the coordinates for player and cursor works good.
---
but literally nothing else is working, while every other addon i have tested has 100% of its functionality. 
---
i can't create notes, i can't see a zones level, i can't manually go to the map of a dungeon or battleground, etc..
---
This might help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m3xnkm2JE4
---
:)
---
Incapacitate is different from stun. My orc did not avoid Sap more than others. They are also quite different with stun not breaking on damage.
---
Okay. Tell your duo partner that you volunteer to have skinning and lw because it's a smart move. I'm sure you wont regret it later.
---
I will now show you why Retail is awful, as seen in the screenshot:
---
# ( * )
---
I rest my case.
---
You know that gold selling became a proper industry when WoW came out?
---
Just ask in the 'AMA' in a few days
---
I haven't. Been trying to stay away from Classic stuff as I don't wanna get sucked in too much but watching the Joana leveling stream made me interested... Oh well :) I'll check him out.
---
Which is tragic, considering it's ignorant logic. Medium servers have potentially 10s of thousands of players
---
I would prefer that over having the name of my class being part of my name. 
---
Darkrouge, icemage, healingpriest and so on.
---
good, good...
---
I really needed to roll my eyes just now. Thanks.
---
That build seems fairly standard for leveling. 3 points to reduce the cost of HS by 3 rage doesn't feel that strong. Compared to an extra 3% parry. It is a personal choice though.
---
Also HS takes place of your next auto attack , so on top of costing 20 rage, you miss out on the 5-20 rage gained from your auto. You'll want a slow 2h while leveling (~3.5s speed). 
---
Personally when leveling you'll run across mobs that have atk speeds of 1s to 4s... So I feel I get more value from extra 3% parry. Esp past level 40, since you'll be spending rage on your level 31 ability and generally won't have extra rage to dump with HS
---
I feel like I'm about to enter a paradox, I'm taking my 4 year old son to stay with my dad for the end of the summer, so will time move more slowly as I wait for classic, or too fast as our child free time expires...
---
But I'm a warrior - two negatives make a plus, don't they?
---
5 base, 25 orc. 30 total. You resist a little less than a third. Is it a big deal? Depends. I don't agree with people that say Orc is always best. Tauren Warrior is great due to melee range and because stunned targets can't dodge. A Tauren Ele shaman can be devastating. A rogue who is running around out of stealth getting stunned all the time is an idiot. The only can't miss class I would say is Hunter. It's just stupidly better than the other 2 choices. 
---
Add to this for the entire phase or two, there is no pvp trinket. Gnome/undead will be the strongest for that time period. 
---
Orc did get nerfed in TBC but that is because the only pvp that mattered was Arena and orc would have killed entire comps.
---
Can't relate to that. I've only played WoW on PvE server, and horde was extremely rare to see there.
---
Well, it's 165-170 to NA vs 62 to EU according to https://us-looking-glass.battle.net/  
---
Triple difference and that' the lowest latency I've ever seen pinging NA hosts, It's just physics, it can't be too low.
---
You can feel the latency when you are trying to smash a mob in melee, you are standing near the mob but WoW keeps saying that you are out of range.
---
When exactly do the realms open?
---
This is freaking terrible xD please give us more!
---
&gt;~~Enjoying the game in a different way~~

Ftfy
---
I’m stuck between mage and priest right now so going off your comment bandages won’t be the biggest concern. But I think I will go with what you suggest and just do 2 gathering, thanks for the reply :)
---
You should have learned in school not to depend on anecdotal evidence
---
Show up on time. Bring reagants for buffs. Know mechanics. You'll get an invite.
---
In retail gold-selling and leveling service basically don't exist because Blizzard made their own versions.
---
In vanilla there was plenty of gold-spam and even some high profile incidents where gold-sellers made characters and had them die in positions so it spelled the name of their website and such. I don't know of any reason there would be less of it in Classic sadly. 
---
If you are considering such services keep in mind that sometimes the gold is from hacked accounts and you can also get banned if Blizzard can figure out you bought gold.
---
depends how long you are willing to go. But I would advice against it, it's really not fun at all people only play it to be snowflakes.
---
If a lot of people play classic, blizzard will probably eventually forced to do SOMETHING once they run out of vanilla content.  I wonder whether they will just roll forward to TBC (which would obviously be easier and more straightforward, but risk alienating people who think that is starting to defeat the entire point of classic), or whether they would (if enough people were playing) start developing new classic content.
---
I think you never played hunter. The difference between a good and bad one is immense. That class has a skill ceiling second to only rogue.
---
Badass video. Also liked the bit about contemplating switching to retail when the guy as talking about taking the easy way out.
---
ret is incredible, like absolutely bonkers in 2019 classic WoW pvp.  This guide is written by my mom.
---
One of the top duelers and WPvPs on darrow is a ret paladin.
---
I used to have those, then later switched to the app. 
---
However, that app was attached to an old iPad that I hadn't used for years. Last week I had dust it off and charge it overnight until I could get it to work again so I could buy months on my account.
---
- literally no one
---
I'm EU but playing on US servers so hopefully with my timezone I won;t have much of an issue with queues.
---
This is still nice to see, I always had faith Blizz would keep their word that layering wouldn't be forever. Hopefully this shuts the naysayers up
---
Genuinely curious not trying to be negative. Couldn’t you just stockpile the leather and sell it when there is a market for it as opposed to taking the lower vendor amount?
---
Blood Pact still stacks with fort in TBC. You're thinking of Wrath and "bring the player not the class."
---
Doing a thorough cleaning of the battle station inside and out, shit needs to be FRESH. Gonna try and find some reasonable energy drink that isn't 100% sugar OR buy a quality thermos for coffee, but it does take some time to brew a batch of coffee so will prolly go with energy drinks.
---
Gonna load up the fridge with different types of sandwiches, carrots, fruits and nuts. Basically shit that you can eat with one hand that isn't 100% sugar.
---
Finally I will give my SO one last kiss before corpsecamping you in STV for 2 weeks straight.

[Titan Panel Classic](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25085-TitanPanelClassic.html#info)
---
Farewell friend, see you in the past again, we are all waiting for the gates of time to open.
---
You're totally right. A couple people being upset they didn't foresee the most popular server being the most popular server despite everything pointing directly to that which results in them having to use a different character name is much worse than having dead realms.
---
True, true, true.
---
If you're concerned about extremely high queue times, I wouldn't even consider Herod. It's probably the fullest server out of all of them. I think Whitemane is probably the second fullest.
---
Just go with Stalagg
---
Thanks for the heads up, got hundreds of hours in DS3, honestly didn't realize how different a bunch of the AC games were.
---
As long as there is a PvP solution, it's not against the tos and reporting doesn't help you to get out of the valley..
---
If you're concerned about queue times, Stalagg is the only one that's not Full. Take this post as what you'd expect with that kind of pop
---
Get risque with it and paint Emerald Dream Goldshire.
---
Thanks, I didn’t think about the bag slot. Is 80c a lot at the start?
---
Youth doesn’t play MMOs anymore.
---
Mages are solid support but lack burst. I highly preferred [fire](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oMZVMZ0o) over frost in the 19 brackets. Poly on priests, decursing, and huge turret range with fire talents. Frost can be better if you are being targeted but chasing the ranged stun on fire blast is clutch. Frostbolt is effectively useless versus a kiting Druid.  
---
Starting at 41 yards and prekiting into a nova/grenade poly works to split a murderball into pieces.
---
Mail until 40 (when you learn to wear plate) then you start phasing in plate pieces as you can get them. Pretty much never leather if you're a warrior tank.
---
Do you do commissions?
---
NE Druid here. I will probably try and get the death march over with.
---
Launch day being a nightmare should be expected. Everyone taking a paid day off for the first day is in for a rude awakening when they can't even play the game that day.
---
A ranged caster that has the ability to control their environment. They can also spec to be capable to have very big bursts.
---
Also fyi a couple should refer to two exclusively. 1-3 would probably be closer to a few.
---
Nah, It’s better in the long run to have less

&gt;just because, damn I like the way they look. /moo
---
This is why I only have four classes to choose from. I can’t stare at the other Horde races for days of my life.
---
Awesome. Thanks for the in-depth reply. I'll stick with this build then.
---
Man, scrolling through the comments...
---
What has this game become?
---
Anyways, odd post to find in this subreddit IMO.
---
I’ll /bonk him every time I run past him, that’s for sure
---
Not my first rodeo.
---
Plate is accessible at lvl40, until then it'll mostly be mail, but since vanilla gearing especially while leveling is rough, there'll probably be some leather pieces mixed in there just because they are decent.
---
Layers
---
It gets hungry often only if its loyalty level is low
---
Can anyone recommend a best race for levelling a Shaman on the PvP server please? Never played Classic and I see a lot of conflicting info online. Ty!
---
You still won’t be remotely competitive, and a waste of a spot that could be given to a mage, Warlock, or rogue.
---
Idk honestly but i do know there will be alot of retail to classic gold conversion, like 100k retail for 1k classic gold
---
Will you be able to loot a chest while in combat?
---
I mean, if I click the install button on the website (which should install it onto the Twitch client), nothing happens.
---
Very informative.  Thank you for sharing!
---
I think people don't want "changes" so much as just new content to consume down the road. I think that's inevitable.
---
We can be level 60 with all the same stuff but have new dungeons/raids/quests/bg's... Actually maybe not bgs as blizz hasn't had the best track record with those lol.
---
A very casual guild might take you. But I wouldn’t count on it. I’d rather go with an empty slot than a Ret Paladin.
---
When you're open world pvp fighting a hunter what is the best approach to the fight as a warrior with engineering?
---
Run?
---
Kill the pet first?
---
Drop stuns and pots then kill the pet?
---
Just prepare to die?
---
Grinding is the best part of MMOs I honestly don’t understand how someone can want to play WoW but hate grinding. It’s like playing Diablo and saying you hate running the same zones over again for item drops. Or playing an FPS and saying good luck having to learn all the maps. Grinding is the fucking point of an RPG.
---
Decent degree. You won't dominate but you aren't weak either.
---
Is the Stun resist better than Undead racial? I always did undead to just laugh at alliance locks.
---
Man, you are so fucking obnoxious it's mindblowing.
---
Fairbanks is full now?
---
SJW's are a very small minority. Social media companies give them special privilege though and magnify their retardation as SJW's tend to fight for the same policies the ruling class are striving for (open borders, etc) 
---
It's ironic. SJW's are the only ones so stupid as to vote in the interest of the elite.
---
&gt;people who don't play like me are young and young=bad
---
nice
---
Be part of the founding of the guild is best way to do things like that.
---
Could look for very casual/relaxed guild as alternative. Say upfront before joining that you will stay retribution and see if they accept.
---
Self burn lmao
---
I got mine from the first batch Blizzard made... Died a few years ago and switched to the one I got from 2007 Blizzcon which still works to t his day. These days I just use the mobile one for convienence. But I gotta say there's some good memories having to hit that button for my secret code. 
---
The only reason my original one died was because I had a habit of hitting the button needlessly, as some kind of desk toy, needlessly draining the battery.
---
Yeah lol. Mana for me is based off the Maori word though which roughly translate as a type of prestige. It's a very common word used in many cultures and has the same sort of rough meaning. It's interesting it's used in WoW because there is a spiritual element to it and obviously in the beginning spirit was a necessity to gaining Mana on WoW. Anyways that's enough useless facts from me for the day lol.
---
Its what an MMO should be.
---
More dots
---
Why would that be abnormal?
---
Keep in mind that storage space is going to be a premium to start out, even with bank alts.  You can use the mailbox of course, but that can get cumbersome.
---
People that are looking to stockpile to sell a a later date are more likely to pick things that are going to offer more return for the effort.  With a few exceptions leather is not ever going to be a high demand item.
---
You’ll be fine. 40 slots available and you still bring utility as ret. 
---
You allow other Paladins to not have to spec improved might. Make better sense as the paladin designated to lay on hands because it’ll dump all mana.
---
For me, it's that loss of control. The world I'm in is dangerous and spontaneous and I can't do anything about it. I'm not the best at pvp. Actually, I'm pretty darn terrible at it and fell victim to camping and getting ganked often enough to drive most people to PvE realms but for me it added that sense of being in a real world where I can't control my own destiny. It would get frustrating and eventually I would give up on staying in whatever area and go explore somewhere else or take a break in a major city. This in hindsight, broke the grindiness of the game and allowed or forced me to do other things and go to new places instead of leveling through the most efficient path.
---
You really think some fortnite kiddies are going to get a wow sub to play classic?   Not a snowballs chance in hell.  The spongebob generation isn't interested in shit like classic wow.
---
Fair point.
---
It's slow.  About half again as much /played time to 60 as a mage.  Your margin for error in pulls is 1 over-pull every 30 minutes. If someone decides to gank you, you just die.  Additionally, you're gear dependent and can't farm for shit, so good luck affording a Medallion of Grand Marshal Morris or Foror's.
---
That having been said, I'm still planning on playing a warrior in Classic as my main.  I'm just not sure yet whether I'm going to level the warrior first or level a mage first for farming and *then* level the warrior.  But I guess that says something, when I'm questioning whether it would be more efficient to level a farmer to support my main before I level the main.
---
Thanks for the credit on there bud. Looks good. If anyone wants the full spreadsheet that goes more in depth you can find it at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-oXmau5zcI_hRD_Kt0XnwJV80gwUBLRwqNBaLoSKBQ/edit?usp=sharing

Every server is just about full
---
Found the salty try hard 🤣
---
He's not saying multi-boxing is fine because buying gold is fine.  He's saying that, because there's always a market for gold (legal or otherwise), it will always have real money value, and multi-box gatherers are extremely likely to be going after this real money profit... and not just trying to make enough gold to trick out their characters.  In the former case, MB'ers aren't really pay-to-win because they're not "winning" anything but real money. Which is shady AF but not pay-to-win, which is the OP's point.
---
You never answered my question and downvoted me instead. Lol.

That's just like, your opinion man. I strongly disagree

I get a Thinbase Goodfellas pizza from Sainsburys for like £2, add a bit of extra cheese and a few topping that I have lying around in the fridge. The end result is a tasty pizza for a tiny fraction of the price.

Yes! With mounts it was amazing.
---
Lot of people chose boar because of charge and then they swap it at level 30+ when Dash and Dive are trainable :P
---

---
Any pet should be good leveling but cats are one of the better dps pets besides windserpents.
---
Doesn't hunter have one of the highest skill ceilings at 60 for pve?
---
As of right now Herod is pretty fucked above other servers by 80%. Expect 10+ hour queues as is.
---
Maybe if you min max , but that's not what OP is after. Even locks and min max with pve/pvp specs
---
Because I think you’re a joke? Okay.
---
“You all”
---
Oh this is going to be good. 
---
Who do think “you all” is, when you say ‘zoomer’?
---
I’ll wait for you to google it ;)
---
3 hour ban? We don’t associate with riff-raff, sorry.

RP is there if you look for it, but not mandatory. RP-PvP is PvP first and foremost, and if you want to flesh out your character then do.
---
I downloaded and installed ElvUI when the stress test was active and saved a profile. That might stick, but unsure.

So you don't see yourself having any responsibility to maintain the community, as part of that community?

I modeled a really detailed version of this exact room in 3ds max a number of years back. Let me see if I can't dig that up. I really liked the way that room was designed.

I remember three of those. The second is my absolute favorite.

Well when its 10pm for me and 7pm for the server, and I get up at 6am, yes theres an issue.
---
Make the world too big that you need to cross realm to bring people together killed the community part.
---
Good god, no.  Hunter, then Warlock.  Pallies don't die but they're back with Warriors on the ass end of leveling speed.  Priests level faster and they have to just ride Wand Specialization to 60.
---
Look at this thread about the Vanilla PvP rank / gear system: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpzgb3/need_a_foolproof_system_for_getting_rank_14_and/     
---
      
---
Pretty much everybody agrees the system was a toxic and / or dysfunctional piece of shit.  Not to mention almost impossible to get the higher level stuff without either cheating and account sharing, or making some really really questionable and unhealthy life decisions.    
---
    
---
I know this would be a pretty major change, but does anybody else think they should scrap the vanilla PvP rank / gear system and come up with something else?
---
This video is using NPCs and is thus not truely accurate.  NPCs are known to have different spell ranges.  Player Taurens are not.
---
I am in the same boat.. not really sure how to avoid the respec costs as shaman... I might just do a natured swiftness ele build and try to raid heal with that.. if I suck or get too much flak I'll switch to straight resto
---
No, I was only talking about the ones he listed. Fairbanks is high.
---
You misunderstood, doodep was talking about the skill-floor not the height of the skill-ceiling
---
Ooh yeah that is the game, I loved and also hated that game so much. Remember so many ragequits and being yelled at my parents for screaming in rage.
---
Additionally, you are not increasing your main faction’s reputation because you are not doing quests in that starting area. This is a big deal come level 40 when it’s time to buy your mount.
---
It seems the last thing they want to do is combine servers.  Doesn't matter the reason, it's what they've decided.  So layering guarantees that won't be necessary.  They are going to have to gather more information before making there next decision regarding shutting off layering and adding servers.
---
Haha I actually like it.
---
That’s awesome! I’ve always wondered what the different drumming styles of Dave and Taylor are. They’re definitely one of the bands on my bucket list to see.
---
Yeah they should add chances for items to roll better stats too.
---
I usually celebrate 30seconds with a girl with a firework of sorts, they usually leave after that though
---
Classic=no mythic dungeons. No ifs ands or butts about it

Are we going to be able to trade BoP items that drop in raids to other members? I remember seeing a blue post talking about this
---
Disgustingly overpriced, and just disgusting in general.
---
Most chain pizza I can stand, but Dominos just tastes awful to me.
---
Aside from the requisite Doritos, Mtn Dew, and hot pockets, I'll be adding rum &amp; coke
---
Good to see I’m not alone :)
---
A fair bit of the original vanilla theorycrafting has been lost and replaced by private server theory crafting.
---
The game is very similar, but just off enough that it's tickling the right spots for people. Not enough so that the average player will care by and large, but that extra 10% you know?
---
This takes me right back in time. Those movies were/are so good!
---
Is it smart to spec into the priest holy tree to get holy nova and try and do big pulls and AoE all of the targets? How does AoE in classic compare to AoE in retail?
---
Come on man read my post atleast not just the title... that’s one of the things I’m against.
---
And they've already been casting it for 7 years, looks like that priest wow dev is very dedicated to this one guy.
---
By the time naxx came out over half the original team had gone.
---
By the time wotlk came out 90% of the og team had moved on.
---
"Of course I don't, but you're acting as if this is some grand gesture by blizzard when they're well aware they're going to make money on it. "
---
Am I? I only asked if you knew what you were talking about.
---
Oh awesome. Thanks for this.
---
:( They nerfed the most flavorful Legion spell ever, Surrender to Madness, which effectively neutered the spec into “normalcy.” So I'd say the community definitely held them to this promise.
---
Honestly just wandering the world and chatting with other players was so epic. 
---
I remember the place I ragequit in was the cave in hillsbrad  with the yetis, I kept dying and making so little progress on my lvl.

Youre right, but on WC3 he claims himself as King, and so is treated by Kelthuzad, Anubarak and the other Lordaeron denizens

Retail Wow was Wall-E'd. Gave us everything on a silver plater, without a hint of struggle or grind. Progression is irrelevant and effectively an illusion with catch-up mechanics and new expansions providing vertical as opposed to (mostly) horizontal progression.
---
Real hunter reason to take cat:
---
Shadowmeld and Prowl.
---
Also, take carrion if you want claw and bite together along with screech. Only Alliance should care about owl.
---
I’m not the one stating that people just don’t have the mental capacity to enjoy classic since their brains have been rewired. 
---
There have been many rewarding games. Those games have been enjoyed by plenty of kids that would probably enjoy classic wow. 
---
That’s the point
---
For me, it was only eating once a day when my mom forced me to come out of my cave for home cooked dinner. So this time, I'm thinking of meal prepping large batches of chilli or something. Probably can't do only once a day anymore though.
---
Do you remember the Diablo immortal announcement?  Why do you think they announced that?  Because they had NOTHING else...  They needed something new to show off though.  
---
Will classic wow make a lot of money?  No, but they need SOMETHING, anything for the investors.
---
*From someone who's spent way too much time on the forums*
---
I think the reason people really WANT it to fail is because it represents a lot of what they hate, and gets rid of a lot of features they rely on in current WoW and get super defensive of when you suggest why it could possibly be a bad thing. Hell just go to the general forums and suggest that you don't need the following; flying, LFD/LFR, quest markers, titanforging, the group finder, transmog or just the notion of having to be social in a game designed to be social. 
---
Therefore they need it to fail because in their mind everything about it is worse. The concept of people liking different things? Then they'd have to acknowledge that the 'elitists' that come and try and criticize some newer features might have had legit arguments instead of simply being elitists, trolls, etc.
---
Fuck the haters, I'm for classic 100%. 
---
Already had so much more fun getting to 15 with my buddies than getting to 120 in retail.
---
Oh man, i leveled shadow to 60 but i never heard about using wands.  "Wand spec?  What is that even a talent for?  SO LAME LOL"
---
Yeah definitely using a wand this time around and can't wait.
---
**Like if you undersand something**
---
You'd be out of mana and out of life.
---
Says the guy who complains about being downvoted on Reddit 🤣
---
Just curious if you read the description? You realize the entire video is from other creators right? Not only hurricane? Which they are all credited for?
---
That would be so epic !
---
Paladin isn't hard to level, just slow and boring since you literally just autoattack and judgement for the entire 1-60.
---
Warrior is really the only class that is a pain in the dick to level because you're so gear-dependent, do worse DPS than pretty much every other class, and have no self heals so you have to eat/bandage after almost every mob.
---
They never actually promised that. They said it was an idea they were still exploring.
---
The WoD fiasco is why they actually never outright state what their plans are anymore, unless it's obviously been vetted by a million P.R. people, just like every blue post these days.
---
I dont mean this as an argument against you, but rather a flip of perspective.
---
&gt; I remember once I was in a 20s area and there was some great back and forth contested world PvP between the local questers on each side. Then one of our teammates logs off, gets on his max level alt, shows up, and just murders all the enemies. The enemies either didn't have max level alts, or didn't want to bother getting them, so they all just left. Which means the PvP was now over, end of fun. 
---
Perhaps this was never "fun" and was rather a skirmish to control an area of resources, ie acceptable levels of experience. Of course you can have fun being involved in that, and of course it is far less fun once one side brings Tomahawk Missiles to a knife fight, but the skirmish was won. Your side has the area now, and can quest in peace and possibly overtake those same equal level opponents in that time and have an advantage in the next engagement.
---
World of Warcraft is fun, but it's still War(craft).
---
You cannot meld in combat in Classic.
---
yep
---
If it's a pvp server you need all the alliance scum you can get.
---
thanks!
---
It's been a long time since I played, could you really not reset your talents before locking them in?  You could really just mislclick once and have to pay to respec again, without an accept or confirm button?     
---
That sounds really stupid, I would think only the most hardcore of the #nochanges crowd would be against fixing that.
---
viper sting is pretty good vs everyone :/
---
Too many hate comments can’t tell sarcasm currently

i like crendor's take on choosing names

Pro tip for launch day hunters: buy the white weapon upgrades at the weapon vendor in your race’s lvl 5 town. Grind mobs nearby for the silver to purchase. You’ll thank me at level 10.
---
I mean they don't though and when this post gets removed for rule 1 the point will be proven. This isn't a subreddit for posting shitty art and tattoos. It never was before we saw more than 20k people, and it won't be after the influx of flavor of the month tourists.
---
Considering that they been saying classic won't be returning for a decade until they suddenly did, I'd say things can change.

Or don't roll on a PvP server.
---
Searing Gorge is going to be a nightmare. Flightpaths are going to be permafarmed.
---
Of course I am 100% looking forward to this, as a veteran Vanilla PvP server player. But it will be frustrating so you need to know what you're getting into.
---
Wish people could logically think about it instead of just hate after reason five words -_-
---
this video free karma
---
Unlikely, let me explain
---
- First specifically concerning east pvp, blizzard has already stated they will not drop another server until stalag is full.
---
- Now this one applies to every server. There is going to be pretty substantial drop off during phase 1. Blizzard is betting on this and probably has very accurate numbers to back it up. Which is why they would rather lowball server count to avoid dead servers.
---
For all you nay-sayers who do not believe there will be any drop off let me remind you of a few things. Nostalrius, arguably the most popular private server peaked at around 15k players online concurrently. These people were the ones who REALLY wanted to play(you had to seek it out) the massive numbers we will be seeing week 1-2 are made up of a few things
---
- retail players who already have a sub so why not check out classic?
---
- people coming back for classic but forgetting just how much of a time sink it is.
---
- finally people coming for classic but we’re either too young or just have never played and have little idea of what it truest is about.
---
This population will grow annoyed with the 1-60 grind, 1k gold sink for there mount, attunements, raid commitment etc etc.
---
The population will greatly surpass anything the private servers achieved. BUT there will be drop off and blizzard probably has real evidence to bet on that.
---
As a WC3 and Normal fan, never made sense to me.
---
Faction races are a bit arbitrary in WoW.
---
Being faction loyal also isn't what Jaina and Green Jesus would want.
---
PLS POST THE SAME BUT JUST FOR MAGES

What's the cheapest laptop that I could buy that would run classic comfortably?
---
What about off to the side? A lost of all dungeons in order, location, minimum level requirement to enter and recommended level?
---
No gift of arthas will knock hemo off
---
Calling me autistic (as if it is an insult) when you are the one who doesn't care about the actual goal of your class/the game and only want to focus on looking neato.  
---
Okie dokie.   
---
Play how you want but don't be surprised when the class leader takes one look at your itemization and asks you what you are doing.  
---
Or join a guild that doesn't care and then wonders why it is taking them several hours to finish MC. If you want to be in that extremely boring dungeon for hours and hours on end, week after week (where no one is noticing what your gear looks like except for you, by the way), go right ahead.
---
I've taken Tuesday off, have to work wed-fri though which will be excruciating. But then 9 days off. Happy days
---
Nailed it.
---
awesome! tyvm!
---
Thanks this is awesome!
---
So glad my company has dedicated "sick days" and "vacation/PTO days" and doesn't make them the same thing. That's ridiculous having to use vacation time if you're unable to work lol
---
Charge, hamstring, disarm.
---
Shout him and pet (hamstring pet) if hamstring fails or he's trying to gain distance. Bandage. 
---
Keep hamstring up and look for trap animation. If he's able to gain distance for whatever reason - intercept. 
---
Never ever let him move without hamstring, if you do that it's over. You have intercept, shout and (maybe) iron grenade - That's it.
---
tyty!
---
It’s a figure of speech. The point is that there are millions of people who play challenging rewarding games. Why wouldn’t they like classic? There are more than enough people out there that enjoy those experiences to allow for classic wow to grow over the coming months rather than contract.
---
All I am saying is that it is a great game that is a lot of fun. I don’t think I am somehow different or special for thinking that. I believe that many more people would enjoy it than the current number of servers would allow. 
---
That’s all.
---
I used to stomp hunters on my war if I got the charge off. Do not target pet ever, unless you're trapped and have nothing else to hit, as it can generate a little rage. Keep hamstring up and don't get fooled by FD. They're pretty squishy and drop rather fast, survival hunters lasted longer obviously.
---
They had already said this and nobody listened. Got sick of reminding people.
---
I promise you are in the minority. And still wholly incorrect in it being anti Vanilla.
---
Agreed, I'm all for #nochanges but this shit has nothing to do with skill. Alienating everyone around you, destroying your body and economical situation for over 3 months straight, all for what?
---
A weekly cap needs to be put in place or an overhauled system. Perhaps one where skill factors in more than mere time invested. R14 meant you had no life, not that you were any good at the game outside of premade battlegrounds.
---
It's called Stockholm syndrome.
---
Ahhhh the good ol "ghetto gold"  as a man with limited optional financial freedoms I try to reward that whenever I can
---
Strange, I couldn't look a chest in combat during the stress test, pretty sure I wasn't being attacked.
---
Thanks for the participation folks. Just trying to air my thoughts and concerns. No doubt I am still excited and look forward to it. Appreciate all the insight and points of view.
---
Raids were designed with this in mind though. Paladins wouldn't work especially in a high mythic environment. No taunts and no reliable mitigation. There is more than enough to do in classic without needing retail elements introduced.
---
All Character models use vanilla models. The Graphics setting are between Classic setting and High/Ultra or whatever you like. There is a button to put on Classic setting and all that is are low settings on graphics. If you go to Ultra there will be improved shadows/texture/lighting/etc. 
---
I prefer Classic setting to get nostalgia feeling but a lot of people use Ultra setting.
---
“Trust me you don’t want classic wow”

Blood was a better tank

Yep, $25 for a soda and medium 3 topping in Canada plus tip.

Undeads are cannibals and elves have an ability that allows them to creep on people in stealth regardless of class
---
FORDE THE HORDE!

Joana be praised
---
Hmm you're right actually. Don't know why I said that because the last two at least were pretty smooth.
---
I didn’t know the other videos had leeroy/ascent/unbreakable/and pat in it. My bad...... didn’t mean to make literally the SAME excact video!
---
It is all credited in the video description *facepalm* where I urge people to watch the entire different hurricane videos.
---
It does minor damage and an ok aoe heal. Give it a shot and report back.
---
Originally it was all Dungeons/Raids. After fan outrage it was changed to raids only, so at it could have been worse.
---
 Before anyone asks, yes hes a paladin and yes his name is not Falcorn, its Falcorne. The south park episode had a bunch of random stuff that didn't make sense in the game like a human hunter, who ended up wearing plate gear. Here we have a paladin wearing warrior shoulders, etc. This is Falcorne, Defender of the Alliance
---
Is this a beta memorial or a streamer worship video?
---
You mean the same buffs holy Paladins offer, except without the really useful healing power?
---
yea those people are just shitty.
---
If like to see post max stuff that exists as mentioned in the vanilla world, I wouldn’t be interested in leveling a goon past 60 that made all my gear instantly worthless
---
I love this comic series!
---
Actually yeah, that spreadsheet backs up what I learned through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By8Ny6BJwKY) video and through my own testing on the stress test. If you prefer a technical form, Male Tauren get +2.55 yards when healing a normal race and get +5.1 yards when healing another Tauren.
---
I'll take those into consideration for my next graphic. Cheers!
---
Oh, nice!
---
How much faster is dungeon grinding tham following a guide? If so, when should I start doing it? My leveling partner is a holy paladin and we have worked out a pretty good path for the early game following a guide with quests. We are bothing taking off 2 weeks, so we hope to pull away from the main wave by the second day. Our current plan is to follow the guide until around 34 and then grind through the four wings of SM until around 42, then do some questing and then back to grinding ZF. 
---
Should we be doing anything differently or does that sound like a pretty solid plan? Not sure if it will matter because of layering but our server is currently medium population.
---
Oh yeah, Ive heard its actually bis for melee specced survival hunters! And with feign death the threat generated wont be a problem either.
---
Is layering actually sharding with a different name or does this statement make no sense? If each layer is acting as a whole server how does that change anything at all with population in starter zones? It only helps try to keep realm populations high after the player drop off they hope happens. Unless they are going to start with layers that only hold for example 1k people and collapse them later.
---
I figure most people that have already reserved names know what they are in for and wont be leaving anytime soon. Cant wait to see them try force people to leave servers or wait 8 months stuck in phase 1 till people leave through boredom.
---
#nochanges
---
Please tell me how a painting of goldshire, is not related to classic wow?
---
Goldshire was very much a thing in classic - and with the amount of time blizzard spent on elwynn and goldshire as a whole, some Even say its kind of a classic staple.
---
IT seems a lot of People are enjoying it, but you for some reason are not.
---
Its okay to not like it - but say that, rather than some bs about it being against the rules
---
Well you won't be able to tell who and who is not using it - without asking them.
---
If you want to play Ret, wait till TBC and go Horde. At least you'll serve a decent enough function. (Can refresh all seals on boss if other Pallies put down light/wisdom)
---
Beserking: Troll racial.
---
When you’re below 40% health, you gain 30% casting speed. 
---
Above 40% health you gain 10% casting speed.
---
If you’re healed back to full, do you retain 30%? Or does reduce to 10%?
---
I’ve heard people saying that it will stay at 30% if it was activated when you were below 40% hp. Even if you are healed to full.
---
Just want someone to confirm or deny this.
---
What horde race I should go for? Would love to hear for both, for pvp and for pve.
---
thats not wow and if it was vanilla there is like almost noting in common with a vanilla 8nstall and the classic client
---
Because it's no longer classic then. That's the point. If you want m+, play retail. There are dozens of games with leaderboards and ramping difficulty. That's not classic.
---
Nice try
---
Tauren if you plan to go enchancement, their melle range is insane and OP. 
---
Troll/Orc are both great. I would go Troll if you plan to go elemental facemelt around AQ40.
---
Close, but not how I do it.
---
10-20 multi-target is pretty much all I do and is Moonfire on 2 targets and Bear (restoration if targets are a bit tougher the bear). I also rarely wrath. You want to absolutely maximize thorns use because it's damage to mana ratio is off the charts.
---
Minor difference in the long run of course.
---
Fought against a few 5 elemental shaman multiboxers in 5v5 arena back in burning crusade, their simultaneous burst potential was insane. Unless the target of the 100% Crit chain lightnings was found out fast enough and got a pain suppression or another defensive cooldown one player was simply dead. Since their programs were flawed back then after you killed the "main" account a lot of their simultaneous actions stopped working properly, so even after the start and a 4v5 scenario we still won most of those fights, haven't really faced multiboxers outside of 5v5 and a few in 3v3 arenas tough.
---
Still good enough for a computer background for now.
---
This comic is from like 2006
---
So uh... yea im probably rolling on Herod as long as my friends are... &gt;.&gt;
---
TBH I just thought if any server needed one it was stalagg lol.
---
Enchanting is kind of mediocre gold unless you are able to get raid patterns. Crusader and the agility enchants that are a pain to farm might make you decent money if you get them early on. The only benefit is the gild making is mostly afk work in cities as opposed to gathering in the world.
---
Like many people argue with though the game was never meant to be balanced. Any game you play there will be the best comp. also for the casual player yes there is enough to do but what if you beat everything you cleared max you’re geared out you PvP and get honor right? So what’s so bad about doing that but in dungeons except you don’t get better gear
---
Thanks. Question is really: Do we have graphics options, or are we locked into how 2004 WoW looked?
---
Yeah, it'll follow a typical blizzard expansion route. Big spike at the beginning, drop off, then several smaller spikes as new content is released. A lower dip near the end of classic, then TBC takes the population even higher.
---
It's sort of nice that we can kind of predict how things are going to go because we've already been through this.
---
I agree. The game, the stories and the history of Warcraft shows just how bad partizanship and tribalism is and people are celebrating it. :D
---
To say anyone speaks for everyone would always be folly. I can practically promise you though that if they released a server with no layering, it would fill the fk up.
---
Ghetto stealthed hunter vs rogue is a fun game actually. Mark, run, hide.
---
I cried at the end

I live in a small town with no large pizza chains, got a local joint with amazing pizza but it's $30 per delivery. sucks man.

FAIRBANKS SERVER -- WTS (fair/low price): Cooldown, Enemy, Freakshow, Circus, Dare, Daredevil, Bountyhunter, Bowhunter, Razorblade, Grenade, Bazooka, Plutonium, Gory, Fugitive, Electrocute, Hornet, Swordfish, Crossfire, Goldmine, Treasure
---
Wand noises intensifies
---
If they end up not going for TBC after vanilla-classic is done then something like this might be cool. It is not really an option before then though, unless you want to make it have zero rewards other than a title or such.
---
If people get even small boosts/improvements to their gear it will make raiding easier which in turn will make everyone say that it isn't "real" vanilla raiding and tons of people will stop caring.
---
I can see where you are coming from, for all of the things in retail that isn't conducive to that MMO player interaction there are also some pretty cool ideas. But a lot of people come to classic to have the vanilla experience or to beat that thing they didn't in vanilla, so any changes bigger than "you can mail multiple items" is a no-go for many people.
---
Cheers. So it uses the old models, but they have been graphically improved somehow? That's great that we have the option of playing Ultra instead of being locked into 2004 WoW. It's the patch/game state for me where the nostalgia is, not the graphics. So I'm looking forward to that now!
---
Wait is this true or not?
---
The only issue you will have with SM is being alliance without a 5 man team. Everytime someone has to leave the party, it may take a while to get a replacement without a warlock summons. As horde this wouldnt really be an issue, but getting to sm as ally sucks, and group downtime is the one thing that holds dungeon spamming back. Otherwise I try to run dungeons multiple times whenever I run them, so your plan sounds good to me.

---
New to WoW, started with BFA. I play alliance. But it's not a matter of liking alliance more, I just like the night elf lore and aesthetic.  Considering what little I know of the lore for the world by and large and the conflict, I honestly see both as equals. Their motives and desired ideal outcomes oppose one another,  but all in all they've both done great things and done horrible thing.
---
Asmongold said it recently on his stream, "guys, it'll break your heart when the top 500 retail guilds will clear MC on the second week under 2 hours, every guild in the top 500 can do this".  I hope we will go down the OSRS path and they'll improve the game over-time, add some QoL changes and expand the content while remaining lore accurate.
---
But it is classic except you upped the difficulty you don’t gain or add any sort of new gear loot table. because players with today’s knowledge will clap any content thrown at them. You truely under estimate how good players are now to then.
---
problem is, they should 100% change it (and lots of other things) but I don't want nu-blizz making any changes.
---
&gt;its so frustrating if I'd like to share a viewpoint that is opposite of the general view then it just results negative karma and cannot just simply be a discussion or argument...  
---
&gt;Maybe i dont understand this whole reddit thing.
---
Sounds like you understand reddit perfectly lol.
---
I think the main issue here is that paying for gold (through blizz especially) is **such** a touchy issue to the Classic WoW crowd here (including myself). If you mention it within an argument and don't immediately denounce it as evil, you've gotta be super clear what you're saying about it.  And even then people will jump to conclusions as to what you're saying.
---
The buff works off the % Hp you had with it was activated, so you can decrease your health then pop it and get healed to full again while maintaining a super strong buff.

---
I've got two weeks booked to no-life, and I intend to get reasonable amounts of sleep each night.  If I can clock 12-14 hours a day, I can definitely make time for 8 hours of shut eye.
---
Lore wise, the alliance are bigots and xenophobes. The orcs were essentially a slave army to demons, and once the control broke they wanted peace. The alliance said screw you, we'll still kill you all. So the horde came together from races all just trying to survive and have their own place in the world while the alliance tried to eradicate them all.
---
Player wise, they're pretty similar, but I honestly do think horde tend to be as a majority, more mature players because many young people see the alliance as the good guys, and play that. But it's not a huge difference.
---
&lt;10 guilds will clear it in week two. Most “hardcore” guilds will likely clear it around the 1 month mark. For the other 90% of people it will still be a fun challenge.
---
Haha what an ugly red haired person.
---
Watch Skarm vids on Youtube for tanking information.
---
Shucks. I'll still be happy as long as they don't allow you to control more than 4 units at a time. #nochanges
---
Exactly then point. Nothing is there that would have interested them so they don’t even look for it. It’s all Fortnite and similar games. MMO dying genre,
---
There are just different types of people. Names matter to some and not to others.
---
I would never pay 7.50 for a chance to get a name in a game. For the same reasons I wouldn't care if I lose that name by changing to a different server.
---
&gt; they are always played by complete gutter sewerage dog shit swamp bog trash garbage players
---
The difference between a good and bad hunter is immense. I've always found recommending them to beginners a little questionable for that reason. 
---
Yes, they level extremely well. But they are also one of the most unforgiving classes in a lot of content. Don't dismiss your pet at a ledge? Might have just wiped the whole party. Didn't pay attention to food or ammunition? Oh the Hunter is meleeing the rest of the instance now. No obvious massive impact CC that's easy to spam (like Polymorph) and requires some more practice (Freezing Traps). Average Hunter getting jumped in WPvP? Most can't deal well with the deadzone. Let alone people genuinely thinking most gear is useful for them, because to an extend it is and they won't know how much better a piece might be for someone else.
---
The majority of these people never played the game when it was good.
---
I promise not to judge!
---
France &amp; Russia have their own server and Spain is playing on Shazzrah (everyone get out while you can).
---
Golemagg is the best choice at the moment.
---
Gotta have that riding set
---
Pretty good! Got ones for Warrior, Warlock or Hunter too?
---
It can be. There's a lot of shared rep and you only have to get honored for the mount discount which isn't too hard. I think it just depends on your overall questing route.
---
"forced to"... :)
---
He deleted his comment just now lol
---
Hunter is hella fun to play to level. Roll beast master
---
Thats not just a WoW issue...
---
Classic isn’t just an expansion. It’s far more content rich. Also that only happened with expansions after Wrath. Before that the player base generally grew over the course of an expansion.
---
not till Wrath, iirc!!
---
Armor was figured out already, since they hard nerfed Green Armor items into base armor.
---
I interpreted this to mean this sub will become a toxic wasteland of bitching once things open.
---
Because, while I've been on this train for years and do not doubt that it will be an overall success, the reality that a lower population server will be a total ghost town by Phase 2 is very possible.
---
See Skarm references below. Bear is well beyond just an off tank.
---
Intercept the hunter, hamstring,MS, disarm, Rend, stun/slow etc to keep them in melee.  Should have a dead hunter soon.
---
You said 
---
&gt;special recipes for professions that can enhance your gear
---
though.
---
Anyway, I think most people want Classic to be just as vanilla at least for the time being.
---
Whenever I level an alt it is always a hunter in a low level contested zone killing lowbies with a few rogues sprinkled in for variety. They are also always fucking trash and get smashed as soon as any other 60 turns up.
---
In o.g. vanilla wow, I leveled a mage using tailoring/enchanting. If i had to do it again, if take tailoring/enchanting at least enough to get the level 14 wand, then drop enchanting for herbalism or mining, while leveling. At level 60, I'd craft the robe of the archmage asap, then drop tailoring and pick up enchanting or alchemy
---
Yeah you're fine.
---
I've raided in original retail naxx, and I have to say druid's biggest problem in the last, most difficult raids is the lack of shield wall. I personally did not tank so I'm sure there are other issues such as lack of block or whatever. Sometimes you really need you tank to just be unkillable for a window of time - especially if your guild isn't exactly cutting edge
---
Do Barrens!
---
There are no cross play with retail rewards.
---
&gt;  and is like “fight these ungodly horrors for me”.
---
*confused human face*
---
No that would have been the efficient way, I suspect a lot of mind flay and a lot of sitting down to drink was involved instead.
---
Who says it had to be timed I said fastest clears classic can be designed for m+ simply increase hp pools and damage out put l. You can make BRD into wings and defeat certain bosses to count as a clear. You aren’t thinking clearly this isn’t something that has to be timed or give gear just a way to time the fastest min maxers
---
It won't be like the Classic you remember because we start on TBC's inflated talents and balance, but it should still be way better than modern WoW.
---
A toaster pretty much.
---
rip BIS drops for phase 1
---
What’s really funny here is that elemental is better than enhancement in PvP.
---
Enhancement is just super RNG, so it looks OP in montages.
---
Was just general information, wasn't saying you'd always get to use serpent sting, nor was it a comprehensive overview of your entire rotation. I kept it simple for the sake of being easy to understand.
---
Famous last words at 01.30 on a work night.
---
&gt;They could have, but it wouldn't have changed anything. People still wouldn't want to move.
---
Good to know we have you to decide what "People" would have done.
---
You would really struggle to pvp in pve frost. SM ruin can do both pretty well
---
Some of us can't. Been playing in BFA for a little as I've subbed for Classic, and I don't have access to flying because they gate it so thoroughly.
---
I remember in Vanilla WoW there was a debuff limit on bosses/mobs, and people (read: warlocks) were frustrated that their debuffs or DoTs were getting bumped off by freshly cast ones.  Is this in Classic WoW or was that patched out before 1.12?
---
Everything is easy mode in a group though...There are literally no difficult group combinations 1-10
---
Except yes it will be you seem closed minded as hell since you can’t comprehend it wouldn’t change the gameplay what so ever.
---
7,5 $ is what 1 beer costs where i live so i dont really see the problem.
---
How about 5 molten giants
---
compared to you im a literal god. you should worship the chair i fart in.
---
1. Dont give a shit
---
2. Get a guild
---
3. ???
---
4. Profit
---
Shits been like this for day one same rules apply now as they did back then, stay as far away from the broad community as you can find a guild and never look back.
---
&gt; Play five of the same class and spec and try to do encounters then. It's almost impossible.
---
Wrong my man.  5 Paladins.  5 Hunters.  5 Warlocks.  5 Shaman Should all be just fine.  Ret's can off heal.  Hunters can use tanky pets and heal.  Warlocks can use Voidwalkers. Shaman can off heal.    
---
&gt; You're the boring multiboxer kind, because you're removing hard encounters and the social aspect of the game.
---
I didn't realize I had to play the way you wanted me to play.  I always thought video games were about having fun the way you want to and not the way others want to.  As long as it doesn't impede on others, why do you care?
---
But that is Sharding. Layering is continent/world wide, not per zone. But yeah, google it for more in depth explenations.
---
this wont happen because in a group/guild of players 99% of people are going to have atleast one person who refuses to transfer and will cause all their friends to stay on that server. if they are going to make new servers it should be now not when phase 2 starts because those servers are going to be rather dead imo
---
APES are playing on Golemagg
---
The \*spoiler\* part? Yes.
---
Yeah, no thanks.
---
Why exactly?
---
Not buff enhances
---
Does that chair happen to be in the basement of your mum's house, per chance?
---
Eh i just see a guy who is pretty good at video editing and trying to push his limits.
---
Guarantee that guy prolly works in video editing or something close.
---
It’s not awful, you just need a lot of pots, food and bandages to keep a decent pace. You have to be overleveled as you have almost zero escape, rely on quest xp not grind. Skip elites or runners.
---
Big claim
---
5 drag-on-flights.
---
we'll see this so many more times. it's like would a game company put a minimum hardware numbers out there before the game launches.  nah.. better ask reddit!
---
16 slots in classic 1.12
---
You continue to speak english and ignore them when they refuse to adhere to the rules.   
---
Hell. Even if there isnt an actual rule enforcing language - you speak english on the internet.   Its World of Warcraft. Not Värld av Krigskraft or Cyka  of Blyat.
---
But grinding rank 14 for better gear is okay right?
---
No love for the 19 druid Target dummy's with like 3k hp in bear form eh? Don't think it was quite that large I'm vanilla, but still not an easy class to kill holding the flag
---
Fuckin right, humies and gnomes are camp until submission
---
For now
---
Amazing and as im going frost mage this will help a lot.
---
I upvoted you, i dont downvote. And because this game is fairly tame and I’m disabling most avenues of exposure. i didnt know how prolific erp was, but the way its talked about you would think you cant avoid it
---
looking to trade/sell the name 'Purple' on Atiesh. I'm interested in Pagle names or WoW gold. Message me with rare pagle names also if you're trading/selling.
---
&gt;Also disappointing to see yet another person saying Tauren is the best horde tank race when its either the worst or 2nd worst.
---
Horse shit.   It makes almost no difference.
---
Hunters get very upset when their pet dies. Warlocks sacrifice their pets intentionally for a buff to their shadow damage.
---
Oh def. I'm from the PNW and I plan on playing on Pagle, and EST server. So I expect there to be a little jump here and there but nothing too bad.
---
False majority of the pop are/ used to be private server players who hate retail wow. 
---
Started late bc but am included in that group bc I played a ton of p server vanilla
---
lets split the world!  27th release are alliance, 26th release are horde!!!
---
Does everyone still think druid will be least played class? I like playing off meta classes and want to be healer
---
Also known as quotes that nobody ever made
---
Tauren ftw. War stomp is good to get heals off and interrupt.
---
I wanted to put in the funeral crash from serenity now....
---
What paladin seals should people use while leveling?  I have seen conflicting reports based on weapon speed.  Thank you!
---
Two warriors doing the Barrow den might struggle.
---
\&gt; and have been banned for 3 hours once
---
Haha this is gold.
---
Damn you hypeeeee.. damn youuuuuuuu
---
We don't really know for sure yet. But estimates off experience says it could be under 4days played which is fast for any class especially for the warriors and rogues who usually do way worse. 
---
For melee cleave it starts as early as 11-12 in RFC on horde I think around 16-17? for ally DM. Caster cleave starts at 22. But yeah if you are just 2man I wouldn't recommend it unless if you can find 3 other reliable players. It's not worth sitting and /lfg after each clear or something like that.
---
You’re thinking short term the game won’t last forever unless you only play casually
---
How do you deal with toxic people irl? /thread
---
That's not how classic classes work.
---
The free mount is huge on a fresh start. Humping around on foot in ungoro as a broke ass warrior fucking sucks.
---
it wont be exactly like the first release, but it's close enough!
---
Pretty sure this will/should become a meme sub reddit once classic releases, similar to OSRS reddit
---
And your thinking about the end before the game has even been released.
---
What do you mean
---
Hunter's are amazing, till you get to end game and realize that you are just not needed anymore.
---
The game is so good why the hell would we want it to get stale that’s why we add on new flavors that do not change the actual gameplay
---
well guess there are 8h of time to play :D
---
Heres the breakdown:
---
Shaman: more melee focused, your heals are good but not great until chain heal, you have more gear options, you have a mobility move, you have plenty of utility but the totem system is very micromanagey.
---
Priest: you do constant, steady dps as shadow spec with a good wand, and you can heal 5 mans super easily without swapping gear (shaman in enhc spec usually need some int gear for healing 5 mans). You melt faces as shadow, you heal like crazy as holy/disc.
---
When fighting, Shaman is more chaotic and crit based, priest is more methodical and awareness based.
---
Nightwish front and center though lol
---
Decidedly looks so atm, PvE content with our current knowledge will be obliterated so fast that only the most casual of guilds will find any fun in it outside the loot and speed runs.
---
But PvP is a whole different world, and I think that is what will make Classic popular for the next two years.
---
Think they might be part of the big drop off Blizz is expecting.
---
I agree maybe I was too early the thought just came to my head
---
Say why
---
&gt;The monetary cost is insignificant
---
This is extremely ignorant
---
&gt;95% of the pserver community just wanted to play vanilla
---
What is this? How do you know?
---
I member this post, such good times.
---
Hes right though.
---
The gear that these new dungeons will drop will have &gt; zero affect on the core of vanilla.
---
Hmm yes and no. For this it would make sense to print out a separate list. The  idea here is that you can do notes on the side and can do a visualization of your leveling route on paper. For some ppl it's better to have a piece of paper then to have a doc open in a tab behind a stream on the 5th monitor kind of thing. Sometimes less is more.
---
Hunter, Warrior, Druid, and Shamen are the only classes worth playing anyway.
---
I'll it again
---
Imagine being this good at pen
---
You can't tell that some player is ninja on Blizzard Forums, it's against their ToS. But you might want to do so, to spread the word. Third-party resources is the only way and discord is the most popular one.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
hunters are good against most casters because their strength is range and they have some pretty impressive tools at their disposable in pvp, especially with pets harassing clothies 
---
hunters in general are pretty dominant in pvp if they're skilled
---
I will be playing comfortably on my 2014 Lenovo Yoga. Not ideal but I'm in Brazil for the time being and at minimum settings the game does not stutter. I think it cost me $450 USD
---
LOLLL facts
---
Found someone rolling on Faerlina
---
i mean it was probably because u were playing on the "alive" server prior the BFA launch,so on launch it became too much "alive".Atleast it was like that on my full EU server,u wanted to play on the highly populated server in late legion,to find groups and stuff,so in the launch spike it became overpopulated
---
If X people are in a zone it open a new instant of same zone, such as am in version one you are in version two everything about the zone is the same.  the issue and why people hate it, is if you want to gruop with me you will  never find me since we're in different layers  others hate it since it hurts  world pvp.
---
For myself i like it as believe questing will be easier day one, thu am not sure amount of people required per zone to start a new layer or how easy it is to swap between them if your trying to gruop with friends.
---
I’m pretty sure some people are misinterpreting what blizzard said about player cap. If a medium population server has more people then the fullest vanilla servers, they aren’t going to reduce the amount of people that can log on once they remove layers. You aren’t going to have a queue On a medium population server.
---
Nowhere in my post did I say that I said I would not recommend gear to drop
---
Under the citycity
---
Free server transfers aren't going to be enough. 2 months in, people are going to be invested in the community and won't want to leave if they don't have to.
---
Why not just skip layering and deal with the queue up front right now? Get that out of the way during launch instead of adding the abomination that is layering just to delay the queues.
---
Alternatively, they could just do it right and open up a sufficient number of servers instead.
---
God, I remember that period in Wrath where it seemed damn near *everyone* was getting hacked. To this day I do not know how it happened, but my entire household (both of my parents and me) all had our accounts hacked on the same day. We knew what sites to avoid and we all had unique passwords for our WoW accounts, I can't think of anything risky that any of us would have done and yet it happened.
---
The only thing I remember being suspicious about was the fact that at the time, I believe both of my parents had installed that Curse addon manager recently. But I don't recall there being any evidence to back that up, it was just the only thing that had changed and it was still a little bizarre because I never did install it.
---
Regardless, Blizzard was really nice about it. They unlocked my account early so that I could at least play alts or whatever while I waited for my gear to be restored and they sent all of us free authenticators (the same ones pictured above, which I still have to this day!). 
---
Account security really has come a long way since those days, lol.
---
I mean it's hard to make a direct, specific correlation from m+ dungeons being added with baking , but I get what you mean
---
I'm just trying to show you why it seems everyone is against your idea, people get defensive because they want it a certain way. Can't really blame em, you also want it a certain way, it just happens to not be the way most people want it.
---
I hope you can still enjoy classic without the m+ dungeons! I do get what you mean though because dungeons in even BWL gear, let alone AQ/naxx gear makes the dungeons overly easy.. faceroll headsmash-keyboard level easy. But idk by then we might be SO sick of those same dungeons that doing them quick and easy is kind of nice, since we will only mainly need to do them for mats and stratholme holy water etc stuff like that
---
Strath is in the game from the start. This counts for both live and ud sides.
---
I started in BC so I am REALLY looking forward to playing something I have never experienced before.
---
I have no idea why you are so fixated on MC. AoEing imps/core hounds vs. multidotting all the 2-4 target pulls, yes I think it's a completely fair fight for damage if you want to include trash. Warlocks don't even have to drink, mages do. Warlocks don't have to decurse, mages do. Banish is 1.5sec cast for 2-3 times on one encounter. Any idea how many times mages have to decurse on Shazz alone?
---
 The simplest way to test damage per second is on one target, that has always been the metric. Look on any dps tool, its based on a Patchwerk encounter. Casting a curse is a minuscule dps loss compared to having a Winter's Chill bitch, it's not even close. Warlocks don't need such degrading spec changes. SM/Ruin is a 4% dps loss, and not even necessary.
---
I'm glad to see you have read it thoroughly. Including the section under "Method" where it states "Shadow Weaving, Winter’s Chill, CoS and CoE will be assumed to be on the boss at all times." So in fact, the dps loss from your WC bitch is not included which would be much more impactful than 1 GCD.

---
Too many syllables :(
---
it has the potential to still fail. ideally its a raging success though to the point that 9.0 adopts some of the vanilla playstyle and retail actually gets steered back towards the games roots a bit.
---
These are the types of people who tell me to rush to max level and skip all the content from previous expansions I missed because it's "pointless"
---
PVE servers tend to be polarized towards one faction.
---
Guilty
---
I know of old people who i work with just coming back to grind classic aswell
---
Looking at the original artwork and I noticed he's scratching his flesh off his own shoulder, that's metal as fuck.
---
Damn this kid is going nuts with his rage. "I dont want to lose my spot to something else waaaaahhhhh, ret play bad"
---
Keep in mind, I dont disagree but not everyone is going to be "oh, ur not meta no invite". Chill out and let people be people having fun
---
Yo I’m reminding you because I was reminded
---
Darkshore - Darnassus and maybe the 15min joyride for a 100m distance between the piers in feralas
---
thought so, thanks.
---
It's a dropped spell book
---
Wow, how old are you, kid?  Not that kids can't have good ideas.  But you sound like you need some experience making analogies.
---
I backed out as soon as he started reading us the Wikipedia page
---
&gt;that's why we add on new flavors
---
And that will kill the game long before any staleness happens. People don't want classic to add on "new flavors." We want it because it had all the old things we miss about the game with none of the flashy new shit like m+.
---
I don't have to temper my expectations. I am not playing classes that requires that. Warrior is pretty cool in Vanilla, specs wise. Same as mage. I can deal damage in PvP, deal damage in Pve and Tank. For a class that is advertised as that.  
---
I'm just thinking about other people, who wanna play ret pals, prot pals, enh sham, elem shaman, balance druid.  
---
And the fact that many classes kind of only have 1 spec viable in PvP.  
---
I think it is really foolish to be blind because "hermagad vanilla best game ever". I'm gonna play it a lot too, obviously I like it. But let's not pretend this is TBC quality (and some would even say WOTLK). Vanilla is ridden with problems. I'm just acknowledging them instead of sucking Vanilla dick because "that's what purists and OGs do".  
---
Anyway, I doubt I'll convince you. Let's all have fun that's the most important.
---
Done. How’s the arena?
---
Upvoted you.
---
Once the loyalty is high you'll only feed it once a blue moon aside from deaths.
---
Ammo is terrible you lose a full bag to it, and at best 16 slots for most bags that's terrible.
---
I'll put an extra 10 hours into it to draw two characters next time.  And maybe throw in a griffon which will resemble a dead feathery blob.
---
Unless it’s a drop off of about 70 percent, new servers will be in order — especially after sharping is removed. 4 out of the 6 pvp servers are full, 2 are high, and Stalagg is nearly full (was full yesterday for a few hours).
---
Tbh I'm only downvoting you cuz you left out the closest class with the biggest dick dps -- warr!
---
And this is coming from a mage hehe I see the self flex with lock tho, unfortunately not til phase 4/5 you fel gnome
---
that is most commonly referred to as a bot. a key stroke that reaches other game clients logged into different accounts to sync up multiple casts in a single cast window is a different beast altogether
---
NP and thanks :)
---
&gt;1-10 isn't even that bad.
---
Go alone into Barrow Den before level 10 and say that. Sure, pre-10 hunter isn't that much worse than Warrior, but the difference between a lvl 9 hunter and a lvl 10 hunter with a pet is by far the single biggest swing in difficulty in the entire levelling process, imo.
---
I think I have met the qualifications for reminding so here’s your reminder.
---
Looking at that though, it kind of still does. Knowing how bloody long it takes to get anywhere.
---
Got any helpful information or just to cry like a kid
---
&gt;Shadowmekd cannot be used in combat
---
It's like people don't even know feign death exists. 
---
&gt;it's not usable as a vanish in Classic.
---
Hunter says hold my pet.
---
Forming an Alliance guild on Pagle with several retail guildies and a few friends at launch, lmk if you're interested!
---
But muh diversity!
---
not really, ign's largely don't matter at all these days in games since people will call you buy your discord/irl name anyways, at least with people you aren't a stranger to
---
If you plan on playing longterm its INSANELY worth it.
---
🤣
---
Commenting to come back later and print thanks
---
2 factions clashing?
---
If anybody wants to take their body seriously while not really leaving the house , investing in a simple resistance band can allow you to really feasibly get a short full body workout in regardless of your fitness background
---
I knew some people who worked as GMs. Said it sucked. Might have been after Activision acquisition.
---
I think it's a whole list of things that really detach you from your character and make the whole game seem superficial and pointless now. In classic you feel yourself get stronger with every piece of gear you get. You feel a connection to the world around you and have interactions with everyone in the world. You feel like your character belongs to you and is unique to you. You put in the time and effort to make your character what they are. 
---
In retail you just start at 110 hit every button on your screen in no particular order and follow the yellow dot on the minimap to hit max level whole everything around you feels the same no matter what level you are. Even my main from vanilla just feels like a hollow shell. Sure I have the achievements and the transmog from 14 years ago, but who cares. To see those achievements you need to dig really deep and be looking for them, and everyone has the transmog because it takes 5 minutes to solo old raids now.  I get no sense that anyone cares about my character or gear today not even me.
---
Stalagg didn't exist at that point
---
I forgot the Tram... T.T shame on me.
---
Yeah, Zul'Gurub also won't be in phase 1. Lots of raids that are gonna happen, they just picked the two most high profile ones, because everybody who played back then remembers the events associated with them.
---
Oh, they implemwnted the role lock? So I guess the meta is set in stone.
---
I had to say something even when it's long. Sorry for that.
---
I remember having fun in Vanilla back then as a kid.
---
The first change which i disliked was the AV change. Spent most of my time there and after all those changes it didn't feel like a real battlefield. 
---
Then TBC came and i quit the first time after done all quests on the hellfire peninsula. Not because i disliked the content. I was sad because Azeroth now was empty. We left our world and everyone was there. All content there was now old. All freaking raids, lvl 60 zones because people went to outland with 58, world PvP was shifted to outland, all there was gone. Only the auction house and leveling phase was there. Azeroth now felt like a dead world. 
---
And this is the case till today. You just stay in your current addon zone and only visit old places for farming stuff or leveling. The world has many terrain, but it's irrelevant. 
---
Everytime i came back it was because of family and friends but when everyone was gone, i left again. The world felt broken and lost. Everything they put into game, ripped something off on other place. 
---
LFR in Wrath and difficulty in raids were so bad that i quit again. 
---
Cata was pure irony when barrens was torn into two places and Azeroth changed. I felt like they searched and find all possible ways to butcher Azeroth down. I skipped the whole expension and watched my brother playing till he also quit. 
---
I also disliked Pandaria. I felt like this place was good as a single put in continent but felt so out of place, that i did not care. Even the intro cinematic felt like a cartoon instead like the cool cinematics before. I still dislike stepping into the world there. Pandas, Ho-zen, silly dungeons and especially in my opinion: maxed out cliches, made me avoid this. I played some 7 days when blizz mailed me, thats all. It still felt like Azeroth was dead.
---
Warlords brought me back at the end because my family wanted to play in legion. I thought the garrision was good first but after reaching 120 a month before legion pre patch (or so=) i saw how bad this is.  It felt like a time waster everywhere. Thats what mission tables are till today. You are loosing youre character gameplay time to click shit.
---
Legion was nice with suramar but only because my family played. Even my mother played. THAT was a nice time. But everything there felt like a burden to waste time and ou have to repeat EVERYTHING. Timegating, repgating, gearfarming in Mhytic+ and different raid difficulties was now there to hold the playerbase in an endless circle of Faming gear and hope for some luck on repeat. Instead of getting one good piece of gear you can wear till you find ANOTHER piece of gear, it got maybe replaced with the same item but it somehow got titanforged. This already was present in Warlords before but this time it was just to let you keep on playing.
---
Now BFA is there and it's a pure nightmare. Nothing has any value anymore. You can throw away your epics like trash. Seeing the World Azeroth dying is like it's finally fully visible for everyone. They have now gone to fully hold the playerbase with all there stuff they implemented before. This poor world gets tormented before it dies in agony. All i do is farm thousands of Zin'anthide and Ore to pay my classic sub. 
---
Oh boy don't get me wrong, i wanted to see zandalar since classic. It's a joke cliche like Mop pandas being monks and rolling around to fight the evil. But all those shitty mini games, puzzles, out of character "Fly above something and throw some bombs" stuff, driving vehicle like shit, building warfront buidlings and all this crap let me now to one final thing where i can only play MY character in FULL Azeroth again: CLASSIC.
---
There i play ONLY my char, travel all of the world, having world pvp everywhere, instances around everywhere. Raids which are somehow build on each other, neutral towns with auction houses, No 100k insane healths, no mission tables, NOTHING but ME and the world.
---
I can't be the only one feeling like that and i can't take any classic hate seriously. Not after this years of WoW nightmare which has happened to azeroth.
---
All of my friends and families coming back. Thanks!
---
will possibly trade them for cool name(s) on Herod
---
Leveled one to 60 back in the day (it has 300 days /played vanilla to wrath) and to 35 on a private server. People can downvote me all they want, but I hope that when they level their mage and get frustrated at drinking level 25 water at 30, they will think of this comment.
---
I loved 29 because there's a few level 35 weapons you can get to have the upgraded enchants like mongoose on.
---
The next one will be desktop background quality I know it.
---
That place is rough solo on any class.
---
I was undecided before but you’ve sold me on hunter
---
As a mage should I use a wand instead of staff?
---
Yw man! Hope you get one you like
---
tbh, retail leveling is worse.  took me almost 4 days /played to get 120 a few weeks ago, with +140% heirloom xp and winning most bgs which was the fastest way to lvl...
---
I've just thought of two factions clashing, I kinda think it helps with the speed as you go down the list..
---
But I like it regardless, it's too late now? Probably? Whatever I really like the idea of this song haha
---
The game wasnt designed like retail where almost everything is easy and handed on a plate. If you dont have the time or dont have the patience ranking above 11-12 is not for you. People just know they cannot do it and want to be able too. Ranking does not have to be for everyone.
---
Good God I hope not.
---
Well, how else do you include the classiness of all the players?
---
DUDE IT WOULDNT MAKE IT FLASHY HOLY SHIT... DUDE it would literally just do the same dungeon with bigger health pool and more damage output you absolute geezer stop acting like this will make new BiS items or items at all it’s literally for the sake of competition
---
Why did my guild chose Thalnos... WHY??
---
WF procs and other sources of extra attacks cannot proc WF again,
---
and in patch 1.11 the AP bonus of WF was cut in half.
---
Roll elemental, my friend! Or get an elemental buddy to wombo combo off your storm strike.
---
Thanks.
---
It would be way easier than 2 hunters
---
This is poor quality, you should be ashamed of sharing this and littering the subreddit.
---
26th for me in the US.  :D
---
Shitty hunter here that’s always striving to be better. I can only speak for myself but I would say the aesthetic of the hunter class is what sold me originally. Never even considered viability or leveling ease. I assume it’s the same for a lot of people. I think outside of min/maxers, a lot of people choose classes based on aesthetic. Some people love the look of decked out mail armor and some people love the aesthetic of the hunter with the bow or gun and trusty pet. I don’t think it’s fair to assume that newbies pick hunter because they’re easy to level, they likely pick them because they think they look cool. That’s just my perspective though.
---
Still rocking mine as well
---
Buying it. Running mage and plan on gold farming to cover costs of materials for leveling Eng and for the tools I'll use once maxed.
---
People knew Herod was going to be crowded - did that stop them from dog piling on when there were 5 other server choices? Lol, no.
---
Isn’t Skarm a pserver player? 
---
Data won’t be accurate.
---
Because it's the BEST!
---
Grats on unemployment
---
Human anything but priest or NE priest for ally.
---
Troll anything but priest is pretty shit too.
---
Hi, good questions. The main ciriticism for this study have been the lack of MMO choices and selecting how long a person plays.  Indeed, there should be a 0, because many people stop any return. The choices there are per week, but if you're unsure then give your best guess.  Unfortunely, I can't change this atm, otherwise it would invalidate some of the data.
---
Ultra neck beards who can only say no and moron :/
---
Yes... but not druids in beast form.
---
They have a point, some -will- leave because they strapped the nostalgia goggles on too tightly. But they're completely wrong when they think that's the majority
---
best bet is PoM sheep
---
Yes. All of your abilities are instant trigger so you want a slow mainhand.
---
&gt; People just have to create threats because modern humans don't have any.
---
Depends on where those humans live.
---
Lmao!!!
---
Why they do always play only 1 class or why cant i comprehend it?
---
They only play 1 class because they keep saying how much they love that class and they are not intrested in anything else and what i cant comprehend is: are you not even intrested in trying other classes to see what they have to offer? :D
---
I'd prefer that over reading this.

I don't see the problem with people rolling pve if they want to avoid griefing. It's more of a mystery why some people roll pvp and then cry and whine when they get ganked by a higher level or ganged up on by a group while they're solo. That's the reality of wpvp and if they can't deal with it they should have rolled pve.
---
Slow mainhand and fast dagger offhand but the dagger is not that important as the slow mainhand.
---
TIL I will never hire any to work for me if they browse this sub.. I don’t understand how majority of these adults don’t even have the incentive to provide any input to a community they are a part of. 
---
Such a toxic work attitude :/
---
You get very little but some yes.
---
Yeah the downward slide has been happening for over 6 months but it really fell off a cliff the past 2 weeks.
---
Shitpost after shitpost and the mods are terrified to slow the growth of the sub.
---
I've primarily played Alliance, and I'm sticking with it. I did level a horde mage to 70k in TBC though, so it wouldn't be a "fresh" experience for me.
---
There were several fights in AQ and Naxx we used bear tanks on regularly.  They have zero issue tanking almost everything in the game.  They can also generate superior threat to a warrior.  I have often wondered where the mentality of druid tanks being not as good came from.   I can only imagine maybe just because of the popularity of the warrior class.  I was the MT in vanilla of a top guild, played as a warrior.  When I would go DPS to take a break, we would swap in the guild OT as MT and he was a druid for progression raiding.  We never had any unique issues that can be recalled making the change back and forth.  
---
Both classes can tank with excellent efficiency.  Something not enough people know as well, is the paladin when played correctly is far superior to both warrior and druid for group tanking.  But due to not having a proper taunt, they are prone to have small issues here and there with stupid group members mass aggroing or pulling something then running away from the tank.  Often, people's elitism blinds them to the functionality of other classes.
---
What is the context here?
---
Also your arms talent build needs piercing howl. One of the dumbest talents to overlook.
---
No problem. I'll put it as under an hour and once a week. I basically don't play at all right now, but plan on really getting back into it for classic lol
---
Well he probably isn’t editing in this way for other projects. This still takes a decent level of skill to do.
---
I know you are just so offended and appalled.
---
I levelled to 60 on a private server. I levelled to 60 in vanilla and subsequently to 110. My experience is that the water is sufficient at every stage to top off your mana. It just takes a little longer as you near the next rank of water. But then you rank up the water and suddenly your mana goes up much faster when you drink it.
---
My bad. Did a bit of skipping most of the post when you suggested mythic dungeons in classic wow. So they also don’t drop any loot, so people who never do them because what a fucking waste of time. Spend gold on consumables to get no loot and get your name on some leaderboard is the least vanilla wow thing I have ever heard.
---
You do know what multiboxing is right?
---
This is exactly what I was thinking. We're toxic for playing on a PvP server though, right? The fuck?
---
The waters will be littered with the corpses of level 1 gnomes.
---
also everyone saying hunters aren’t needed beyond a certain point don’t understand that dominant hunters aren’t used for their chart topping dps. i’ll take a hunter that knows how to kite well for bosses and knows their shit over some dummy mage or rogue just bc “omg high deeps” A good hunter will have a spot in every single raid, guaranfuckingteed
---
I play horde for 10 yers, and its time for a change.. im going Human Priest Holy for new and exciting experiences!
---
Lol wtf are you even saying, this shit isn’t going to sell
---
Just leveling it gives you potions that give hour long buffs. You can easily roll around with +armor, +agility, health per 5 seconds, + stamina, + strength and more. It seriously twinks you out.
---
I dont get it. You support a rank 14 honor grind but dungeons for competition with no loot table is bad.
---
Same ;) Thank you for participating in the study.
---
yup
---
 How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a kid over them mountains?
---
No, isboxer mimics your keystrokes on every client. If i group my characters they will move together after that, they will break group if they get stucked, CC'ed etc
---
Oh, you gunna poop.
---
What do what time and date does it actually drop? I’m east coast USA, when can I play?
---
Yeah such complicated rotations in classic man, you shadowbolt and then wand until mob dies.
---
Yeah, getting ahead of the curve means (hopefully) much easier access to mobs with less competition
---
It's obviously a female orc, hence the shoes and upright position
---
Yes because multiboxing is botting
---
derrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
You'll find a guild that will really be eager for you to off tank
---
The guys trolling. Lets stop feeding the idiot, it hurts
---
Have a sense of humour!
---
Yep. It was awesome leveling through eversong again though, cuz I feel like they haven’t touched that area at all since TBC
---
you should watch the video series for druid bear tanks by Skarm ;)
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEFbn7j8JTuGndsrvyx3h3MlX5hMxy-HB
---
Wotlk when everything was so easy and everyone had catch-up gear and TOC was shit and started the split difficulty trend. I quit after I cleared TOC hard mode.
---
I actually have that name on Fairbanks lols
---
When the game has already obtained all the world firsts what do you think they will do.m? Speed clears and what would make speed clears more interesting. It doesn’t have to have a timed limit but rather a way showing who HAS done it the fastest.
---
Become a streamer now lol
---
You're really bored aren't you?
---
Anyone know any good Undead Warrior speedrun guides or videos? I've seen undead mage/rogue speedrun videos but never Warrior.
---
ahah didn't know that one pretty good
---
No my poor beta character is just ganking horde at a farm upstate
---
The biggest factor is just improvements on minmaxing and theorycrafting. Feral druid relies on spamming crowd pummlers which is something that back on even nostalrius wasn't considered at all, imagine how it was in vanilla then.
---
But there's been some stuff that could impact druids. We found that the raw damage in bear form somehow was slightly less on classic than on pservers, and the 16% parry definitely impacts druids more than warriors.
---
Its 2019 bro. I dont do streamers or twitch or all that nonsense but you bet your fuckin ass I'm watching The Office and LotR on my way to 60
---
"I'll attract the enemy with my human call... I'm so wasted!"
---
Ur have no idea, Einstein...
---
God bless you.
---
NE Hunter is better in wpvp, solo pvp etc, due to being able to stealth ambush and decide fights (stealth cat too). Dwarf Hunter better in bg and group pvp.
---
highly unlikely. otherwise they would have overturned the terms.

Since this comment has gotten some upvotes (perhaps from your friends) I decided to give it another response.  I’ve played MANY MMOs since my 1st, SWG.  I know what I like and what I don’t like.

Your comment reflects more on you and less on me.  You’ve included nothing constructive that adds to the conversation in your comment, just opinionated criticism.  You’re allowed to be a contrarian. I’ve noticed a trend in your comments that point to arrogance.

Ridicule is to be expected on a public forum so it’s nothing special.  Difference of opinion in a disrespectful way. Haters are going to hate for whatever reason. Mainly their lives being miserable so they try to spread the misery onto others.

You dont even need that map OP, admit it you committed it to memory many moons ago
---
Dungeon is more likely to be PUG. So if you are 4 friends and one random, you can fuck over the random by all rolling on an item and then trading it to the one in the friend group that needed it.
---
Raids tend to be more organized than that.

Interesting survey, I like doing these sorts of things because it makes me ask myself questions I usually wouldn't.

There was a section on loneliness there that was a little harrowing lmao.

$20 this is Roshbank
---
wtf, no one ever mentions my realm...in english
---
Leveled a rogue in the beta and decided then and there never again, what an absolute horror.
---
can someone throw this guy a bean?
---
That’s not bad after delivery fees and tax, since the tip was excluded in the comic. Last time I ordered just a large pizza the fees and tip alone were $8 of the $20 bill. Fucking bullshit
---
OSRS is the best example of this. OSRS has unique content for its game that the 2007 game and RS3 never had. I play OSRS because it still contains the gameplay and soul of the original game. New content means I can continue playing that game and experience new quests, monsters and loot without the game staying stagnant. 
---
I understand the "no changes" attitude for now, and I think it should stay that way until we reach Naxx. But I want to continue playing Classic, not BC or WotLK. New dungeons, raids, outdoor PvP zones but in the Classic world would be my preferred choice.
---
What else am I supposed to do as I stare at a grayed out "Enter World" button.
---
Why woudl you quit your job without a backup plan?
---
Needs small clips of minimap screens of these hubs dictating which boat/zep to which city
---
Activision is already working on that.
---
Bummer.
---
I wouldn't trust private servers as far as I can throw them. 
---
If you want to be safe you should follow the meta that developed 14 years ago, there could be countless of things wrong with private servers yet to be exposed. If they can get a basic thing like boss parry wrong, they can get anything wrong.
---
If you tank as a warrior and DPS as a mage or rogue (if you want to top the meters) you should be fine.
---
That would be pretty funny, honestly
---
There are a number of reasons why even worse case scenario layering is advantageous compared to merging individual servers.
---
Indeed, if blizzards projections are accurate there will be no need for any transfers which is the aim of layering. 
---
Layering does work best if the predictions are accurate, without seeing their data it’s hard to make a judgement regarding the number of servers currently provided.
---
Many have pointed out factors that do seem to indicate that there will be issues and blizz has been trying to rectify some of these factors(I.e Herod overload).
---
I think blizz is trying their best to deliver on classic wow and I don’t think claims that they are penny pinching on server numbers is realistic.
---
Classic wow is a major cash cow and and not providing enough servers to accommodate the playerbase would be a terrible decision business wise.
---
Having leveled by a hunter and warrior to 60 in vanilla, I didn't find the warrior hard to level at all.  But yes the hunter was easy mode.
---
I don't see how this keeps you from playing with friends. I'm just optimising things a bit to save time and because preparing things is something fun to do while waiting for release
---
I did not.
---
But I wish you the best with wow classic!
---
My guild in vanilla had multiple bear tanks and we did fine. You won't have issues.
---
Uh... yup.  Faerie fire SUCKS for rogues.  It takes away vanish, or if a rogue does *somehow* manage to break combat they still can't stealth, and it just lasts forever.  That's why experienced rogues generally avoid druids.
---
Craft the community experienced you want to see. This means careful blocking and ignoring and Guild forming or Guild joining and public Channel opening or closing.
---
If you definitely want to tank I would really suggest warrior for classic. Druid could tank 5man but it was in lack of finding a warrior and with people who already knew the druid.
---
This seems most likely: "Oh, Herod is full and I can't recreate my characters there. Maybe you should just move to Stalagg so we can stay together?"
---
Because when they explained the whole layering system they said that each layer would have more or less the same amount of player than a 2006 vanilla server ?
---
&gt;intense high skill
---
You're in the wrong genre.
---
Its sunday so I guess all the interns are back home
---
Easily the best open world PvP class in the game. You won't have issues.
---
Warlocks will trash you 1v1. Rogues aren't fun either if you lack a PvP trinket. That's about it. You have the tools to make everyone else your bitch.
---
Skarm said himself, that at T1, druids are better than warriors for tanking. If it's skarm and the subject is tanking, his word is law.
---
Yes I’m aware of how multiboxing works, and clearly you have never tried to even run in a straight line by broadcasting movement keys. 
---
The slightest variation in positioning between characters results in every character moving in wildly different directions after a couple seconds of movement, and it is literally impossible to get your characters facing exactly the same direction without follow.
---
It's already going soooooo slooooowwwwww. :(
---
56k modem is all you need fam.
---
That’s my understanding. You’ll can’t get that till phase 3
---
TL;DR  Retail folks legit worried people will leave their game they're so invested in, because something that is actually fun will be a draw.
---
I'd be worried too, if I were them.
---
They removed blessings for prot pallies
---
They removed auras and switching auras
---
Ret aura is a TALENT
---
Why so many players will roll a priest?
---
As far as professions go, is it advisable to take some money making gathering professions (like herb/skinning) early game then swapping to crafting later on?
---
Also I’m rolling a warrior tank, wondering if I should plan on going engineering or blacksmithing late game? Or maybe even alchemy?
---
She didnt hit him she just tossed the money at his face and didnt even ask for change.
---
The flavor of vanilla is putting in that work to get to that alchemy lab though.  It may seem tedious or unnecessary the 50th time you've had to fight to the lab... but that's the flavor.  You aren't given things, you have to work for just about everything in one fashion or another.  It's a time invested vs reward system and if you remove all of (or some of) the time investments all you have left is rewards.  That's not vanilla.
---
This is a very good point.
---
Mine still in its opened package and battery still works.
---
It won’t lol
---
Jebaited
---
I hear ya. Never played original or BC but my main always was and will be an undead warlock.
---
Thank you for such a wonderful response.
---
Did you really just rank spirit as the best stat for warriors?
---
My google history: "How to sleep for a week straight."
---
I googled it but thank you for your explanation.
---
People wasting paper on all this dumb shit lol.
---
We aren't 12 and we have faster computers now. Just alt tab or have a second monitor.
---
I'm from europe so i'm not up to date with the NA servers.
---
Except so many of us have played on private servers for years and know exactly what the game was like
---
&gt;Everything has its positives and its negatives. The problem is, some people have no idea what negative things Classic will have in store for them, and how it will affect their enjoyment of the game. You are all blinded by your nostalgia
---
Always wonder why Hinterlands is marked as 40-50. I wouldn't go there until atleast 46-47
---
It's cake once you have a pet. Before that it's a bloody nightmare.
---
Everyone says that "someone else" will craft your shit, but who is that person?  Who gets to be the crafting bitch?  Are they compensated for this by the guild in any way?
---
So you’re telling me doing a m+ scholomance and getting a lab that has a 24 hr cool down wouldn’t be flavor or hard to obtain. Like everything you tried to counter with is exactly what my ideas consist of.
---
Yup. I'm of the opinion that the grind is part of the game, and paying to skip the leveling grind is like paying to get to stand up to wait to get off the airplane instead of just sitting in your seat and letting the aisle move.
---
But, financially speaking if I wasnt of this mindset, a couple hundred bucks to save me literal days of "grinding" is clearly worth it.
---
I hope these are kept aggressively in check.
---
Don't listen to him. it's an idiotic advice. Never give a newbie a class where you have to micro a companion. It's a pain in the ass if you don't know what you do. Just roll her a Mage or some other braindead class and let he have fun. If we talk instances, it's one button also.
---
I was kinda put off by your comment. My first reaction was, whata dick...
---
Then I went to the guide.. There's nothing there... I mean it's every YouTube vid, article I've seen, just with alot less information.
---
I'm in the same boat. I am highly looking forward to playing classic after starting late WotLK.
---
Actually buddy, you will be surprised.
---
Did you not play stress? I play silvermoon so I understand what you're saying about the lag, but unless you're playing with 2005 hardware, I promise you thinks are great. The stress test was extremely busy and the only lag you'll get is a small push to latency with hits and whatnot and even that's rare. The stress test went really really well.
---
One person the entire time complained about lag, everyone else in the same place all said it wasn't a problem.
---
Well yea this is what I'm putting my faith in terms of wanting to roll druid.
---
I think it'll be a viable tank on the road to 60, and grabbing bear tank bis should be fine.
---
I'm also prepared to build a resto gear set and heal as part of raids also. I just dont want to be stuck being a solo healer.
---
Well, that's what I meant
---
As soon as i read “the loading screen cuts to black” i knew where this was going lmao
---
It's gonna be rough. I'm off Friday-Sunday and then have a one day work week before going on leave but man it's going to be torture.
---
After some research I made a comment giving all the links I got
---
It happens but 5 percent is so low you don't notice it. You expect to resist and look for it when you are at 20 plus with the class/race combos you listed.
---

---
Retail tourist checking in!  Really hoping classic gives me some more enjoyment than retail.  I quit a little over a month ago due to the boring ass daily grind, and shitty endgame content in general.
---
I think I'll get much more enjoyment out of classic leveling than I would from doing the same dailies every day.
---
8 am on Tuesday the 27th for us Australians, it's gonna be a long week
---
I stand with Vancleiff
---
I'm secretly compiling a screenshot like that for people who think that Blizzard won't add level 60 boosts and gold tokens to Classic.
---
I have an old 2012 Mac, seems I have just barely the minimum spec requirements. 
---
I tested it by downloading Battle for Azeroth and logging into one of my old low level characters and doing a couple quests in EF.
---
On low settings, it plays fine, only some choppiness when I first log in.
---
If I’m able to run BFA, I’m assuming I’ll have no issue with Classic, correct?
---
They will do whatever they want. Pvp, twinks, alts, farm, help guildies. We didn’t wait all this time for classic just for it to have a creeping element of #somechanges. The game didn’t go from BC to BFA, it was over time.
---
This is the classic wow reddit. We want classic wow, not just mostly classic then retail. It’s the reason most people probably aren’t reading the whole text of your post and the same reason people don’t want permanent layering. While there are retail tourists that want all kinds of things, that’s not what this game should be in the community’s collective opinion.
---
I prefer horde because I prefer thier lore, characterization, and athetics. 
---
I disdain people who pick race just because it's optimal "every UD rogue". 
---
BFA ignited allot of faction pride, on Reddit you frequently see people arguing about the merits, downsides ,and ideals of both factions. Because racials are less substantial people are more free to pick the race they want instead of what has best gameplay advantage. 
---
I must admit that server hopping has done major harm to wpvp. I do like the weekly kill player quests.
---
very interesting, thanks for the link!
---
lol fair.
---
Druid will not be play by everyone but that is fine for me. It means more stuff for me in raids.

I only had two beers occifer.
---
Druids were viable tanks in vanilla. Many progressing guilds had atleast 1 feral druid offtank. Feral druids had a bad rep in vanilla because the Druid class came a very fucking long way from release to 1.12. Sometime I think between 1.10-1.12 blizzard did a hard sweep of all the classes talent trees and toned up everyone. Druids received some of the heaviest improvements. The bears were actually viable and encouraged to bring atleast 1. It was an offtank that could switch to dps whenever their job was done not needed and offered Druid utility( battle res / innervate / whatever the 31 point talent was). 
---
The continued to have a bad rep until tbc because people were stupid in vanilla, stuck in their ways, and basically the only real theorycrafting community that existed during this time was a subculture within the rogue class. Forward thinking guilds however realized how useful a bear could be and quite a few adjusted their raid comps to have 3 druids (2 resto / 1 feral).
---

---
Not according to the many threads on this sub about "I'm a boomer with 300 guildies and we've been waiting for this for 15 years and we all reserved our names on Herod and now we can't all switch this is a matter of life and death"
---
Seems very odd
---
I mean, I don't like layering either (though I think it is an OK solution to a complex problem) but this information is simply incorrect.
---
At least as far back and plans were concrete enough to matter, the information given has been somewhere between a few weeks until the end of P1.  Saying "1-2 weeks" and "lucky if gone by P2" is disingenuous.
---
It's fine to be up in Blizzard's grill - we want to make sure layering doesn't stick around a minute longer than it's needed.  But at least be mad about the actual facts rather than making it seem worse than it is.
---
Druid raid sets generally favor healing bust stats like agi exist.  You can mix and match rogue gear to compensate.
---
I meleed through VC not too long ago as a hunter.  I'd been expecting to hit 20 about 1/3 of the way through the dungeon, so I filled my quiver with mostly the next tier of arrows.  I ran out of the lower tier arrows just as we hit the ship.  I still had another half a bar of XP to go.  Luckily, we pulled pretty much everything and I dinged 20 right before VC.
---
You should some other zones too. I'd like to see some Mulgore!
---
Only 4?

Nice timing!  Just make sure you put your job search work in before getting sucked in for your daily play sesh.  Nothing feels better than knowing you're being productive AND binge-ing on your favorite game.

Yes, I made a comment to meet this requests. But they are not made by me.

Do not hesitate to share why it is bad.
---
i don’t see the issue. when i went to college i had to get caught up on everything since the invention of my field to current state of the art (computer science). it’s one of the trade offs of living in the modern era. 
---
if i can learn to write an 8-bit OS in assembly, you can get a carrot on a stick.
---
Ya, i'm agreeing with the others on this. BF tanking in private servers is not gonna be the same as in this specific version of Classic. I think there will likely be some people surprised when they go try to do it in a raid zone.
---
The bigger thing i remember from that was that the lore was changed a lot so holy power now came from aliens. Blood elves were suddenly there and ready to suck on alien juice and thats all they needed to become the same paladins as what we had before.
---
Probably.
---
alrighty, thank you
---
Remember a week ago when we were all jazzed about Herod and being friendly to each other? I miss those days.  I will say though the Stalaag meme game has been strong of late 🤣 wishing the best for both servers.
---
Word. I understand man. I did something similar in my early 20s and it paid off. Hope it all works out for you too!
---
This game should have gameplay challenges. Because nothing will be a challenge besides grinds AQ/Nax and world PvP
---
Apparently people are saying it is.
---
Ahh yes the bridge of gankzad-dum
---
Imagine choosing goodie 2 shoes,muh light, virgin alliance over honorable, blood and thunder, chad horde.

That was my plan exactly! You can easily get the first wand by level 9ish by getting Tailoring to level 30 and making 10 green robes then get ench to 10. Was going to then drop it and take skinning hoping it won't set skinning back to much. Are you going to keep enchanting till you can make the greater wand? Aren't you worried it will set your skinning too far back though? Or can you start skinning in the Barrens?
---
I want to do the same thing with engi and get both so I feel I'll definitely need mining at some point but worried without a mount it will slow me down too much while leveling
---
I absolutely hate the current state of the game and I don't want to play Vanilla forever and would love to see it progress through WOTLK.
---
My guild had the pleasure of a druid main tank back during vanilla that tanked every raid up to Naxx, his name was Moonhair.... and if he is reading this? dude you were ahead of your time for damn sure and your TPS back in day allowed our dps to go hard and kill bosses faster and it was a real treat.
---
Here's the thing. Warrior are the preferred tank. Can druids tank? Yeah. Are they the best tank? Depends on the situation. Would a druid who knows how to tank be chosen over a warrior who doesn't know how to tank for shit? Absolutely. All you have to do is be the best druid tank you can be. If you're a competent player, you will be useful to a group.

AGI-&gt;INT-&gt;SPR are the primary hunter stats until around 50.

My actual handwriting is dogshit, tbh.  
---
This is with a calligraphy pen and takes way more time (tis isn't even good for calligraphy standards)  
---
This took multiple hours, still, thank you.
---
It 100% does work on players. Druid's track humanoid works on players too.
---
My friends and I started near launch and stopped playing somewhere during Wrath.  Part of it was two of us got hacked, but will always remember good old Drakor.  The guy had everything stolen, but was left with just his Hand of Rag, I think even the hacker felt bad and didn't vendor it.
---
Those gold farmers buy tons of copies of the game and run a lot of accounts though, it’s not in Blizzard’s interests to crack down too hard unless they get extremely bad, to the point where they’re losing significant numbers of subs over it. Like you say, it’s not the kind of problem that would be hard to put an end to if they really wanted to.
---
I can‘t wait to forget to dismiss my pet before doing a jump in a dungeon/raid 👌
---
Druids tanked raids and did fine most encounters
---
I'm leaning towards this as well but I'm worried mining will slow the leveling process down too much. May be easier to do when mines aren't being camped and you have a mount?
---
"Mobile games" only really became a thing when smartphones came out, so circa 2007 I'm not sure many 12 year olds will be playing Classic but what do I know......
---
I've had so many rogues roll on my bows for stats.  I don't even feel bad taking rogue weapons when I need the status.
---
Probably an emotional outburst im chat

It won't be good DPS but you will do enough usually to justify being in a damage spot. Not sure what raid it starts being a struggle to do enough (let alone more than enough) but I think its after BWL.
---
You won't be taken over any non-"meme spec" but you'll be taken if they just need any DPS. Which will probably happen a decent bit.
---
Druid isn't too bad.

Unless you live in America you can take off the 27th since it releases midnight. So you can start fresh first thing in the morning.

But do you remember?
---
You said most, not me. I'm saying that the newest generation of Gamers were more likely to have their brains rewired because when you are young, your brain is at its most malleable.
---
But mobile games affect everybody in that way, some more than others and age is one of those reasons.
---
And that's an awfully small age range for making your point.
---
Thanks boys
---
Replace all mages in raids with shadow priests, they give shadow weaving. They are clearly the more superior class to go hand in hand with warlocks.
---
"Hear me out"
---
Said no one ever, expecting to be heard out.
---
Pve servers are like the type of people who want to play retail. They want the option to pick their difficulty, and they don't want to play the hardest difficulty but still play all the content. Classic's appeal is that it doesn't hold your hand, and you just can't get that survival, difficult play style on a pve server
---
I believe there are some Race specific quest.  I could be wrong though, it's been a while. But also, say you are a Shaman, and go to Deathknell, there is no Shaman trainer.
---
Aoe relies heavily on uninterrupted grinding. A new server generally won't allow this to happen unless you win some insane lottery to get ahead of the mob
---
you’ll have no problem healing as shadow while leveling. endgame dungeons aren’t as demanding either but it can be a personal choice for you. Maybe do the dungeon the first time as a shadow dps and see what spec the healer in the group is and see how smooth the run goes.
---
that's what it looks like to me.
---
Sounds good indeed! Alchemy it’ll be.
---
We used druids to tank AQ and Naxx in vanilla. the idea that the warrior was only viable was one of many wrong assumptions that held so many guilds back.  It was absurd then, we used to laugh about people saying it then, now 15 years later it's been proven otherwise for years, and we still see it.
---
OP and those who may use this as a guide. 
---
It is HIGHLY recommended to NOT buy some spells in classic. Most notably on this list any frost nova above first rank and poly above first rank. 
---
You need to buy spell level ups in classic. Each rank cost money. Thru general play you will not have enough gold to buy your next batch of spells. However you DO want some spells at their highest rank, such as frost bolt and fire bolt  until level 20 when you start only using the one with your spec. Etc. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
You complain now, but when someone is camping your dead body. I'll come and save you because I no-lifed to 60
---
Sorry but that sounds like your breaking up a community. The exact thing layering was supposed to prevent.

If you care about it, keep in mind that Humans got the bigger ~~tits~~ weapon models even before the changes they made in WoD IIRC

---
If you're duo-leveling, it happens pretty much on its own with tailoring, enchanting and skinning / lw as professions.
---
Also, don't humanoids drop greys too? I don't see a problem just grinding those instead of beasts.
---
I feel like the human crest should be updated a bit since the symbol on the shield is for Lordaeron, which is practically gone as a nation at this point. It should have a lion symbol to represent Stormwind, in my opinion.
---
I did at first, which is why I was gonna skip classic wow, but I have instead decided to become a casual and just enjoy the ride with some friends and see where it takes me. If being behind is too boring, I’ll find something else to do. In the end the time spent in classic wow will be a nice experience for me, it will only be a matter of how long it’ll last.
---
It's going to be hard as hell and it's going to be even harder to find a serious guild willing to take you.
---
Priests are looking very popular for Classic compared to vanilla and even more private servers. Who knows why... but yeah, priests are fun powerful solo levellers and pvpers, and known for being a strong reliable healing class from RFC through to Naxx. What's different this time though I don't know.
---
Wtf was this. Why is this here? Can we please not be /r/wow
---
The biggest mistake this sub makes and most players are confusing tedious time grinds with difficulty. 
---
Classic wasn’t more difficult than anything we have now, it was just more tedious. It required more time spent but there was nothing actually difficult about it.
---
Lol wow. You literally proved my point.
---
Crap. I'm torn between replying "I 'member" and "Remember what?"
---
People worrying about ratios are one of the reasons why skew in the first place. People flock to the server with a few % difference and of course it snowballs.
---
You just said so many words
---
i think the general general consensus is that they changed too much after clayman but imo a sense of purpose was their last good album
---
and don't forget to remove your GPU's guys, we playing on integrated MOBO one's here :D
---
Why does it have to be about BFA literally it can be classic with harder difficulty. Everyone bitches they took out the difficulty in the game, but when the thought of optional difficulty increase comes then everyone gets mad. I cannot understand how in the world this would detriment the classic feel don’t add this option in on phase one add it in phase six.
---
W-what... are you...a dumbass?
---
Natty bois
---
I'd assume because it's an easy source of quick gold. Once you got the attunement and can skip straight to the waterfall part, Boomkin / Hunters &amp; Locks can solo Princess, Rotgrip and the goblin and sell each drop for like 2-5g each depending on armor type and if it's a weapon or not.
---
Can get like a quick 10-13g per 15 mins if you know what you're doing and is relatively geared.
---
You can't go wrong with either. Sounds to me you are leaning more towards Pally
---
Is it viable to play a druid as tank/dps? Tanking/offtanking in raid and switching to full dps otherwise? I don't really want to heal :/
---
Not sure if there's a point to carrying a healing set while leveling: one will be looking to heal in dungeons, and one will be looking for dungeon groups in the cities - where the bank is - so it's not really worth-while to level with it on hand...
---

I've played on US from UK for years. You just download the US client and buy sub from the US store. It always auto directs you to EU but just change it in the url bar. 
---
Never had any issues, only on retail where you can't turn tokens into bnet balance if you're not actually from the US or CA. Can still turn tokens into game time though.
---
Ugh...that feeling.
---
G’day mate!
---
Pretty sure you just keep painting yourself into a corner here mate. If you don't want to grind consumables then Classic just isn't for you. Go back to Retail and leave Classic as it is for us other people, you know, who actually *want* to play it like it is.
---
Thanks man, believe I'm consuming all the literature and videos on the subject too :)
---
Level 1-60 solo ins 6 hours, beating the current record by 4, 14 hours. My leveling route:  delusion
---
Don't swap too much though since you're set to 0 from the stats when you change gear, like you don't suddenly gain the Mana for having 20 int on it
---
This is the most cringeworthy thing I ha e seen in years.
---
Classic wow isn't hardcore, casual players will still get to experience the journey to 60, they will still be able to experience and complete 5 of the 7 raids availables, they can still get decently ranked on the pvp rank system. They will only miss out on naxxramas, high rank, Thunderfury (unless they are the tanks of their guilds) and scarab lord. I might have missed a few things but that's hardly a lot of the classic content.
---
It's funny because there's only one person on this picture that has semi valid criticisms, the rest are literally just "ItS oLd", or "AnYonE whO PlaYeD The gAMe KnOws ItS bAd", without any sort of substance to their actual arguments.
---
Not gonna lie, it's enjoyable to make fun of morons like this.
---
Priests with the BFD wand put out roughly warlock shadow bolt damage so the sustain is fairly good. The offensive dispels are also very strong. You won’t burst anyone like a rogue or hunter but you’ll make your team a juggernaut when played right. Good luck in the 19 bracket.
---
Seems to me like he rightly doesn't want to play on Herod but just can't admit it.  You will likely be better for the move as well anyways due to the large queue.
---
In the past, they’ve done free server transfers.
---
I think there is a lot to why they are losing subs.
---
You can always introduce specialized or gear that is better in certain zones or gear that that is just a tiny bit better so that power creep is held to a minimum. Content does not have to be vertical. Personally I could love with these things as long as instanced material are kept to a minimum and world pvp healthy (no shitty teleports or flying mounts and other things that let people stay safe all the time).
---
You have your talent tree to post my man?
---
You guys should check out Cranius youtube channel. He has made many more music videos with selfwritten music related to World of Warcraft. A very talented guy!
---
Yeah, both are irl friends, one is ally in their server and the other is horse on another. If I go horde, I’ll have a much bigger group to play with. If I go ally, MUCH smaller group but I know they won’t quit. The horse friends are more likely to quit the game after a few months imo since they haven’t actively played the game in many many years, whereas the ally friend has constantly played with minor breaks. Still deciding tbh but I have a toons on both servers
---
Then go Heart-of-the-Wild spec: you can readily flip between tank, dps, and heals without re-spec'ing.

---
Just a fucking huge pile of cocaine.
---
The survey results do suggest Priests are second most popular class. This may be as they are the standard healing class and can be chosen by both factions, unlike Shamans or Paladins.
---
Yes, because trolls can be priests and start in the same area, therefore there's a priest trainer present.
---
Wow, look at you. Using words as "micro". Warlock is definitely the best pick.
---
Haha what. Shaman’s aren’t that good at 60 and even weaker while leveling; and I have never ever ever heard them called “the best open world PvP class in the game.” That title easily goes to a geared rogue, hunter, warlock, or even mage before it ever goes to a shaman. That’s a hard disagree from me.
---
It’s actually Skyrim
---
In my memory, yes. Trying to cast Fear through dual pushback only to have the Hunter Feign Death when it was 95% done casting, all while Viper Sting was ticking away...
---
You can beat a hunter if you get the drop on them, but in an even fight it's a struggle.
---
Trillions will come back for Classic. Trillions!

G'day, keen for Arugal on Tuesday? The starting areas are gonna be chocka block with randos

Just hit the downvote button when someone gives you facts, ooga booga 🦇
---
It’s just Chen looking for his keg!
---
Back in classic there were some guides floating around that told you exactly which quests to tackle in what order. They even went so far that they told you how many random mobs along the way you need to kill in order to hit certain checkpoints. Hunter is good at quickly killing mobs along the way without really stopping that much.
---
So yeah, i bet there's even better guides now and hunter will definitely be world first level 60.
---
Yes it should be coming soon. Gehennas i nearing full status so a fourth shouldn't be far off.
---
I will bear that in mind ehehe
---
iirc yes, you just won't get the quest to go see the trainer if you move zones so you just miss out on whatever bit of xp that gives.
---
8.2 doesn’t support multi-cores.

That's simply false. Look at heroin addicts chasing the dragon.

You shouldn't be posting these discussions if you can't handle critisicm. People can have other opinions you don't need to cry and try and defend yourself to every person.
---
AOE grinding is the best, but no one is going to be able to do it.  Everything is going to be cluttered unless you can get ahead really fast.
---
If you think farming consumables was the funnest part of your wow memories I pity you. You’re taking like some kind of elitist with this “for us other people”  you can play the game as is and they should also increase the options people have in phase six while leaving the game AS IS. Adding a hard mode keeps the game AS IS only making the game more competitive.
---
No clue why everyone dumps on prot pally tanks/ret.  Yes they do lack a built in taunt... But they are still pretty effective. You just need to grab engineering and be clever to get yourself that extra oompf and be competitive.
---
Thanks, do you have a suggestion for how I could make it better?
---
Not sure what i think of the fact you just bought your gf's time with you...
---
I think it's a bad idea. Wow is not for everyone. Try to get her to make dinner while you play instead.
---
&gt;&gt; "Just play it and you will understand"
---
I say this to people allot and its because trying to pin point whats actually fun and break it down to bullet points makes it sound really boring, but once you start playing it you will understand pretty quickly what charm it holds.
---
If i had to choose one thing tho its definitely the people... i think Kevin Jordan put it best. classic is basically a chat room with a game attached to it.
---
Let her choose everything like you got to when you first started, and don't have her just following you around, you follow her around and let her learn it in her own time but still give her some advice.
---
The devs built it that way.  There’s a million little dopamine hits that cascade into each other.  Quest finished; gear upgrade; lvl up; boss clear; profession skill up... plus the collection thing and tons of goals that there are.  There’s always something to give you a little hit.
---
It's absolutely fucking not. If you have someone who will have trouble just handling their character, you just don't add another layer of difficulty for no reason. She can spam Frostbolts the same way as Shadowbolt.
---
I think the last point has some claim in DBM but that's about it. Hell, I'd argue that classic needs more addons than live.
---
The last real mythic prog I did was M Argus and there's no way that's easier than classic. I bumblefucked my way through classic as a kid and did just fine where now I need 3 different websites to help with mythic prog.
---
You're being contradicting, so there is an implication. 
---
If you think it is even remotely possible that development costs come within an order of magnitude of the first 3 months of *NEW* subscriptions to WoW you're bonkers.
---
Very good sir! I played a gnome mage and NE priest in vanilla, going horde this time around to experience the other half of the game. Rolling grobbulus I look forward to RP as forsaken.
---
I believe that is the video of WoW going back in time to classic, therefore passing by MoP..
---
WTS RFC run, keep all loot PST nice kind group.
---
People assume that there will be a drop off, because there are a significant portion of poeple who have a current BFA subscription that will be allowed to try classic for free (they already have sub). A lot of these people who play BFA and enjoy it will not like classic, because they are very, very different games.
---
Also, a lot of people who are very excited for classic and don't play retail will play for several months, then realize they just don't have the time required to play an older MMO (They can't raid, because they can't ever play for 5hrs striaght, and they can't rank PvP because they only play 4-6 hours total per week, if that).
---
Even if they don't quit all out (some might because its not worth the sub cost for how much time they are playing) they still won't really affect the population of a server in terms of community because they aren't there very often.
---
Mechanically, the bosses in Vanilla would get shit on today by retail standard, I'm talking Normal raids. Typically in Vanilla only the end boss would have several unavoidable mechanics that had to be done, but vanilla through most of TBC you would faceroll most bosses and only have to worry about gear, buffs, pots, etc. but nowadays it all comes down to skill and having at least entry level gear into content. Something that comes to mind is Illidan in BT, out of 9 bosses in the raid, only 3 have legitimate mechanics that have to be explained in detail, with only Illidan himself having the level of complexity we've come to expect from bosses today. Similar scenarios were common in every Vanilla raid, namely Rag in MC.
---
Not everyone is like you. Printing this off for my kid. We are excited to teach him WoW.
---
Buddy. That’s going to be a loooong Monday.
---
wish someone would make a im coming home video for WoW like when Lebron returned to cleveland
---
two things.
---
Decked out hunters &amp; Decked out druids(who are willing to burn stuff to win).
---
Hunters have a really deceptive amount of burst.  Druids who are willing to burn stuff are almost unbeatable in 1v1s.
---
Ah shoot, that makes sense. Was kind of obvious lmao
---
Just associated it all with the actual release time for some reason :P
---
You got it man! What server you rolling?
---
I put the raid leader from this clip into the "You're not wrong, you're just an asshole" category. 
---
His technical knowledge of the game and fight appear to be on point, however he completely falls apart on the soft skills and anger management fronts. If this clip is anything to go by, he seemingly only knows how to manage a group of people through unilateral autocratic aggression. There's a reason most reputable employers don't hire or promote people like this in the real world, it just doesn't work and does more harm than good.
---
Granted, trying to lead a group who are making mistakes can be frustrating, however a good raid leader will almost always remain calm, objective, and open to two-way discussion. I'm sure it's different for everyone, but some of the most successful raid groups I've run with have also been some of the most relaxed and fun. An emotionally stable raid leader is worth their weight in gold.
---
I'd say that's possible if they have everything perfectly coordinated: gear runs, mats for fire resist gear, mats for fire resist enchants, getting lucky with flask recipe drops, etc.  And top guilds tend to, so we'll see.  That'd probably be around the 3-4 week mark after release. 
---
But I'm not arguing about top guilds.  I'm saying for the smug masses, I can't wait for them get slapped around after thinking everything is a cakewalk "cuz it's vanilla."
---
its not the end of the world, you can just re-roll a different character. I really don't know why so many people hate the journey that is levelling, imo thats where the most fun is had.
---
Isn't Thrash Blade Alliance only? The Quest atleast appears to be Alliance only.
---
No one has even played on a server yet.
---
You should repost this if there are 6 hour queues 2 weeks after launch, I don’t think you will have to though.
---
4 hours a day for 60 days is 10 days played. Average will be longer than that. If you genuinely think average players have 8 hours EVERY day for a month straight to hit cap you're nuts.
---
I think he means in a raid environment.
---
I've never played WoW before and I'm kind of interested in trying classic when it launches with some friends. I read that you only need to have a subscription to WoW ($15/month) to play classic when it launches. Does that mean I need to own some version of WoW currently and buy a subscription to play it?
---
I would love to be able to let him now how much of an impact that one phone call had on me - all I remember is that his name was Brad since it was also the name of my best friend at the time. Who I obviously fanboyed to about it lol.
---

---
Players would literally riot. Pitchforks and everything
---
/u/vevmeister /u/Tarrock /u/barkend /u/jerslan
---
Lol, dorks.
---
Lol i got mine to play 1-20 with me for a back massage. Your girlfriend is expensive
---
Things can change you know. Classic is a game that wasn't very multiboxed due to technology limits and sub price being higher, and the impact from multiboxing is a lot higher than it is in retail.
---
One thing I don't see taken into account is also that some of these people making the server sizes larger.... made 1 name on 3 servers or at least a 2 and 1.  A lot of these people already have an escape plan.  Whether they do or do not take it is the question.  Either way they are artificially increasing the population on the 1 or 2 other servers they reserved on also.  This will alleviate a little of the load. 
---
 If each individual character is what they are using to determine the population and not unique accounts... then essentially the populations are all multiplied by 3 as compared to actual population.  
---
If they are only looking at account per server then they are still artificially inflating the second or third server they created on, 3 characters on one server not having a x3 for those accounts.
---
They could also be counting individual accounts but only counting one server even if you made characters on 2 or 3... maybe just counting the first server.  In this case only the counted server could possibly be inflated if you didn't make that your home but the other one or two servers that you weren't counted on would have surprise numbers. 
---
Server count may be a lot harder to judge is all I was thinking about.  Random thought.  With the influx of new players due to jump in right at launch the current info is more or less probably just a drop in the bucket anyways.
---
Well, thank you. Now it's completely different case.
---
This time around, it‘s gonna be me, the Ret Paladin. Just watch!
---
I'm definitely interested.
---
Fair enough.
---
I have the "album" with Don't Make Me Get My Main etc, still listen on it from time to time.
---
Bringing it back into my playlist for Classic. If we get TBC I could get some Nyhm as well.
---
&gt; shared key presses, which most boxers use, automate gameplay by defintion
---
not really
---
- Against TOS: 1 keypress = 2 keypresses
---
- Multiboxers: 1 keypress = 1 keypress (twice)
---
there's a difference.
---
One could make an argument about Mythic Archimonde and the lasers/tethers, but even Blizzard agreed that the mechanics were overkill. They removed the part of the API and designed future encounters accordingly.
---
Key binding in actual Vanilla didn't exist yet.
---
Better than her complaining about me online all the time. Rather have her with me!
---
bigwigs was a vanilla add on telling you ability timers and whats going to happen
---
They start slow but from 39-60 they're the undisputed kings. Lightning Bolt crits for half of someone's health while leveling and you can guarantee a crit every 3 mins. Then you have heals, shocks, Purge, Grounding Totem. The class is literally made for PvP.
---
I really wish I knew if these quests are going to be in at launch
---
I hear the Shazzrah discord was pretty toxic.... Could be why 😂
---
I'm just not gonna bother until servers are stable I think. :p
---
Play a warrior.
---
 L l l l l l.
---
You do not need to "own" any version of wow. A sub will let you play all versions of the game OTHER than Battle for Azeroth. So you can level in retail up to 110 and you will be able to play classic for $15 a month. Nothing else needed.
---
Nope should just be able to pay the $15 a month fee from what I understand
---
I've been the that terrified undead fleeing back to Tarren Mill, it was a fucking blast.
---
Exactly, and unlike the current iteration, it felt like it meant more. This makes you want to keep grinding for it.
---
That's why I said troll anytihng BUT priest. Troll priest works.
---
Yea female dwarf has a sick casting animation. Also doesn‘t look half bad fully geared. Doesn‘t even necessarily look like a female dwarf anymore, just kinda like a small dude.
---
"convince" is a funny word for "bribe", my guy.
---
yeah I was a lucky kid to have the ability to do that. I was living on pizza pockets and Mountain Dew for three months (the time it took from rank 11 to rank 14). I definitely will not be doing that again as a 30 year old.
---
&gt;I'm NOT expecting to raid tank, but if the opportunity arises I can most likely get away with tanking dungeons while leveling as a pally, especially once I swap to prot at 32 for the reckoning spec. Plus I can still easily heal, and the buffs that pallys provide can guarantee a spot in groups/raids. Plus pallys get the lvl 40 mount and are good farmers.
---
I wouldn't recommend tanking level 60 dungeons as a pally due to a lack of a range pull outside of undead dungeons.  It can be done, but it isn't fun.
---
That being said, you will have zero problems getting groups as a pally.  Pally buffs are so OPed, good heals, and even when they're playing DPS, a clutch off heal is great in a 5 man.
---
I played horde in retail on pvp server and we'd destroy alliance everywhere eitehr in bg or world pvp.  Now ill play alliance to see it from their point of view.  I will miss garrosh, thrall, lady sylvanas and nathanos though.
---
Yes it is an important aspect of life. However much like in schools today, retail hands out gold medals to everyone for minimal effort. You get a legendary and you get a legendary ultimately destroying the value.
---
Yes: the way to lvl as a healing druid is to go feral and make sure you got a healing set in your bank, and then respec resto at 60.
---
Bolt down the chair and get the handcuffs
---
Nope it's not, bug on Wowhead. Guy got downvoted for saying that yesterday :D
---
To answer your question as to if Druid tanks will be less viable than in the pserver environment, the only thing we really know for sure now is just slightly.
---
The pservers got boss parry chance wrong and it is considerably higher in classic.  Higher parry chance + crowd pummeler haste means you will be increasing the number of hits you take from the boss, which can be an issue for a class that can’t reduce crits/crushes.  There may be other things about bosses we don’t know yet, just like we learned about the boss parry chance and crit aura reduction.
---
A word of caution as everyone keeps citing Skarm, yes he is knowledgeable, but a) he’s talking about pservers and b) he’s also coming from the far end of the spectrum re consumables and world buffs, so keep that in mind.
---
It would be difficult to even get 40 people under normal circumstances l. That’s why later stages in the game once people have geared they can push dungeon limits for fun and competition it does not need to change the classic feeling or design at all. The dungeon won’t have a time limit how Normal M+ are done but rather how fast someone has cleared it so maybe the fastest was done in an hour and then someone can attempt to beat that record for leader boards purposes
---
WoW is for Weeaboo's
---
Resilience wasn’t introduced until Burning Crusade so good luck with that
---
Essentially. Each Continent gets layered from my understanding. So after one continent reaches whatever the layer cap is it starts a new instance and routes logins to this.
---
Which is a lot healthier as well.. most people need 7-8 hrs sleep.
---
Why not just play a warrior
---
can alliance skip stranglethorn and if so where do they go?
---
I managed to do this a few times. Everybody loved me.
---
You're putting meaning to my words that wasn't there, not sure if this is some kind of bait. You seem hungry to fight anyone judging by your comments in this post.
---
We don't want anything added to the game, is that so hard to understand? TBC added things to the game, WotLK added things to the game, etc. Slowly it became what it is today, a hollow thing I hesitate to even call a game.
---
Classic is made for people like me who liked the game as it was back then. If you find yourself wanting more, it's just not for you. This should be as simple to grasp as the colour of the sky or the act of breathing.
---
Yes you can. Enhancement tree is best suited to it. Go to YouTube and search for advanced shaman tank guide. There are some good resources compiled by ‘defcamp and melderon’ on the subject.
---
phase 2 is only releasing one 5 man dungeon.
---
Rend is nice
---
You're going to have a bad time if you do this. Druid or warrior
---
Rather than using old ideas that will change classic into some kind of recycled retail, I would rather welcome completely new content. New bgs, raids, zones to farm, professions upgrade rather than downgrade, new recipes, new crafting resources with possible higher proff skill cap... These kind of changes would be more appealing for me.
---
Warrior
---
Statistics say at least a few of us won’t make it to Monday too :(
---
Possible. Easy as enhancement. But mana will be your biggest issue.
---
If you bother to read the post, these are only wands that you get from quests
---
Hey thanks for the late response, I really appreciate it! I have to look up what gear is best to keep. Thanks again for the info!
---
Hunters are find for casual players. People say the skill ceiling is high, and it's true. But if you aren't planning to do the top2 or 3 raids, it's not going to matter. A casual player can do perfectly fine leveling and doing dungeons.
---
I think the pet aspect is cool too, for new players. You have to feed and take care of them, and can pick from a wide variety. It's a level of detail warlocks don't have, since they don't feed demons and don't get to pick from a wide variety.
---
Not to mention Bloodfury and Axe spec, pet damage
---
No changes is not a meme.
---
How do I hit the gold cap?
---
and even after bgs come out
---
I'm sure this is exciting news for 0.01% of the audience here that could go there.
---
During the stress test I was getting 60ms on an East Coast realm while playing from SoCal. As far as I know, the EST realms are actually hosted in Chicago, so latency isn't all too bad.
---
How about someone in the group play a tanking class?
---
You're having a fictional argument.
---
Playing WoW is better dollar per hour than console gaming seems to be your thesis.
---
You also seem to believe that WoW is infinitely entertaining for 15$/month.
---
Know what game I've played most on my PS4 the past few months?
---
Apex Legends
---
Ask me what I paid for it.
---
so you think a character doing several actions in a row automatically is worse than 5+ characters being controlled all at the same time? or are you arguing semantics?
---
Def not, there was the idea of changing ench into a tank spec way back than but was never pushed for so they are not built for it. Also late game their dps is slim to none not that you can't play it but being real your dps is only good in PvP.
---
I tanked all the way to 60 with my druid.  The only reason I stopped tanking at 60, is my guild needed me restro to heal raids.
---
Get a life m8. He’s just some dude that lots of children like to watch.
---
why would you order a soda when you are supposed to keep a 35-pack of dr pepper in the fridge at all times
---
What exactly were the Druids burning?
---
Wasn’t there a zeppelin from orgrimmar to thunder bluff that moved in real time?
---
For me, it starts the week after release. So I have one good week to binge before school/work again!
---
You  mean "why I play hunter". I also leveled a priest, so...yeah, you want to talk pain? But fuck it. Hunter's fun at least.
---
we'll see. I looking forward to seeing who was right.
---
Yes but set your hearth for UC. So when a class quest comes up at level 10 you don't have to walk back.
---
Skarm and Taladril are heros.
---
Oh I will for sure! Good luck on ur adventures man and have the most fun
---
Druid is a fully viable as a tank. DPS will be more difficult. You'll have to go hard at it. Read here for more details:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8ny040/taladrils\_treatise\_on\_druid\_tanking\_in\_vanilla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8ny040/taladrils_treatise_on_druid_tanking_in_vanilla/)
---
There's no real need for you to validate your choice here. Just play whatever you want.
---
Ah I see. Thank you
---
Yes I had the thought to just call them rank 1-14 since everyone is okay grinding 14 PvP ranks but not doing a harder difficulty dungeon
---
Program increment is done and delivery due this week. Going to scream by for me

I'd say Night Elf. The density of quests and area is a lot higher than the other two zones.

Good argument! When would you rather your pet use Bite than LB though?
---
Your sharing debuff slots still tho so.. they'll go right into the nope drawer

The point was they didn’t know classics amount, not how many retail has. Nub
---
New Rhino race confirmed.
---
^^(Or it's just a troll looking at the guys on the bridge.)
---
can’t tell if this is serious.
---
You actually feel like you achieved something whenever you complete something
---
You roll a new character and do it all again, or you quit the game. I dunno, that's what I do. There are other games to play, I don't need Classic to last until I die.
---
I just want to play a game I love again, exactly like it was back then. If that makes you mad, if you can't understand that, well... too bad I guess.
---
Please move thousand art posts to r/wow
---
Would be better if it was 24 hours before release, I'm gonna be playing, sorry.
---
Yeah definitely, a lot of the updates to OSRS have been good and I still play to this day (well, I've played on and off over the years but came back earlier this year to make a hardcore ironman which I've been enjoying).
---
All I'm pointing out is that a lot of people are going in atm with the assumption that there will be no changes, and while it will probably be that way initially, player attitudes tend to change over time. People used to joke in OSRS about "well Jagex can add GWD now, but if they let too many updates through, before you know it we'll have the GE and D claws and this and that etc etc" - then a lot of the things people used to *joke about* actually made it in eventually.
---
WoW's a very different case though, I think even a lot of the no changes crowd would expect them to release BC as a separate server to copy their characters onto while the time comes.
---
Wotlk. Things at 70 felt rather hollow, albeit there was a lot to do. I also felt that was the beginning of class homogenization.
---
You know it could be randomly received by players so that they are forced to do the content with random people to keep the idea of community and communication alive.. something about retail's weeklys is boring in sense of the whole region doing the same thing at the same time..
---
Tbh it can't be that bad, i used to be the main kiter for a guild.
---
I absolutely disagree. The age of players hasn't really changed, it's not like there were less kids playing the game when I was a kid playing CS 1.5/1.6. The players weren't older nor more mature, they just weren't edgy wannabes.
---
I also disagree with the fact that Twitch is the reason for spreading the culture, but it has definitely helped.
---
You may have it better. If you're an orc diamond flask + hardiness wrecks in wpvp

I didn't play at all during the stress test, I'm guessing loads of racist and xenophobic nonsense in the general chat?

No one follows the number 1 rule of the internet, don't feed the trolls
---
Then you either pay or find a better deal.
---
Chances are if you have the Matt's a guildies will probably do it for free though a tip is always kind.
---
Am I crazy for thinking that if that one comment is true and people play for a year before they start dropping out that that would still be a huge success? Most games that come out today don't even maintain an audience for a whole year, let alone a remaster of a fifteen year old game with a paid subscription model.
---
I cant understand that, but people WANT the game to last forever and to do that you have to add flavor that doesnt affect the gameplay. If this was to be added i suggest phase six when everyone should be geared out and needing to find something to do.
---
Warm bodies are people in raid teams who don't matter but are required. It's very hard to keep enough people around to continue a full 40m roster. Some guilds can be picky and only take what they want but eventually most guilds will run into recruitment wall where they can't find what's perfect for them so they have to take anyone who wants to go. Doesn't matter what their DPS or HPS is because mathematically they just need someone doing the bare minimum to meet requirements. Right now in retail I run a guild and on good nights we have like 15 raiders which means I'm 5 people short from running mythic. I can't be picky at all I will literally take anyone with a pulse (a warm body) who wants to raid just so I can get my team into mythic.
---
She wants you!  Use Seduction then Lash of Pain
---
I thought he meant burning cool downs and or consumables
---
How the hell is that supposed to make sense when there‘s only 1 RP PvP server? I always play on that kind of server.
---
I wish there was a way to block or hide certain channels on YouTube
---
Sometimes you gotta ride the bull, am I right?
---
Perhaps, but that makes it even worse from the enemy point of view.    
---
     
---
Now not only did one of the enemy stop the world PvP by getting on his high level alt, but he also denied the zone to them, and their characters have no real way to fight back at all.
---
Yes, yes, not that hard and I don’t use macros
---
This post would make sense if it was 2-3 months after the classic actually released. Jerking off to it right now, when we have no idea how big the player retention will be in the future is kinda dumb.
---
The top guilds will always rush to down content as fast as possible but I'm wagering most of the people who stick with Classic will raid yes but it will take months before they are getting consistent Rag kills.
---
Make your own videos man. Not edits of other ones.
---
I think I’d be ok with them adding BC and Wotlk content if they didn’t raise the cap. Not sure how they’d handle naxx in that situation. Would the idea to be to just increase ilvl for BC content and then raise a bit more for WotLk? Or have the same raid tiers in place and just raid as people see fit? I could get behind something like this down the line. I’d really like to see a way of making old content not irrelevant without making everything scale.

I agree with all you said. Blizzard wants to completely avoid having dead servers and having to merge them down the line. Sure they could open 30 servers at launch, but what happens when 10 of those servers suffer a huge drop off?
---
There is a lot of doubt around here that a player drop off will happen. Truth is the first month people will come and check the game out. Then they hit that wall, whether it's leveling or gearing up at max, where they can't justify playing and decide to quit.
---
I don't think it will be a huge drop off, but even if it's only 20% you can't have that happen to the servers. The best option Blizz can do is gauge the interest and then offer free server transfers down the line.
---
Concecration is super expensive mana wise though
---
TBC had shit everything except the raids and class balance. all of the dungeons were just linear facerolls. there was no RPG left in the game. you might as well had just been playing a spreadsheet.
---
TBC needed:
---
- no flying mounts
---
- a world that wasn’t sparse an ugly 
---
- quests that weren’t all grouped at hubs
---
- not invalidate the entire existing game (it makes absolutely zero sense to replace the entire huge world of vanilla with a medium sized world of an expansion)
---
- dungeons like BRD and BRS
---
- no daily quests
---
- an aesthetic that wasn’t just weird amorphous abstract shit mashed together
---
- no epics not tied to actual accomplishments (kara should have only dropped blues)
---
What TBC did well:
---
- being a mage was finally fun. i could be full haste+arcane in raiding. i would have given anything to not have to be frost in vanilla. i hate frost. slowing something then running away from it is a pussy’s tactic. a mage should be able to look its target directly in the eyes as it runs towards it at full speed.
---
- 25 man raids: this is controversial, but i think 25 is better than 40. everyone had a much more defined role.
---
there is
---
The gif of this is incredible
---
As stated in post, and the graphic, data is from an official survey run by the moderators. It's as legitimate as one can find.
---
WoW's a very different case though, I think even a lot of the no changes crowd would expect them to release BC as a separate server to copy their characters onto while the time comes. I also happen to think Jagex ruined RS3 over the years far more than Blizzard ever ruined WoW over the years, but that's another story.
---
I was there on that fateful day, dropped Ozymandias multiple times, gods those Orcs were strong.
---
&gt; Then I’d spend hours on that splendid website perusing the race bios and class info trying to decide what to play before I could finally make my account.
---
Tale as old as time.
---
Yeah, this is funny but these are all still points that could very well be validated in 90 days...
---
Pretty much here to post this.  Rank 14 wasn't about skill, it was about putting in the time to sit in BGs.
---
Hey man, hope you get that image of specific female anime characters drawn with dicks you requested a couple months ago! Good luck!
---
Leveling Fury until you can switch to get MS is a perfectly viable way to go. Just to be clear though you should be 2H fury, don't dual wield.
---
For your second point it depends on how fast you want to go. If you want to get to 60 ASAP pick skinning only or no professions at all. If you want to gather gold/prep a crafting profession as you go then double gathering is fine.
---
You can have any brew you want, as long as it's a Dwarven Stout
---
Strangely enough nah it wasn't it was just random shit being spewed out and a lot of people just spamming Retail is better and trying to bait the shit out of people.
---
The worst part about it was no one was taking the bait but they just kept going.
---
I think people are fed up with retail so adding features from it into the classic is not going to be appreciated. I get your point though.. I think the current game and upcoming stages should keep us occupied for a while.. let's hope classic is successful enough to force Blizzard to make a new content for us.
---
It's almost as if that's what gives the game its flavour, but what do I know ;p
---
Wot
---
Dude, I went through ALL of the recommended vids that had "Asmongold" in their title and blocked them one by one. His ugly ass face still kept popping up. The dickriding is insane. I'm genuinely worried for our little zoomer friends out there. I think the brain damage has already gone too far and there's no coming back.
---
Duplicate post was removed
---
For sure, but will it stay high over the long term? Are the people who have already names reserved the 'serious' folks while those who arrive at launch are more casual and are less likely to stick with it in the long term? I dunno, just wondering.
---
yes like fishing or first aid
---
Not from LA unfortunately
---
I played all the way back then and I can trace literally every big issue the community has now to either a complaint they had or an issue they created lol
---
“Neck beard elitist” wants to make mythic difficulty dungeons with no gear in classic wow just to flex on others on the leaderboards with how sick his PvE prowess is in his maxed out gear ... sound familiar?
---
I literally want zero changes. I want it to remain true to what it was. You want to bastardize it. Make small changes because “it’s in everyone’s best interest, only neckbeards like classic the way it is” To which I say, stop projecting your nerd insecurities on other people and have an amazing day. 
---
This has devolved to name calling so I’m just going to block you, that will be the reason I will not reply further.
---
Are you bean the troll hunter? Anyways, good luck!
---
I'd say if being a MT for a raiding guild is the drug you're after, it'll be hard to play as a casual without a change of perspective.  And I think it would be easier to do that with a different class.
---
I played as a casual before, and plan to again.  What makes this game for me is the journey, made with a community of ppl that love this game as much as I do, making friends, getting a reputation as a decent player, overcoming challenges with my buddies.  If you're just heading back to Azeroth to be completionist and tick off some boxes that you never got to before... of course that's valid, but I also feel like it'd be very unfulfilling and not worth it for me personally.
---
That could also be because as I've gotten older, I've learned that... Getting stuff is cool.  But life is all about people.
---
Wink and go to the bathroom, good luck my friend.
---
That feeling when you buff somebody passing by and they don‘t buff you back.
---
It really hurts you in the stats 😥
---
Can horde level in duskwood?
---
I would think the best place would be on the server.  Plenty of guilds will be advertising on all the servers, find some people you enjoy playing with and it should grow organically from there.
---
Charity to support terrorism on other countries under the banner of the army. Good one.

It was pretty sweet for a lvl 15 raid!
---
How did you feel about the stun resist on orcs for warlock pvp? I am still pretty convinced I want to run male undead for warlock, solely because I want the dance lol. I need to look up the female one to see if it's different. It's been too long since I have played.
---
That's some impressive planning my dude.
---
To answer your first question no it wont improve the game I'm not looking to improve the game I'm thinking about adding interesting end game content so the game does't fizz out during phase six.
---
Yes I played classic when i was a child when my dad introduced it to me.
---
As for "people will need it" no they dont need it this is an option like I said the difficulty increase wont reward you with gear its for competition and leader boards many players will know exactly what items to get to min/max and builds to do most possible DPS output there is no use in doing this beside PvP and parsing in PvE. So I thought of this idea as a way to put skill &amp; team work to use. You cant always be doing 40 man raids the other 3 options you have are PvP, rep grinds, and farming. 
---
You dont need to grind the dungeon either this isnt something you do because you need to like I said it is an option for people who want competition and leader boards not a grind.
---
I really am disappointed that Blizzard is still using this outdated naming system. We have unique account names, so we should not have any restrictions on character names.
---
I will be playing a holy paladin.
---
Imo the big downside of paladins in classic is having to basically raid priest gear to effectively heal in the earlier phases.
---
For example in phase 1 there’s precious little plate healing gear.  So in pvp you’re often resorting to green plate random rolled gear for some slots, or accepting lower armor than you’d like.
---
Having said that, I do think pallies are the best overall healers for pvp and pve in all phases.  There’s just so much useful pally kit for both types of healing.
---
Everyone used addons in vanilla, even addons that you could never use today that automated decursing and healing. You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Yeah thanks. I hope you find more interesting things to do with your time than stalking on strangers profiles and intimidating them over the internet.
---
Oh yeah ofcourse but would also be cool to find some people in advance i think. Especially as dungeons are such good xp.
---
All the ones that automate the game and are borderline botting.
---
Yeah my Diablo one still works.. It's kind of unbelievable.
---
Well, yes, like being strong at dots, hots, or physical tanking, magical tanking, etc.... No need to distinguish this based on pve/pvp
---
Where else would you apply your gear ONLY PvP thats why you need other options braindead
---
Fucking incredible.
---
Guess we have another corpse run then.
---
How do add-ons mix with WoW Classic? Over the years I know many of the most popular became a base part of the game as Blizzard added those features, but I assume if we're back to Classic those will be mostly gone.
---
If so, is there a good source to re-download all of those vanilla WoW add-ons? I imagine it would be difficult to find some since they would have been updated as expansions came out, with the original versions possibly being lost.
---
Not always.
---
There are significant portions of the AoE leveling experience that can be done in instances alone.
---
I believe you can go something like 45-55 by just doing solo AoE runs in mara.
---
Plus you net some serious cash towards your epic mount.
---
That's the clue mate 
---
You have to do twice the work to break even. Where I could just go warrior with engi and be twice as good as the pala for the same effort palla puts in

Hunter and warrior LOL try a priest
---
Really? I was planning on playing rogue :(
---
Overpower her
---
Retail is boring I only log on to do the raid and dailies and it’s not that fun
---
Never mind. You can do it if you have two or accounts.
---
Not ideal, but can be done. Watch this guide, covers everything about shaman including tanking. Tanking part begins at 24:55.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhJ78qfgrK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhJ78qfgrK4)
---
It depends on how early you’re talking. It’s way less then ideal but as long as your group has good communication and smart pulling a shaman can possibly feasibly tank all the way up to the latter parts of scarlet monastery (the wing with Herod they can definitely do the graveyard). But honestly you could probably get away with a voidwalker or hunter bear pet tanking the dungeons at that early. If y’all really good you can even just run no tank and cc / kite everything before SM dungeons.
---
That’s why I say add it in phase six when people do have gear
---
I've been finding myself not able to enjoy any other games and such now that the anticipation is so much (league, overwatch, etc.) So I've been working out more and reading net+ cover to cover to vent my frustration and be productive, because I know DAMN WELL I won't after classic drops. Ugh. So close
---
Was this a promo booklet that came with the WC3 battle chest or something?
---
ART POSTS. let’s fuckin go baby burn this subreddit to the ground
---
You're right, it isn't, its just taking what would otherwise be visible to the entire community in trade/general chat, and puts it in a little private window.
---
I'd rather have it in the wide open for all to see and chime in on.
---
recently re-watched chronicle of the annoying quest. It was so unbelievably bad, but I couldn't tear myself away.
---
Jajajajajaja
---
Yea they are that’s why these trash people can only say no they have no other output besides no but they can’t think of the games long term
---
i don’t like timed runs. it adds stress, and removes an opportunity for RP elements. a raid should be an epic adventure with RP elements interspersed. but any sort “waste of time” will make timed runs impossible.
---
Yeah, I hope you're only referencing pve. A bad hunter in PvP is the most ineffective class by far. Someone who gets deadzone kited easily will lose to basically everyone. And no, it isn't just HERPADERP, FROST TRAP HURRRRRR. A rogue gets the jump on you, a warrior gets a charge and gets a hampstring off, and you'll be dead without a chance if you don't know how to react.
---
Well it's a good thing we're talking about it now just in case someone hadn't thought of doing this.
---
Some of the best memories I had in classic wow was the southshore vs tarren mill battles. World PvP was great in my experience
---
i wanted to stay on Herod originally, but if Blizz saw it and was like "shit's fucked yo" i figured it has to be bad enough that it's worth switching
---
Stalagg I think should have an okay population since I'm assuming it'll get quite a bit of the newer players who avoid massive Herod queues
---
It would be kind of neat for them to go back and add old style talents for all the new classes.. Wouldn't be that difficult, but then people would want them to fix hybrids.
---
If there isn't an advantage, why are people paying the extra $15 a month to do it?
---
I've already listed some advantages and so have you so I'm not going to do that again.
---
My argument is that it _should_be a rule. Football, to take your example, has had tons of rule changes to improve the spirit (and safety) of the game.
---
I believe multiboxing should be banned to protect the integrity of the game.
---
He wants to tank.
---
Yes, you can set up a sandbox environment using the [Arctium Sandbox](https://files.arctium.io/s/MK9CzaKbwtmeMTD?path=%2FApp)
---
There's a tutorial for setting it up [here](https://classicmaps.xyz/sandbox/) but you don't need to mess around with downloading the beta files now, so you can just use the legit classic folder and skip to the "Using the Arctium Sandbox project for the World of Warcraft Classic Beta client" section.
---
Someone's upset he is already home suffering and didn't get his care package.
---
I use a ton of macros on my druid in PvP. I practically need a macro to shift in to forms, and not out. So you can spam it. With the spellbatching on a PS you can bear form after you get sapped, or warrior charge stunned. It's not the same on every PS, and will be different on the actual classic server, so you may have to test it out. 
---
You can use macros to cast CCs in each form. Pounce in cat, bash in bear and roots in caster. So you keybind the one button. Or something that shifts you into bear to feral charge. 
---
I used one spec to PvP and raid heal on my druid. I'm actually worried about rolling mage because of the respect costs.
---
Fair enough. Personally I think a better thing to do is to launch new servers for people to start over at square 1.
---
It's really about the journey, not the goal. The friends you make along the way. The hardships you face and the bonds you forge. Classic has this magic I've yet to find in any other game to this day, but it's not found at the end of the line when I'm decked out in full T3, it's found on the way to get there :)
---
Found the commie.
---
Yup. The thing is tho, a lot if people REALLY wanna play on the super-high pop realm, so this won't be nearly as smooth as Blizzard would like.
---
Heck, it could even end with them splitting the realm in 3-4 pieces and you have to choose a new one(or get placed on one randomly).
---
The wow forums have a guild recruitment section.
---
#iMaGiNe
---
Just remember to care about how you do vs the other warlocks instead of how you do vs other classes. Vanilla is not balanced like retail where everyone does roughly the same damage.
---
Thought pickpocket farming wasnt good in classic?
---
Every server will be overpopulated when phase 2 drops.
---
If Oxhorn gets back into machinima that'd be fantastic.
---
Ddos attacks havent worked the last few expansion releases - won't work for this one.
---
Where’s the Org/TB line?
---
&gt;Our best times were literally hunting down Blackfyre.
---
I spent most of my time in EPL/WPL so I'd just fly over on my 60 and it was on.
---
I would never admit this in court, but Blackfyre was actually a good player, and stupidly geared. Every time I killed him 1v1 it was awesome. He'd eventually give up, or more of his friends would come, in which case it would turn into a massive Alliance VS Horde brawl.     
---
Except this 100% ignores my point.    
---
I said it's a shitty situation **for players who don't have a max level alt to get on.**    
---
And I happen to think that a level 30 zone should be a level 30 zone, not a "level 90 (30 + a 60 already leveled) zone.     
---
&gt;Hopefully people that thinks "it's not really PvP" for a stronger player to gank a weaker, lower level one has no place on a PvP server.     
---
This is ridiculous.  You are drawing a massive false dichotomy as if the only options are "play completely PvE" and "think it's totally cool for max level characters to gank in zones where they could, literally, kill an entire raid worth of zone appropriate level characters."     
---
It's possible to think world PvP is fun and awesome, and also think that it's not really PvP for children to go around stepping on ants.    
---
&gt;Part of Vanilla WoW is that time investment = more strength. It's not just level. If someone is in T3 and you're in pre-bis, you're going to get obliterated. That is Vanilla WoW.     
---
Somebody in fancy epics will almost always beat somebody wearing whatever gear they were in when they get 60.  That's true.  But they won't just run around effortlessly slaughtering huge numbers of them.  I hit 70 somewhat late in TBC, and while I was much less powerful in PvP fights than I was once I geared up, I wasn't completely useless.     
---
_____________________     
---
Let's go back to my off the top of my head brainstormed possible solution, and then play a little game:    
---
* Maybe something where overleved players are normalized to the zone. So a well geared 60 in a 30-35 zone would basically be fighting as a 35 twink with a wider variety of moves. Still stronger than the typical quester, but not just an untouchable god amongst men. (    
---
Pretend this was ALREADY how the game CURRENTLY worked.  What argument would you use to say we should abandon that system and switch to the current system where a 60 or 70 or whatever can just show up in a 30 zone and just effortlessly cut through pretty much any possible number of questers?
---
Another UO player, here. Shout out to my Baja peeps
---
Unfortunately for me that would be called desertion :p
---
Yikes
---
This is the best thing i've read all day
---
From what I have heard, the classic dev team is the only one at blizz that has high morale and has a lot of pride in what they are doing.
---
I bet the sheer amount of excitement and nervousness they might have overcomes the tiredness and stress from crunch time.
---
They already know what the tsunami of players hitting their servers at launch is going to look like, that has to a huge motivator knowing how excited everyone is for the game they are making.
---
This is from Blizzard's 2002 product catalog which I may have been included in the WC3 collector's edition.
---
I've never seen children so adorable and fierce at the same time. :3
---
Artist did an amazing job on this!
---
Ya no kidding. This is a relatively small launch of blizzard. There's going to be problems I'm sure, but this shouldn't be a big surprise.
---
Then he's a shit guild mate. The reason why guildies should give free crafts other than being a decent guildie, is that by being the guild crafter they get all the rare MC/AQ recipes from the guild and get money from fees from other players, money from a recipe that the guild got him.
---
Yea that is the end goal and with classic finally coming and staying with no new expansion you can imagine that people WILL get there and that is why I suggesting adding ideas that don’t affect the game itself but adding new things to do that lets people show their skill because if everyone is running around in T3 does it even matter anymore at that point it will just be about who is rank 14 PVE you can only flex world first and gear only matters when the challenge is still there
---
Are there nameplates in classic and can they show cast bars?
---
Lol "effective." Lol "competitive."
---
Prot is not a competitive tank. Ret is not a competitive dps. Holy is, however, a competitive healer.
---
If you have a choice between a subpar tank with blessings or a subpar dps with blessings or a good healer with blessings, which one do you want, if we consider equivalent competence? 
---
Right.
---
Level first aid and be smart about positioning. Bada bing bada boom warrior can go zoom zoom
---
It’s long and boring but stable gold/hr
---
Small price to pay to not be a filthy alliance scum.
---
no. hyperbalance makes the game boring. not everything needs to be fair.
---
You definitely need to read the info boxes on the right in the first panel too
---

Because unlike any other MMO these days, spending a fuck ton of time working towards your goals has a visible impact on your character.
---
-Hi i'm Thex, what's your name?
---
-Hi there i'm Thex! And my buddy here is Thex
---
Stalagg won’t be any better. The problem is too few servers in general.
---
Will the long questlines related to the silithids and hakkar be in the game at launch? I don't remember when the Hakkar one starts but I know the Silithid one starts in the barrens. I don't know if those quests were in at launch or they came in later when their respective raids were patched in.
---
Hunters *use* melee weps. That's the difference. A rogue won't touch that stat bow.
---
Shamans can tank early dungeons, i wouldnt try it on the lower end of each dungeon but enhancement spec does have some tanking talents and rockbiter weapon + earth shock generate good threat
---
Don't be so harsh 😉. It's in everyone's interest to keep the game going. People are disappointed what happened with wow so,as mentioned before, adding content from the "bad version" into the virgin version will leave all of us worried. Don't take the bad feedback personally. Bad feedback is better than non 🙂
---
Why not? Multiboxing is pay2win, and a lot of games abandon pay2win because it makes others quit the game from being owned by pay2winners.
---
Of the 4 DPS classes, warlock is pretty subpar until late BWL/AQ. Problem is that their T1 gear just isn't that great for DPS. Once ZG/BWL release and locks start grabbing more gear spell hit, crit, and +damage they can start really shining.
---
I mean when your class is so easy it became the farming not MVP you have to take the time to learn on your own cause the game sure isn't teaching you anything when you leveling with your face on the keyboard
---
Nah. Blizzard only had minor issues on legion and bfa launch. They can handle 3/4 million day one players from a technical standpoint.
---
That's why I'm rolling a holy priest.
---
Mage food / drink makes it a lot easier too.
---
Inaccurate... There will be 10x as many horde than Alliance
---
But at that point blizzard will have either announced that they will or won't do BC. Which in either case will allow people to quit if they don't add it. Or get ready for BC if they do. I don't see how adding something as arbitrary as harder dungeons for no other reason than leaderboards will add to the game. Personally I'm against it, but my main reason for that is because to me leaderboards are anti-rpg. I understand PvP has leaderboards and ranking but I have never been a hardcore PvP'er.
---
i doubt the dev team is in crunch like how much is there to develop
---
the server team may be in crunch testing and making plans for when all the servers catch on fire
---
the advertising / pr teams seem i think have the month off
---
they may be training a bunch of people to gm still
---
It’s not even bad feedback it’s just straight negativity. In my last paragraph I asked for feedback I only got hate messages
---
I’m the only one of my friends in this exact same boat. I’m glad you made this comment lol I was starting to feel kinda lonely trying (and failing) to get all my friends who play WoW to come to classic with me.
---
shhhhhg
---
-Die in game, die in RL
---
When do mages start using frostbolt over fireball when leveling as frost? Is wanding evert more beneficial than spell casting?
---
Damn bro, when we were kids we were such unapologetic retards
---
The reward was always worth it.
---
If it's just the two of you I can't imagine it would be faster.
---
This depends on a few factors. R10 gear for a Shadow Priest is great, if you're on an equivalent level as a Warlock you're a tad worse off. If you can get past that as a Warlock, you'll generally be better off. 
---
1v1 Shadow Priests do excellently from start to finish, but in 1vX they start to struggle a lot more than Warlocks due to less consistent CC and mostly their very limited mana pools. 
---
For BGs both will do well, but if you're really trying to optimize usually Shadow Priest doesn't see that much play as they offer little value over a Disc Priest who does all their strengths just as good if not better while filling an important support role. Shadow Priest damage, just like Warlock, will get hurt a ton by cleanses (Priests, Paladins) but a Warlock offers a lot more besides that and thus tends to see more BG play.
---
No wayyyyyyyy
---
Had a hunter roll need on a [Briarwood Reed](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12930) once and won it.
---
I fucking hate hunters.
---
Even currently... no one likes playing a healer because they don’t make stuff go boom. But healers keep the people who make stuff go boom alive... that’s why I play a healer. Kind of a self preservation thing
---
The said that medium server today are the size of full ones from back in the day you also have to think that not everyone has reserved names and will start playing later into launch.
---
I can wait and fish all day!
---
...until the bots arrive
---
You probably don’t need any name reserved on any server but that’s your choice.
---
1 tank, 2 healers, 7 mages.
---
We don't know really. It looks pretty nerfed from PSers judging from beta, but won't know exactly about what it's like at 60 until we see it.
---
We know.
---
😐
---
Probably because with all the pserver experience, it is more common knowledge these days that priests are the #1 healers. Back in vanilla, the ratios were different because there weren't as many min/maxers. That's my theory at least. 
---
Another thing to keep in mind about polls - most of those priests will never make it to 60.
---
Twitch app sucks and so does this video.
---
World of "Warcraft"  But I want to flash out the Warcraft part! eso is for you
---
You're doing God's work
---
&gt;- No bathroom breaks until VC is dead
---
Does this include piss jugs and poopsocks?
---
Why would blizzard want people to quit the game. Leaderboards add an element which playability will always be there just like PvP where you continue to grind to become the best. Once you obtain tier 3 maxed out professions you’ve technically beat the game that’s when you start competing
---
More, the racial is added to the stun resist chance everyone has which as far as i know is 5% so orc has 30% chance to resist stuns.
---
suffer well
---
When you get hit you are so close to mages it doesn't matter.  In real vanilla tier 1 and 2 were 8 debuffs. That isn't the case in Classic. 16 off the bat. Mages are stronger out of the gate raiding. They both suck compared to melee though until AQ to be honest and people need ranged, so don't worry about it.
---
Threat is much more of an issue horde side. Alliance is easy mode due to salvation. Without a good tank your guild is bad on horde. A traffic cone could tank on Alliance side.
---
So like 8-10 hours? Wow tough challenge
---
it breaks stealth
---
haha dae WoW
---
Except in wotlk many switched to alliance for every man for himself
---
I hope so too. We're at 700+- participants now. We're getting close to our target. Thank you so much for participating. Well done on almost finishing your MSc, I know it's quite harrowing as well.
---
New and interesting!
---
You should have expected hitting the wall of nochangers and antiretailers though...
---
[Darrowshire is great as well!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LcJXckn0Lo)

Realm forums were a huge amount of fun back in vanilla. When you're on a server where you recognize names an out-of-game chat becomes a place where you can talk some shit, high five each other, and generally chit chat about realm drama.
---
If you played vanilla and were involved in the goings-on of your server, you'd understand why realm discord is important.
---
Gonna bite the bullet here, GW2UI
---
If only for the reason to have a large indicator of my health *near* my character and not five zones away

You're wrong; only children play Horde

Only diapers are allowed. That way if you soil yourself you have to deal with the consequences.
---
no sleep till rag or your a fucking casual
---
It's a lot more than just names. Apocalypse Now makes the same point about colonialism in the context of the war in Vietnam, because it was more culturally relevant.
---
such cope
---
I'm staying the hell away from. VC but I will hit 30 before I go to bed
---
If you have the same rank frostbolt as fireball then frostball is superior. After you get full points into imp frostbolt then even with a higher rank on fireball it starts to not be worth using fireball at all.
---
Just like with amazon servers, normal use of wow servers, especially during a launch, is a ddos attack.  So it won’t work.
---
arkinventory
---
&gt; 10-20 multi-target is pretty much all I do and is Moonfire on 2 targets, restoration and Bear. I also rarely wrath. You want to absolutely maximize thorns use because it's damage to mana ratio is off the charts.
---
I feel like you're not going to be able to chain pull this way like you would with single pulling 10-20 because you'll take so much damage and if you're starting the pull with hot(s) and 2 moonfires and then shifting, then healing after the pull, you will be completely oom and not able to do the next pull without drinking. Would like to see it in action to be proved wrong, but having recently played a druid at low levels it just doesn't seem to quite add up. Unless you're only fighting mobs that are lower level than you.
---
I think you are just reading into what I'm saying. You don't know the cost, nor does anyone who isnt on the leadership team, so don't pretwns to know what you are talking about. I never said anything about NEW subs.
---
look how worried this guy is
---
I'm thinking different areas like duskwood next.   When I started I had no idea what I was doing and had the page soaked in green water haha.  
---
When I add in small people the quality watercolor stick figure talent will show.
---
No your point was to say that there is a them against us situation. The only thing you proved is your own prejudice. 
---
Did someone screw up? Sure. Does it mean it's because they hate you and classic?  Grow up man.
---
Lol wtf really?
---
It's pretty easy and straightforward as long as you wait till you're a good level higher than a warrior would be to tank it (and take a couple stacks of water).
---
Sounds like the scepter questline which isn't in the game before AQ in phase 5.
---
Yes I did but I expect more than five reasonable responses instead of people who act like a single brain cell
---
I think the concept of adding dungeon difficulty goes against the philosophy of Classic (at least from my point of view). Only the extremely top players care about leaderboards. I think while yes, it could be a way to add an element of teamwork, people would rather put that to other uses. I am looking forward (hopefully) to the friendliness and social aspect of the original game.
---
Hey all, so after I get the opportunity for more free time I plan to start up WOW again. I'm curious as to the resentment of balance druids. I was previously an alliance warlock and plan to roll horde tauren this go around in non-pvp. I would like to go balance druids but I'm curious how they played throughout vanilla back in the day. Could someone explain the cons of being a balance druid? I'm just curious as the quality of it leveling and endgame as balance.
---
Are chained flight paths in Classic WoW?  I can't remember when they added those.  In other words, if I want to fly from Crossroads to Azshara, do I just click the destination or do I need to manually select each leg from each flight master?
---
nobody here is suggesting automating the game.  virtually everyone so far is looking for quality of life bag sorters.
---
Why does JP have time to pound noobs in Azeroth?
---
it's gotta be exciting times for them. They'll be looking back at this for decades from now. Knowing how all the daily challenges they had to overcome to make this possible.
---
There is nameplates and addons can make them show cast bars. Though vanilla castbars aren't 100% accurate.
---
Ok? Not really sure what point you are trying to make.
---
Doesn't matter, on launch I reckon they'll all be full anyway, unless they add more.
---
It’s almost as if we’ve known this for days now. Oh wait.
---
Man, you'd have to be a pretty noxious pile of waste to find a toxic response to this post :p
---
I made toons on both servers
---
Oh wow I had totally forgotten about the dustwallow marsh transit
---
This is the most convincing deep fake yet
---
I'm looking into buying a new PC for my mom so she can get back into WoW and play Classic; she played Vanilla through Cataclysm and introduced me to the game when I was younger, but all she has at home is an older iMac that isn't compatible with the game anymore. I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations on what might be good to get her, preferably something under $600.
---
Tried to argue with me that it made his arcane shot better, and thus he needed it.
---
hardware limits and no software to push the commands to other boxes was the reason.
---
sub prices haven't changed in 15 years though, and you had to buy the expansions each time. multiboxers generate more revenue than 1 person (store purchases aside).
---
That’s fine but eventually something will need to be added that won’t happen for awhile but it will need to be done or it will die
---
woosh
---
i have 18k hours played in dota 2. let's assume 20% of that statistic was afking and queueing and make it 14k (580 days). i have bought four or five compendiums and 4 months of dota plus, resulting in like 60€/18000 hours. and that was by choice and for advanced QoL stuff, basically the game is entirely free. 
---
wow is 156€/year and regardless of how much i play. i'm a pretty tame vanilla player, i probably average around 10 hours a week, making it 156€/21 days. yeah, it doesn't cause an existential crisis, but it's definitely money. and i also get we don't want cosmetics to cover that cost because it ruins the game, but it's still hard to convince some of my friends to pay 13€ to try out a game they don't know, to play maybe 2-3 hours per week because that's how much we're able to spend together. 
---
and yeah, maybe that's not a real problem. but this game would have a significant increase in players if the monthly fee was 5€/$. because that's an amount you don't mind throwing out the window. also, what justifies the full original cost, when the games is already fully developed, aside from bug fixes?
---
&gt; just raid finder
---
I still get chills when "A Call To Arms" plays. Love the music by Jason Hayes.
---
You can always go back later to do those quests just for the rep.
---
Think it's all Humanoids but Ogres don't run away.
---
Someone close to the guild lead usually, because of material and time investment.  I wouldnt expect them to be compensated, being fed materials and having rare recipies is enough in my opinion because you can turn a profit with those.
---
Because classic runs of legion client, the addons are basically retail addons slightly twisted so they work on classic. The old 1.12 addons do not work. You can find lots of addons on https://willitclassic.com/  &amp; https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=1738749986%3A67408&amp;filter-sort=4
---
Wich only means that "one" can't find any legitimate data at all at this moment. Moderators of what? Subreddit?  Congratulation, you have a legitimate statistic of users of this subreddit. Not classic wow players. Subreddit for enthusiasts can only provide distorted and misrepresented picture since it represent only a specific fraction of players. I'm not saying actual statistic will be drastically different. But it will be diffirent. And because of that your post is misleading.
---
   I feel like this is a newer player thing. Having leveled to max on all the xpacs on both factions, I enjoy the lore for both.
---
I have a whole sprint's worth of work to finish in half a sprint, so I'm not too worried about how fast this week is gonna go lol
---
There are 4 servers listed as Full now. So we're all in the same boat AND the people who plan to return who are not subbed haven't even joined the mix.
---
most exaggerated statement of the day goes to
---
Warlocks are bottom tier dps early on but move quickly up the ranks once ZG and AQ are out. 
---
Rogues are top tier dps throughout the entire game. 
---
The nice thing about Warlock is that their cookie cutter pve spec is very good in pvp so you don’t have to respec between raiding. Rogues don’t have this benefit because they need Subtlety talents to be effective in pvp.
---
Making me nervous about leveling a rouge, is that hard?
---
Anywhere is a zone connection from Felwood to Darkshore if you're brave enough
---
min/maxers switch professions to maximize gold or for certain BiS BOP pieces that require 300 skill, but of course you dont have to.
---
Really? How could they not be accurate?
---
I loved naked dueling warriors using Rank 1 frostbolt on my frost mage.  You could feel the rage build in them when you perfectly deadzone kite them and they never get to touch you.  Made it even better that it took like 10 minutes to beat them.
---
I never said Blizzard will want people to quit the game. No game company wants users to quit. But if they don't continue to BC they will almost certainly have another expansion by then for players to go back to. I think adding leaderboards if they add content is not the right choice.
---
Yep, Antifa has made it to r/classicwow
---
12’ish.  Get a few talent points to reduce the cast time and you’re ready.  Then talents to improve the snare effect and duration and it gets legit.  
---
Wanding as a mage is what you do for OOM emergencies.
---
This looks like the Defence against the Dark Arts Challenge in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on PS2
---
I think people understand this fine. It's long term population people are concerned about.
---
Stalagg will be so, so much better
---
why especially for horde?
---
4 servers listed as Full now. They're being stubborn not releasing enough then will be acting surprised when it causes problems.
---
Gotta SuPpOrT tHe FrEeDoM FiGhTeRs!!11
---
I don't know if they stuck with it, but the last official word was 2 hours for drops in raids. I'm not sure if that extends to UBRS.
---
I'd hate seeing -myaccountname after my character name and others.  This has bugged me in other games, so I'm happy with it lol
---
Yeah, you are wrong. RMT can be validated by chat logs. Here's the blue post about how she broke code of conduct:
---
 https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/65258-mia-rose-adult-film-star-banned-from-wow/
---
Blizzard even added an npc called Mia the Rose. Nobody at Blizzard plotted her ban for doing porn, put down the tinfoil hate dude.

[https://youtu.be/kzbGUDKCajk](Jordan Peterson - Are video games like World of Warcraft bad for you?)
---
A medium realm today already has more players than the most populated realm in vanilla. I would assume most of these realms will be packed and Blizz will have to release a few more after launch.
---
I fuckin' love a Steely cause I'm a goddamn degen.
---
Contrary to the answers given.  I mean stuff they usually would save for raiding like Manual crowd pummeler or  sappers.
---
Honestly don't listen to 90% of the plebs here. They have no clue to the potential of a lot of stuff because they're stuck on patch 1.8 if they ever played vanilla.
---
Porting old code over to a new game engines creates all kinds of unforseenable bugs in the new game version. I promise you, the dev teams work isn't done, not by a long shot.
---
That’s a idea I can get behind thank you for your reasonable criticism
---
I'm Holy my man 😎
---
&gt;They can ban people for that??  
---
&gt;The only time I had been banned were for obvious exploiting of game mechanics, or world exploring.
---
probly said the gamer word
---
What's the matter? Just play Rogue ;)
---
Is it really that bad? I never did rogue, let alone really played classic a lot outside of a few private servers. Now you've got me worried.
---
The only information you get in classic about spells is in the combat log. So the addon takes the combat log and sees the enemy is casting fireball. It does not know what rank(and thus speed) or if the player stopped his cast.

Theyre chained, it was pretty late, like 1.10 i think.

I can swear i remember having to take multiple flight paths when going to AQ
---
Hey guys, Skarm here.
---
True but not one as harrowing as the Barrow Den from what I remember. Although the kul tiran stronghold in Durotar can be a real pain it isn't as winding and confusing
---
Might be normal for teenagers but it's not normal for adults.
---
Yep, bgs aren't out till phase 3, but they will be cross realm as in 1.12
---
I mean if you get the new forms of the druids stuff, the skeletons of the rigs would have to change, and a lot of people dont like the new skeletons. I remember when they updated the models of the playable characters I hated it. at first there was an option to use the old textures, but the actual skeletons were changed, so it wasnt the same. 
---
I get where you are coming from but its not really an objectively better change. I do agree that nochanges is not sustainable though.
---
15$/month is worth what it can get you, ie acting as if it's chump change is a strawman.
---
I don’t remember the little dude being so ripped...
---
That being said, I don't know what kind of content would be reasonable to add. I like the idea of it preserved as it was like a relic from a past time.
---
&gt; Small price to pay to not be a filthy alliance scum.
---
and then not have any alliance scum to pvp, defeating the whole point in pvp servers, gj buddy on your new pve server.
---
Maybe more like Mage's Conjure Water. It's not a profession you skill up by making poisons. Lockpicking is closer to being a secondary prof.
---
a lot of people paid "7.50" to play the stress tests
---
Voidm's video had a Mars Volta track 'Cicatriz ESP' on it. Automatic upvote.
---
It don’t mater people see paladin flair and think your a retadin.
---
I am having a good day, reading stupid posts like this about a retail baby wanting to bring their dumb ideas to this game.
---
I would very much like to level as a warrior in a proper group, I have 10 days off. I am quite experienced. Please hit me up if you and your group are dedicated.
---
Yeah it seems like LB is the way to go. I can't think of a case when Bite might be preferred. I guess against a super-low armor mob?
---
Also, don't we still have to do that in retail WoW? Isn't that like, the entire game?
---
Thank you, I have made a note of this in the post! For any further infographics, I shall include a note on the image itself.
---
it's middle of the pack, a good bit faster and easier than warrior / paladin. Keeping your weapons upgraded is the most important thing.
---
Never played rogue in vanilla. What’s the go to leveling/pve spec and can it be used for world pvp too?
---
well we just dont know where they are internally blizz like to polish products they may have prob been working out those bugs since the blizzcon where they showed it off.
---
classic was likley ready to ship quite a while ago though you are prob right they may be working hard looking for bugs and exploits
---
I moved to a PVE server.
---
Someone didn’t get their name

West virginia
---
so I quit playing when cataclysm got me down. and I did come back, but it's just not the same. there were some really cool quests out there. I enjoyed attunement quest progression night. I liked climbing that big mountain in the barrens to get the wailing caverns quests. I liked the epic journey to find Nat Pagle. I wish the dungeons hadn't changed.
---
yes it took longer to level to 60. but I had a fantastic time with my friends. the achievements meant more. coming up with silly LFG ads in /1 was fun too.
---
I'd imagine war is much worse for the side that is losing, yes
---
That level 60 didnt drop out of the sky. He went through the gauntlet he has now become.
---
Nothing wrong with a man knowing what he likes
---
I don’t like retail for one and it’s an idea that is a way to persevere wow so it last longer because it will die
---
Thank you internet explorer.
---
Because windfury totem has no effect on druid animal forms.
---
Yeah guys let's trust current Blizzard, what could possibly go wrong?
---
Pretty decent like 8 hours or so

But dont tell my mom :'D
---
First off, it isnt a "fictional argument", its non-fiction, because it fucking exists.  Youre taking bits and pieces of what i say and misconstruing them, and using a single contradiction to counter my broad statement about paying monthly for long-term enjoyment vs paying over and over for games with shorter appeal, GENERALLY. Jesus christ this sub is so jam-packed with cynics.
---
This is a list of games by someone who buys Funko Pop figurines and calls themselves a gamer.
---
"good farmers" who told you that lie?
---
Yada yada, projecting, reflection, misery, yada yada.
---
Your post was long, scattered, never made a point.... and show ZERO digestion of the MMO genre as a whole....
---
As in you NEVER showed a single hit that your played a game for a long period of time, gained some knowledge from it and now with that knowledge you think this and that.
---
You quite literally just talked without a purpose, then I told you as much. If you have not noticed, reddit is for discussion, so if you did not design your post in a way to spur discussion then the response I gave should make sense.
---
I do not care what you think, enjoy, believe, hate or worship, I only wish to have discussion with people who continue to gain insight from their experience..... You showed zero and got a response that is deserving of such.
---
Nothing more, nothing less. You have no value as a conversationalist.
---
be able to get in ( herod)
---
hit level 10
---
Full balance is pretty bad at everything. 
---
Leveling is too mana dependent and your dps is lower than feral, making it much, much slower to level.
---
Endgame DPS is extremely low, not enough mana or regen.
---
Engame PvP is also very bad as youre largely reduced to Moonfire kiting and other casters will just outdps you.
---
As to how they were treated in vanilla, the better guilds knew they were useless, the middling and worse guilds thought that the aura might make them worthwhile and they were occasionally found raiding
---
No... no you wont.
---
Because the doublesided tape keeps falling off on the top :'(
---
I've played WoW on and off over the years, and I've only ever played PvP servers because that's what my friends always played on. However, I've found World PvP to be more of a nuisance than a feature that adds a fun dynamic to the game. The biggest reason being that players can attack each other regardless of the level difference between them.
---
When I encounter enemy players of similar level, it becomes a tense moment of whether or not we fight, who will initiate the fight (unless one side decides to ambush the other), and if so then who will come out alive afterwards. Getting ambushed isn't enjoyable by any means, but if it's by a similar level player and I at least have a fighting chance then it's reasonable to encounter. However, when I come across an enemy player that's 40 levels higher than me and they decide to one-shot me and continue on their way, how does that translate into fun? There's no challenge or reward for the higher level player, and there's **literally nothing** the lower level player can do to defend themselves. You just have to accept your fate and die for no reason other than because somebody wanted to make another player's game experience worse. If that's their idea of fun, then maybe they have self-esteem issues or a power complex, I don't know.
---
Isn't the whole point of the honor system to, you know, be honorable? It must take a lot of balls to successfully kill an enemy player that poses zero threat and can't do anything to oppose you. While I enjoy the idea World PvP and the unique moments that come from certain encounters, high-level players who kill low-level players with no remorse like this don't strike me as powerful, intimidating, or strong. Instead it just comes across as arrogant and self-absorbed that they feel the need to kill players that can't fight back in order to get their kicks.
---
It's because of these experiences that I'm more than likely going to be rolling on a PvE server for Classic, since I don't want my gameplay to be dictated by people who have played much longer than me and decide to kill low-level players just because they can. World PvP at 60 would be better since max level characters have a more even playing field, but trying to get there and dealing with constant ganks along the way isn't exactly my idea of a fun game experience.
---
I don't know if it's a change that everyone would welcome, but I would gladly play on PvP servers if there was a green-red level range for initiating fights with other players, OR if killing an enemy player with a grey level results in a significant loss of honor points. I get the whole idea of two factions being at war, but even intentionally killing civilians is considered a war crime in real life. I know that players aren't "civilians", but when the level range is so great that the weaker one is no threat and can't protect themselves at all, what is the difference at that point?
---
The energy drinks, and snacks. First few days are going to be sleepless lol
---
Hey wait a minute there buster!!!
---
💁
---
It's def not as good gph as DMN trib runs or some other things, but you def can get at least 40gph, and most of it doesn't require much thinking and is easy. It's a great way to farm when you're only half focussing on the game
---
HOTW is a very versatile spec, it’s great for pvp and raid healing.
---
Thank you so much! So just wanted when out of mana or to finish a low health mob off?
---
Because it is incredibly rewarding. You are reminded of future goals, be it a quest reward, spell, talent, and it is never-ending. Simultaneously, there's a lot of carrot-on-a-stick, you're not guaranteed gear, so if you want something you have to do it a lot - rep grinds for example.
---
Leveling spec is definitely combat. It can do wpvp but not well.
---
I think Hunters, Mages, Warlocks, and Druids all have a spec you can do both PvE and PvE in. They wont always be the most optimal spec but in all honesty, who cares.
---
Really love the UD female run myself. It's so lithe and snappy. That said, most of the new animations look positively horrid :0
---
Hunter it is!
---
Lol. I'm one of the few that would be OK with very minor changes, but dear God, NOT mythic+. Don't bring that hell hole anywhere near classic.
---
So did balance not really become a thing until WOTLK? I remember seeing a lot of them raiding during that time. So essentially balance lacks in the fact that they go OOM 24/7?
---
Handle it!
---
Is there only going to be an auction house in Ironforge?
---
What is this alliance propaganda?
---
Combat and yes but its not ideal for pvp, you have better talent options for pvp, even in combat spec.
---
Leveling is straight up combat with riposte and then finishing in assassination. Raiding spec is the same but without the riposte. And no it's garbage in world pvp, it can work while leveling, but at 60 you pretty much have to respec to do pvp.
---
What do you take with skinning if people say avoid other gathering professions? Just nothing?
---
Lololololololol. That’s all you deserve.
---
22ish hours it's not hard to stay up that long.
---
Out of curiosity: why? To have a professions alt?
---
Pirates took rummed water to sea to prevent mold and other bad shit growing in the barrels and stops the water from going to shit with a lil bitta orange to stop scurvy so theres a good chance
---
Wow, like using their class abilities? That's hardcore man.
---
It is a minor change it adds nothing but competition
---
I think we should be careful about mocking someone in a position like his, a lot of power over the fate of the world (...warcraft).
---
 *"Sometimes, we are literally watching. Sometimes, you could be fighting a dragon, and there could be an invisible gnome flying in mid-air, overhead, looking down at you. ... Gnomes.

---
Buddy and I did. Lost my seinfeld names but got electrocute for shaman and wheels for hunter
---
Wow classic is a great mmorpg.  The game.
---
Yea! I've got the Friday and monday of labor day off instead.
---
This is not true at all. If thats the way your guild did things, they were gimping some of their best FPS.
---
Very well said. Yet a hard truth. 
---
What server will you be joining if you don’t mind my asking?
---
It will fracture the community. It’s bad for the social fabric. Devs should break it 100%
---
the HOTW spec discussed above is either 0 balance or 1 balance for nature's grasp which is very helpful in pvp. But if you want a 100% optimal tank/cat dps spec, you would be going at least 11 into balance.
---
On the battle net window, it shows a link to posting on the forums for trying to find old friends. Here's my problem. I know I played on the server Drenden. But I don't see it posted anywhere on there.
---
If you're far ahead of the zer you kinda have to, as the Tribal LW quest (that unlocks Wolfshead craft) requires level 40. On the other hand, if you expect to be closer to the zerg, its realistic to just buy it off someone.
---
Yes but be careful. Depending on your class, this could be difficult.
---
For example, for Shaman, Tauren Shaman get different quests for their first totem (level 4) than Orcs and Trolls. For Hunter, you get a specific quest at level 10 that will require you to return to your original starting zone.
---
And on top of that, if you pick something like Undead Priest, and make your way to the Barrens, it could get very annoying to find things like Class Trainers, and being forced to return to Orgrimmar for your skills over and over.
---
Do a little bit of research on your class and be aware of these limitations. That and the fact you have to run to your friend's starting zone could take a long time.
---
She certainly has the social skills one expects from a dirty horde player.
---

---
Best comment here. Everyone needs to upvote this shit right now.
---
Play the AH and become the monopoly man.
---
&gt; Blizzard streamlined out all of these “pain points,” but in doing so,  took away the character of the game.  So you have an utterly convenient  “game” completely lacking in anything that makes it interesting.
---
So your argument is that "pain points" make the game interesting?
---
I don't understand.  
---
Of your pain points, 8 of those things were either time-wasters (finding a dungeon group, flying, raiding), tedious grinds (leveling and professions), or stupid mechanics which didn't contribute to anyone having any fun (bullets, shards, slow-travel/late mounts).
---
Certainly I can agree that the simplification of class combat mechanics was painful and made the game less interesting.
---
I leveled a holy priest and resto druid in classic. It's why I'm dual boxing this time around. I could never do that grind again but I still want to be a pure healer.
---
Not to mention it saves you a shitton of money. Unlike later expansions most classes really need to eat and/or drink on a regular basis. Some classes need to do it after practically every encounter (warrior being a painful example) That means you go through a whole lot of food and drink, which is actually really resource intensive. Money as a whole is harder to come by in classic (not being able to buy all your skills because it's too expensive for example), and relative to the money that's available to you as a player buying food and drink costs a lot. Mage have the added benefit that they don't need to pump resources into this, which can actually save you a lot of gold by the time you hit 40 and have to buy your mount.
---
Priest.  If your willing to be healer.
---
Priest aren't any better than shamans and paladins, but there's definitely less druids. Also keep in mind when looking at polls to x2 the paladin/shaman as they can obviously only be played on 1 faction.
---
New player who intends to play Classic with a group of friends who are experienced. Planning to watch some guides over the next few days. Was wondering what classes I should consider as a first timer?
---
I think you have no idea what crunch even means, kid!
---
Or when flat on your back.
---
This is not a pserver launch bro.
---
You don't get dual welding until level 10. One hand stabs and sinister strike for 9 levels, weeee!
---
My first 60 was a rogue, and levelling takes forever. You're squishy, mobs are close together most of the time, sap removes you from stealth, you won't be able to solo any elite quests.
---
Still, rogue is fun and if you level lockpicking, you can get in to a lot of groups since you don't need atunement keys.
---
I understand that you have long reached your intellectual limit, I wish you a good one.
---
So I guess my question is this: Is it possible to implement a system that prevents/mitigates completely unfair ganking for World PvP (eg. Lv 60 killing Lv 20) while still maintaining the proper sense of danger and conflict with other players when exploring Azeroth?
---
I was sure that Death Knights came in WOTLK, guess i was wrong.
---
That is 22 flawless hours. Not taking into consideration actually logging in. Starting zones absolutley flooded with people. Fighting to tag mobs. Take a screenshot of 22 hours played and level 30 and ill gift you a month of wow.
---
You realize the amount of people that Multibox in WoW is in the single digit percentile right? They are so rare, they have no effect on anyone.
---
Most multiboxers are not good at the game at all, which is why they multibox. Which means they are easy to exploit and kill, troll, etc.
---
Your right-click reports will not do anything. There is no realm of possibility of it being removed or made illegal.
---
I am jumping.
---
youtube.com/results?search_query=Priest+classic+lashers
---
Monkeynews speed runs are definitely worth checking out for warrior.
---
&gt; Except this 100% ignores my point. I said it's a shitty situation for players who don't have a max level alt to get on.
---
And being one shot by full T3 is a shitty situation for players who don't have an alt with better than pre-bis.
---
Vanilla WoW is not about equity. More time + more social coordination = more power.
---
You *will* get abused by players stronger than you, whether it's because of higher level or better gear, and there *will* be times when there's nothing you can do about it.
---
If you're not able to tolerate this, you can roll on a PvE server and never deal with that dynamic, as many players choose to do.
---
If you post really juicy information it will get downvoted because people like to keep their secrets. Just like the vendor that sells Felcloth for 40s each in Winterspring (nobody will tell you that and you wont see a post about it)
---
There's a AH in every capital city and they are all linked (but not cross faction ofc).
---
Does this only work in the raid, or if you're in a raid group (not actively doing a raid, say BRD for whatever reason)
---
if you are up for anything, ask your experienced friends what benefits the group the most
---
I fully support this, I have no idea what to do til launch.
---
Is the pvp spec assass? Just wondering what the oppressive build rogues went while leveling.
---
I think it’s a rather bit silly to say this about realm discords, especially when you have people like Capt on the Whitemane discord making sure rules are enforced, like having different rooms for different subjects. If you don’t want to be told how to level, don’t go in #leveling. Most people admit they’ll use in game chat anyways, this is just a nice way to build a realm culture before the game comes out. I do agree that anyone advertising RMT should be banned and shunned though.
---
I like how you downvoted me. But, yes, key binding wasn't in the game until BC. And addons didn't exist either to simulate key binds.
---
im pretty sure an undead mage would be closer to an orc mage than a orc warlock
---
Is this a serious question/comparison?
---
WotF counters the main CC ability of 2 of the classes that counter mages the hardest.  Berserking won't do jack to help you live against those classes.
---
Yes it is possible. I made a shaman tank during vanilla and did up to sfk before I gave up. Lack of aoe makes adds hard and having your only threat generator on a CD sucks.
---
I'll try! I mean I won't say i can guarantee 22 hours but that's the average time for the route I am taking. Hopefully the crowds dont complicate it too much.
---
It's laced with crack
---
Whatever you find interesting. There's no bad classes to start out with, only bad ones are those you don't enjoy. Look at some gameplay footage from various classes, and listen to some of the Pro/con discussion on youtube, and just pick what interests you.
---
Thats a good question and I am not sure off the top of my head.
---
Warlocks op
---
No need for xtra hard and long dongeons+, people find other ways to entertain themselves. Like speedruns. Mc in under 20 minutos, ombre. There's nothing to add. 
---
Except tbc. God, I miss tbc.
---
Even still... long hours are nothing new to some of us. IRL shit will stop me before sleep tho
---
Afaik it's a very good tip for most classes. Learned that from this guy:  [https://www.youtube.com/user/SpacedNeedle](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpacedNeedle)
---
Don't know why you are being downvoted. I mean there is a point at which cost will offset enjoyment (specifically for me WH40k price increases), but for me to be able to play classic and have it NOT turn into another BFA, I would be tempted to shell out some cash elsewhere. Charge for major content patches at a base amount say 20 bucks or somethings for stuff that goes on past classic if they decide to go that direction, maybe add another 1-2 a month onto the sub or having a sliding monthly subscrip scale like FFXIV does. I understand that servers have cost and dev teams have cost, but they just need to be able to show that the costs justify the ask from the consumer.
---
Is it possible to go into the file folder and somehow set up some macros before release?
---
While i enjoy classic and i'll play it, this kind of post suit better once we prove them wrong.
---
A pvp spec most likely. Although a pure pve spec isn't all bad for sneaking up to a guy and unleashing hell.
---
Sorry to bother you friend but it seems your keyboard is broken. It has added a 0 at the end of your 2 by mistake :p

Hey dude. Ex-Field Marshal warrior here. I'd rather be immune to cc than have haste. Same reason I rolled a gnome warrior for escape artist so I could close down mages who frost nova'd me etc. Haste won't do nothing if you're cc'd for the duration of your racial so wotf helps with that for sure

They are able to, they just don't have to.
---
This is sadly very true. Retail is much more difficult both mechanically and in execution than vanilla ever was or classic will be. However it also has a much more forgiving difficulty curve, that is ruined by a out of whack reward system.
---
The skill floor for classic/vanilla is much higher, while the skill ceiling is much lower.
---
Basically it's harder to be "just ok" in classic/vanilla, but much more difficult to perform at the highest level in retail.
---
I'm a firm believer that people want a higher skill floor for the game, as shown by the Classic movement. I just wish we could also maintain the higher skill ceiling that retail has.
---
TL:DR - Retail is harder at the high end, but way too easy to at the low end.
---
Nah
---
Hes the president of blizzard now
---
It really depends on a few factors IMO.
---
What type of server are you rolling on (PvP/PvE)?
---
Which faction are you playing (Horde/Alliance)?
---
Have you played an MMO before?
---
What role would you primarily prefer to play (Tanking/Healing/Dealing Damage)?
---
Have you read through the classes and gotten a sense of what sounds cool?
---
Those answers might help narrow it down a bit. Hunters and Warlocks and both very easily started classes, but since you are playing with a group it comes down to what you think you’ll enjoy more.
---
I made my own youtube playlist by going through other lists, picking out the songs I remember and liked the most.  
---
Google is your friend here.
---
Before posting a comment, kindly take a look at our rules a few inches that way --------&gt;
---
who cares i am working crunch too ffs
---
Lol, you sound like a Blizzard fanboy that would believe anything they say.
---
Hell yeah. Back in the shit.
---
1 hour gonna be spent in que no matter what server you pick and then by the time you hit level 7 you’ll see the text “server restart in 15 minutes” followed by a blue forum post with “we’re rolling out a hotfix to optimize the servers. This will be short lived however because after you relog into an hour que you’ll play for two more hours until you see “server restart in 15 minutes”
---
Standard...
---
Almost all rogues level in combat, it seems oppressive to every other class when they gank you because they can be tough to deal with without some practice, i mean, rogues were made for killing after all. Plus stealth is a bitch if you dont have aoe to pull them out.
---
I read that with an N in it.
---
Aye, the hunter will be using that strikers mark for about two weeks, the rogue will never use it but also never replace it.
---
Hunter gear amirite?
---
I've always looked at it as the ingame map not being correctly to scale and the distance between continents and islands much larger then it shows.
---
Or reddit for that matter lol.
---
Got 6 cases of Soylent and a case of Rockstar.
---
Lvl 5 for enchanting mate.
---
ST is a bitch. But super awesome lorewise and the journey is fun
---
Just do it in sections, a full BRD run is something everyone should do once and probably never again imo.
---
And don't suck Blizzard dick to hard. Yeah, thanks for listening and releasing this game again after a decade of begging, but:
---
Don't dally about rolling back phasing.
---
And probably remove lee-way.
---
I reckon it will take you that to get out of the starting zone :p
---
It’s depressing knowing now how undervalued and underplayed GMs are
---
Just because they are rare doesn't mean they can't effect anyone. And we don't know how common multiboxers are in classic. There's always a realm of possibility for practically anything.  I know it's unlikely things will change, but I'll fight for whats right regardless.
---
Sounds fair! I'd probably have done the same. Heck I remember during the summer spending days at my best friend's house and playing all night until his mom got up for work in the morning and then fake going sleep so she wouldn't get mad at us. Then actually go to sleep, wake up at 1:00pm and do it again. The life of a teenager...
---
Actually quite some music I still listen to today comes from PvP videos.
---
Without the awesome taste of thise classic PvPers I probably wouldn't have heard of Soil, Tool, In Flames or Aphex Twin. It has been a grand time.
---
This is only feeding my decision to gank every horde i see regardless of level.
---
First realistic response in this thread haha.
---
Wholly/Grail for quest tracking.
---
True, but we can't get Trex in classic.
---
ok, thats what i thought but was just confused by the start of the vid
---
NO CHANGES
---
Child NPCs are unable to be attacked as a general rule
---
Alas, no shaman :(
---
I still don't want it at all, and can guarantee nobody else would. I've hated every change they brought to retail over the years, but mythic+ being at the top of the list
---
I don't want to see super optimized mythic+ groups giving people the impression that you can ONLY play the top specs. It always happens. The hardcore mythic+ groups don't take Ele shams, Ferals, and other specs in their speed 5 man runs, so now it eventually becomes the norm in the regular runs. Hard pass
---
Really struggling to pick a race for my hunter, any suggestions for each faction? 
---
It's my first time playing classic and wow (other than a bit of private servers), so I'm planning to do a bit of everything and will be running on a PvP server.
---
dark mode
---
Hunters will chime in that they have to aim shot and multi shot in between auto attacks.
---
It's technically more complex than pressing 1 for shadow bolt or frost bolt. But so is pulling your pants down to shit instead of letting it go in your pants I guess. 
---
In the end it doesn't even fucking matter because they scale poorly so the difference between their rotation and afking is irrelevant anyway
---
It was a really good fight with coordination required, unique mechanics and all sorts of stuff going on!
---
I was the warlock tank in my guild for that one.
---
Thanks for assuming I guess? If you think about it the same guy that upvoted me probably downvoted you. I didnt know, and it seemed incredulous to me. I cant find anything online confirming what you said but I'm not saying you're wrong. Check your insecurity tho fr

Same here, I played on Madoran in TBC but I don't see it listed. I know it was not an original realm but I don't see why they wouldn't include the ones they released after the game launched...?

I know that's not how things worked in the past. When I said "new server", I meant a brand new server yet to be played by anyone. It's just an idea, as I said in the first sentence. I don't expect them to do it, but it would be a way to sidestep the "I don't want to lose my cool name" problem.
---
Bring it on. I don’t plan on playing the first two days anyway.
---
We had to worry about arrows and stuff.  And food!  ANd sometimes we'd auto attack, just because our pet was slow dps.
---
Yes. This is all of them in one movie 😁
---
Why are you asking rank 14s? Ranks in vanilla had little to do with skill and everything to do with time investment.
---
Hate to be that guy but wasn't this posted already but the top panel was different
---
You don’t get it. Let’s sink time and effort into something fuckin useless nobody will want anyway.
---
Current games try to use psychological findings from rat experiments to turn games into “skinner traps” that addict players. Fortunately, we aren’t rats, and this sort of reward structure quickly exhausts us. The developers of Vanilla regularly play tested the game to make sure it was fun and delivered hits of dopamine at intervals that didn’t wear you out, but came at just the right time. They also added rewards that were more intrinsic. As your skill increased you felt better. The game was designed to encourage interaction, which can be extremely rewarding. The game was designed to sometimes cause personal growth which is the most addictive experience you can have. Watch some Kevin Jordan to learn more
---
Seconding this.  Great to see ps2 even mentioned.  Also, it's free!
---
yeah what was he smoking

Glad I got my characters on mankrik then. I'd like to avoid the swarm of streamer fans.

if your an undead priest questing in silverpine wouldnt you still need to return to UC to train anyways?
---
My main from 04-09 was a pally, then I switched to DK from then until present. My paladin had been faction changed a few times in his life, the DK has always been human.
---
Anywho this time around, I’m looking at being a warrior. I want to be human for looks, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to be dwarf.
---
Switching back and forth would cost a lot of mana and interrupt your mana regen.
---
200 hours remaining, 8 days left, let's say we sleep an average of 8 hours a day.

200 - (8\*8) = 136 hours remaining!

So upset that we refuse to play with them.

It’s deffo been asked a million times but how viable actually is Druid for both melee dps and tanking? Is it just more effort for the same results as other classes or is it statistically worse? I really want to play a Druid in classic (as well as a holy pala that I plan to level with friends) and I don’t want my time investment to be wasted if I’m going to struggle to get stuff done because of my class. Can someone reassure me and tell me it’s all going to be ok please ❤️

I’ve downvoted you because you told me too

Way back in the day arcane shot did benefit from spell damage. I remember making a pvp suit with +sp and two shotting clothies lol
