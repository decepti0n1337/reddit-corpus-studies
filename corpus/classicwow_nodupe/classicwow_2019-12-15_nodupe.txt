I mean rank14 never meant you were good at pvp, it just meant you played 16 hours a day or more for months.

TL DR

I ninja‚Äôd a BL from someone by pulling mobs, dying/grave running and getting the BL while Paladin was busy dealing with mobs.
---
I also disagree with that man, 60 is the most fun in the game. Nothing like hitting that level after all that work, and realising that you're not even halfway through the game.
---

---
Where people fuck up is ignoring the fun while levelling in order to rush to the endgame. And then they rob their fun in that as well to force themselves to play according to what others consider the most efficient. 
---
People are weird.
---
No you can't. Archers were much stronger and you needed 2 towers down to have any chance at Drek.

It is funny that the mentality of the playerbase has shifted so much your all demanding changes to a 15 year old game because the way you ‚Äúmaximise honor gains‚Äù is not the way you intended or prefer.
---
It does make me laugh indeed.
---
40 is too low for searing gorge
---
You should be low on healing meters as a druid right now. If you are not there is something going on wrong.
---
Druids have good mana efficiency, but they dont have a fast heal so right now in MC where fights are short they are bad. Druids are essentially carried by guilds and geared up for later.
---
I find it sad that a new player already does parsing
---
Parsing is for nerds who are too bored of playing the game normally because they played it years for thousand of hours...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
WoW isn't a comeptitive game just enjoy it and explore, levle up new classes and discover enw zones if you're bored.
---
ok don't get mad if I ignore healing u to keep tanks up in AV cause I don't have water to drink and I'm saving mana.
---
Agreed. I find rushing AV significantly more fun than long stalemate shitshows.
---
thank you! i believe this is the item that netted me, too bad its not something i can get
---
Damn you turtles. freewaterpst has made me accept your bastard build.
---
Lol, you kids have fun. Is sincerely mean that, too. Us old fucks will get there when we‚Äôre good and ready!
---
I looked at this too and saw that it was only reasonable to go third best because not only were ques three times as long at start, but you could tell that the people willing to wait to get into those realms were NOT he type I wanted to play around/with.  
---
Too much agenda, too much anger.  And far too much assmungoof (I‚Äôd pay to avoid that cringe beast).

Count to 3 and hit join at the same time. Good chance of success. Leave queue if it fails

How do you get sapped as a warrior?  If there‚Äôs even a remote chance of being sapped you should be in berserker stance in anticipation.
---
It would make more sense if you were complaining about being sheeped forever.
---
I believe this was it thank you
---
think baganon or Dejastats?
---
That was 2 polys then. Technically possible it was 1, but extremely unlikely. CC's have a soft cap of about 15 seconds, where they exponentially increase in likeliness to break. Super rare it would ever last 30 seconds in pvp.
---
How much time did you spend bitching in this thread for free? smh
---
How‚Äôs that going for ya?
---
That's true. They just shapeshift and run away until someone else does the job for them lol
---
I think he's talking about the fact that in every AV game everybody just rushes the bosses to try and get as much honour as possible rather than playing to have fun. 
---
So when you join AV it is very boring. honour grinders ruin the bg.
---
Good changes and very nice summary. A suggestion: To help enforce link flair, add a report option for posts calling "Wrong Flair". All the other report options don't really communicate that issue, so the mod reading the report won't understand what the reporter is trying to convey.

Holy shit you‚Äôre right lmao. I‚Äôm impressed.
---
Hey I've seen that icon add-on everywhere. What's the name of it?
---
&gt;First of all, you said BG, not walking around Ironforge.
---
So you admit, most mages, in circumstances where they can get paid for their food/water service, would not give it out for free?
---
Man, who would have thought that?
---
The only reason mages don't charge in BG is because they can't. You can't trade gold in BG. If you could, you would pay 1g for 6 stacks as you always have.
---
Using the BG as the excuse to not pay is so shitty but most people will do it because they are lazy and the mages are too tired to stop telling people to stop trading them so they eventually just capitulate since dealing with toxic people such as yourself on a daily basis can be exhausting (not for me I actually enjoy telling toxic people how toxic their being and then watching them squirm trying to justify their poor/antisocial behavior).
---
It's funny you think I might be stupid, because I know you ARE stupid since you literally can't wrap your tiny brain around the concept of opportunity cost. Hell, you think your grocer actually has to go through hours of labor to get a gallon of milk. How dumb are you, things are so automated nowadays that any grocer taking hours to get a gallon of milk is going to be out of business tomorrow.
---
I mean alliance made it a point to go for rep right away pretty much confirms they dont care about honor or pvp just items and farming pve stuff.

Honor spy doesnt report honor for the current day. You probably got data from a few more players during the AV which pushed you down in standings.
---
Maybe do a dungeon instead of a few? You can easily do a dungeon in 45 mins. Also raids take like 60-90 min
---
I‚Äôm super competitive by nature. So I really enjoy doing well!

However I understand that not everyone is like me and they enjoy things differently! I hope you‚Äôre having fun as well

I‚Äôll be running bgs a lot, and I want to still be viable as a raid healer in the build.  I know Swiftmend isn‚Äôt great in raids, but good in pvp, which is why the choice is so hard.  I didn‚Äôt really consider the 11 pts in feral because it feels like i lose out too much on the spellcasting end from Balance.  Really want to drop from fatty moonglow crits on peoples heads and still have good enough mana efficient when healing üëç

DONT BE A KEK RUSH DREK
---
a lot of players saw this coming and expected even longer queues and would roll alliance bc of it. I wouldve if I wasnt a shaman knowing what I know now. But it seems many vets rolled alliance because of queues in addition to the convincing argument that pallys equalize or even put alliance ahead of horde in terms of organized pvp
---
There's already been a meta and counter meta that some people knew about but everyone for the most part has caught on too. The horde winrate was pathetic at the start but in the last 24 hours I'd guess I'm at like 60% winrate. Feels good.
---
Honor spy adds people and updates them as the addon "sees" people.  It also is only showing you what people have so far for the week but isn't counting what they have earned so far today. It's not actively keeping track of where you are in the rankings, it just updates and adds people as they come online/get inspected by the addon. Use it as more a of a guide on how much honor you might need to stay in a certain bracket, not as an accurate account of your actual standing.
---
WoW, especially Classic is not a competitive game
---
So most undead rogues have atleast 2 things to counter locks
---
Then you will be a lot mor happy later with the 1 hour qs.
---
Every game that Horde has back capped and defended we‚Äôve won.  Every game that‚Äôs just a rush to the finish the Alliance have won.  Fuckin Defend boys.
---
Whether or not alliance ass pulls the entire warmaster room has the biggest effect on victory or defeat, in my experience.
---
My faction are the Horde of Firemaw-EU, and I don't even like all of them. &lt;Adept&gt; in particular can go jump in a pool of lava for all I care.
---
Why do you feel your identity and values must be dictated by things such as, "faction"? I like some Alliance on my server far more than I like the Horde.
---
I'm sorry I just won't ascribe to that sort of blind tribalism. You can go for it though, that worked really well for the KKK and the Third Reich. Seems to be going nicely for the Middle East right now as well. China too has exactly no problems with everyone blindly complying with Mainland China's demands as far as I know.
---
I was really disappointed that I wasn't playing vanilla, but honestly 1 realm pvp like the good old days really made things feel good.  There were heroes and villains in my old battlegrounds, familiar faces I came to know while grinding my reputation up.  
---
This makes me feel like I'm not missing out, now that I know the thing I loved most isn't in this "version" of vanilla.
---
All of those crafted items are BOE so I can buy them from someone with tailoring :)
---
Those Runes if Duty definitely not in the game right now.
---
Well if waiting times reaches a point where its worth it to camp brm while waiting, im guessing horde will just qeue up in org then to out and start smashing alliance skulls just like before bg's until they get pop, was 13min qeues for horde today @ gehennas
---
Also in a world where premades don't exclusively get matched against premades it's absolute hell for anyone not also in a premade.  This guys characterization of putting together a coherent WSG team and coordinating over comms as "playing with my friends" is hilarious.
---
Yeah, normally it drops pretty quickly, but on that one alt, I was literally over 100 kills with no drop. I decided to just abandon the quest since I had already gotten a whole level and a half just from grinding mobs.
---
During Classic, every time I've been in a dungeon with 4x Brazilians from the same guild it was a very pleasant experience for me. I kinda miss them since that guild transferred off the server.
---
Dude. This whole post is about mages charging for water in BGs. 
---
Why are you bringing up that mages charge OUTSIDE of BGs when that immediately contradicts what your title says?
---
You said your opinion was unpopular, because it is. Mages don‚Äôt charge in BGs because assholes would do that. 
---
You cannot say mages follow this unpopular opinion of yours. That is another contradicting statement.
---
Nothing is being "solo capped". We're just rushing the objectives because we all know exactly what needs to be done to win.
---
U realize horde will start camping flight masters and brm etc again if qeues go above 30nin since they will have more than enough time to justify going out and about while waiting for av qeue
---
Yeah, but a guy can dream.
---
Jokes on you, I'm having tons of fun playing 40 minute games and don't give a shit about "losing honor"
---
We summoned ice boi last night, good times.
---
It was already not vanilla like because you lost stacks when swapping weapons.
---
Why? Who decided that winning AV is the only way to play it? There's no rank system, there's no rules.
---
Not denying that. Just saying it‚Äôs not efficient for the horde to turtle. If you want real pvp go to WSG. AV is a PVE/PVP hybrid mode
---
What do you mean what's my point?  
---
The chart doesn't lie. Either you're lying your ass off about working full time, you're a chronic insomniac, or you don't have a life outside of WoW. It's cut and dry, one of those three options. There's no possible way that you'd be able to fit a "life" in to a sub two hour per day average timeframe, unless you either slept an inadequate amount, or you didn't work.  
---
My analysis suggests that you are *probably* an individual who either doesn't work, and is still living with their parents, or you're an absolute loser who lives paycheck to paycheck and has no social life.  
---
Tell me I'm wrong.
---
Minmaxers are destroying any resembalance of AV fun.
---
They also destroyed everything in the 2.5 world PvP phase. Every gryphon master camped, literally couldnt play the game on a relatively even server.
---
Maybe reroll away from the Zerg faction then?
---
Because if you cap it, you make alliance spawn further up north rather than behind you at that graveyard.
---
K
---
üòÇ Yeah it‚Äôs me that can‚Äôt 1v1
---
That's exactly why I like it better. If someone really wants an item, they'll pay. If someone is willing to wait for later drops, they're rewarded by  not having to pay as much
---
Get your 100% mount
---
Yeah most people are exalted now.  It‚Äôs what happens when you have instant queues and 90% of the time win in under 10 mins.
---
&gt;5 mages and a shaman aoe down all the ally raid
---
Much turtle very defence.
---
Honestly the answer is defend yourself, but this turns the game into a huge stalemate and it's why I try to convince Horde to stop defending or picking off the 60 mount people or they'll counter by defending hard themselves.
---
Your best bet probably is to go with the 60 mounters and crash the Horde group at Balinda, most of them are pretty unorganized and aren't expecting a mass of pvp. You wipe them at Balinda and they're basically fucked.
---
Run around the outskirts of the field of strife to avoid the cluster fuck and then kill an elite npc or take a tower.
---
Use it on offhand only and not main hand
---
So rets actually have to rely on skill now instead of just mindlessly reck bombing everything.
---
Yea locks are hard af.
---
I just use instant casts, if I can setup 2/3 nova/Coc/fire last combos they‚Äôre dead. But it can be hard to make the duel last that long
---
This is down to the increase in horde turtling in games imo.

2nd this. How I roll often. Equip the trinket, kill Bal and buncha lieutenants,  fight some for bunker then port back and defend. Dont really notice a prob with mount speed now that early AV zerg frenzy is over.
---
-Badlands
---
-Swamp of Sorrows
---
-Feralas early quests
---
-Southern STV
---
-do SM Cath runs, plenty of people farming it
---
If you don't already have it, get "Questie" addon, it will show you where questgivers are around your level.
---
And get bitched at constantly and blamed if you lose.
---
"good spawns"
---
Everyone is farming them either for the quest or for elemental earths.
---
Fair bit of random RP I see on Bloodsail Alliance side.
---
I‚Äôve yet to see a game where horde goes full turtle. It‚Äôs mainly just a fraction going to defend while the rest push north and win, which is the only way to win against the pure zerg strat alli use.
---
Don't be a zug, give Galv a hug!
---
It also pisses off the allies, which is a bonus.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Not sure how busy they are on people's servers, I had pretty good luck with them while leveling but obviously can vary.
---
I honestly think Mages are the more OP class. What are locks strong against?
---
Rogues? They kill locks in a stunlock and WOTF the fear/seduce.
---
Mages? The WOTF the fear, ice block the dots x2, and can global the warlock in an imp CS.
---
Priests? They can keep your dots dispelled and outheal your damage with VE alone, while their dot slowly kill the lock, dispelling your shadow ward. They can also WOTF the fear.
---
Hunters? They can outrange a lock's spells and range-kite while draining the Lock's mana. If BM its even easier for the Hunter.
---
Shamans? Tremor totem, grounding, interrupts, purge the demon armor/Soul Link buffs, 2 shot the lock with chain lightning.
---
Warriors? Immune to fear, can 100-0 a lock with Recklessness. Can WOTF the fear when berserker rage/death wish are on CD.
---
Druids?.... I guess Locks can kill Druids. Too bad they are the least played class in Classic, though :P.
---
Oce wirh 40 minute queus
---
Yeah, but rosters aren't always a resolute thing. Sometimes you get new people in your guild and sometimes old people leave. On top of that there are usually more people that need to be geared than can fit into a 40 man raid. Let's say that you have a total of 20 warriors that all want the Onslaught Girdle, that means if you're unbelievably lucky it will take a minimum of 20 weeks to do, but it's drop rate is 10%. Let's say you're extremely lucky and you get an Onslaught Girdle once every 3 weeks. That leaves about 60 runs, or 60 weeks of MC, to essentially guarantee all 20 Warriors that belt. For all we know we'll already by in AQ by the time that happens, and that's being extremely generous on the drop rate. For a lot of people it could take 100+ runs to get those.
---
Yep saw both tree and Loki the mighty summoned few times by now
---
much skill involved in premade wsg groups stomping randoms. premade wsg was always about dodging other premades, not winning with skill against other premades.
---
No you really can‚Äôt the npcs fuck you up.  You can‚Äôt just run past a tower or bunker as 1/2 your group will get killed.
---
Also you pretty much had to have capped the towers/bunkers because the war masters were way harder to kill and hit for like 3x the dmg with their cleaves.
---
Having a northern gy greatly aids the offensive push north.  Counting on SP or SP aid is a fools errand. If you wipe, you go back to IB at best.  Not to mention how hard it is to cap SH tower with alliance defenders respawning over and over while your offense just fucked off to attempt to grab SP aid station too early.
---
That it is :)
---
Right now, the best way I've found is just to all be in voice with each other, all queue at the same time, and coordinate to make sure you're all going into the same AV, as it gives you a number.
---
Until an addon comes along for it, that's the best we've got.
---
Lol love this!
---
go back to retail lmao
---
Unless you‚Äôre a priest who can weather the storm
---
Sweet, now I only have to visit the subreddit once a week.
---
&gt;You are a mage and part of the mage class is making food and water.  This is how it works.
---
Who said so? You? The community? Some person at Blizzard who says, "This is the way to play xyz class"?
---
I decide what are the important, class defining aspects of me as a mage. If you want to tell me that my job in a raid is casting frostbolts and nothing but that, I'll tell you I think that's bullshit because I have some of the best parses in the world right now for Mage DPS in Molten Core and my most used skill on that given fight wasn't frostbolt. Your narrow view of what defines my class does not dictate anything other than your own gameplay, period.
---
I CAN make food and water, but my class is defined by so much more than that, that flatly stating something as subjective as class identity in a video game as an objective fact is ridiculous.
---
In my guild's raids, I do not trade food and water to people during the raid because we have alt mages making them water and food before the raids and trading them, AND they are REQUIRED to buy extra Argent Dawn Enriched Manna Biscuits AND Hallow's End candy (it stacks with normal food/water) because my GM and Raid leader agree with my views. In an active raid, my job is NOT to provide food and water to people who were too lazy to prepare for the raid. My job is to do as much damage as possible while maintaining my mana pool, engineering consumables, buffs, and decurses, among other responsibilities. It is because of these beliefs that we clear Molten Core in about 35 minutes (good for world top 20) while most guilds take 1.5-2 hours.
---
We don't limit ourselves based on what other people think or assume our roles entail whether that be our tank (who is a troll that uses DW with daggers), our healers (who don't use HoT spells like renew, rejuv, or regrowth EVER at ANY point during raids), or our dps which includes hunters that melee weave, Mages that don't spec traditional 31/0/20 Arcane Power, and Warlocks who are allowed to use Corruption in certain cases.
---
I simply don't think my class is defined by one minor aspect of it, and while, yes, I personally do not want to trade people for food/water in my BGs and I have never, ever sat in Kargath offering ports/food/water service for a fee, I am happy to do it before raids start, before I do 5 man dungeons with people, and before I premade PvP with a group because we are in the group together working towards a common goal. I do this for free because I know I will probably in the near future be doing more group content with those same people and I want the run to go smoothly, something that the rest of my group wants as well and will play to ensure that result (which is good for me!).
---
But please, understand, that if you aren't even on my server, I have no obligation to do anything for you, and vice versa, you have no obligations to me. Since the only time we will ever see each other is Alterac Valley solo Q games, I am very comfortable not giving you food and water because we aren't working towards the same goal, and I will never see you again.
---
This is just the reality of the situation. For those 10 minutes, do I really care about this person who came unprepared to BG that I won't ever see again? The simple answer is no, I don't.
---
Horde adapted changed tactics and are defending now so winning most
---
Im so very curious as to what classes people seem to consider the best and most worth to pvp rank (atleast r13 to get full epic set). I know for example r14 weapons are bis untill naxx for melee etc, and some people say hunter arnt really worth ranking on cause of their PvE tier sets being very strong for both pve and pvp. Anyone who can shed some light on classes that both benefit heavily from pvp gear (as in being useful in pvp, like hunters) and if theres a class where their pvp gear is just garbage for everything.
---
thanks &lt;3
---
Yeah. Vanilla I played a human warlock. When classic came out, I said screw that, and rolled undead. Best decision ever.
---
I like to find a buddy and take a tower or two. That gives a bit of honor.
---
Great logic except for the part where you forgot that honor calculations are faction specific
---
This 100% isnt it. Alliance are losing because 50% of the raid decides to afk or galavant around the entire fking map instead of following the objective. Dont tell me they are doing quests because they most often arent even close to those places.
---
Cool, didn't ask about any of that. Glad you're excited for it, though.
---
That's blizzlike and what makes WSG what it is
---
Yeah I just looked that up. Either way, horde wasted our time with ganks, now they get massive queues and a slow rep grind. I‚Äôm already exalted with my epic trinket.
---
I mean the set bonus is pretty nice
---
Vanilla is the expansion where the ceiling and the floor are the closest. A little RNG can completely shift the game around. And it only gets crazier as phases progress because people will gain 25-50% more damage and only 10-20% more health in Naxx gear.
---
That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been trying. It worked great the first day but hadn‚Äôt since.  Is it better to join a certain room together or first available
---
Depends on your class. Mages, rogues and hunters can stall. Paladins, priests and druids can dispel enemy stall and deathrun to heal after relief hut is capped. Warriors and warlocks can only defend I guess.
---
IDK the source you linked me says its "a game mode for League of Legends". That's your source. Ive never heard of it before, so Im just going off you what you tell me man. Maybe read the shit you link before you link it? IDK what to tell you.

That is super lame. Sorry that happened to you.
---
1 shot by rogues? L2paladin :P

I don‚Äôt play it i was just telling you
---
Run as a ghost to RH and ressing there honestly is better than putting up a defense

Most turtles go for less than 40 minutes. Wouldn't it make more sense to just stay in the game that you've already wasted 20 minutes on at that point for another 20 minutes to get the full reward instead of only being able to get back 15 minutes later, wasting 35 minutes total.

It seems like they never cap the GY there. Is there any trick to it?
---
No shit
---
I mean u rally don‚Äôt even need a premade to do this.  Many a solo av ends up exactly like this.
---
Capping that GY was *always* meta in vanilla. Alliance can capture Snowfall if they like and still PvE, they just have a longer run which works in our favor. Or they can try and take Iceblood.
---
You misunderstood. I said that premade v premade at 60 is fun, but those happens too rarely as most of them are just permades vs pugs. 
---
49 and 59 brackets rarely have twinks and thus there's also rarely any premades in them which makes them more fun.

You think they do, but they don't

You are so selfish and greedy and lame.
---
You could perfectly pull with level 1-2 spells that you get before level 10.  
---
No need to waste mana that is better spend on heals.
---
Why are lakes in AV fishable if that's not how AV was supposed to play out? Stupid logic.
---
&gt;Dude. This whole post is about mages charging for water in BGs.
---
You can't trade gold in BGs that's the whole point. People specifically queue into BG with the express intent of AFK'ing out immediately once they get what they want so they can go off and do some solo farming or 5 man dungeon. People on this Reddit  have claimed they've done this exact thing. They do it because they know they likely won't get free food/water anywhere else but from mages in AV who have been bullied into silently accepting the new status quo by toxic players who think they are entitled to their basic consumables for free.
---
&gt;You cannot say mages follow this unpopular opinion of yours. That is another contradicting statement.
---
Mages only account for approximately 20% of the WoW population. Even if every mage on every server agreed with me, as long as the majority of the other players did not, it would still be an unpopular opinion. 80% &gt; 20%.
---
That's just basic maths. You simply don't understand most of the points I am making, so I'll probably not reply to anything else you say since it's kind of a waste of time to argue with someone with your level of reading comprehension.
---
My guild does it the same way, makes sense. Show them this thread.
---
Horde overpopulation continues to fuck over alliance. Awesome stuff, guys.
---
Fantastic thanks so much!
---
Thats just a prediction of how long the current phase plan might last i think
---
The Christmas holiday decays will fix that
---
Ty for the info!
---
Are we speaking about raids or dungeons? Because in raid you won't do all things that you mentioned.  
---
I remember been fined in DKP for using Tranquility in Naxx one time :)
---
Battlegrounds have loot?
---
Gregstreet lmao
---
The alterac biscuits are amazing
---
It isn't, but a prot Paladin can't reasonably get crit cap anyway. So you don't really have a choice in the matter.
---
He said he afks after 10, where are you getting 20 from that?
---
Cause it's more fun imo.
---
&gt;What the fuck. Jesus no wonder you're like this. Glad I'm far away from you on an oceanic server lol, fucking hell.
---
You are the one who said I should try to help my Faction regardless of what the end result of that means. I'm just showing you that historically, that hasn't really worked out for people.
---
"Person noone should care about tells us his opinion"
---
I‚Äôm trying it out only level 22 so far. I do have +30 sp to a skinning dagger so things are dying decently fast.
---
I love being a turtle!
---
Hahaha I spend most of my time having fun while others are trying to calculate their fun.
---
Meanwhile at 19 the only talents I have are not interrupting my heals and more Mana. Wooo. üòÇ
---
This was always a thing, but you had to bother someone to join your group, so that you could then leave it and be booted out. He's just found a way you can do it without bothering anyone.
---
Just find people your level and farm all the trash in the hallways, maybe kill the spritecaster cape lady if people need her and wrap it up with a quick arena then reset. Thats what my friend(pally tank) did with me and I got all the way from 53 to 60 w him in a few days.
---
&gt;You actually argue like a toddler.
---
\*Throws insults with no meaningful comment to back it up\*
---
Yes, yes, I am definitely the immature one in this discussion. You're right.
---
Pack it up boys, we're done here!
---
av av av av av av av av av av
---
Honestly, why would people not want you to use it? It's the most mana efficient heal you have when multiple people are injured
---
Sounds epic
---
I crack up every time I see a wolf mount animation
---
don't run by Belinda tower go up the hills beside it and round
---
usually rogue or druid sneaks ahead and they will cap it stealth
---
I seem to remember 3 am being correct.
---
Current AV is basically what people wanted to get away from in retail.
---
Love the screenshot. Would be nicer if it was actually there though.
---
Ususally those are crocs that have the amulet on their corpse. It's a group drop - which means after you loot it, the item is still there for others in your group. Means it can't be skinned even if everyone in the group already looted it.
---
That isn't what is happening. The difference between the lighting fast 7 minute round and the current meta is about 7-8 minutes, 15 mins tops. And we mostly win these games + do turn ins which give a ton of rep. Since we have queues, that means we get way more rep/hour by dragging the games a little bit.
---
For comparison, a loss is about 350 rep, a win + turn ins starts at 1k and can go to 2k.
---
And if the allies overpower us, it just goes back to the old 7 minute game so nothing lost.
---
Black Orcs represent!
---
You and me both.
---
Miner BS and mining crashed. It doesn‚Äôt help that when my guild raids I usually end up 15g down in repairs a night. I barely have enough gold to have armor, much less an actual mount.
---
Tried a Dark Iron ore to bar gamble to try to get enough for a mount and got completely blown out too.
---
no this has always been a thing in vanilla and not punishable
---
I've never seen so little PVP happen in a PVP instance.
---
Porkus, you truly are a champion of the Horde. Rock on, brother.
---
I ROFLed at the losers yelling at you lol.
---
‚ÄúI play this faction, it‚Äôs not very popular, you‚Äôve probably never heard of it.‚Äù
---
All things considered, this response is pretty wholesome lmao
---
Is there any add-on where you can get achievements? Would be nice to create your own achievements and have some that comes with the add-on already, which they are obviously achievements like completing a raid set, kill this boss or something.
---
But it‚Äôs an entire guild waiting for another guild not just 1 guy I mean if you can organize 10 of your buddies to wipe another raid that‚Äôs FairPlay for me but like actually camping people what is this is wow turning into an FPS, there should be a cap on how many accounts can you log in at the same time
---
When it pops just do /reload then it will pop up again and you‚Äôll be able to accept it
---
&gt;There's no way you're going to consistently clear these raids with no world buffs

---
This should be a good starting point for you.
---
&gt;I don't charge people when I buff them an hour of stamina and it even costs me gold, not just mana.
---
You have plenty of time to hit a bunch of people with 30 minute Fortitude. It is your choice to spend the reagent to give them a 60 minute buff when they may not even live 5 minutes.
---
If you give tips to randoms, you shouldn't expect a random mage in a BG to expect anything less. You will never see that mage again since BGs are cross realm. Even if he gave every healer in one BG 10 stacks of water, there is 0 guarantee that in his next game, he won't have to do the exact same thing for every healer in that game, and the next game, and the next game, ad infinitum.
---
You are biased from the PoV of the healer. You only need to click one button to accept a trade from a mage and you are set for hours with water. When a mage is making water for other people, the demand is endless.
---
Even with edgemasters I think perditions is behind deathbringer, viskag and brutality blade for main hands, and core hound tooth is a better off hand
---
Imagine that. "Stop playing BGs for enjoyment of pvp so I can get my RePuTaTiOn." Just play the BG and stop acting like not taking the fastest path is some sort of detriment to playing a video game.
---
Idk, I don‚Äôt want it capped cause I want alliance to spawn in the middle of the map - they then have to decide if they are going to defend or push and they split their forces. If they all rez at their base it‚Äôs a LOT harder
---
MMM more salty ally tears

I just got my epic mount about a week ago I get the feeling!

So like there‚Äôs a wolf mob name that ends in alpha, and there‚Äôs lots of them, and you‚Äôre saying that since all the wolves think they‚Äôre alphas there‚Äôs no betas to look after the pups which are getting murdered by Tauren?
---
There is literally a pop-up in the game that says you will get hearthed in 1 minute, after YOU leave the group (not even being kicked). This mechanic was absolutely intended by the devs. Now, did they intend for people to use it for a free hearth? Probably not. But anyway, it's definitely not a bug. 
---
Anyway, considering that people were getting GM whispers (no punishment) telling people to stop safespotting/using the MC/duel exploit on flight paths, I highly highly doubt you would get any punishment for this without getting spoken to by a GM first, and even then I'm still extremely doubtful they would even waste their time. I mean we're not duping any epics here. We're literally just doing the same thing people have been doing since day one with a few extra harmless steps.
---
The more people you discover the more likely you are to be earning less RP, because the more people you are finding that have farmed more honor than you.
---
This has nothing to do with the honor system and is simply the limitations of honorspy.
---
I'm curious, why do you keep putting things in quotations like its something he actually said? You are literally putting words into hit mouth, it doesn't do well for your argument or your intelligence.
---
What class are you? I‚Äôm guessing rogue or fury warrior. Here‚Äôs a link to rogue pre-raid bis. You can find the other classes here as well. I took the list and put it in excel then sorted by dungeon to see which had the most loot for me and spammed that first. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
not just edge but any other + skill piece
---
As per game theory people will always put themselves in the best position they can by their own power to win regardless of how good it is for the others/consumer.
---
Should have rolled mage and just run around aoeing with their skill.
---
Yep, I am alliance and all of the AVs I've been in ended up with the horde quitting en masse shortly after the first turtle is discovered. The rest are just arguing with each other or just fucking around in the caves, lol.
---
At this point I just go out and start killing harpies away from everyone else so I can get some XP, at least.
---
o no I just meant that's how much honor I got in about 4.5hours, which is how much I played each day.
---
Took me 3 days to get it, so total about 13-14 hours to get exalted.
---
I'd buy them for 50s silver. Just broadcast in see if people are interested.
---
You can't imagine the amount of shit I've got done around the house since BGs were released!
---
Those 10 min breaks are actually very useful, and since I only compete for honor with my faction, doesnt' really have any negative effect
---
Well he will never see a raid or a premade battle ground or anything endgame. and beside loosing buffs, it happens.  
---
All a multiboxer is ever going to be is a griefer or a farmbot.
---
Day 1: av sucks games are too fast I hate av I‚Äôm not gonna play it anymore.
---
Day 4: AV games are going too long no ones gonna play them anymore.
---
Get sheeped off your horse, die, ghost run to the graveyard near Drek and spawn there to help
---
I assume core hound gloves with Perds would give a bigger dps increase then edgemasters and deathbringer because of the stats on the gloves?
---
Edit: I‚Äôm talking from a non human/orc perspective
---
Have  you seen what happened to Flamelash-EU?
---
It's nothing but corpses and tears for miles and miles.
---
:(
---
Getting rank 7 isn't too bad.  You've gotta play about 15 hours a week for about 3 months pvping tho to get it.  You can go harder and get it faster.  It varies based on your server, but that's about right.  This week in particular is pretty rough cause everyone is grinding BGs.  This means for a similar rank you gotta play more this week.
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much, I'd just play and see how close you can get just playing.  Once you get close (like rank 4-5) maybe try hard for 2-3 weeks and you can get rank 7.
---
As someone in another thread said, the Horde don't turtle the Alliance do.  What the Horde do is send some to defend, and some (most of the raid generally) to push.  Sometimes the Horde don't send enough to D and the Alliance zerg strat wins, and the rest of the time the Horde defense either stalls out the Alliance offense long enough for the Horde push to win, or the zerg gets genuinely scattered and only *then* do you see a real turtle with the entire Alliance raid sitting in their base with no attempts to form up any kind of offense.
---
Objectively more ‚Äúfun‚Äù? Idk dude some people have ‚Äúfun‚Äù spending hours ganking in low level zones
---
Can‚Äôt wait to get mine! My main is at 51, and now that BGs are out, I can finally get back into questing regularly haha
---
&gt;throwaway
---
Coward
---
&gt;noooo stop having fun I need to minmax my numbers gain ahhhh you're getting in the way of me getting r14 which I won't actually get
---
Pls stop
---
That's the joke dude...
---
Naxx is the only one of those two that will cause problems. And then most of the problem will because naxx is so stupidly gear dependant. Do you have four tanks with the set? Nooooo? Well the horsemen say get fucked come back when you're geared.
---
its like a couple days max of farming. game has been out for ages already.
---
you are a good sport &lt;3
---
Did you DE the set before or after you DE‚Äôd the hand of rag?
---
Sorry no min/maxing allowed here /s
---
Even tanking raid-content in this current phase. Tanks are a better choice for Rag when they are full fire-resist. They have more armor, more health, better threat generation (save for Fury Tanks). 
---
I‚Äôm on the Blaumeux server, and while people are surprised to see a bear tank, they are even more surprised to find out that a properly geared one can hold their own against even top tier warriors. 
---
Now, it‚Äôs easy to be a bad Druid tank, which is why they get such a bad rep tanking wise in raids. Lack of shield for crushing blows, and parry‚Äôs is their major flaw. 
---
So while they‚Äôre not typically ideal in raids, in the hands of the right person; they are amazing.
---
I don‚Äôt care if he can farm but like having multiple accounts on a pvp zone shouldn‚Äôt be legal
---
WSG is better for game play than this sprint past each other strat, but the rewards aren't there right now so nobody cares I guess.
---
I just left a guild that currently uses DKP with no rules. ‚ÄúDKP is DKP‚Äù so a hunter could totally win in that situation.
---
It's because it is what he's saying.
---
When people say stupid shit like "I hate those players creating turtles!" But are referring to enemy players that killed them outside Dreks room and sent them back to base what they just said is..
---
"I hate those players that capitalized on me being too stupid to cap a graveyard"
---
He's literally admitting he can't cap a graveyard so it's everyone else's fault his team rezzed at base...after they didn't cap a graveyard.
---
Edit: imagine a hockey player saying it's the other teams fault that when they tried to just skate in a straight line towards the net and left no one on defence that they lost the game after the enemy player got the puck 
---
The quotes I put are the exact same thing just not sugar coated. There isn't an "argument" here. I will continue to repeatedly kill him in AV and until he figures out how graveyards work the "People he hates for creating turtles" his him.
---
Honor spy is currently fucked and you cannot trust it. That's the issue there :)
---
Happy dwarf :)
---
Go count how many PVE servers there are compared to PVP numbnutts.
---
That's fine, I don't, and never go into a BG expecting healers to heal me.
---
Likewise, the same goes for when you try to get water from mages. You should never go into a BG expecting a mage to be there.
---
What happens if you Q into a WSG and there simply aren't any mages? Are you just useless for an entire BG?
---
People stopped rushing Drek. Now they go to Galv, cap the wrong GY and wipe on Drek. They watch Premades maximize honor, but don't realize they can't do it as a pug. Ally would win every match if they just kept rushing Drek.
---
Blizzard isn't banning even bots and you expect them to ban afkers xd They don't give a fuck.
---
Don't forget about holy reckoning
---
&gt; "This content doesn't appeal to me so I'm going to make sure everyone knows"
---
"This comment doesn't appeal to me so I'm going to make sure everyone knows".
---
Or, we could say that any sort of reactions can potentially be okay.
---
Well when your full raid gets wiped twice in the same night and your raids morale drops to the floor and people just go away, that‚Äôs when you be like omg I hate multi boxers pvping, idc if they use their accounts to farm I just don‚Äôt want em ruining my night
---
That makes sense why I was getting confused about those two times then! Thanks for the clarification.
---
The idea was to zerg rush, yes. But it was not being done in 7 minutes every game.
---
they can gave op paladins though
---
What a sad person.
---
This is just not a big deal at all.
---
I don't, and never have gotten mad for this reason.
---
The tank is far more important than a lone mage. You are doing exactly what you should be doing.
---
ur UI is like ifehjgijwe9truj9ejbdofkowjgfp0j fdp0gkjpfdkgpdfkpgoekr pgo
---
ya DAE else hate hanging out with family?? just give me my beer and wow XDD
---
If they don't want to buff or heal me, that's fine, but they refuse to buff or heal for anyone during the entire BG.
---
That is called throwing a tantrum, and is a severely disproportionate response to not getting free water.
---
AV is like a box of chocolates.
---
Don't forget that they're given priority on all caster loot!
---
Huh?
---
Sounds like a smart move to leave.
---
Same here, waited over 4 seconds once and I thought I lagged out or something.
---
SSPVP is decent too.
---
Of course people are gonna clear the raids without wbuffs, here's a link to an interview of Classic Countdown with one Death and Taxes guild raider, one of the best if not the best guild in Vanilla PVE:  [https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/03/06/episode-94-a-history-of-world-firsts-with-death-taxes-flight-paths-druids-sunken-temple-lore/](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/03/06/episode-94-a-history-of-world-firsts-with-death-taxes-flight-paths-druids-sunken-temple-lore/) 
---
In this interview he says "We never used world buffs once for raiding, the only times we'd ever use them were to get high numbers for PVP movies if you were into that. Nobody considered that at the time."
---
In fact, it was in TBC when one feral druid stacked Dire Maul stamina buffs to become immortal in PVE they became popular. All that time from Vanilla to TBC you could stack Dire Maul buffs and nobody knew, that should tell you how nobody knew about them and much less used them well.
---
Furthermore, you're not gonna wipe shit multiboxing 5-10 mages, if anything multiboxers are laughed at as free honour. I will explain why you will never succeed wiping a guild that doesnt suck:
---
1. They will not AFK outside Naxx with world buffs ticking out, stacked, waiting for you to wipe them. They will fly in, ride together and enter the raid.
---
2. If it ever would become a problem that you would kill FEW of them, they would come prepared with AGM's, prepopped greater fire pots, and pop new ones as you ress, or even go slowly with shields or any other preparation.
---
*laughs in alliance*
---
Are you the top guy?
---
Yes if you only attacked 1 thing at a time there‚Äôd be a good argument for SL. Try doing the maths on afflic vs SL while killing 2 or 3 things at once.
---
Hey, it works.
---
True
---
There are queues for AV?
---
lol right? no one used world buffs in vanilla.
---
multiboxers are terrible for everything high level anyway
---
I can't select my classic characters either, only retail :\
---
I understand why people do it. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs a shitty thing to do
---
Correct answer. Flight paths are food and bathroom
---
This is the actual reason. Capping SHGY basically makes their decision for them. If their zerg wipes they spawn at their starting cave which is way close to their base than SHGY is. Then they have enough forces to stop a horde push which ACTUALLY results in a turtle game.
---
I farmed SM cath for an average of 34-36g an hour as a mage, my gear caps me out at about 10 mobs a pull ATM so there's significant room for more.
---
I also just vendor everything but twink gear, as I'm lazy. It's sooooooo boring though lol, I recommend throwing in some armory, lib and GY clears as they're MUCH faster albeit less gold per hour but do a lot to make you not want to die IRL.
---
Edit: oh yeah it's 34g ish an hour of acrual farming, not per hour overall. in-between I tele to IF and fly back which adds about 10 mins that I never really count.
---
His threat was wiped on onyxia and when I grabbed agro and was main tanking the boss he pulled agro and wiped the raid.
---
Dead servers don't have queues
---
and no one has the luxury of not being in AV cause of the competition
---
People play more than they did in Vanilla and spend that time more efficiently. The casual term has become distorted by the gaming community in recent years. Anything that you spend more than 10 hours a week doing shouldn't be considered casual, yet many players consider themselves casuals for playing 20-30 hours a week. There are a LOT of players closing in on 30 days /played already. Just leveling to 60 takes roughly 8 days, and many have 2+ 60s.
---
15 years ago, I wasn't even allowed to play on school nights and had to share the computer with my siblings during the weekend. Also, 'playing outside' was still a thing back then. At the end of TBC, my /played was 30 days split evenly between each expansion.
---
49 bracket is really fun just takes more investment to think than others, got my rogue sitting at 49 now doing more bg than on my 60 war haha
---
Only reason I want to come back
---
AFK did kick you from the BG and report AFK existed as well, that simply isn't accurate.  It's always been people fishing or at the cave jumping just like now and I see more leechers every day in classic.
---
We also had coordinated queues where 40 mans rolled everyone and every objective in under 7 minutes and it wasn't this inflated honor wise.
---
Long que times is what the horde gets lmao. Get use to it kek
---
Up to 46min now horde
---
It's because you do more dmg with dots that you can apply to several mobs at once. And you have less down time thanks to life steal effects and mana stealing from pet.
---
So less single target dmg but higher multi target dmg and less down time
---
This is so stupid and wrong.  What a bunch of click bait garbage.
---
Oh look, another Alliance player who thinks they‚Äôre the only faction who had it rough. You guys should have your own sub!
---
I ram 20/31/0 but if i were to play the specc right now i think i would be 5/31/15
---
Well i have 3 jobs 8 children 2 wives and i can only play 15 minutes a week. But i still have 2 epic mounts and full bis boes. :]
---
&lt;&lt; is that increased healing enough to edge out a flat 30% damage reduction from Soul Link, increased stamina, and imp healthstone? &gt;&gt;
---
In a pvp encounter with high burst? No. In prolonged PvE? Yes, very very much. Depending on the encounter, siphon life can mean infinite sustain. There's a good reason why SM/DS (30/21/0) is the best solo farming build at endgame, while Soul Link builds are the best PvP builds, and Ruin is a must-have for competitive raid dps.
---
Y‚Äôall crazy as hell for trusting the honor spy add on in the bg phase.
---
No they won't. Multiboxers are already very rare, and what the fuck do you mean "nothing anyone can do about it" ? It'd be easy as hell to get a group of people together and wreck a multiboxer. The aoe spam shown in the video can be avoided simply by not all standing grouped up on one spot.
---
Horrible clickbait title.
---
Bro I'm just enjoying not dying on sight. Level 40 and 53 with a 60% mount.
---
This is not appropriate.
---
Solid Stone is quite good right now also. Not better than Herbalism, but good.
---
Nice
---
My thoughts exactly after reading his two comments! üòÇ
---
Bop
---
who cares if sum random idiot blames you for a loss, just enjoy the bg your way, the guys that bitch usually do nothingto help anyway and just talk shit all game.
---
did ~150 jump runs, can confirm
---
Definitely this, you can take SP graveyard with two people easy as horde assuming there's no allies there. One to drag the NPCs away and the other to cap.
---
As soon as there's one ally there things get more complicated
---
Yeah a couple drops I‚Äôve noticed
---
It was super easy to get the Wildheart set, I‚Äôm a tank and the market on my server sucks; only mats sell. I even had 3x of a few of the pieces and had to go lower than DE mat prices to sell them, so I just DE‚Äôd th set (I wasn‚Äôt playing balance or resto or boomkin at the time so it seemed like a useless set - I also never played WoW prior for Classic so a lot is still a learning curve for me). A legendary vs a rare is quite different.
---
See it as an investment when you make someone water. Thats how i see it when i buff people in AV with motw. I think maybe just maybe buffing all 40 at least help tip the scale our way at some point for some player and in the end increase our chance at victory. What do this have to do with your water you might ask? Well spending time buffing like crazy is something i only do if i have gotten a nice supply of water from some kind mage, which i actually always gotten so far when doing bg's. So its all connected.
---
Not doing bg's just out in the world? Still, an investment. The person you give a few stacks will hopefully make something productive out of it. In time making his character more powerful. And maybe he one day will be there fighting by your side and you will then draw advantage of his strength that you once invested in.
---
It's not being done that way any more, either. It's closer to 10-15 more often than not. But the 7 minute zerg was a thing in vanilla for a time. The same process that is happening in classic happened there as well.
---
Everybody just hits need like a gorilla on it
---
Thanks, it‚Äôs herbalism then. I just didn‚Äôt know the markets like at all.
---
This is why I rolled RP-PvP.
---
Farm the whelps instead. Better gold and weaker enemy
---
They have a program that inputs the key presses from a single keyboard into every window of WoW, and then a shit ton of macros. 
---
A ton of work goes into making a multibox if they're different specs / classes, real easy if they're all one. And so long as they stick to  the 1:1 input rule they're not against the rules.
---
So we should play the game solo?
---
It‚Äôs cross server. So it doesn‚Äôt really matter. Unless everyone suddenly quits classic, I doubt anyone will really have an issue getting wsg games. My queues have been 5-10 mins wsg at random times through the day, but AV is a long queue on horde too
---
Same but like to check the sub for good stuff while I‚Äôm shitting only to be greeted with all the bitching haha, truly is a vanilla experience with all the scrubs going ham on forums
---
*laughs in mage*
---
I'm not saying you're wrong.  But it is possible his timer expired from the first afk report, or multiple reports of different types played a role.  I honestly haven't looked into so not positive how reporting is handled right now.
---
I can't even guarentee that my solo reports on actual afk makes a difference.  But, anecdotally, I've noticed most dont stay in that spot long.
---
Collusion! /s
---
Show us on the doll where the mean alliance touched you cuz your comment history seems like you‚Äôve been buttfucked by gnomes too many times
---
Just award everything for 1 dkp. Done.
---
Lol bro. Not on the same server as you guys, but my server Sulfuras in China is about 2:1 ratio in favor of Horde. I felt so bad about what I had to do to get Rank 7. Eventually my friends and I picked up second accounts and rerolled alliance lol. (And by rerolled of course I mean I payed some guy $200 to level me a rogue to 60.) Feels so bad just farming people who are trying just trying to get to BRD or MC.
---
I played during vanilla horde and now I play alliance, so I know exactly what I'm talking about. Horde adapts to new strategy and alliance loses almost all AVs.
---
Expose armor hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Yeppers
---
I mean...
---
...yea..
---
A Big Mac pls
---
if you farm trib solo, the 3pc set is great
---
So if they stick to the 1:1 this is not breaking the ToS? That's insane op so you could use this to powerlevel people or farm bosses and it would be fully legal?
---
I mean, alliance had the blitzkrieg going good the first day ot two, granted horde didnt care much about the win anyway.  But now it only takes about 10 horde to reverse that psychological damage right back lol.
---
&gt;That would be like I, as a rogue, would demand 1g for lockpicking since it's the equivalent workload.
---
First off, I tip 50s per box that rogues open for me, and if you don't, you're cheap. I have only received an item worth less than 50s one time from any lockbox I've had opened for me, so I tip the rogue because he is providing me a service I cannot (or will not) perform on my own.
---
Second, where do you get the idea that lockpicking is anything like making food/water? To pick a lock, the rogue inputs two keystrokes, then hits the "accept trade" button.
---
To make 6 stacks of food / water, you have to start with making water, 10 at a time, and 7 casts makes you go oom, so once you've casted "conjure water" the 6th time, you sit and drink for 30 seconds, then start casting either a conjure food or water spell until you have enough stacks to complete the trade. Then, you have to open trade with your customer, put the food and water into the trade window, and then finally hit accept after about 1.5 minutes of casting spells.
---
Again, that's two keystrokes for the rogue (generally I open the trade window with the rogue) to perform the service, and another single keystroke to accept the trade for three key inputs that take a total of approximately 5 seconds to complete.
---
Water/food on the other hand, takes at minimum 10 keystrokes to create the stacks another to open the trade, 6 more to put the food and water in the window, and one more to accept the trade for at minimum 17 (20+ when making water only) keystrokes and 2+ minutes of time spent casting spells and trading.
---
Look, I am fine if you want to make a comparison, but you could pick locks for 20 people in the time I could make a decent amount of water for a single person.
---
OMG 2 hours.  Always let alliance have either Snowfall or Stonehearth lol.
---
Ok boomer
---
Shadowpanther is what you need to be looking at.
---
I was on a medium population server back in vanilla. We had one rank 14, for both alliance and horde. She was a legend in that server.
---
Tremor Totem pulses so if a pulse has just gone off before you get feared it's possible to be feared out of range before the next pulse goes off
---
This is very true. I was a somewhat competitive pvper back in early expansions who still had to rely on BG botting and buying gold just to keep up while balancing life.
---
At least you understand that‚Äôs it‚Äôs your opinion. Worried about the way your character looks? Lols.
---
That's what I hope for too. But I really dont see it happening. Blizzard hasn't hinted at anything like that at all and I feel like they would have at this point.
---
I don't.
---
That's the difference between you and me.
---
Jesus this guy is annoying.
---
I didn't say to do it, I just answered your question. Can you think of another way for a hunter to "clear the dots"?
---
I didn't play a warlock alt till way after vanilla.  But can't you just turn off all abilities and they'll still auto attack?  Why passive?
---
Which quests do you do ? Is that the mines one?
---
nice false info. Arcanist set bonus has the same spell pen
---
Every rank past 3 take 5.000 RP each  
---
    
---
Every week your current RP takes a 20% decay before the new RP is added (being bracket 13 means you get between 11.000 and 12.000 RP, max is 13.000 at standing 1, every bracket below gets 1000 less at the top)  
---
At 4 and 68% your current RP is around 13.500, so your weekly decay is 2700 RP, if you then get middle of bracket 13, you'll get roughly 11.500 RP, and end up at a 8800 RP surplus, taking you to roughly halfway through rank 6.
---
&gt;  should you bring your own tubers/hp pots so warlocks don't have to give you healthstones
---
Yes, and, believe it or not, I do bring my own HP and Mana pots as well as bandages, goblin sapper charges, iron grenades, LIPs, FAPS, and dense dynamite. I even use Elixir of Fortitude and Rumsey Rum if I think I'll survive the entire game. Heck, I even have two healthstones sitting in my inventory right now from warlocks that I gave water to outside of the AV portal in Alterac Mountains.
---
I also do not ever expect anyone to buff me, heal me, or trade me anything in BG.
---
It's pretty liberating to rely only on yourself for your needs. Maybe you should try it some time?
---
And, barring that, you can also ask the mages in your guild for food and water for free if you don't want to pay for it. Why is it my responsibility to provide food and water to people on other servers when they don't have my interests in mind while playing AV and I will never see them again outside of that one AV?
---
This post will definitely make me call for turtles more. I had no idea you all hated it this much. This is wonderful
---
Why are you in AV if you don't have an epic mount? Go farm gold.
---
That‚Äôs only if you‚Äôre weaving.
---
Trade me for HEALTHSTONE!! Next to mailbox! Tips appreciated :)
---
Is what I would go with
---
4300 honor, the win, and all in 15 minutes.  That's what dreams are made of lol.
---
In my experience, as a geared 60 hunter now and back in vanilla (but before the 1.8 patch), hunters do not "counter" warlocks. We do ok, better if we get the drop from max distance (see OP comment). Best if that drop includes a 2k aimed shot crit. But that goes for hunter vs. any class.
---
In the world I'm just as likely to encounter a warlock while we're both mounted. I won't take that fight and expect to win more than 50% of the time (hence, not a counter). But, if I really want to win it, I will put up shadow reflector and drink a restorative. I'll use grenades and whipper roots. Because no matter whether people are happy with it, consumables win fights.
---
Also, I'll hope for a string of big crits.
---
See the comment by u/zergprime below.
---
You lose your stacks if you mount and you lose them if you initiate, then cancel an auto attack. 
---
I guess that's a nerf? So you can't just load it up from mobs then mount and go bomb someone?
---
The meta used to be if horde capped snowfall it was a turtle. But that doesn't matter right now since alliance don't even attempt lts or galve 80% of the time
---
Everyone hates you because you are having fun.
---
I feel like fear simply does not break in classic. On private servers it would break after one corruption tick
---
Be on the ball about gettiing out the door and mounted, have your carrot on. I've honestly pretty consistantly gotten to drek, there's a lot of feet draggers, and if you stay on course you'll make it. If not delay around stone hearth until the lower GYs are almost capped and then run as a ghost and rez at the lower GYs.
---
No, just checked the screenshot his name was Sauce
---
I love this
---
What do you turn in? Never managed 1400 rep.
---
This is incredibly incorrect
---
That‚Äôs fine man go thru all that traveling each time since when you‚Äôre done with AV you‚Äôll be where you queued. I‚Äôd be willing to bet that would keep the numbers manageable.
---
Yep!
---
Stfu trashcan.
---
Imagine
---
I love the level of entitledness from Alliance players on this subreddit. We've gone from "Horde gankers have ruined PvP" to "The Horde is holding us hostage by not letting us have an easy win."
---
Actually for an alliance pug that's better honor in 15 minutes then I've seen them get yet.  I've heard alliance pre-mades can push it a lot harder, but it's not easy to que everyone in the same instance.
---
Remember, alliance and horde don't compete with each other for pvp ranks.
---
Edit:  If we look back at alliance day one strat I'm wrong.  With instant alliance que's, 7-8 minute wins would give 800-900 honor.  So yeah, that group of alliance got screwed by a couple hundred honor.
---
Riiiight.. I've been having fun winning
---
My goals were super ‚Äútrivial‚Äù too so I know how you feel. The main for me was to get Anathema and I finally did on Monday. Feels great!
---
Gz for accomplishing your goal!
---
You spend all this time and money to try and do your best, but also don't wanna give your teammates, who are on your team and can help you, any help because "fuck them"
---
Your way of playing is objectively bad. It's a team game, fighting together and working together and healing your teammates is objectively superior to intentionally avoiding helping, you can do all those things and work together.
---
You're not a try hard if you're not. You're just a weird noob.
---
&gt;It's pretty liberating to rely only on yourself for your needs. Maybe you should try it some time?
---
It's pretty satisfying to be a good person for the sake of it. Strong people aren't independant, strong people use their strength to help others.
---
&gt; Why is it my responsibility to provide food and water to people on other servers when they don't have my interests in mind while playing AV?
---
I have the other people in my AV on my mind when I play, I try and heal them, save them, CC their attackers, rez them.
---
Maybe this is why Horde sucks so much at AV, is this their attitude?
---
Big. Yikes.
---
Finished the rep grind and I really enjoyed it.
---
Tanking is satisfying here. And the game has slowed down so there's usually pvp too.
---
The guild is notorious for locking down lower-level zones before the honor system. Normal pvp server stuff, I guess, but they're the type of people that keep waiting on your lvl 40 corpse with a raid of 60s
---
Well you have to at least acknowledge that not everyone wants to play the same way you do and you have to respect that.
---
There are a ton of guides with way more detail than any reddit post could give you... and they are just 1 Google query away.
---
But anyway ... ranks work on a server wide competiton against your OWN faction. Players get honor from honorable kills or bonus honor from battlegrounds. All this honor is summed up at the end of the week and divided into brackets based on the percentile of honor you have (for specific numbers on brackets please use Google or duck duckgo or any search engine of your choice). The players which farmed the most honor compared to everyone else on their server get the most rank points. Only the most "dedicated" top 3ish players will get the best honor bracket every week (13k rank points).  You also loose 20% of your rank points each week.
---
Long story short: your "Honor" is entirely meaningless on its own. It only matters in comparison to everyone else and is reset each week. There is no fixed honor rating for ranking up, there is no honor cap or breakpoints. If everyone else keeps farming you will keep losing standing. If you stop farming people will overtake you and you will lose standing.
---
Ignore galv and run straight to drek. If you get ambushed you can FAP+rocket boots btw, works most of the time.
---
Damn people actually using their insignias to defend lmao. We really are in the min max era
---
DBM has a PvP plugin. If you install it using Twitch client make sure to go to Versions tab and select the last version like on my screenshot [https://i.imgur.com/oFGcbBH.png](https://i.imgur.com/oFGcbBH.png)
---
All of them, the boss turn ins give the most. Up to 300 rep for everyone just for that. Finishing all the armor upgrades give 150.  Each wing Commander is 50 or 100 I can't remember. A win is 100 from marks 350 from a win. Getting the captain first is 185.  Each LT is additional. Each tower is 150 each...it adds up very fast. A 30 minute game with all objectives completed win or lose is better rep then 8 min wina.
---
Nothing special, it's mostly for fresh 60's that don't know what to build. Maybe flair was abit misplaced.
---
Exactly what Trollicus said.  It's way easier on alliance cuz of near instant que's.  Super hard for horde to pull off more than a few peeps in the group getting the same que though.
---
Don't sleep on Stoneform and Escape Artist---They may not be flashy but they're still really good for every class that can have them.
---
Stoneform in particular is probably my favorite PvP racial because it makes you immune to a lot of obnoxious effects like rogue poisons, viper sting, rogue/cat dots, etc and the extra armor is kinda nice too.
---
As an added side-bonus it utterly dumpsters those gimmicky rogue bleed builds that sometimes show up---They unload all their dots onto you thinking you're already dead but nope, stoneform and they've burned everything they've got and have nothing to show for it.
---
Shit, I'd trade any alliance player WotF if I could get Stoneform.
---
WotF is just like... Oh boy, rogues are better at 1v1ing priests/warlocks and UD priests/warlocks get a slight edge over alliance priests/warlocks. 
---
And it still won't make warriors and mages any less horrible against them (especially given that warrior already *has* a ton of fear immunity and it's not helping them any)
---
Never do the mines, loot bodies man. If you loot 20 bodies you should be good to almost complete every quest.
---
I make 2 stacks bare minimum per mana user and that‚Äôs usually if I‚Äôm last to join last at instance. If I had 5 minutes while everyone else was on the way to the dungeon or I was in IF waiting for the group to finish forming all I‚Äôm doing is making water. I usually wanna make 4 stacks per mana user, but there are plenty of times I‚Äôll give 6, depends on how many mana users we have in the party. Healers get top priority.
---
Grobbulus is dead now tho. So sad. Nobody else bother transfering there please.
---
Xa! Traitor! That's a gkick!
---
About 10 minutes for AV.
---
If AV doesn't last 12 hours, it's not the classic experience.
---
Peasant Mounts - My guild calls em
---
you cant even take a few days off those boring real life things to do something that is fun? i pity you, i really do. honestly sorry man :(
---
Fair point but here‚Äôs my counter: unclear how people ranking together are doing on the horde side given the inability to queue together but I would think that people ranking together would all be in and out of BGs and queues at different times.
---
It's pretty easy to queue 20 to 25 as alliance
---
Completely agreed. I like FFXIV's story and presentation for example, but it's a million times more clunky feeling than WoW's combat. Something about the way WoW controls is perfect, things come out snappily and theres so much quality of life to it. Even player movement feels perfect.
---
Ah I'll agree with that, they were definitely more common in wPvP. Still though, frost reflectors seem way more common. Well at least if the constant whining and moaning from my mage bros is anything to go by.
---
the image is comparing what two people enjoy it wasn‚Äôt throwing shade on either or
---
Yup. The moment people say go galv, others will fucking screech and say it'll end badly, turtle we lose etc
---
the blue gear arent crap at all. Good stats allocation for pvp Id wear alot of them pieces over mc
---
but I guess if text colot is all that matters to you then they are crap
---
found out today to fish in AV you need 175+ fishing... (100+bobber)
---
i carry water. but its shit water and cost money
---
What's the deal with potion cooldowns? If I use invis pot (10 minute cd), other potions go on 2 minute cd like normal. But if I use AV mana pot (5 minute cd), it puts every other potion on 5 minute cd.
---
oof, i should have taken a screenshot too since my last AV for today lasted 26 minutes and we, the horde, won with 5k bonus honor while the alliance got 1700.
---
ZF
---
No healers?
---
try killing them from the barrens side
---
[https://imgur.com/D7MCeks](https://imgur.com/D7MCeks)
---
Yep, very clearly struggling for wins over here mate. Literally won this game as I was typing this response btw.
---
Maybe you're just bad?
---
Also, what is there to not understand about using my consumables on myself during PvP? I farmed thousands of gold to bank them for Phase 2 and 3, why wouldn't I use them?
---
The issue here is other people not wanting to spend THEIR gold to buy basic consumes from mages on THEIR server before they queue into BGs. It's about THEM being cheap.
---
How does it not make sense that someone who already spends time, and gold, and plays well is upset that casuals come into their games expecting the players who prepared to carry them EVEN MORE by providing them with something they should already have?
---
Why is it my responsibility to carry them so hard? They haven't proven anything to me that tells me they will actually play a decent game, and if they come into the AV without proper consumes, I can basically guarantee they are just there to leech.
---
What is so hard to understand about any of this?
---
It is a bug because it is possible to do this same method and have the original heal not crit. Divine favor should be affecting the "next" heal, not the current heal.
---
Well most class trinkets remove fear and them being undead is just something you have to expect. On my server there are almost as many undeads level 50-60 as there are humans, dwarves, gnomes and nightelves combined. So over the years on private servers I've learnt to rely less and less on fear. It's a powerful CC but it's quite rare that you can use it effectively.
---
He really should be hunting while the rest of the Zerg rushes the victory. I imagine he‚Äôs probably taking a break so might as well gain honor while doing so right?
---
I don't know the specific, but the concept makes sense
---
It doesn't even confirm character length. I tried it with something waaaaay past the 12 character limit, and it worked fine.
---
But pally is overpowered. Just not dps pally
---
You get more honor if you participate in fighting. The bonus honor is literally just that.. bonus... you can still get ALOT of honor by killing other players and that is not Battlegroundwide, you have to be there on the kill.
---
I have gotten more honor from killing blows on people than just being there, infact being dead wont net you any honor kills.
---
I watched my honor tab closely today and before the BG was even over i had gained 1k honor from only kills, then when the BG ended i got all the bonus honor aswell.
---
You can be actively killing players and get kicked. People will mass report and it'll trigger the kick no matter what.
---
More specifically you take 1 dura damage periodically when in combat so you don't even have to be hit to lose dura.
---
I hate that I read that in the fucking dwarf accent
---
No need to be an ass. You can just pass to the next post.
---
Considering how easily you get T2 head with reset every 5 days and good drop rates I'd say mageblade would go for at least 1k
---
Yeah I guess it just depends on your reference frame, I don't personally play retail so I'm not too familiar with the loot system there but the power creep seems to be much higher there judging from what you've said.
---
Wait Alliance lose almost all AVs? I'm not arguing that Alliance does dumb stuff in AV, but in all the time I've played (Vanilla-WoD, now classic) I've never lost more AVs than I've won.
---
Yeah the sheep lasts wayyy too long
---
must been a long break beacuse he stood there for for the entire duration of the BG, (25 min ish or so)
---
No the system is far more accurate, you cannot simply jump in place every five minutes, you need to preform actual actions. As it turns out fishing counts as an action but that is probably an oversight because fish were removed from battle grounds way before the latest draconian system was introduced.
---
Literally unplayable
---
So ask your guild mages to make you some before you go out and BG?
---
They should be very happy to make as much as you want for free. I've made 24 stacks on request for someone before and didn't charge a dime because they were a guildie playing Elemental Shaman in a raid (they go oom SUPER fast).
---
I am happy to provide for my guild, are your mages not the same way?
---
It‚Äôs usually a very contested area but depending on the server it could be good 
---
My server it‚Äôs basically always camped by people farming ele earth
---
Perfect. There‚Äôs a TON of people leveling ally side on Benediction. You‚Äôll have no issues finding groups.
---
Wonder how many people know about the giant on the island with the statue
---
Every drek rush I've had today has lost because horde have 5 - 10 people trinket back and pick off alliance while they have no graveyards capped, and then it's GG.  Literally 100% loss rate if horde does that.
---
Westfall, check my post history
---
Right on brother. First time round I had to kill less than 10 zhevras and it felt wrong. Good thing on my alt it was like 40.
---
Is that common on alliance? Never heard anyone whine over people defending. But maybe that's different for horde
---
Check how he presented the information vs how you did.  If you had simply said your piece without the attempted jab at the end he probably would have ben grateful.  
---
People might be more open to listening to advice when its not in a condescending tone.  Even here in your last sentence you say chasing +healing is stupid and insinuate anyone who does that is dumb.  Situationally true but its just as easy to say it like that vs talking down to people.
---
I was doing zf making about 25 gphr at best (wasn't able to hit 5 clears/hr) and I have frostbite now so it's not really possible
---
You cap RH as part of rush.
---
Hmm, I‚Äôd love to have an auction for that but I‚Äôm sure not everyone would agree since not everyone is rolling in gold.
---
Yea forgot spirit buff exists. Never seen one on my rogue :p You can always ask to put the casters in the same groups for spirit.
---
What addon does the Warcraft 3 style quest tests?
---
So why'd you confirm it?
---
Why would you include edgemasters? No need for weapon skill in pvp. Also you said this was for a fresh 60 and some of this gear is not easily attained like onslaught girdle or the breastplate.
---
That's right. Provide no argument and detract from the topic. You started this and can't even finish it because you know you look like an ignorant moron. You're so pathetic hahaha. Get a life and stop trying to pick apart every little thing strangers do on the internet.
---
Remember the chat lag recently? Its thousands of ppl using HonorSpy and their addons syncing the leaderbords again and again which was basically DDoSing the server.
---
Black lotuses were 140g each on my last server lol. Herby is King. Ghost mushrooms even spawn outside the entrance to marudon from the middle fork, to both the entrances of the orange and purple side aswell. Plus the mushrooms in the instance too.
---
Well, that's just shitty "streamer" pre-mades doing shitty "streamer" things.  üôÅ
---
It takes 5 minutes to cap it.  In those 5 minutes the horde will kill you and take FW, which ensures that every death sends you back to aid station or tunnel.  It's seriously braindead  easy.  Horde can also skip FW if alliance have too many there, to get more people into drek's room.  
---
The zerg rush is so fucking weak it isn't funny. 
---
It works great if horde has no defense, but if they always do now, and they always pick people off, and those people end up on the other side of the map ensuring horde wins because they went for objectives.
---
The community that follows streamers is toxic and childish.
---
You just sitting back eating paint chips or something?
---
How do stealth classes cap a gy when they're guarded by multiple npcs, including an elite?
---
Nah. I leave that to the Alliance.

I went against a Herod alliance pre-made earlier that was around there.  Sucks for the guys that dont get in.  But if you have an "honor focus" person set, I'm sure it's amazing for them.
---
What do you mean by reset the swing timer? So you are fighting and get Crit do you get a charge?
---
When you release that charge before a swing does it give you two auto attacks or just one? 
---
Or are you meaning when in mid swing if you release reck it just makes the current attack instant? 
---
Sorry I don't Pally.
---
Horde can get 3k honor in 7 minutes by killing balinda, captains and lieutenants, how is a 90 minute win faster?
---
Yeah just a constant
---
I tested it. I don't get kicked and all I do is shuffle around a bit and jump.
---
You are right that Blizzard has something in place to detect basic jump autohotkeys, but there are plenty of bots that bypass that.
---
GFPP helps alot also u can grab fire resistance buff from spellbinders in UBRS for some extra juice ( priest Mind Controls the mob and buffs the raid with the mob¬¥s spell )
---
Mission: joke
---
Status: failed
---
90 minutes is on the extreme end - the Alliance should have thrown long ago by your reasoning. But, 10-20 minute queue times makes winning more efficient.
---
You got me good!
---
Yepp, so long as they aren't cheating by having functions automated through keyboard macros, etc blizzard just sees them as 20 players rather than 1 person controlling 20.
---
It's called Immersion
---
There's a decent chance your solo Q's happen to have a premade in them.
---
One of the first things I say, is don't cap SH GY.  And usually people listen.  So when the zerg fails and the whole alliance team ends up at the base.  You know they recalled back.  It's pretty crazy IMO that they would really try that hard to prolong a loss.
---
I guess it‚Äôll depend if it‚Äôs efficient but I feel like even if it was that would lead to alliance once again not leaving cities and then who are you farming? If tops rankers don‚Äôt see it being worth doing than a lot less people would follow
---
Honestly, warrior just sucks in pugs.
---
You can have a lot of fun doing WSG premades, but any random pvp as a warrior will be miserable.
---
I love you for this.
---
Anything to fuck with minmaxers.
---
Back capping is not turtling, it's guaranteeing victory.
---
Everyone in the group needs the greater fire protection potions. You may find it helpful to get the +80 Fire resist buff from Blackrock spire before pulling rag, we did on the first 2 kills.
---
 https://imgur.com/L7zGkph

I would be scared too if I won this often, I don't blame you friend.
---
your a loser
---
You're*
---
yeah the skill of hoping we get a lucky seal of command crit lol
---
hopefully we get crusader strike eventually
---
War is hell.
---
I generally solo cap Stormpike Aid Station or grab a group of mages and suicide wipe Alliance at Galvangar, no healer required there.
---
Honestly, I get so few heals in most BGs that I actually stop and say "ty" to people who do heal me, it's that rare that I feel the need to call it out when it happens.
---
Most healers are far too busy keeping their warrior buddies alive, no time for us poor mages.
---
they had both for last hour or so :D
---
It's the circle of life. That 60 also got ganked when they were 20... Don't worry you'll get your turn.
---
Lmao that mind control strategy is pretty awesome. But priest has to buff 39 people individually?! Doesn't it take long? With that buff we surely don't need greater fire? Normal fire would work?
---
I have never been a fan of attacking people who are gray or who have res sickness however it must come down to a disdain for the opposing faction. Even my ‚Äúdie alliance scum‚Äù policy stops after one kill... 
---
Then again, my brother kills (or at least attacks) everyone in sight because ‚Äúif they had the advantage or the jump they‚Äôd have done it to me‚Äù  which also rings very true.
---
Mages can benefit from this still. You set your hearth wherever. If it‚Äôs on CD and u need to hearth again just teleport to Org and ghetto hearth using RFC
---
Edit: SW using stockades for you alliance mages
---
Okay, well that‚Äôs good to know but it‚Äôs clear they are getting better with there Algorithms.
---
The normal pots won't cut it right?
---
Some people genuinely enjoy feeling all powerful. I don‚Äôt get it either. Freud would probably say they have small genitals.
---
Imagine being proud of two wins in an hour.
---
Horde life is rough huh. Sorry bout your terrible faction but I'm glad it's a containment ground for people like you.
---
Isn't that a night elf?
---
TB. Inn and everything all there
---
I've tried nobody bites for me
---
Ah, by that time it's too late if they still have Aid Station.  They will all respawn at the closest one.  Snatching SH GY early and wiping the zerg is a guaranteed turtle. 
---
Pretty much never touch SH GY till they have Snowfall 100% capped.
---
Edit: Snowfall is the worst GY on the map, and we always want alliance to go for it lol.
---
This person probably isn‚Äôt a warrior and probably can‚Äôt put themselves in someone else‚Äôs shoes. Just ignore.
---
Maybe try selling them in bgs
---
&gt; Horde constantly lose to Ally zerg
---
&gt; Horde adapts and changes strategy sending 5-10 back to defense
---
Alliance: OMFG HORDE TURTLES SO MUCH QQQQQ
---
I didn't, those are stronghold gauntlets
---
Also, you'd see alternatives to the gear if you read the guide :/
---
Dang man I feel for you...but ty for posting to remind me to leave this subreddit just as I did this game lol gl hf bro and I hope you get your drop

Normally it's just like missing one in a few games, so it works out decently well.

That xp tho

Lol sorry didn‚Äôt mean to be a dick. You are correct and I‚Äôm sorry üòò
---
&gt; poor mages
---
You're literally a douchebag who refuses to give out water.
---
&gt; Most healers are far too busy
---
You're literally a douchebag who's too busy to give out water
---
&gt; Honestly, I get so few heals
---
&gt;  it's that rare that I feel the need to call it out when it happens.
---
You are special.
---
No that's why everyone is saying greater. Your whole raid buy 2 and rag goes down ez. My guild does this every week its neither expensive nor hard to aquire.
---
People who enjoy the game without min/maxing just don't don't understand it well enough yet
---
&gt;You're a bad person. Like actually, think about the sort of person you are being.
---
I am a bad person because I get upset when people are toxic to me when I don't want to do something they ask me to do for them? People that I won't ever interact with again. You are telling me that I am a bad person for not wanting to be around, communicate with, or help toxic people? People on other servers actively flame me and call me all sorts of shit up down and sideways when they hear that simple word, "no", and you expect me to want to help those same people?
---
You have to be trolling at this point, there is no way any sane person thinks this way. 
---
To put it another way...
---
Do you give every homeless person that you see money when you pass them on the street? If I did that in my city I wouldn't be able to support my family. Who do you think is more important, some random bum I will never see again, or my Wife, my Mom, my Dad, and other people I have a deep connection and bond with and whom I support financially? Why would I have any incentive to give that homeless person my hard earned money aside from making myself feel good in a very selfish sort of way (wow that homeless person would have never gotten by without ME to give him that $5, I am SUCH a GOOD PERSON WOW, GO ME)? Why should I trust that homeless person is going to use my $5 in a positive way for himself, or other people around him? Why should I not invest that towards my family's future in a way that makes sense for the people I really care about?
---
And, here is the kicker, I could take that $5 and donate it to some charity or organization of my choosing (and I do, I donate back to my University every year because they helped put me in a position in my life to succeed in a very real way). But, to expect me to take that $5 and another $5, and another, and another, and just give it to everyone who asked me for $5, I'd eventually have to put my foot down and say no to someone.
---
You have to make choices in your life, who you care about, who you help. If you want to say to me straightfaced that you'd help any random stranger on the street who asked you for a moment of your time, I'm going to call you a liar and not feel an ounce of shame about it because there is nothing wrong with calling a spade a spade.
---
At least I am honest with myself about that fact. You act like you go around helping everyone you see, when I bet you're sitting there armchair QB'ing this whole situation trying to create a sense of moral superiority over me even though you literally have no idea who I am, what I do with my life, and how generous I may or may not be outside of this one, extremely specific circumstance.
---
How you can sit there without a single iota of self-reflection, think about yourself, and why you feel the need to be superior over someone you've never met in an online forum.
---
I've built homes for people in Louisiana post-Katrina. I've installed toilets and painted houses, poured concrete and laid foundation for the Lakota Peoples of South Dakota in one of the poorest Native American reservations in the entire USA. All of this volunteer work done without one shred of expectation from anyone. I've spent my time packaging food for people in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew and working in Soup Kitchens in the south side of Chicago, one of the most dangerous places to be as a white person in America. Dude, if I am a bad person, I PRAY for this world, because it is surely not long for us.
---
keeping the stacks was a bug and unfair to clothies who got 1 shot by it and there was a paly on my server that would also use invis pots to get past everyone to one shot clothies where atleast rouges take a bit of time and can have a team mate come back and save the healer I personally didn't care as a warrior since it would 1 shot me
---
Holy Paladin is a very strong class set, especially 1v1. The issue is they've forced everyone to go that spec in PvP in order to be competitive. Reckoning somewhat balanced the playing field for 2H paladin, but now it's completely dead (if they don't revert or fix this change).
---
Honestly, it should be. Every group that gets hit with Rag's fireball gets the damaged absorbed, then runs back to their spots. Saves the healers a substantial amount of mana. And keeps dps alive.
---
Just queue for AV get free food and water and leave
---
You mean the original game UI? Lol
---
this made me laugh so much haha
---
Did the same thing with a piece of might bracers. Meant to put them up for 540g but only posted for 5g40s lmfao. Bought out the moment I posted it. Must‚Äôve been an auction house bot
---
You should be getting him down further than 60%. How is your raid DPS? Are they pre-bis? Do they have greens? Make sure your DPS is efficient. That sounds like it might be a big problem
---
This isn't your reddit account
---
Man queue times are pretty rough, but I appreciate you not being able to detect sarcasm at all.
---
How is your AV rep grind going? Exalted yet?
---
P.S. - The honor grind is actually easier for me than it is for you since you have more competition and have to play more games. How does this make you feel?
---
Meta already shifted a lot from that. Horde always send some form of defence while the rest work on winning the game. My experience after day 1 was 90% losses to horde in 30 mins games. I guess they rather win a 30min game with max honor than lose a 7min one.
---
Hit Revered in AV today. As soon as I'm done, I'm going to be living in WSG. I just want my ring and Rank Trinket first.
---
Black baron cloak (strat ud), pads of the dread wolf(lbrs), cadaverous chest(scholo). Devilsaur gloves and legs(ah), tarnished elven rings(dm n), dal rends(ubrs), bracers of the eclipse(dm w), mask of the unforgiven(strat live). You have a lot of stuff to hunt for.  Just focus on hitting 60 for now and run whatever dungeon you can get your hands on.
---
Just Google "pre raid bis rogue classic"
---
Hrs polite to ask. If people aren‚Äôt polite don‚Äôt reward their bad behavior.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna pay for water that disappears if i log out
---
It's because there's a 10 minute queue so it's close to efficient and it's more fun to try and win
---
How does it feel to be triggered so hard right now that I'm taking up free real estate in your head and probably will for the next several days?
---
Yeah, and if you own the farm, you can
---
Yeah uhhhhhh I assume you're being sarcastic, but it's not paid. This is all volunteer.
---
Yep I finally got the item rack addon just for fast switching between trinkets on the fly. Idk how I‚Äôve had the patience to manually equip trinkets before now but I don‚Äôt see how I could ever go back.
---
Usually two stealthers. One pulls mobs and runs other caps.
---
Actually AV was my favorite back then, however this rush fest is not as fun.
---
But with more objectives the PvP will automatically increase. For example if you need all 4  towers to kill the commander you will always have some people defending the towers. Because it will greatly increase your defence to hold those towers. Same with the mines. If the mines would give you some sort of bonus on your defence/offence people would capture them.
---
The honor for pvping is the same as in wpvp. Like 250 for a kill if you are alone, split up for everyone near you. Honour for pvp-kills is non-existant in this BG. Its only the honor for killing galv/balinda and the end boss.
---
Yes, you are absolutely right if you want to decrease the honour gain from NPCs, but if one team manages to kill 4 towers and the other team manages to kill the end boss, there should not be a big honour difference.
---
Ah, so you're one of those illiterates I have been hearing about.
---
Though I find it amazing you've memorized how to write this exact sentence with a QWERTY keyboard, that's pretty good!
---
Go you! Really knocking out those life goals insulting people on the internet eh!
---
I do it cause I'm just trying to have fun playing a game instead of chasing a rank I'll never get
---
As queues get longer, more incentive for horde to win, and alliance to give up
---
As a horde, trust me.  It doesn't take many alliance to defend either.  We dont push north fast.  We dont D towers we cap, and usually not even GYs.
---
I report afk horde when I can, but probably doesn't help much overall.
---
From my experience as a horde, if you break the zerg alliance looses their shit and has zero back up plans.  Horde never started with wins, we are a juggunaut across the battle field.  It really is hard to break our will.  The longer the battle lasts, the more officers we kill for honor.  And a better chance to win for more rep.
---
As an Alliance, thank you for your service.
---
You‚Äôre locked behind a gate for the first like 90 seconds anyway
---
Thank you.
---
Is it pretty active at night? I‚Äôd be getting on around 10:30 server time
---
Why do people think that being comprehensive and explaining yourself thoroughly is a bad thing?
---
Oh wait you're that illiterate chap from earlier. You did some more memorizing, good job! Maybe you should take that time and learn how to read more than 128 characters at a time though.
---
Post deleted? Oh no!
---
Just go left and you'll be fine...
---
Is it possible to alter this somewhat to reset instances while farming? (Solo jump runs)
---
I just can tell you he was kicked within 2 minutes after the reports began.
---
I dont know if he was reported previously or by other raid groups, just that he was instantly kicked from the game as soon as he was mass reported by us. We were a 25 "premage" in this BG btw.
---
No. Ghost run to South GY and res there.
---
:\^)
---
I thought he was depicting the alpha starving tigers in hillsbrad, those are also really far apart
---
I'll get Unstoppable Force soon, I can guarentee myself that.  Next goal is BRE in the Hope's that future bosses have a bit more armor lol.
---
I'm talking about 9 lvls that gave lvl 60s honour and I'm talking about phase 2 before bgs released.
---
Edit: Unauotcorrected a word
---
I tried helping, leading the raid to victory. But, no one ever listens. I gave up and afk to play halo mcc while the zombies farm honor for me
---
Unlikely, even at 30 minute queues the honor is simply that much better than in the world and if honor is their goal their presumably higher rank makes them get even less honor per kill on the bulk of the populace.
---
The Wowhead page you cite also lists the cooldown as 1 second.
---
BS
---
I promise you this isn't worth it. Just respect and farm gold as fury/arms and buy Forors instead.
---
For undead, we call it the sickly horse.
---
Ofc its rewarding. As much as speedrunning MC is rewarding. But would you like to do that 3 month in a row?
---
Go get your god damn epic mount.  Stop leeching honor and rep in AV.  The open word is entirely open, on my server at least prices for things like Felcloth have already started rising. Find a grind, grind it, get your mount.  Don‚Äôt be a leech.
---
Am I asshole for reporting every afk person i see ?
---
How have you *not* noticed that honorspy doesn't update before the next day?
---
I highly recommend having everyone in your raid that heals use HealComm. This is huge for me because I no longer have to worry about getting heal sniped with my slower heals.
---
I mean while they are still in qeue waiting to join AV, to kill time and gain some more honor meamwhile, doesnt matter where u are in the world when u get pop for bg u just join, but standin around in the alterac cabe for example will be pretty boring if qeues reach 30+minutes.
---
It's Orgrimmar dumping all those plastic straws in the river.
---
 k next
---
not sure what games everyone has been in but im on like a 10 win spree tonight all of which were forced into turtles by horde and we ended up beating them anyways despite ice boi.  Had a 63 minute game about 3 hours ago,  pretty sure Horde was mad when they lost.  The 63 minute round as soon as Horde put 20 on defense we just went back Van and then walked like a sweeping plague across the map on them.
---
thank you bro
---
/dbm pull
---
My friends and I were just commenting how its waaaaay less fun to solo queue..feels like retail, playing with people I'll never seen again.
---
Although it makes it cool when randomly get in with guildies.
---
See, you dont have an arguments, so you just downvote. Lulz
---
Awesome, ty!
---
If you're talking just solo farming (DoTs + Drain Life) then yes SL/Nightfall is still plenty strong at drain tanking 1-2 mobs efficiently enough.
---
Part of what's so appealing about SM/Ruin (or Dark Pact/almost ruin, if you're still not 60) is that the talents in Destro still let you hurl big crit shadowbolts, which is necessary for contributing sustained DPS in a raid (or general dungeon for that matter). SL, lacking ruin, can't compete in a group setting where max DPS is desired above survivability.
---
&gt; have been kicking casts in PvP based off pure hunches...
---
As god intended.
---
You do realize you can queue from battlemasters in cities not just in the alterac cave first off right?
---
2nd there are less people in the world now due to bgs.  Theoretically you could get a group, fly somewhere and camp up but you're gonna be talking at best a couple of hundred honor for that effort.  The people out in the world now are those looking to farm now that the cancer griefers are in bgs and aren't gonna keep coming back for a fight or getting people to help and get you honor in the world, they'll just fly off somewhere else and warn people you are out griefing (or go back to a cap city).
---
I also apologize to you, fragile gentleman.
---
I joined a balanced server and don't deserve any of this!! haha

how exactly do you think reckoning use to work? The whole mindlessly reck bombing things just kinds proves that you dont really have a clue as to what mechanics behind it were
---
One thing thay bothers me. "See crowd, go ham" and you have hamstring or howl when in crowd. you always whant to use howl.  Or Am I incorect in this ?
---
Yeh it's really common, as soon as we lose the gy down south people get so angry for defending in the north as they just want the game to end rather than trying to push down south again.
---
Actually no, never went left.
---
or may be horde got superior pvp racial trait so their turtle at drek is much harder to break through
---
I got it. And exhaled through the nose. Good one.
---
Yes. Me and like everyone who plays Alliance hate those who defend. If the rush fails we type "let them end dont def"
---
grow up
---
If ally turtled Horde wouldn't break through either...we just have instant queues so most people just give up if Horde play aggressive defense.
---
Pally buffs make up for Horde racials in a PVE map.
---
Just to clarify, they're suggesting that no one wear FR gear except the two tanks. Everyone else just has 2 GFPP and it's ezpz.
---
Oh maybe I was misinformed. My mistake. üòä
---
For alliance, you get storm crystals from pvp and rarely npc drops. Turn 200 total in (200 from team, not one person) to a person in the cave at start. They walk out a bit to a new location and start a summoning portal. Then you need 10 players to click the portal and summon the npc (just like a warlock summoning portal)
---
Horde is same but you get blood drops instead of storm crystals.
---
Yeah!   
---
They should just start balancing Classic now. Screw preserving the experience people paid for!
---
You beat RUSSIA in the WINTER?
---
You don‚Äôt compete with the honor gains of the opposing faction. So everyone in the Horde getting more honor on average than the Alliance actually means nothing.
---
Few dozen I'd say. Especially the first day or 2. He would clear EVERYONE off the NPC with sappers
---
i was in touch with the guy who sorts of the brackets for our server wich also happens to be a guildmate to this player and was asking for "proofs" and was saying they would 100% report the player, once he got the proof and realized who the player was he turned very quickly into defending the player with excuses like "everyone is doing it"
---
The clicking physically hurt me
---
Horde Always win Long games
---
Hey no worries bro! Since they decided to change classic i guess that opens up the possibility to nerf some of the other op classes.
---
Biizzard is spammer :0
---
the russians get Chromie? thats not fair :(
---
I dont play on Shazzrah, but what I saw on the bg¬¥s from that server... jesus poor people... abuse shit when they can, spit on everyone they see/kill and yeah, atleast the horde site, cant tell much about allys.
---
&gt;  We try to leave either SH GY or SF GY to them so we aren't forcing them to turtle.
---
and every horde and their mums rez up at IB and create a big turtle fest right?
---
I know the feeling.
---
As a alliance I still win most of my games. If the ally don‚Äôt argue about going Galv first then we win almost every time
---
ÂÜÖË£§Ôºü
---
It's an RP server I think.
---
Like your brother's playstyle is just good pvp tactics, but it suggests some sort of parity between the opposing players. If your brother kills grays to keep the upper hand you should tell him he's a huge coward.
---
Well, depends if you're trying to single out a healer it's better to apply hamstring, or why not both :)
---
Maybe someone didn't have autoloot on or had no space in their bags so they left vendor trash on them, causing the corpses to stay for a while longer?
---
I feel your pain. Our OT Druid (who is 6th in line for Druid tier gear) has 7/8 T1 and T2 helm... while we have had about 5 pieces of rogue tier gear drop since the start of classic
---
Both teams afk homie.
---
About 100g/hr doing tribute solo
---
Blizzard has already nerfed runeblade off baron from giving 1:1 scaling (this 1:1 was on wow-tools, so it wasn't a bug) on the aura to giving no scaling. The scaling on runeblade allowed people to stack +healing and get that much Hp5.
---
In reckoning's case, they're insisting that it functions similar to parry-haste. They are wrong, and this is a link that has video evidence of reckoning working pre-nerf in vanilla.

I dont understand the streamer circle jerk, as someone who plays on faerlina i've never had a negative experience with anyone and have meet some amazingly skilled pvpers and great guild.
---
AV premade is about 20k/hour. You can also pull high numbers if you solo PVP around the middle.
---
WSG is only worth doing if you're bracket stacking and want a change of scenery.
---
***parade***

Chestnut in mare?

Must you make it sound so dirty?
---
Waow, a witty comment demeaning OP's thread
---
truly epic
---
only see this each time i open a new reddit tab
---
I mean yeah, until we get Stormpike GY we all res at Iceblood.  But that's mid field, not even close to a turtle.  Unless alliance cap Iceblood, and then it is their fault because they forced it.  Exactly why I tell horde to never touch Stonehearth.
---
I think that depends on server and playtime.  I know from midnight to 2am when I play hunters have a hard time selling items
---
The only true answer to this is because it first happened to them while they were leveling
---
I switch back and forth my man but I have a Horde tattoo on my leg that pretty much sums up my commitment - I had it before Classic so I can‚Äôt say I picked Horde for the PvP racials nor would I do that anyway.
---
I gank lowbies as vengeance for when it took 12 deaths to get from Thorium Point to BRD. I literally KOS anyone level 53 and below as a level 60.  But I leave 54+ alone because I'm prot spec and I ain't got all day.
---
Sounds like a system built more for people who want to increase their personal power over making the guild as strong as possible.
---
This is without selling items
---
If nobody is breaking brackets you can do that, but solo players can get decent honor/h in AV and if that one random guy refuses to play nice he can force everyone to work much harder. If AV slows down or gets nerfed it won't be an issue but for now there's not much choice.
---
Muh internet points!
---
Also you haven‚Äôt countered my argument other than ‚Äúwell Blizzard could just cherry pick.‚Äù That‚Äôs not an argument. That‚Äôs an excuse to whine.
---
You're right here describing a meta raidwide strategy being implemented on the horde side. Meanwhile Ally has one strat: follow the zerg. If the zerg is broken, you'll never get 20-25 ally grouped up to do anything at all, except the default def-the-choke at SP. Fighting down the map one Tower at a time would also be a better strat for ally when zerg fails but never happens. Nothing about hordes being bog brained or anything, just the way it plays out.
---
Man, I thought the opposite I feel like you could do so much better than ‚ÄúBiizard‚Äù
---
Just saw a tauran warr rocking vendorstrike and almost thought that was you lol.
---
My que has never been over 8 mins
---
bro bracket 1 players queue av in their sleep
---
If the singular strategy requires that 40 people work together and 1 person can change the whole outcome of the strategy within the first 2 minutes means that it's not a sustainable strategy (nor a singular or optimal strategy)
---
Your Stronghold Awaits!!!!!

waste of rage to apply both.

Look at the 2 piece bonus, it's an upgrade for nearly every class to put 2 pieces of it on
---
And then renataki's so you can live the dream in PVP too?
---
As someone who rolled Horde on a fairly balanced server in classic and played Horde during TBC, I really, really want faction changes for classic.
---
We had instant queues in TBC, and I didn' think that many people would also roll Horde this time around. I love playing my undead warlock, but I'd happily pay 35$ to switch to gnome and get those insta queues.
---
if rank 14 is your goal im seriously depressed and concerned for your well-being for the amount of time dedicated to what is supposed to be a game.
---
Its much more fun. I dont like losing, even if it were more efficient I still wouldn't like having my ass handed to me every. Single. Game. Its demoralizing
---
Why did I like this so much
---
Why am I a dick?
---
For 4 months of Classic WoW, water / food service from mages has been offered at a fair value of 1g for 6 stacks of food or water.
---
Why am I a dick for expecting that to remain the standard?
---
Why aren't other people dicks for expecting to get something for free from me that every mage on every major server offers for 1g for 6 stacks?
---
Where else are they going to get water from except for a mage? Vendor water? 13g for 6 stacks, not exactly a good deal.
---
As I have said earlier, when I enter an AV, my goals are not aligned with the goals of my teammates, so there is no "common ground" for us to stand on. It isn't a 5 man dungeon, it isn't a PvE raid, and you aren't my guildmate.
---
Why do you expect me to give you something for free that has an established standard price and has been that way for months?
---
Nothing has changed except for the activities that most people are engaging in, so why should that change the established standard value of water? It's not like people went out to a 5 man dungeon and if there wasn't a mage there, they just said to there party, "Sorry, can't heal today, no water!"
---
No, that person hearthstoned to Kargath, paid a mage 1g for 6 stacks of water/food and a portal, and went on his or her merry way. Apparently, now that the "merry way" is Alterac Valley, people seem to think they don't need to pay for water anymore.
---
I'm here to let them know the standard is and always will be 1g for 6 stacks, and regardless of what activity you do, you should be happy to pay a mage some nominal amount for water because the ONLY alternative is over 10 times more expensive.
---
This doesn't make me a dick, it makes me someone who expects long established standards with logical backing to remain the same.
---
Since friday horde are winning every game.
---
You‚Äôre better off with a succubus with her abilities turned off. She‚Äôll still do ~20% of your DPS just by auto attacking, regens mana quickly, and also can seduce a ganker or extra mob when necessary.
---
It's about 20k/hour when there's enough people on. A few people miss queue but overall it's pretty reliable.
---
There's a couple randoms that are pushing very high honor but it takes an insane amount of time so it's not widespread and hey, they deserve the bracket spots for spending so much time on it.
---
In the lower brackets, unless you are wearing ‚Äúof the eagle‚Äù gear, Viper Sting is CRAZY expensive on mana. I test the waters out on classes that can cleanse it. If they are smart enough to cleanse, I won‚Äôt reapply because my mana pool will be gone. I do love me some druids that won‚Äôt cure poisons though.
---
Lock set blows, look at mage set
---
I am alliance and this is cringe
---
Fucking mememasters in action!
---
I mean on alliance side
---
Kinda guessed a pet on auto would help a bit more than one just pure regen.  And yeah for Succy her other abilities can come in super handy on a pvp server.
---
Also on Blaumeux Alliance! I recently hit 60 so will definitely need a tank for dungeons.
---
Yeah honestly towards the end of the day it felt more spoke 75% or something but I knew if I said that someone would get in a pissing contest and dispute it. Point is Horde is definitely adapting to the Zerg and as of right now it looks like Alliance doesn't know wtf to so.
---
A pair of shamans named touchmytotem and totemtlucher
---
People are always going to hate it but honestly I don‚Äôt understand the problem..
---
You weren‚Äôt going to tank any dungeon at all but decided you would on some conditions - if people don‚Äôt want to take your offer thats fine but noone has gained or lost anything by you reserving.
---
It should be a net positive to the server that someone is willing to tank a specific place - because if they could get a tank without paying they would do it - and if they can‚Äôt find a tank to do it then they would have gone without anyway..
---
It's not really possible to dodge in classic with huge battlegroups and potentially to many premades.
---
PvE
---
Sound like the same issue Alliance has. Just replace SP with RH and Balinda with Galv
---
I dont see how pug AV alliance can even come close to a pre-made.  I know we dont compete as horde and alliance.  But I do kinda see where alliance is at.  Most games alliance even with a win is low honor, the few exceptions I've seen were pretty long games.
---
I think people are missing the point - Drek is dead on the ground but the Horde won
---
"Literally everything wrong with this game is Horde's fault" -Alliance players
---
This is true they don't directly compete, but the fact still stands that the alliance are missing massive amounts of potential honor.
---
Looks like I'm getting that addon
---
It is currently up on eu servers. Gobto ironforge/orgrimmar
---
I'd argue that this is even more useful as a mage than anyone else. You have access to instances in SW and Org. That means that no matter where you go in Azeroth and no matter what the CD on your hearthstone is, you can always get to your hearth location in under 2 minutes. That is something no other class can say (except shaman lol).
---
6pc shadowcraft with devilsaur set or truestrikes+cadaverous, double tarnished elven rings, satyrs bow, rend's swords, hand of justice, blackhands breadth, and mark of fordring are your prebis. Feel free to get the other assorted armor pieces on the typical outdated prebis listings if you want, but 6pc shadowcraft doesn't start getting beat until you've got tier 1/2 pieces.
---
I make an exception for Horde questing in Hillsbrad. Basically the Forsaken send players off to go kill farmhands, civilians and other non-combatants on the town.
---
That doesn't sit well with me, so anytime I'm passing through, I always check to see what's going on there. If some Horde is slaughtering the town, I'll go out of my way to ruin their day.
---
I did it back in Vanilla, and I'm doing it again in Classic.
---
Kinda like you said, but from my perspective it's the whole alliance team heading to Relief Hut and trying to convince 10 ish to stop and kill Galv and Officers.  Which has seemed to happen more regularly in the past day or two, and has led to more horde wins.
---
Stoneform is fucking nuts
---
Nailed it.  I did this three or so times and asked myself the question and this answer was all I came up with.  So I stopped.  Was a real introspective learning experience.
---
As a resto drood in Vanilla, I lived in DM pre-raiding. I remember struggling to get people to understand the differences in loot tables depending on the choices made in Tribute runs lol.
---
It was so infuriating sourcing the frost oil and ogre suit, putting the group together, *explaining* in full detail what your intentions were as to which items you were hoping to get to drop‚Äîonly to have a group member or three decide at the final boss that they aren‚Äôt down to do things the way you need.
---
I haven‚Äôt been playing AV but from what I have heard from my bf, Alliance has not been playing AV properly. It is true that Horde have an easier time to get to the end but Alliance can win if they play right
---
This is part of the life cycle of many, many guilds.  It's perfectly natural for a schism to grow between the hardcore and less hardcore- and quite honestly it's usually for the better.  I consider myself more of a 'hardcore' so I would probably side with Nuk, Zolix, Oomay, because at the end of the day why should I have to carry those who want to put in not just less effort, but significantly less effort?
---
You'll just have to let them go and try to pick up the pieces as a truly casual guild.
---
I mean  a 6 min queue is fine with me lol 
---
just go world PvP while I wait
---
Blizzard added snowballs to the game as part of the winter holiday (one of which applies a knockback on both enemy and friendly players). With this in AV, players have the capability of griefing their team or enemy faction (as demonstrated in the clip). This (can) effectively cause AV games to be drawn out a lot longer if utilized by coordinated griefers. But then again its not really funny if I have to explain the joke
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs the joke. It‚Äôs 4chan, don‚Äôt read too far into it.
---
If you are going to raid and going for bis gear the +weapon skill racials are nice to have.
---
Horde causing their own problems, what else is new.
---
you dont have rank 3.
---
the mount has a base price of 800g, you get 10% off for being honoured, and 10% off for being rank 3 or higher.
---
there is no discount for rep above honoured.
---
&gt; Or are we willing to keep allowing minmax to dominate the gaming culture?
---
There are hundreds of guilds that don't prioritize minmaxing to the extreme that you're describing. *Every* actual raiding guild is going to want members to be performing well. You're taking your isolated incident and acting like it's some huge thing happening across all the servers. Relax. Play the game how you want, chances are you'll find plenty of people with similar mindsets.
---
Benediction has a late night guild
---
I don't think you know what irony is
---
I have a feeling ally are about to deploy that same start
---
This happened to me
---
In Vanilla I farmed low drop rate mats of E.Plaguelands mobs, or maybe grouped with another for Righteous Orb farming. Didn‚Äôt have a ton of options as a resto druid, and also just didn‚Äôt know any better back then
---
rank 3 as in honor rank 3?
---
Can assure you no bracket 1 pushers are afk pushing. 
---
Bracket 1 on my server is 1.1 mil, which was achieved after 4 days, none of which was afk.
---
Stop.
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying but I‚Äôm saying going 1-60 is harder than 51-60 and not comparable.
---
You need 2 sets of gear and I recommend starting to gather them already when levelling. You need a tanking set (basically as much agi and stam as you can get) and a healing set (int and healing power, spirit is also nice as it scales with innervate).  
---
The good thing about Druid healing set is that it is very easy to obtain some starter pieces for it as Druid is the only leather caster so when you run dungeons you will get all the leather caster gear if you want. Also if you are playing the tank you will probably get all the tank gear as well as any +healing gear that the group healer does not need.
---
Do you want longer queues? Because this is how you get longer queues
---
Apparently this guy doesn't know it was like this in TBC.
---
sweet, keep enjoying those L's
---
Dungeons were harder? What?
---
Go level
---
You are not GUARANTEED to match up against a premade? statistically impossible bro
---
Dude he's right. Orc and undead both are as generic human or gnome/dwarf.
---
Yes, wait for ranks to update and you‚Äôll get the discount.
---
I‚Äôm confused are you putting guild drama with player names on classic wow subreddit ?
---
Lightforge is one of the few dungeon sets thats probably always worth getting, It's very good for pvp/solo game-play and only passed by the R10 pvp set.  Plus lightforge looks really nice imo.  Congratulations!
---
The issue isn't with them leaving thats perfectly natural, they joined a casual guild but ended up wanting to be more serious, no problem just leave and make a new guild. The issue according to the thread is that they decided to try their best to be sure the guild completely died when they left.
---
1v1 really isn't worth talking about at level 49, and no warlock on the planet is going to be in their 1v1 spec at that level so you can't extrapolate anything from those fights.
---
Trade off for your base being objectively easier to defend lol
---
yes
---
LOL nice
---
I thought it was just me or that one of my add-ons was causing this. Very strange.
---
He's right tho, cool animations too
---
Attention when using this though, it does not send the Warmasters with him, Horde/Alliance could very well pull and kill Vanndar/Drek like this.  
---
Possible Exploit?  
---
Pulling Drek with a Snowball, Vanish to get rid of the Warmasters. Tank and Spank Drek without having to kill Warmasters.
---
Take a whole new meaning of dwarf tossing!
---
The few times I've done it we had 4 priests and a tank mind controlling the mobs.  Have each group run in and get the buff.  You can get 1 or 2 buffs off before having to re mind control them.  Takes maybe 15 mins if everyone is on the ball.  Make sure the tank has some bandages so they can heal up the priests, they will take some damage occasionally.
---
Yes this is batching but because of batching there's a good glitch that shamans use all the time. If you have divine favor up and cast a holy light and then a holy shock instantly after, both will crit. Making a free heal for like 4k health.
---
Yeah on alliance even in a partial premade group we were ruined by a 15-man turtle at relief hut. It‚Äôs just really difficult to cap it when we have half of our team get wiped on the way down and then we have a group with infinite respawns and archers shooting down on us. Now, that turns what would otherwise be a 10 minute alliance win into a 25 minute Horde win, but that‚Äôs just how it is I guess. Alliance really aren‚Äôt willing to go wipe the horde on Van, but I‚Äôve seen us completely fail an initial Zerg and try it again for the win. It amazes me how slow the horde offensive group can be.
---
Do you get any Lua errors? (```/console scriptErrors 1```)
---
Does disabling all other addons besides ClassicCastbars change anything?
---
Have you tried resetting all settings? (There's a button for it in the addon's options)
---
Are you playing on English WoW client or a different locale?
---
A buddy if mine loathed that song so much that he had it play every opportunity that he got. Because apparently that's what you do when you hate a song and don't want to hear it.
---
Seconding westfall, its a great server
---
Alliance: Give them nothing... but take from them... EVERYTHING!!
---
Horde: wolololo wooolooool zerp derp. **I Pooted**
---
*Horde wins*
---
Or horde could just win faster. Your 30 minute wins are the fast ones.
---
Vuhdo addon?
---
I don't care for the sound at the end. Not at all.
---
lol
---
Had almost the exact same scenario with a hunter. It was the week before we started dkp and we had three hunters but two of them couldn‚Äôt make it. One hunter in raid, we are rolling on loot. Every single boss dropped hunter gear. Even got leaf.
---
&gt; 7-8 alliance don't leave the northern part of the map
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; another 7-10 die in the middle of the map due to a slow mount
---
&gt; 22-26 actually make it to Frostwolf GY, and 5-7 stay and defend backcappers
---
&gt; This leaves like 15-18 people at most actually fighting at Drek.
---
Not really much different for horde.  We're lucky to get 15 on Vann.  Can do it with 10.  Typically it's because the healers set outside to drink, and prevent alliance from getting in to cause any damage.  At least that's what I do on my shaman.
---
While it Sims (and performs) higher, it's also relatively garbage the second you start getting raid gear, and have to consider breaking apart the set bonus.
---
&gt; We dont D towers we cap
---
Well we typically just kill the lieutenant and completely ignore it, then just kill the marshals.
---
This is totally fair. I‚Äôm a healer and always tip 1G for water outside of BG‚Äôs. If I run out in a BG, i usually whisper a mage and ask if they would mind tossing some water my way. Unfortunately, the problem is that you can‚Äôt really offer up tips inside because of the cross realm. If the ability to tip in a BG was available, of course I would; however, I usually just tip the next mage outside of a BG the extra G. Paying it forward is the best way!
---
one of the priests in my guild was solo running dm east. if you have herb it can be extra profitable. not sure how priests run it but i‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs stuff on yourube
---
This guy RPs
---
Props for the Jim Carey.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsDdIByh8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsDdIByh8A)
---
Was thinking that. Classic's raids are very simple by comparison, so there's a lot more room to focus on rotation etc, not to mention there isn't nearly as much a requirement for high parses to push throught content.
---
Isn't it crossrealm, tho?
---
I wanted to be AdolphCritler, but nooooo
---
Exactly.  Alli can call us "turtles" all they want, but if horde stops the zerg once, and they get spread out, horde will usually win.  
---
Alli rush is just easier than Horde rush, so of course they don't want us to play defense and do a base race.  Horde will lose every time.
---
I spend the first 80% of the game hunting down people to actually pvp, then eventually make my way to help kill boss.  People will occasionally complain if there's a lot of us, but I honestly think it helps if there's 5-10 doing it.  Slows them from going the other way.  And I get more honor for kills.
---
Had a couple 10s.  Nowhere near 20 on NA.  I can't keep up though.  Yesterday alliance were saying honor is relative to faction, so it doesn't matter if we get more or less.  This argument seems to counter that.  What's it gonna be tomorrow?
---
It's a good idea to alternate.  Harder for me to know which side to drop earthbind on.  It's kind of funny because you watch everyone run by it, and nobody thinks to kill it real fast.
---
&gt; Horde have an easier time to get to the end
---
That's half true.  There's an exploit jump that has always existed on the map.  Horde haven't been using it very much yet though.  If they don't, it's actually harder to get over the bridge.
---
It might have been healers aggroing, some of our OTs struggle to grab adds right away. The DPS is on the boss and has been good about waiting until I give the go ahead.
---
Our OTs are complaining they are getting slowed, is this a problem with our pull or them not picking up adds fast enough?
---
seems legit
---
Every AV win you get 3 medals, and every loss you get 1. 
---
You can hand in 3 medals for 3300 exp and this is repeatable. Each AV lasts 10-25 minutes usually.
---
Does really matter if anyone is "right"?
---
Someone didn't like the way a guild was going so they formed one that suited them. It's like leaving a job if it's not working for you. Noone has to be "in the wrong".
---
As an opener in cat form, should I go stealth and use ravage, or just pull them using faerie fire? Which will end up killing the mob quicker?
---
I can do 2 man jump runs with 2 water per run if I even need any. Even before I was this well geared I never used a full stack of water in a dungeon like scholo
---
hey, sorry for the late response but theres really alot i mean by class identity lacking. ill start off by talking about retail.  Theres nothing that really seperates a class from one another currently, and to make matters worse we even have personal loot so 8 ret paladins in 1 group is fine, loots personal ! Every class can aoe, every class is fair on dps, i know sometimes one spec might be lacking but overall im not gunna decline a monk, or a mage, or a hunter a spot because they suck or anything, every1 is fair! lets look at classic. my favorite class is the hunter, which has a ton of flavor and identity. id consider it the class that requires the least amount of effort if u wanna play  hardcore, but still u will find tons of things to do. Hunters can solo dungeons and really get some cool things done. the past 2-3 weeks ive been solo running HOj for the guild to get them loot, ive also helped with mara/ dm tribute loot/dm e loot as well, all solo! This is the hunter, and most of the work isnt done alone, we have our trusty pets which arent just there for looks, they demand food and healing and attention and micro managing!! in retail, ehh fuck it just turn it off and get a dps boost.. cool huh? and these pets arent all 1 in the same, each pet provides something new to the situation, maybe you need a tanky boar, maybe a fast annoying cat for the pvp, or a wolf for that raid buff!now ask yourself; what does a hunter do in retail that really seperates them from the other dps classes? in classic all pve content will continue be a nice easy ride that will get tougher later on. classic really isnt for the "pve only" player.  MC/ony takes like 3 hours a night at most and then ur done for the week, classic is revolved around its world and pvp so if u just look at it and say " oh mages press frostbolt, oh warlocks press shadowbolt". yeah thats true... in raiding for those 3 hours a week. but out in the open world as a warlock your a control freak! dotting up 3 different opposite faction players at once, fearing one, succubus charming the other. so if you take a look at 2 classes right now that i just grabbed, the hunter and warlock, you could see the flavor and identity they bring. warlocks and there soulstones, health stones, soul shards, constant dots, and fears. and the hunter, the solo god who hunts alone with his pet to really take down enemies from afar with that max 41 yard distance! i can go on and on about everything. last thing ill drop is rogues.. oh boy fuck those dicks, if a hunter is the solo god that helps allies with his solo work, the rogue is the opposite. is it bad i can name enemy faction rogues that are notorious for camping 1 spot just to pick u off? to me i love it, i love when genkk the undead rogue blinded me, gouged my pet, then skinned my devilsaur and /lol'd me and stealthed away.i love emberstrife who camps the brd entrance to pick off stragglers who were late to raid just to take em out with a quick burst combo while now the whole raid team has to wait for him and summon that player.
---
It's trivial to make an auto hotkey macro that just makes you move once a minute or whatever.  The thing is, it's actually worse honor.  The real high bracket players are hunting HKs every match.  Potentially even account sharing.  The people doing this will be behind those players.  And there's a very high chance of being reported as a bot, ruining your overall objective.
---
You're a legend man. They all should suck your dick fuck them
---
What were you knocked off by? Looked like a wand cast?
---
the Min/Max crowd will still be on top. since they can just swap to wsg and farm all the plebs. (just wont be afk like it is in av)
---
Ah didn‚Äôt notice he was from your own server
---
They can, it's a lot tougher because the Horde O is a juggernaut.  They all stop at Balinda and mass push north when shit stops twitching, no matter how hard I scream to get people on SP GY.  It's much harder to get horde in small groups unless you catch someone defending a tower.  And most horde will leave that one person to defend the tower alone.
---
Snowballs! :D  
---
They're everywhere now
---
Honestly horde would get more queues and faster rep if they just didn't turtle and let the zerg play out. Mathematically speaking the shorter the game the more alliance can queue and create for games
---
How quick are you guys clearing MC with all that?
---
We've got it down to 2hr after a bit of shaking out the bads, but no one has even considered a list that long to be used in MC. 
---
You guys speed running it?
---
If you are twinking do not turn in marks for rep. They will give XP at every turn in (I think)
---
"Lmao just take a day off from all your responsibilities you fucking moron, it's that easy!"
---
I bet your only responsibilities in life are brushing your teeth and doing your homework.
---
Default UI. Just that they ticked the option for class colors on the raid frames
---
What the hell is causing that?
---
Non-greater fire protection is fine ASSUMING your healers can keep up, but considering you‚Äôre wiping at 60% they probably aren‚Äôt able to keep up. The tank definitely needs to have a fire resist set, and for the UBRS FR buff, most groups only focus on the tanks/healers getting it rather than all 40 people. Which makes the potions that much more important being regular vs greater as dps.
---
From playing with premades there's no way it's comparable to the average honor I'm getting in AV. 
---
Yes if you always farm bad players MAYBE. one other serious group and you end up losing 15+ minutes when you include in queue times.
---
In a WSG premade you should have plenty of time pre-BG to buff up your group with 30 minute buffs.
---
Are you honestly telling me that you are buffing people after you group rez at the GY? Because that's a pretty good way to lose giving your opponents so much time while you drink up after buffing.
---
What is your argument here, that you are bad at WSG?
---
The thing is, its not about winning or losing per se, if both factions just agree to super quick games everyone gets more reputation per hour
---
There is no right or wrong. People want different things out of the game. You can‚Äôt blame one side or the other. This happens all the time. 
---
You just have to accept it.
---
Interesting. On Oceanic Horde they always cap these GYs and nobody complains. We get rep and honor when they cap. Shrug. I guess my region adopted a different meta. We win most games that aren't against premades.
---
Jesus Christ it's like you've completely lost sight of the fact that this is an easy game and you don't need to do everything the cookie cutter way to succeed. 
---
Meta killed this game. Your comment is delusional.
---
Honestly that's a pretty solid policy.
---
If you told me a good joke pre-BG I'd give you all the water your little heart could ever desire.
---
;)
---
You know those are all generalizations of your perceived experiences right?  There is nowhere near enough of a "certain type of person" that plays Alliance or Horde to make a noticable difference.
---
&gt; Defense either wins games or loses games so its 50/50.
---
Insightful
---
&gt; The issue is they've forced everyone to go that spec in PvP in order to be competitive. 
---
Just like a bunch of other classes?  its classic after all.
---
Once you're exalted or even revered.  As alliance the zerg win hurts you, if you are legitimately trying to rank.  If you're goal pure rep then more power to you, it works.
---
But again, once rep is "mostly" settled.  The zerg win is boring as shit.  But once you slow/stop doing it, just remember.  The horde is there, waiting.
---
I‚Äôm so surprised there aren‚Äôt half a hundred people in here complaining about BiS. On Faerlina it‚Äôs like everyone is madly trying to get BiS and it‚Äôs actually kind of disheartening.
---
We do know what to do, it's just that av is very unbalanced terrain wise so it's really hard to give complex commands to pugs and have them follow
---
I suppose we‚Äôre all idiots/assholes to someone, fair enough.
---
Ugh I actually really relate to that. Those have been in retail since what, MoP - in an easy to acquire format? WoTLK originally?
---
Horde gonna horde
---
In a straight zerg alliance is going to win 95+% of the time.  We saw that on day one.  I don't agree with the assessment that horde have it easier to get to the end.  I think it's the opposite.  Horde just spent their time learning to optimize honor gain early.  Alliance is now going through that process, and it's costing them games.  Since we already know how to do that, we continued to optimize, and now have resources to spend to defend.  The hardest part for horde is actually getting to the boss.  Once that's finished, it's trivial.
---
Any add-ons for wsg? Like timers?
---
he does petstay, petattack then petpassive in that order. petstay and petattack you should be familiar, but /petpassive is the button on the far right that you can see clicking in the video
---
Not just fun but efficiency, too. Most of those people would rather get their AV rep out of the way asap.
---
Someone in my guild was telling me they were in one for 40mins, I thought it might have got shorter over the weekend but it seems to be getting worse and worse, won't be long before running it will be pointless.
---
We do a bubble pull....  Once they all aggro - we have our locks banish four targets while our tanks pick up the other ones.  Sometimes with only four tanks we either have a tank pick up Garr + first kill add or other times we have enough to pick up Garr and the four adds with five tanks.
---
Not that you could do it but we have a lot of Warlocks and had eight one night so we literally banished every single add and killed Garr first - then just called out which Banish to kill next.  Good times...
---
oh don‚Äôt get me wrong, i think it‚Äôs a pretty toxic issue, I guess to paraphrase for video games it would be something like: ‚Äúeveryone who kills me is a try hard poopsock, everyone I kill is a dumb noob‚Äù.
---
The general point is that most people aren‚Äôt able to acknowledge when they fucked up.
---
Use pet stay with the pet relatively far away, set trap and send pet in, allow pet to get aggro then pet passive
---
If local queue were an option, it would be dead.
---
Give horde blood elves, give alliance high elves and let dwarves be shamans.
---
My guild bubble pulls and we hsve never had problems. Have a Paladin run in and back toward the raid. Tanks charge their targets and banished go up smoothly
---
‚ÄúI cant 1 shot people now, rip pvp‚Äù...Pleb..
---
Also gnomes can‚Äôt be priests
---
You really have no idea of what you say is true. The # 1 standing on our server for 3 weeks+ hasn‚Äôt logged off in over 72hrs.... so the possible things he could be doing to achieve this are left up to your imagination. 
---
None of them are 100% legit.
---
Horde is literally a tidal wave of death that slowly moves north.
---
It has it's good points and it's bad points.
---
I think it's more than a dozen daily.  Like 18-20 I believe.
---
Same for me.
---
The realm status says Razorfen is down now.
---
Just pick what you enjoy. Being the "wrong" race will not stop you getting invited to anything. You will feel the impact of certain racials quite strongly in PvP, eg. the Orc stun resist will often save your skin, so maybe think a little about them if you're going to PvP a lot. But there are almost no racials that will have a noticeable impact on the average player's experience or performance in PvE.
---
What happened to the Zerg meta?
---
Horde are a juggunaut! Our will is unbreakable! We are so cool and we always win
---
You could say its razorfen downs.
---
Damn thats abit sad
---
Battleground Leader: DONT CAP SH GY
---
Ya, even the "turtle" matches are over on a half hour or so and it's still comparable rep/honor to sitting for another 10 minutes if you get into one half way through for sure...
---
Never Horde of what now?
---
Oof, sorry to hear it. Either way, hope to blast you in the field :P
---
Oh you want to complain about faction balance in AV huh?
---
Outro was the best part, way to promote the channel!
---
&gt; This is part of the agreed upon strategy
---
No it isn't. There's no such thing as one "agreed upon strategy". It is one shared by many for sure, but that doesn't mean it is mandatory or anything to follow it.
---
That's not the kind of things I do in a 2 hour AV.
---
I laughed, but it seems you've upset a few people with your question.
---
Let me put what the OP was saying in slightly clearer terms
---
The Alliance has 3 distinct races of white people
---
Also South shore guards
---
Its fantastic for dungeon tanking when you need to spam swipe, but I find it unnecessary for raiding. Boss hits keep your rage nice and high and I cat on enough fights that I think Blood Frenzy is a better overall choice once you've gotten your pre-bis from dungeons.
---
Well this is pretty legit tho; they aren't having fun, they are farming and trying to forbid others from having fun. Fuck them. I like triggering them too.
---
Thats incredibly boring though.
---
Healers are taking aggro because you're sending in a tank who's pulling every mob and taking massive damage. Healers have to respond to that. Do the mage with ice block method to avoid it.
---
Oof, if wiping the first ally push is turtling then you've never been to AV before.
---
I've lost more than I've won as Alliance.
---
no gnomes on our faction
---
Yeah at least when people rushed there was a fairly even chance for one side to win or another.
---
The turtle shit extends the game 20,30 minutes more for a Horde win and is miserable for everyone using it to get honor. Alliance will quickly turn to WSG for Honor making the queues even worse.
---
???
---
There's other ways for horse to win, mainly a small force defending RHGY.  If you can Stonehearth the games usually result in hour long matches unless th alliance just gives up (they never do).
---
Same... Really want to know
---
Where the true PvPers go.
---
I levelled to 60 on a pvp realm during phase 2, and this makes me laugh so hard.
---
A lot of the people who are bitching in this video are probably the same people who were mercilessly ganking lowbies in levelling zones and camping flight paths when BGs weren't released yet. Now these same people get fucking enraged when someone doesn't allow them to play the game the way they want to play it. How does it feel to be on the other end?
---
My guild started out with forcing rogues to decide between daggers or swords pre-raid. This has since changed so that you aren't locked until the person wins a weapon.
---
We did a similar thing with our warriors. Either they were 2h fury or DW fury. This also depends atn what they get first now.
---
Only downside so far is that we play horde, have seen 7 Vis'kags and 0 Deathbringers and only have 2-3 active rogues.
---
Yea I heard tommorow at 2pm CST they are opening paid transfers
---
It's a long listen, so play it in the background, but we got pretty in depth with Warlocks in this discussion. Hopefully you find something useful in there - if you manage to make it through.  
---
[https://youtu.be/DchTwt13YtI](https://youtu.be/DchTwt13YtI)
---
Nah, I don't roll against the primary class for dungeon set, hell most runs we didn't have a rogue in the group anyway since we normally only have 1 slot in the group available. I'm lucky enough that my buddies that I do runs with are a fury warrior, mage and a priest.
---
Can any charges with engineering open chests in dungeons?
---
That's the point; AV is amazing, but the initial version was just far better.
---
You can invite an alt to the same party as you with a friends help and hop to your alt each reset
---
Idk at the current rate (for alliance) it seems if your wsg premade is winning in 15 min or less you make WAY more honor than afk in av. Seem only like 1 in 4 ally AV games are quick wins and they rest are slower losses where no one bothers to get the easy bonus honor from LTs. 
---
There is I suppose the guarantee of SOME bonus honor from av with no effort though
---
Ohh I remember people used to snowball people in the spawn cave (who were afk) all the way out of the portal in the back!
---
am i being meme'd
---
It most certainly is not, my good man
---
It's not about hitting high rank, it's about ranking in general.  Mind you I played AV on the launch day, where queues were instant... and I'm only rank 4 80%, but at my current honor I'm actually still going to decay down to 40% if I don't play anymore before tuesday.
---
Just goes to show, you don't have to have particularly high rank goals to make efficient honor grinding worthwhile.
---
I'm not going to go for r14, but to rank at all past 3-4 you'll need to play enough to get enough honor to place in a respectable bracket.
---
Lol. confirmed lost to a brain dead class.
---
Yeah you should. A lot of people have to. I also want to clear all raids with my friends but due to other factors I can't raid as I want to so I have to like my t0 dungeon set while they run around in purples.
---
Doesnt matter what it is, a long duration CC makes sense in PvE, not PvP. If youre just running to Drek, getting sapped just means that game is a snoozefest and you may as well AFK-ish and wait for the win/loss by the rez spot. (If zerk breaks sap, thatd be news to me, ASAIK, it can only break fear.)
---
I've never seen Russians win AV, if you send 6 people to Def you can wipe them and they just stop playing
---
A second snowball to push him out to reset it?
---
its not hard to get up their but let me tell you about annoying druids that stand on the GY point and just change from stealth over to oom kin and blow you up
---
It‚Äôs totally blizzards fault for you choosing to camp FP. It‚Äôs totally blizzards fault that you choose to Zerg AV. It‚Äôs totally blizzards fault you‚Äôre min/maxing. 
---
But sure, the 0.01% of things in the game that don‚Äôt match 1.12 show how they should have released an earlier version of AV because of how you CHOOSE to play. That makes total sense.
---
should of joined in
---
I don't know if you're asking if everyone should go fire resist gear... but just in case, that's only for tanks. You need the DPS and heals way more than you need fire resistance on people. The greater fire protection pots will take care of most of the damage DPS and healers will take, so let them gear to do their job and let tanks gear to do theirs (with as much fire resistance as they can get). Tanks shouldn't fire prot pot either, there's no point. They take so much fire damage it'll burn right through the pot in the first few seconds of the fight.
---
And tell people to bring spare fire prot pots in case you wipe. They need to get used to the idea of spending some gold on making progress in raids. Rag is easy if you have the DPS to down him in under 3 minutes, but he's a real shitter if you don't so prepare for wipes.
---
If people have DBM you can also tell your casters/healers to do /range 20 and split accordingly, stacking 2-4 people at a time. Chaining the knockback is one of the biggest mistakes raids make on Rag
---
Works one in a hundred times, but when it works you look like a god
---
Any for wsg?
---
no one should have to.. why is that so hard to understand?
---
its unacceptable that the dominant form of pvp be exclusively solo play in an mmo.
---
your problem is not the same. your personal conflits do not translate to the game saying you **cannot** group with friends.
---
they should either allow us to group, or make AV and WSG equivalent honor. why doesnt that sound reasonable to you?
---

---
I've been having a hard time lately. It's a small thing, but people liking this post and actually gilding it made my day.  Thank you.
---
Oh word, what add-on is that?
---
It also has the side effect of creating a stalemate in a chokepoint if enough of the horde and ally are stuck there.
---
Lmao yeah. Even better, I haven't played in a month or so and this was my first roll since getting back on
---
Have a mage or pally aggro then ice block or bubble. This causes Garr and adds to run toward the raid and everything can be picked up fine. Also do this with majordomo for easy add pick up.
---
Dunno, there's a guy that solo'd to 800k honor when our top earners are around 1 mil.
---
I kek.
---
While most pvp minmaxers are horde, most horde are not minmaxers.
---
2 minutes per reset. Plus you get other perks like instant trades instead of 1h mail.
---
honor was gained and spent like a currency, so you pvp, get lets say 10k honor then go buy BG items like the blue pvp set items with honor and bg marks.   
---
the best pvp items were gained from playing arena's anyway.
---
Im as old as you going by the 88 in your name. I take days off for my hobbies dont you? Or do you only work and do chores every waking hour of the day? Probably not.
---
who called these guys pserver allstars LOL
---
Literally every top guild disagrees with you
---
Took the words right out of my ass.
---
His dad works at blizzard
---
yes and i sympathized with you then. 
---
what a pathetic position to take. "you deserve this as punishment for the actions of others"
---
But you have enough to heal to max, hot and use max nukes with your full mana pool.
---
Both of our problems have solution in the retail version of the game. People were bothered by this in vanilla and Blizzard listened.
---
People whined they ruined the game and we have classic again with all its faults.
---
What is reasonable to me doesn't matter. We're playing this game with the old rules that have been studied for a decade on private servers and that's how it is. 14 years ago I was on a full server and 350k honor week was enough to get me from rank 9 to rank 10. Now in that bracket anything under a million will make you lose rank.
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
we tested it with premade and it wont
---
AV is much better, sadly.
---
Have a mage run up and Ice Block. They need to Ice Block EARLY, like when the nearest enemy is barely still outside Frost Nova range, to not get insta-killed. Garr and his adds are huge and move surprisingly fast.
---
Yes, they are just whiny bitches. Classic is all about the item grind.
---
One of our warriors was using it on trash and it worked out alright.
---
I don't think you get rep or honor for capping GYs.
---
Does the DHC proc scale with spell damage?
---
the issue isn't the stacks, if it was literally just 1 charge i'd still be happy. a faster auto attack is fundamentally different from an additional attack, the talent is basically useless right now
---
Still no luck mate. This started about 4 days ago. One day out of the 4 I‚Äôve had no issues.
---
No I killed him to help the horde war effort.
---
its pretty much indisputable that people came back to this old ass game because it had community. blizzard acknowledges this, even if they dont know what to do with that information.
---
cross realm server bgs without the ability to queue with friends completely spits in the face of community.
---
i just want to play with my friends man. it blows my mind that so many people seem to hate that idea.
---
No because one is doing so with intent.
---
I've leveled 4 locks to 60 and in my experience fastest way is to use dark pact, max fel con, succu as visible only autoattacking. Max drain life. Visible succu will aggro mobs sooner and you can dps sooner. Let succu take some damage while going max range. Don't use soothing, invis, lash. When they aggro you. You drain them while they run to you. You can already send succu to next. Funnel/dark pact between mobs if needed. Keep life and mana not maxed. Max your int and spirit. Extra stamina won't help your regen. With casters you can also optionally seduce, set curse of tongues right away It won't break seduce, then start with immolate or sbolt if you want it down real fast. Otherwise start with slow dots like CoA and siphon, so that succu does some tanking for you. In level 60 the best option for farming is sm/ds where you have draintank, but you sacrifice vw, which gives you 100-120 life every 4s.  Some people like to sacrifice succu, but I've found with vw sac you have zero downtime and you don't need food or drink, even against hard mobs, and you can solo mara/dme easily. The better shadowgear you have, the better vw sac is. In early gear succu sac might be even better. With this spec you won't be raiding though....
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
This makes 0 sense.
---
I feel like the camera movement wasnt sooooo glitchy this time. I more than double the bit rate, but maybe it wasn't enough! Thanks ya'll
---
Cry me a river, questing was impossible as a level 48 warrior. You can go without premades in AV
---
Y‚Äôall made your bed, now sleep in it
---
Head straight to FWGY and start taking it over if the group stalls at some part of the zerg. You'll either get there just as the epic mounters are done finishing off the NPCs guarding the post and can act as relief to defend the point, or you'll beat them to it and can start clearing it out.  
---
Alternatively if the zerg is going well consider yourselves the "vanguard" of the alliance and make it your job to stay in a tight knit group and pick off horde that are returning towards Belinda's area after they res at their GY in the Fields of Strife (I think it's called the Fields of Strife, the large open frozen area between Belinda and Galv.)  
---
If you're clearing out the Fields of Strife together make sure you loot all horde corpses, and if a wipe does happen at Drek with no GY capped start turning in Shards immediately up North to get druids summoned ASAP and beat out the horde on their own turn ins.
---
make you wonder why they nerfed it
---
Pff, 15 you mean.
---
It's actually a dog and they're friends
---
Individually? Yes. As a faction? No.
---
Not saying it can't happen.  Just saying it sure ain't easy.  And he still didn't best the pre-made guy and probably put in more time.
---
questing was impossible for me too man. 
---
open your fucking mind.
---
It's not alliance.
---
Its everyone.
---
You see how you are also whinning on reddit about people whining about the game? 
---
You ever watch naruto? It's a cycle and yall part of it and no better the each other.
---
Well it‚Äôs not necessarily a punishment thing. My guild
---
Managed to get in as many as 10 deep. 8 minute que must suck, but it‚Äôs better than originally horde que‚Äôs.
---
Point 1: Molten Core used to take 8-14 hours, now your average guild clears it in 2-3. Metas change, for better or worse, no point in changing it because you dont like it.
---
Point 2: I defend the way it is because changing it to queue up as a group would cause more problems than it solves. Horde gets roflstomped enough as it is, now add premades into the mix, no thanks.  It would be fun to play with friends, but AV is just doomed to be an honor/rep farming bg, nothing short of getting rid of rep rewards and reducing honor to nearly nothing would change that, but them nobody would queue for it.
---
Point 3: I dont sympathize with you because youre trying to change the game to YOUR liking. Should we increase 5 man dungeons to 10 mans because I have 10 friends online I want to do Dire Maul with?
---
Escape, Interface, bottom is Raid Profiles, click "use raid profiles for party, etc etc" But yeah, that's default. Jus tplay with the settings.
---
Wait snowballs? I thought those were part of the Winter Veil event
---
Even though I‚Äôm playing horde right now I‚Äôd consider myself an alliance player. So me whining is just par for the course
---
Too true
---
this sub is just a bunch of ally crybaby boomers.
---
Ally is op as fuck, horde racials is a meme and doesn't make up for paladins not even close.
---
That doesn't mean you have to be holy now. You're being overdramatic for nothing and your video was pathetic.
---
my friends arent pvping with anyone
---
Welcome to classic. It isnt going to change
---
If you *really* only care about the 1v1 then go demo, otherwise just go sm/ruin build. Skip dark pact as its not that good, sadly. For bgs id recommend sm/ruin as well since you can mostly avoid damage by playing smart and positioning correctly.
---
Fair
---
Gehennas rankers sleep too.
---
I followed Aniothos and LMGD closely they sleep about 6 hours a night.
---
this isnt how classic was
---
I only wonder how my life would turn out if I never tried WoW..
---
At the start? Yeah. By 1.12 that wasnt the case at all.
---
Daily questions thread was great. Now the new tab will be full of unanswered repetitive questions that no one cares to click on.
---
This is possibly the new AAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
How are you not knowing how to do a printscreen? Did you get a computer two days ago?
---
Im not the one with no friends to play with.
---
what made you so toxic that you would talk like this to a stranger?
---
except people minmaxing only allow their idea of fun which is 4minute games, if you dont adhere to that you're reported so who is ruining the experience for others?
---
isnt that the whole idea of classic? going back to the start?
---
Just play druid, only 1 race per faction so you cant pick wrong
---
Hunter can pull as well.
---
Reading your posts.

youre a shitty person
---
The real tactic is that 1 Tank runs in with Greater Stoneshield Potion + Shieldwall. Use challenging shout and let the other Tank taunt Garr off.
---
First Tank uses Demoralizing shout while positioning them at the corner.
---
Everyone focuses Garr and if an add gets loose, either a 3rd Tank is on pick-up duty and bring them back or you banish them.
---
Once Garr is down you can start AoE. Once an add gets low the Tanks on the side can taunt them out 1 by 1.
---
The fuck is the point of that mob
---
It's the only way to farm honor for multiboxers, and it's actually really good honor from what I hear.
---
You're a zoomer.
---
"I wanna play domination with my friends"
---
"Nope tdm let's you play with friends already sorry"

Ironically, you're the only asshole here by assuming stuff about me with nothing to base it on. 
---
I like to PvP. I join PvP BGs to do PvP. PvP happens when there are players to fight; if they rez behind, that's cool also because it means Dun Baldar will see PvP action instead of rushing a PvE boss.
---
I finished my exalted grind yesterday as ally and am probably not going to touch it again.
---
What difference is there between this and having a rogue pull Drek and vanishing? Either way, they will probably all just reset, or they will all aggro something. Doubt this would work.
---
bruh your name is that of a 12 year old in quake 3...
---
One night in goldshire too! Sucks that copyright striked:(
---
Reading your posts... you seem very angry about something in your life
---
There is a lot of good advice here. The one thing I would add is that you can have hunters pull targets to off tanks after the initial pull. That way the OTs aren‚Äôt chasing a target running at a healer.
---
By 1 12 it was. People were zerging it well before 1.12
---
More likely they entered a battleground? Summon requires out of combat to accept.
---
D : damage of one of your spells
---
H : chance to hit for that spell ( H is comprised between 0.83 and 0.99)
---
C : damage bonus due to crit chance (higher than 1)
---
normal damage of your spells : D*H*C
---
adding 1% hit : D*(H+0.01)*C
---
adding 1% crit : D*H*(C+0.01)
---
Substract both and you get :
---
D*(H+0.01)*C - D*H*(C+0.01)
---
= 0.01*D*(C-H)
---
Since C is higher than 1 and H lower than 1,
---
C-H &gt; 0
---
and thus :
---
 D*(H+0.01)*C - D*H*(C+0.01) &gt; 0
---
Is this a different meaning to the word macro? Because all wow macros are one press one action.
---
In theory? Yes. In practice blizz shit on that when they chose 1.12
---
A man can dream
---
holy shit, the classic snowball knockback was still in 1.12?
---
I remember games like these from back when BGs first got released. Maybe things have changed since then, but the key was to properly contest the flag cap. Once the flag reaches the opposition base it's so much harder to get it back.
---

Same. Playing since 2006. But Still married, Baby and a good Job. Still Wonder...
---
You were probably on the border between wpl and alterac mountains. Same shit happens if you have a party member in there, they look like they lag out cause of zone shift. So no, it's not new. It's classic wow at it's best
---
My stupid orc shaman in 2004 getting on the wrong zeppelin and thinking "Grom'gol seems pretty cool, I wonder what's outside?".
---
Except they've ruined pretty much every aspect of WoW consistantly.
---
Can't do a dungeon any other way than the best strat without being called names or kicked out.
---
Couldn't do wpvp without fucking deathballs and fp campers.
---
Hillsbrad quests were a pain in the ass because of all 50 mages that would be trying to AOE farm the exact same spot.
---
And now they ruin AVs, THIS TIME I got a means to stop them and actually get to experience AVs as they are intended to be experienced.
---
I still have no idea what 90% of maraudon looks like, because people only do princess runs.
---
Iceblock is what we do and it seems to be super easy that way.
---
No every single game was won by alliance when everyone rushed. Horde wins were a rare occasion. This is the entire problem in the first place, a ton of alliance got to exalted super fast while horde were barely revered with the same amount of games.
---
Idk, it really has me in stiches
---
Fuck over low level people out questing, same thing as Stitches. Gives the world more flavor tbh and also kills bots
---
The difference is intent. Min maxers aren't playing in a way to intentionally detract from the experiences of others. Doing shit like this stuff showed in the video then not only are you ruining the experiences of others, but what makes it shitty is that you're actively trying to.
---
its awesome :) been doing since yesterday now! :P

This was happening to me as well, routinely DCs every 10-ish minutes. Tried disabling addons or re-installing them, nothing helped. Then I updated my network driver, that fixed everything.

Hope it can work for you too.
---
Are you trying to diss on people by calling them adults lmao
---
Haha right, I‚Äôve legit never lost to Russians in AV.
---
They rush too fast and leave too many people behind. Then you wipe them at Drek and they just sorta give up.
---
I‚Äôve noticed most Russians rush the right side instead of the left one aswell.

Faction change would be huge slap to the face for every ally who played on horde dominated PvP servers. BG queues were the only positive thing to look forward to for sticking through the weeks upon weeks of complete lockdown Horde had on the world and constant mockery if you didn't take the beating.
---
Id rather have a 40min close back and forth game than some zerg fest. Seems like Alliance just want to minmax as much as possible and play the vitimcard in every situation
---
Do it however you like as long as it's within the bounds of tos, just don't do anything with the outright intention of ruining it for others. If you wanna cap SHGY, then by all means, but if you're doing it explicitly to slow the game down to make the min maxers mad, then yeah don't do that lol.
---
Mage Iceblock, no prehots. MT taunt boss, OT sapper AOE the adds, equip engi shield, you will never lose aggro. Kill boss, AOE down the adds.
---
We're getting better. Was 1h20m last time, and we're getting better every week.
---
It's a weakaura:
---
these guys were top tier on private servers. I know the private server community was relatively small compared to retail wow but that doesn't make then any worse.
---
You are completely leaving money by passing them up. Herbalism&gt;mining for mara farm, but obviously the AH prices dictate most of it. Do note that since you are gathering, it does slow down the farm a bit, not enough to not make it worth, but id probably suggest skipping the stranglekelp for example since swimming takes so long and, in my case, its not worth the money since theyre so cheap.
---
‚Äú‚ÄùHow dare you hint how I should live my life‚Äù‚Äù

You picked the wrong zone fool

I'll give you half a shoe for it?
---
Winning is more honor than losing. Honor farmers should at least have a slight preference for winning. In which case, unless you have reason to believe water will be what extends the game, it makes the most sense to help your teammates.
---
Shut the fuck up Donnie...
---
Thanks for the advice mate. I‚Äôll update once I‚Äôm home.
---
Sure, except whining as alliance gets ya 100+ upvotes while horde get downvoted to oblivion.
---
Well I don't kill lowbies as they don't pay honor, but many people do.
---
Some do just because they are enemies.
---
Others do it out of bitterness, for being ganged/griefed.
---
A friend said "The lowbies will try to hit you with something if they see friendly 60s attacking you, so kill them".
---
Many reasons. As long as they don't corpse camp, it should be fine, getting killed a couple of times is no big deal.
---
The purpose of this question was to illustrate is that there ISNT any other way.  You either do it yourself or wait for someone else to do it.
---
It's the eternal debate of intention versus outcome ethics.
---
You can't ask nicely because you just get called an idiot, the same response for going against the minmax meta for literally any activity in wow.
---
Going through your whole life valuing other people's pain over your own all the time means you get taken advantage of not just by people but my runaway systems.
---
This only works BECAUSE of the zerg meta. If the zerg meta did not exist, this would have no effect, you already have to be in the process of being screwed over.
---
Wait, what? FARM ZE HONOR!

It‚Äôs the penultimate episode of Countdown To Classic, and the show continues to bring in the big guns of MMORPG gaming, as well as a bunch of the WoW Classic community for a chat.
---
Today, we kick off with a chat about battlegrounds with show favourite Marky Mark, and the ‚Äònew meta‚Äô that Classic players are experiencing through the Alterac Valley, and to a lesser extent, Warsong Gulch grind.
---
After that, I‚Äôm joined for an epic chat with MMORPG legendary designer Raph Koster, the current CEO of Playable Worlds, and former lead designer and creative director of Ultima Online and Star Wars Galaxies, respectively.  Listen in to one of the best chats the show has featured, as Raph talks everything from Richard Garriott‚Äôs castle, to his thoughts on micro-transactions and their place in gaming, to his current work with Playable Worlds.
---
Following that, the show publishes a bunch of calls that I‚Äôve held on to far too long, with apologies to the callers, as we heard about a diverse range of WoW Classic topics from DHK‚Äôs to Pet Threat.
---
Highlights Below:
---
Calling Countdown #1 ‚Äì Ranking in 2019 w/ DaRealMarkyMark ‚Äì 5:20
---
Calling Countdown #2 ‚Äì Raph Koster on MMORPG‚Äôs ‚Äì 37:20
---
Calling Countdown #3 ‚Äì More Death &amp; Taxes Memories w/ TheNidhugg ‚Äì 3:08:10
---
Calling Countdown #4 ‚Äì Feral Druid Issue w/ Quanta ‚Äì 3:35:50
---
Calling Countdown #5 ‚Äì Pet Threat w/ Sera ‚Äì 3:47:15
---
Calling Countdown #6 ‚Äì Dishonourable Kills w/ Soniti &amp; Shahin ‚Äì 4:02:30
---
Calling Countdown #7 ‚Äì Healing w/ Effie ‚Äì 4:19:10
---
I know the Raph Koster chat isn‚Äôt WoW Classic related, but I *highly* recommend it!
---
If you‚Äôre keen to listen in then you can catch the show here - https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/12/15/episode-128-raph-koster/

Because they can and it gives them a power trip, thats the simple answer.
---
Personally I only kill for resources, You can come up all friendly and do your quests and I won‚Äôt bother you, but if you so much as look at my fire elementals you‚Äôre a dead man.
---
Actually it would be 0.0081%. you took 100/100 and multiplied it by 81/100
---
And I don't get how he does have free space in his action bars. Mine are full and sometimes I feel like I'd still need a few more slots
---
pim pi ti tiin
---
imagine actually believing an orc is anything but generic.
---
Mage iceblock or locks with sacrifice shield. The latter works well too, our raid seems to prefer that.
---
I tried warsong and got met by a premade. I'm not going to waste my time helping alliance rank up for 10 rep.
---
Wow that‚Äôs way more impressive than when you‚Äôll wreck that person in the single crit global when naxx gear comes out.

merry and pippin are 0 reliable

---
We all have our ideas for the MMO we would want to make, but mine is exploration and secrets. Lots of secrets. Reward exploration.
---
Darkfall had a great mechanic for exploration in the form of random spawning Chaos chests around the landscape. Knowing I would find chaos chests made the decision to explore when the itch struck me an easy one
---
Not sure how to fight the wiki knowledge thing other than the thought to make things more random or procedural somehow.
---
I think you think I'm saying "don't play the game in this specific way if you know it will bother some people." I'm not saying that at all.
---
Play the game however the fuck you like. As long as it's within the rules and you're not doing so with the intention of ruining the experience of others, regardless of the outcome.
---
Fuck it, even if you wanna ruin the experience of others that's cool too. Some ally stole your elite rare kill so you want to kill and camp him for a bit to vent your frustration, by all means. It's arguably scummy thing to do, but that's the beauty of MMORPGs. You have the freedom to act scummy within the bounds of the world that you normally wouldn't be able to replicate in the real world without real would repercussions.
---
My issue here lies within you creating a false equivalency between that type of mentality and a min maxing type of mentality. Again, saying "goes both ways" does not apply here because one party is going out of their way to hurt the other person's experience whereas the other is not.
---
But I'm on a PvE server so that doesn't matter
---
Despite my clickbait initial sentence, the only claim I am trying to make is that this is worth looking into.
---
Seeing wowhead have one binding drop *three* times as much as the other binding - when in the past the data indicated identical drop chances - already qualifies as evidence.
---
This is not a court. I am no judge. The game‚Äôs source code is not public. The burden of proof is quite literally on Blizzard because the game service they offer is *inherently trusted* - meaning it requires a trust component on our part.
---
Other games will go through big lengths to earn that trust. Especially if money involved. To an extent they will get rid if *pseudo*-RNG entirely for true randomness. Yes, they have a person filmed that is shuffling cards with a bunch of cameras.
---
Context matters for ‚Äúthe burden of proof is...‚Äù. I am not making criminal allegations here. I am just thinking critically.
---
Had a 47 mins game yesterday where our final attack with 30 players surrounding the freakishly huge Icelord tear through the Russian Alliance. That was the most epic moment I had since Classic started.
---
&gt; Just saying it‚Äôs not efficient for the horde to turtle.
---
10 min queue + 10 min loss = around 600 rep per hour
---
10 min queue + 30 min win = 1000+ rep per hour
---
Yes, there is. The wow term is different from the general term.
---
Reckoning was never supposed to be anything other than a meme that worked in any substantial way only on rare occasion.

Private servers never had it right, and montage PvP videos obviously are only putting in the clips were in those "rare occasions".

So, the actual reaction here you Reck paladins is: "Glad I got 3 months of broken Reckoning" and not "waah, #nochanges"... cause this is what #nochanges is.
---
There is absolutely no difference in intent between minmaxers having fun by minmaxing and casuals having fun with longer games and the only way to do that is to cap the graveyard. The intent is to have fun, do the casuals report minmaxers when they rush? Do the minmaxers report casuals when they cap graveyard? do the math
---
I genuinely am happy with the changes.
---
Additionally, can anything be doing about the "gOt mY 40 mOuNt" kind of post?
---
I tried doing the mines once. They were terrible for me (poor honor, poor rep, boring game play) as well as me being useless to my team.
---
I think the original concept behind the mines was:
---
\- the game allows people 51-60 to play. But what chance do level 51's have against raid-geared 60's?
---
\- the game was originally envisaged as going on for hours
---
\- so the mines give some level 52 something they could do to contribute to their team
---
Any level 60 has better things they can do with their time in AV than the Mines, and realistically level 5x's do too.
---
Unfortunately you don't always get quick wins as premade in WSG. If you're in some 40 mintue game you just want to /afk as nobody is even giving honor if you finally kill them.
---
By comparing two independent sets of data and proving that they are incompatible.
---
Incompatible means that it would be very unlikely to see the second set if the first data set is the baseline and vice versa. We can choose the threshold here. Usually we raise eyebrows if the odds are 5% or higher. Chances are that if there is a bug, the results would be impossibly unlikely (maybe even 0.00001%).
---
Us data scientists can go further than that. That percentage is an estimate. We can quantify the certainty of that estimate.
---
What‚Äôs left in science is bias. We shrug our observations off to confirmation bias, given we perceive an off-set but can‚Äôt explain it with our gathered anecdotes. A bug is also bias. *There is a bug component in terms of bias*. Always. It might just be very close to zero.
---
THANK YOU &lt;3!!
---
Printscteen mate
---
One big Mac and fries pls
---
This is exactly it. When I queue for bg I basically suicide into the first enemies I can finD because you can accept a queue pop mid combat or if you‚Äôre dead. Thus even if I solo run into a group of 3 I‚Äôll try my best to get a pickoff on one before I go down/accept the queue pop. Free honor
---
Yes, the top horde guilds stayed. The following 3-7 left.
---
Your mother's mouth makes me feel better
---
Best advice here.
---
Yup. Paladins are absolutely nuts in both PvE and PvP. They change the game from being horde favored through shamans and orc/undead racials (though alli have strong ones too) to alliance favored. They‚Äôre so nice to have.
---
How much are small eggs selling for?
---
Same thing happened to one of my raiding groups last week. There literally are infinite universes.
---
rekd
---
Did you read the link I sent? It's 0.4 according to blizzard. Wtf.
---
I do census checks on HW Horde side every day.
---
Most horde I've seen online at once was about 670 players (that was a few days ago)
---
I have to embrace my ANCESTORS!!!
---
Kinda ironic Horde still wins.
---
I'm not super into the grind either, but dude, you gotta let people live their lives without being a jackass about it and talking down to them. There are definitely people playing an unhealthy amount but you cant just assume someone is if they're chasing rank 14. Like... I cant imagine what the point of your comment is besides to criticize others and lift yourself up. We all do it sometimes but plz realize that and strive to do it less &lt;3
---
Yeah flametongue doesn‚Äôt proc additional attack procs/modifiers. Wind fury does though that‚Äôs much more rng dependent.
---
More Ally players that get Exalted the longer the queues for Horde comes as most Ally stop playing after it. SO the only way to keep the queues shorter for Horde is if Horde wins all the games. Everytime Allys win a game it means Horde get longer Qs.
---
If your off-tanks are warriors make sure they aren't hoping to charge off the bat, as your main tank pulling Garr almost instantly puts everyone in combat. Have your offtanks sit in berserker stance and bloodrage/intercept their adds on the pull, you can swap back to def stance mid intercept and you won't take more damage.
---
Gandling-EU ?
---
Did you not watch OP's video? People are literally telling him to die in pain. It most certainly goes both ways, OP is an asshole for doing this since he is doing it solely to fuck with everyone and minmaxers are assholes for reacting like they can decide everything and have a fit when it doesn't go their way.
---
That is just blizz raid frames ui
---
I am only here for the memes...
---
Mmm no, the chance of predicting your roll is literally a 1/100. The fact that he won has no influence on the probability of his prediction
---
Is that what happens? Cause after 10-12 mins without a Drek kill, it seems the alliance defence just falls apart. You can go grab Aid station with a couple people and no one will come to contest it.
---
&gt; I'm gonna try this with my rogue.
---
rogue raid tanking is very much a thing. I've gotten as far as AQ as a dodge rogue tank. I also stream some rogue tanking. Happy to discuss it further, if you're interested.
---
They tell me you're a little edge lord who likes to mess with people to get a reaction.
---
i mean, both of them? less than a minute apart from one another? And I sat there waiting for an hour (was watching youtube) and never saw them come back...?
---
Something else is up..something real fishy i think...
---
50?
---
Takes me 10 tops. And that's late at night.
---
Right but that doesn‚Äôt matter. He could‚Äôve said he‚Äôd roll a 58 and his chance of rolling it is 1/100, same for if he‚Äôd predicted a 90 roll or whatever.
---
then you‚Äôre doing something wrong
---

Also RP servers, atleast mine has a nicer community willing to stop what they are doing to help you aswell. People passing out bags, supplies, potions. And they will help with quests too.
---
[Here, I'll add something actually worth the click...](https://youtu.be/Y9EKzvTo3g0)
---
Aldrin* :)
---
How do you teleport back?
---
And what would be the best class to go for a tanky type character? Warrior?
---
Lol yeah ban them without any proof.
---
You know, we were real close to AM, but, not close enough to zone us.
---
The mages in question, like to sit behind one of the trees on the actual borderline, watching the FP, then they polymorph and attack.
---
but they were fighting on the road, where it forks to go right to the graveyard/scholo and to the left to go to andorhol...
---
So, they were far enough in that the zoning thing couldn't be the issue.
---
I honestly feel like they found a way to completely ninja log and fade out instantly, especially since right afterwards, a rogue in their same guild (whose been camping our chillwind FP for the past month or two) showed up to attack.
---
I mean...dont these guys get it that there are BG's out now?
---
My main issue here is the possible bug/glitch/exploit. Its definitely not the first time I have seen this. Another time was a warrior in Blackrock Mountain.
---
Does anyone know if you can PoM + Teleport in combat? Kinda like an 'Oh shit!' button?
---
Generally speaking someone always turns in the max amount of armor/flesh and what have you which gives everyone rep, not just the people turning it in, if the round lasts more than 15 minutes. There‚Äôs a reputation guide on classic wowhead that has the rep amount and which turn-ins do what for Stormpike and Frostwolf. I believe you also get 1 rep for each opposing faction member that dies, but I may be wrong. 
---
Anywho, I‚Äôve gotten ~1,400 rep from a single AV win before that lasted 40 minutes.
---
No you can't pom teleport
---
wow bro you willingly sabotage your own team to waster their time bro, can I be your cock holster bro?
---
My server had zero chat lag.
---
A previous thread stated it was probably DBM.
---
I just turned off system messages because I never got around to seeing if they had an update that fixed it.
---
They have been online since BGs opened.  Either they're botting, or account sharing.  Those are literally the only two possibilities.
---
Sell them by the BG battlemaster, might get some buyers there.
---
40 runs pfft noob stats try over 100 runs and never had the fkn trinket even drop.
---
Okay so here's my real question. I'm rank 3, 98% to rank 4. Is it harder to get to rank 5 this week just because I missed out on rank 4 by 2%? (obviously it will be \~2% harder at least)
---
Gotcha. Well, then its gotta be something weirder then...cause somethin isn't right about this.
---
Like i said, so far, it was too far away from the zone change area...and it has happeend before, mid combat, once they start losing or get to a certain health percentage...
---
ill try to get it on video next time...this was the first time it's happened twice in a row, with two different people in the exact same situation.
---
Basically, once my kidney shot is over, they phase out as if changing layers....
---
i complain literally every game and then the casuals ignore it anyway so i've given up trying to explain it
---
Should be harsh for your region, EU Horde AV queue is 5-10 mins tops.
---
I played warlock, druid, rogue and I'm playing a warrior now. 
---
Warrior is by far the funnest class I've played, and yes it is the best tank class in the game. 
---
I earn you, it is hard to level as it has little mobility, no self healing and depends alot of gear. It is very challenging. 
---
But the warrior scales the best with gear out of all classes and becomes an absolute powerhouse around lvl 45+ and you can put on a shield and tank all dungeons while leveling. 
---
Tanks are in short supply on all servers, so if you play a warrior and learn how to tank a little bit, you will be in high demand, and you will gear up quickly.
---
hey azjuk, nice to see another shaman tank!
---
I'd luv to talk shaman tanking with other shamans! If you're ever available to chat let me know.
---
dont roll alliance on an alliance dominant server... they alerady winning they dont need you
---
Heard of teamviewer or Chrome remote desktop?
---
Its not. Look at it this way. I came there to help them out with water and even decided to help them with the dungeon. You have a sick sense of twisting it into something sinister..
---
Have you been on 24/7 too? How do you know they never log off.
---
"got scarlet set" / ravager
---
Right now it's a stam upgrade if I grind to rank 10 and use 2 piece, which is a lot of grinding for a mild amount of upgrade.
---
If these things work while you are asleep, then they're bots.  If they don't, which they don't, then you have no point.
---
Having to insult me makes you one much more than me. All you have here is "you aren't turning the other cheek, therefore you are a bad person". That's how empty your point is.
---
Cheers.

Warrior, druid or paladin. Warrior being the best of the 3 as a tank, but the other 2 allow you to perform any role tank/heal/damage, generally aint as good as the other classes that fo that role. Warriors are a bitch to level.
---
Should be one for "learned to use the god damn screenshot feature"
---
I hope they nerf this.
---
I also hope that they fix instance teleporting so it doesn't hearthstone but instead teleports you to the closest gravyard.
---
Look up an arms build spec and follow it when you start getting talent points. For the first 20 or so levels focus on getting gear with spirit on it. You also want strength, agility and stamina too. 
---
Learn first aid asap, because that is your only healing, and try to stock pile food aswell. 
---
And you will be trying to gather mail items, maybe leather if they are good.
---
There's an enchant minor speed increase
---
Priests will still win. Their heals are faster, so they only have ~1 second window to see that someone else healing this target and cancel their Flash heal.  
---
In the end it would be druid who will constantly cancel his longer casts, because target is topped by a paladin/priest.
---
no one tell him
---
All the features of the same you just choose when you want to pvp against the enemy faction
---
This would explain some stuff actually
---
One more tip. Learn how to use a ranged weapon, such as guns or bows. Being able to pull 1 mob from a pack with a ranged weapon can save you many deaths. Just save whatever crappy boe, or gun that drops early on, and Google where to train that weapon skill at.
---
Is Garr dropping three times as many bindings as Geddon also just "the Law of Large Numbers in effect"? (n=12000)
---
Finns are basically snow Mongolians.
---
I'm not insulting you. I'm just drawing a logical conclusion based on what you said. You're making the game harder for 39 people because one or two were being assholes.
---
bgs have been out for 5 days only, it's still possible to have drug users in this batch tbh.
---
In classic Horde have the majority on Oceania. More so than other regions probably because wanted to try something different from Retail where they're probably Alliance and have been for many years.
---
Retail is as it is by chance in that Frostmourne Alliance guilds were incredibly stable which has always attracted more people to the server. OC servers killed Blackrock for the most part and every other server is basically dead as the game has declined, even Barthilas, and so Frostmourne is the last server standing.
---
Not the case for oceania I'm afraid.
---
Sounds like PvP happening on a PvP server
---
Noggenfogger could be a pick. Quite a big Scandinavian community, but there is a lot of you brexit people as well.
---
The server is high pop, but that is hardly noticable since most people are in BGs or raidlogging these days
---
3+ runs of Scholo? Back to back? Fucking masochists.
---
Yep, it's for real.
---
Vanilla's honor system has one particularly fatal flaw that makes it pretty painful: It's all relative to other players so the harder other people no-life the harder you have to no-life
---
You just want to *maintain* your rank of r11? Well, how much time you'll need to dedicate to compensating for RP decay is loosely tied to how much time the top rankers are spending competing with each other for r14
---
If you want to actually progress further then you need to no-life harder than everyone else.
---
If people were to hypothetically agree to a cap of, say, 8 hours a day *max* and no more PvPing after that *and* collectively enforce it by blacklisting players who try to sneak in extra hours, then that's all you'd really have to do.
---
But if there's no mafia formed to keep the honor caps low for the sake of peoples' health then you get a state of utter chaos where, if someone else is playing 20 hours a day, 7 days a week then you have to do the same thing just to compete
---
And if they decide they don't like your competition and start sharing their account with 4 other people to maintain 24/7 uptime on AV farming then, again, if you don't do the same you don't win.
---
&gt;Yes, **everyone** who can do basic math knew this was going to happen.
---
Lots of people in this sub were not able to do such basic math though.
---
Jesus queue time is instant for alliance oceanic (peak times)
---
Perhaps. Just to be sure: I was not trying to say it's "better" or anything. Just trying to give an honest recap of what happened, in an attempt so people can make up their own minds, whether the dip in honor is worth it for them or not.
---
If they've been up for 4-5 days, then they should still be banned for their own health.
---
Ohhhh how do you know, are you watching them online without getting a break? How have you managed it?
---
Yeah it's been rough lately, no idea why the AV queues are taking so long to pop on Oceania. 
---
I'm sort of resigned to waiting for BG weekends to get my AV rep at this rate.
---
The stuff to summon ivus/lok give 5 rep for a 5pack which ends up being 200-250rep to summon.
---
Not if you add 10 minutes of queuetime.
---
Play on a PvE or RP server and you won't have to deal with toxic private server players. They're the ones ruining the game.
---
Me walking into the Eastern Pestlands from Tirisfal...
---
This happens on my server right before MC entrance on raid nights. Pretty ridiculous that you can get one shot by these fuckers and lose your buffs before a raid. You can't even see their bodies sometimes because they die in the lava.
---
From info I gotten you can maybe reach 10k/h maybe a bit more. and thats if ur stomping hard.
---
Witty isn't right maybe shitty. But no wits were involved in that comment.
---
Well, aren't you a clueless one?
---
The queues started to get bigger BEFORE turtling started.
---
The reason why queues are longer is because Alliance had 3 days of maximizing REPUTATION, and since Alliance is basically a PvE faction, the more players get to exalted, they stopped queing for AV.
---
The ratio of Horde / Alliance players queing for AV became worse the more Alliance players get to exalted. And there were a TON of them getting exalted in first 3 days, winning 90% of the games, and winning them after 4 min queues and 6 min AV, getting max rep in 10 min (but less honor), while Horde getting crap rep (but max honor).
---
And yes, it will get worse for Horde queues, but not because we turtle. We turtle because Alliance stopped queueing in the first place, after their PvE players reach their goal : getting exalted.
---
Will they, or will it just be the next line of bots?
---
This is why I know horde die on the way to aid station.  I backdoor jump/solo the guards then watch people nearly die just trying to mount to where I am, thinking it must be safe to get there.  Of course they aggro every NPC along the way... odd that alliance don't seem to have this problem.
---
Everytime i see the Russians Horde I know I am in for a good game. Both teams zerg easy 2.7k + in 7 min. But when you see Earthshaker holy shit both alliance and horde from that server are special.
---
One thing is that also 40+ mins of AV games happens. yesterday played all evening (dont know the count of games) and had planty of 10min 3k honor games, 15 min 1k honor games and few 40+ 1k-2k honor games.
---
It‚Äôs easier to get a premade in av as alliance than horde. You countdown the queue and it insta procs and if enough of you are in then you go and if not then you re-queue.  On horde you have to wait the queue time and then just hope everyone is in.
---
You could gain 3 ranks, if you got to bracket 14.   GL doing that though, as it's largely dominated by people botting and/or account sharing.
---
^ This
---
I'm planning to hit r14.
---
I'm just not insane enough to try in the first few months.
---
Maybe a year or two from now when the environment is far less inhospitable and I've got all the best possible gear in the game *then* I'll put my hat into the ring.
---
But for now, eh, I'll savor PvE progression while it's still a thing. Honor will always be there but BWL will only be "new" once
---
The big brain strat. I like it
---
You have to set achievable goals
---
It's entire EU in one pool yes. Alliance has instant queues (couple of seconds AT MOST) and horde has to wait.
---
Can confirm: everything he said is true. Was with this guild from their start. Won a ton of their MC loot then left. Screw Regilol and Pooface
---
Not the guy and its only 17-18k per hour but Maitoz on twitch runs WSG premades because its better honor at this point.
---
1.1 mil thats alliance tribe. It will go up. But shitty acount sharig turtmeister needs to fall in line or get banned first.
---
If you don't do much pvp, you won't need shadowtrance and exhaustion at all and you can put points to fel and drain life. This is one of the reasons I play in pve server. It is so much faster to level and grind, when you can ignore those 2 talents. 
---
Pve server setup for level 40:
---
3 suppression
---
5 corruption
---
2 life tap
---
5 drain life
---
1 coa
---
1 amp curse (use it often)
---
2 grim reach
---
1 siphon
---
5 shadow mastery
---
1 dark pact
---
After that demonic embrace maxed, 2 more points to imp coa, max fel int, max fel stamina, fel dom, master summoner.
---
At level 60 respec. Leave dark pact and take Demonic sacrifice instead, or just respec to sm ruin raid spec with maxed fel con(that drain life can save your life in raid also) Optionally for PvP purposes you can go for exhaustion. In pve server I can keep max fel con, which makes farming a lot easier. I hope this was helpful :)
---
To expand on this using the original examples‚Äî
---
Playing exclusively 4k 20 min wins: 2 x 20min games and 2x 10min queues to get into those games = 8k in 1 hr = 8k/hr
---
Playing exclusively 2k 8min losses: 5x 8 min games and 5x 10min queues to get into those games = 10k in 100 min = 6k/hr
---
Playing to win right now is maximized honor/hr by the given numbers.
---
Little mounds of snow in the ground
---
Hahha thats funny. Pooface was the member that was being so terrible to me specifically. I‚Äôm glad you got out, friend.
---
Who were the Alliance players?
---
Alliance can skip the bottom part of the Horde base very easily on their mount, and ride through to the Horde GY without adding anything, kill the one Commander Guarding it and are right onto Drek's adds.   
---
That's very little Honor but foolproof Drek rushing.
---
Because its fun. Last week i ganked a lvl 42 hunter 17 times on my lvl 41 rogue while watching Netflix. Later he came with his main. A 60 warrior. But he was so bad at the game and only had a 60% mount. So he couldnt catch me. But he didn't give up either. So i vanish for the improved stealth. Sap him and hs out while /lol and /spit. Fly back to where we were and kill his hunter 4 more times.
---
Not true, as the horde are turtling more and games get longer wsg is gonna be better, think u need to do a game every 10 mins in av to be better then wsg and kill litu.
---
I... Mean... You see the hypocrisy here... right ? You legit insulted people in your reply. So to use your own words, "Stop  throwing out insults every time someone disagrees with you, It's time to grow up."
---
&gt; You'd think he'd go for things like the Bloodfang boots from scholo, and the epic chest from arena, but no? I don't understand.
---
dungeon tanking is very trivial with many people heading to tank raids instead, there is honestly no wrong choice gear-wise for dungeon taking as long as it is not cloth or completely missing tanking stats you should be good.
---
I experienced the same, but I‚Äôm 99% sure he just entered a BG when he realised he was gonna die.
---
The chance is 50:50
---
Horde I assume?  Guess the queue time makes it more sense to solo.  On alliance because insta queue it‚Äôs much easier to group up.
---
Of course the people at the top don't have jobs, but that's part of what people are trying to get through your head. A legit player in this thing looks very similar to a bot. Its almost as if an officially sanction competition to see who can play the most is a bad idea.
---
thanks, I'm on duty now.
---
The long con
---
Could be as simple as them simply using more consumables than you. Don‚Äôt underestimate the use of mana pots on fights(and time them well on fights like baron)
---
For rep it is absolutely better to turtle, at least once you are revered.  Right now we have 10 minute queues, if you just play the zerg strat alliance will beat you three times in an hour and you will get a total of ~850 rep with the turn in.  If you defend and turtle, you can do it perfectly and get two wins in an hour for ~1500-1700 rep.  If you fuck it up a little and end up in a full on turtle you will get 1500 rep from a single 50 minute game.  
---
The first one will get you more honor than a full on turtle, and about the same as the two 20 minute games.  But from a rep perspective (which is what most people care about) the turtles are much much better.
---
Is that last screenshot some bragging about the 5100 honor(in 54! Minutes?)
---
On the contrary, Alliance are now back out in the world since BGs dropped. Considering the long Horde queue times, me and my guild have already started ganking Thorium Point again.
---
How do you know someone plays on a pve server?
---
Dont worry, they will let you know
---
That was a really good game.
---
Oops the. I saw some guy with almost top standing on Chromie with super low honor, thought that would be RP.
---
Sucks that you have to switch client language to actually play there.
---
Motherfucker has the secret service playing round the clock....taxpayer dollars at work.
---
They got absolutely destroyed in WPvP and are now super salty.
---
Sure they do happen but rarely imo.  Happens more if the ab you get is full pug but if you queue a few friends in on useful classes (tanks and healers mostly) you can reduce the chance of a turtle game pretty well.
---
why the fuck would any alliance in their right mind que into a 45 min horde turtle every match after exalted. cant wait for horde to qq on reddit when they are sitting in 30 min av ques cause alliance cba playing into a turtle every match
---
The people that could fall for it wouldn't know how to enable class colors anyway (or is it on by default now I heard?)
---
Apes definitely chose the optimal race, optimal for PvP over raiding though.
---
Rep is much much better in turtles than in zerg loses.  If you can win zergs they are better, but as horde you absolutely cannot win those unless the alliance are absolute garbage, their advantages are far too large.
---
thats because what u think is all of the ''alliance'' is actually just 15-20 with epic mount. half of ally is questing, fishing, or afk at spawn
---
Does anybody know what kind of dog breed the small dog is? 
---
I had a dog that looked just like him growing up and I always wondered what he was. I found him on a hike with my friend one day in the middle of nowhere so I didn‚Äôt have any information about him.
---
I was upset when SethRoguen was taken
---
Mage/Druid.
---
Imagine a mage, except this mage heals himself, can just skeedaddle out of any bad situation, has a million dots, can stealth, has an additional interrupt, is immune to a lot of cc, can just afk in bearform vs melee, the list goes on. It would be impossible to beat.
---
Downright filthy.

Calling someone dumbis childish behavior.  Calling that out is not an insult.
---
God, I've been in a lot of raiding guilds over the years and this is my number one sign to get the fuck out quick. Yes, it's important to be up to date on the latest info but unless you are actually at a competitive level, *at least* doing realm first/second/thirds, this type of min/maxing will cause more strife in your guild than it's worth. *If* you're at that level, most raiders will understand that the good of the many comes before the loot of the few, but as long as you're not there, it just seems like petty favoritism about a percentage that is not gonna make the difference in a kill anyway.
---
"But we're a *serious* raiding guild about to become as famous as Mythic!" No. No you're not. And on the off chance you are, it's still more important to keep morale up in your raids than it is to get that slight edge, at least *until* you're up there with the big boys. Before that, it won't matter nearly as much as you think.

APES has been streaming WSG all day yesterday.
---
Heres their GM with 10 members from APES.

Heres Hydra, member of the 2nd team. So thats another 10
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/521296831?t=04h09m35s

Their BG team holds the top 30.

Clearly there are servers where not everyone is spamming WSG.

You¬¥re completely wrong.

Maybe they are asleep the same time as you are, you know :)

&gt;if he is not account sharing ( my guess he is)

Well, duh. This is what he is able to afford exactly.

50:50 you guess it right or wrong

Isn't selling mageweave on ah more profitable?

You didn't call anyone out mate, you insulted everyone on the subreddit. There's a difference, I'd suggest you learn it. As it stands, your a hypocrite. End of discussion.

Ok, when are they going to fix hunter?
---
The fact that you are calling me an asshole and cannot accept that you are insulting me is enough to conclude that a. your logic skills are pretty terrible b. you are unable to admit being wrong in any fashion. That's on top of having already demonstrated that you are eager to pass down judgement based on hasty conclusions.
---
All that is enough to conclude that your opinion can be safely dismissed. Have a good day!
---
At level 52, which boss do I go up too for BRD?
---
Thinking about rolling some kind of utility spellcasting PvP druid build. Will be only my second or third character - is it possible? Their spells appeal to me more than their shapeshifting.
---
According to Perplexity they're a legit team.
---
Thanks legend. LOVE listening to these on my commute to work
---
Something is seriously fucky with how high his honour earned is, can anyone explain this? How can you get that much?
---
Because the alliance archers actually do something.  The first person to get archer aggro will 100% die to them before getting to the GY.  In full tank gear, running through in Bear with 7k+ hp I still get absolutely dominated to the point that I cannot possible pull the flag guards without dying, if I am first through and get the aggro.  
---
You have to go to the north bunker, reset and heal up before moving on.  Just one of the several massive alliance advantages, ally can get through to aid station with only taking ~1200 damage, versus our 6k+
---
No, calling it out means you have only 1 correct outcome, so 1 in a 100.
---
locks may be the biggest exception, your mc set is built for pvp
---
Some of the US private server players do play EU servers. There are some Americans in apes.
---
Ye guess be will have to roll Rogue, mage, hunter, shaman... Every other class that can one shot now
---
My bad, you want to ban people without any proof of cheating based on their /played the last week and that makes you a superiorly intelligent being.
---
There's an addon called HonorSpy, it let's you see your current rank and how you're faring against other players on your server and based on that it tries to predict what your rank will be next week.
---
Almost everyone in bracket 14 and 13, but especially 14, are cheating.  Everyone knows this.  idk why people are defending these people, unless they are these people.    Either that, or it's sort of like how some poor people of a certain leaning tend to defend rich.
---
I mean everyone was told that rank 13-14 are borderline impossible. Idk what you expect. People are gonna cheat, bot, account share, drug binge, call off work and play for 16 hours a day. It is what it is.
---
A thousand times, this!  There is a reason these two mobs feature in a lot of nostalgic memories people have of vanilla.  They are flavor, and a particularly memorable flavor for a lot of people.  They did a lot to ground the world as a real place with its own thing going on and it wasn‚Äôt all a series of small stepping stones on your way to max level.
---
I mean, the world is so well traveled now and there are so many shared stories about these mobs that they don‚Äôt have quite the same mystery and danger that they used to.  But I was glad to see them again
---
Did you buy a lottery ticket straight after, Lady Luck smiles upon you
---
won a roll with a 69 and the rest of the discord erupted omegaluls
---
Stupid horde and their *shuffles deck, draws card* unwillingness to let us win the game.
---
You can hunter pull drek and FD after warrior taunts him off. It still comes with one warmaster and 2 dogs though.
---
I think I might start fishing in AV
---
I just dont understand the pirate server philosophy of exploit to the max.  If you are going to cheat at literally everything in the game, why not just go play retail?
---
interesting
---
Such title opportunity missed
---
In a priest mirror UD is better because fear ward should always be dispelled before using PS.  There is no counter to WotF.  Against locks fearward is far better though.
---
Account sharing doesnt count as "cheating" aslong you do it within the family.
---
So the well-known alliance tactic is to cry on reddit instead of playing the game.
---
What about Squar? Did you follow Squar?
---
good
---
Unlikely. It's still best honor grind. Queue times are going up because 10 minute games are getting more rare.
---
&gt; Odd, it's 3-6 am
---
Yes very odd. It's 01:05PM here but timezones, countrys outside the US and so on, very odd stuff going on.
---
I hit 60 yesterday, Prot Warrior, and wondering if I'm missing something on the next steps. I've done MC attunement and doing ony attunement, got a decent amount of pre-BIS. Anything else I should be concentrating on right now?
---
Takes me back to that one time I accidentally crossed the border to the western plaguelands while I was levelling in tirisfal. It didn‚Äôt end well.
---
YEs they are FUCK rushing av that is fucking boring
---
Moving more into the meth realm here.
---
Sure, but he's making a guide. And he went with the strategy of telling people what items to pick, instead of telling them how to choose good items.
---
Honestly, this is a trend I see a lot in guides to classic, people are making them when they themselves don't really know what they're doing. Obviously "shaman tank" is a niche field so the quality will naturally be lower, but still. Wowhead guides for instance are often either bad or not useful, along the lines of "just grind r14 for bis 4head".
---
Found a botter.
---
honor: 6969696 ü§î
---
I don't think there are zones next to eachother that easily available.
---
Since we cant dictate how others play the best strat is the one that benefits ourselves the most, its basic game theory.
---
Holy shit that server is loaded with bots.
---
I believe he means d e r e k
---
what a massive waste of instance IDs
---
I've not even touched AV or WSG yet and have 37HKs. Not even more than 15 on the same week so still rank 0.
---
First of all, you get rep no matter what you do, it just depends on what your team is doing, you do not need to be close.
---
Second, on a 60% mount I am always in time to Balinda to start killing Lieutenants and Commanders, as well as her. It's not that much slower. Just ride with the zerg and tank the elites.
---
Something like this: 
---
NF/Ruin: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/35002004122--52500051020001
---
I wasn't even aware. Thanks for the heads-up
---
I heard there was originally a checkbox in options and it was removed later in favor of making it the default, but everyone that started early had the old "off" value saved already.
---
Honestly I loved the fear that mob brings. Every other mob in silverpine forest is either killable or almost killable. An enemy with no recourse other than to run is a good reminder that you're only level 15
---
Very wasteful to give any healer two cauterizing bands as you replace one with pure elementium band from nef.
---
This is the main issue imo. Even if it was just so we could duo queue. Half the fun of WoW is shooting the shit with friends while playing.
---
Don‚Äôt forget: 
---
This is how you AV
---
I lost with a tie roll
---
PvP happened on PvP server
---
It‚Äôs all Blizzard‚Äôs fault
---
Is it too late to try classic?
---
should have rolled alliance then I'm always playing AV with a bunch of guildies lol
---
Bracket sorting already?
---
Yes? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Dal rends are best if you‚Äôre weaving, barbarous is better if you‚Äôre not.
---
quality shitpost
---
35 mins is not, and never will be a proper AV.
---
I can guarantee you he's a UD engineer who will rather run away 10 min from 10 ennemies than just dieing
---
It's gandling EU, the guys who make the brackets are a shitty guild that allow pubs to push it they're all a bunch of crayon munchers sadly.
---
Nice! My feeling as a Warrior is close to this.
---
Go ask that paladin that bubble pulled drek's room TWICE and bragged about it.
---
My guess is they got to the level that‚Äôs required to appear on the armory (like 18 or something f) before you, therefore they got the name. 
---
Just a guess. Could be a glitch. Maybe contact a gm.
---
I agree as well. Memes are adding nothing to the table, but a quick smirk at best. 
---
Plus they get repeated like a virus. One out of ten is funny and the rest are bad taste posts that clutter my feed. 
---
I can definitely live without them.
---
I recommed pvp servers. They offer unique experience. Sometimes you will be killed by bored level 60 but then form group of couple people and hunt him back. Pvp servers are not good for people who easily give up.
---
As for first class rogue and warrior are best because they have by far coolest weapons and armor.
---
Lmao
---
One of my favorite subreddits is the Stellaris one because of how much I learn reading it. And it took me a little to realize that there were no memes, and it hit me why it was so much better than other game/entertainment subreddits I follow
---
I guess.. 
---
duel yes.
---
god i hate that server
---
How will they know they need to improve if nobody's honest with them?
---
No, I'm saying that 2h is better than 1h when weaving, because you are only ever going to be doing one Raptor Strike then going back to ranged. A 2h Raptor Strike will always be better damage than two 1h.
---
The gnome looks like it has an extremely distorted face and I‚Äôm scared.
---
The other day I buffed 9 mages and 3 priests (I'm a druid) and not one buffed me back. Frustrating
---
Well as i said i threw this together very fast, it's more of a build path more than a guide, also yes you're right rend is prio. And as written on Anger Management "Not required but i like to have it"
---
We don't want to go too far with condemning common posts. That last one is new people who obviously don't frequent the subreddit and we don't want to be cliquey and drive people away.
---
This is amazing.
---
Feral tank / dps spec is like playing a bad version of a rogue / warrior in pvp (only good if you play tank in AV maybe.
---
If you 0/30/21, you can use feral + heal + sustain, great for 1v1 duels due to charge, nature swiftness and stuff.
---
If personally use the one Sodapop using during the duel tournament, its good for both duels and large fight combat. Its more moonglow-ish build (balance/resto), with T1 gear and having moonfire+insect swarm up at all times, rooting and healing.
---
Ty!
---
I know exactly that feeling. It‚Äôs so satisfying when a rogue who starts fighting you pops evasion. That will not change anything, say good bye boy!
---
As people play AV more and more. The more META will change, from one to another. Now alot of hords are tryig to intercept before they reach balin building in gap between it and snowfall gy, then sometimes allys start going left, to avoid this. This will just keep on developing
---
Is that 30 in feral and 21 in resto?
---

---
I know what you said. I know what i said.
---
It's relative. If you are comparing it to the pve meta, i understand why you might not be dissapointed with this AV.
---
If you are comparing it to proper AV, it sucks.
---
Every wolf and bear on the southern perimeter of Felwood.
---
tbf that sounds like police siren "weeeeeeee"
---
There is a trinket you can get which ports you back
---
That frost shock resist tho! :''(
---
This is the type of quality content this sub needs.
---
&gt;If you are comparing it to proper AV, it sucks.
---
Eeeeeeh, I did do proper AV back in the day and it's fine for like....1 match. I know some people liked the chilled out, 6 hours AV, but I prefer these medium length, more action-y but still relatively tactical AVs.
---
It's not entirely the grind war that was intended, but it's fun in its own right.
---
Could you elaborate?
---
Was this since phase 2?
---
probably does that but sometimes even the nolifers have to sleep, I guess some friend of him logging in and queuing + parking the character there in AV while the account owner is actually sleeping.
---
Edit: account sharing is nothing new, ppl did that in vanilla too.
---
&gt;it's 1% not 1 in 100
---
Both of these mean exactly the same thing. When speaking of probabilities, uncertainty of any specific outcome goes without saying (unless of course the probablity is 100%).
---
I know people who left Grob because alliance was toxic af.
---
What bracket are you referring to, and how do you know what bracket other people are in?
---
Epic mount will be a grind as a warrior.
---
Start grinding AV rep for your Don Julio‚Äôs.
---
Finish getting your pre-raid bis.
---
Gold/hour/zone varies a lot depending on your class and even strategy, you can use FarmLog addon to track GPH and just try. Give each zone a few hours and you'll know.
---
I don't see any russians in my team any more, or random russians in enemy team. It's either no russians at all or 40 enemy russians.
---
And here I thought no one was gonna beat my Bankimoonkin :(
---
&gt; Can't do a dungeon any other way than the best strat without being called names or kicked out.
---
Well, 80% people on pvp server are horde so it's a given people will maximize gain.
---
that is wrong. you need it - you can check it by urself in the hall.. all mounts require the specific riding (for example tiger needs tiger riding skill (1)
---
Alliance waiting to give the Horde ‚Äúready checks‚Äù üòÜ
---
This shit is perfect with the added little flairs of frost shock and the rogue. It makes a  comedy.
---
Oof. My troll priest at level 13 going from Brill to EPL. Fun times
---
Isn‚Äôt he the Engineer? Potion injector is great,, but it is no substitute for a real healer.
---
My mage is called Yeetler and I still haven't been force namechanged. Not sure why.
---
Yeah, the first day, everyone was just rushing and the games were 8 minutes long. Now horde actually learned that they can't win by rushing and figured out that they need to send ~10 people back to break up the alli rush so that we can actually win.
---
Only the AV ones. Hardpacked. Normal ones has a chance to knock down allies.
---
I weirdly remember wiki-ing the same word when I was younger in TBC.
---
And versus Hunters you‚Äôll spend very little time in animal form, and try to root them and cast from the dead zone while the pet is hibernated. If you go beast form they‚Äôll fear beast, Fd + Trap then lay on a series of huge shots on you. And if you go beast form to get them you‚Äôll just end up in that trap, and feared again after another volley of hits.
---
I‚Äôm kind of glad it keeps the toxic honor grind confined to AV. It lets WSG be primarily the fun mode without people crying to let the other team win for easier honor after losing 1 cap.
---
This is Herod.
---
no true scotsman
---
It absolutely was not.
---
Doesn't want to help by making water for people (no reagent, just mana), but can lay down a portal to IF/SW (18s reagent) to grief newbies... Seems legit.
---
jesus fucking christ the people saying "well alliance queues are instant!" must be the dumbest fucking people on the face of the plane
---
no fucking shit the alliance with fewer people has faster queue times wow you're a fucking prophet dude
---
Nice bait.
---
Just like a true enh shaman
---
As much as us pvp players raging about being farmed by allies ?
---
"I am too lazy to message people and ask them to group together, so I'm going to cry that the game is anti-social single player"
---
Nice ty!
---
Awesome ty dude!
---
I mean anyone attempting to draw parallels to vanilla AV and this are already slipping on ice. This AV is the "latest" AV which had everything removed and nerfed to the ground. It's not like you can do *that* much. 
---
Besides I think the people who wants to see those hour long AVs are the same crowd that will quit playing AV within a few days. There are many players (me included) burning 10 hours+ a day just to get R10 gear and none of use wants to sit in hour long AVs extending the amount of hours we need to invest.
---
PvE all the way. PvP servers are just hellish nightmares of ganking once you hit level 20.
---
you're a ding dong.   you can purge fear ward.  you can't purge wotf.
---
Because thems the rules. If you want a game that isn't handicapped by game design decisions made almost 20 years ago, maybe try the version of WoW that has been patched and changed over time to make it accessible.
---
My level 12 mage on that zepplin, looking like that baby yoda meme sitting between two skull-level players
---
A perpetual shit-post machine!
---
It was changed to what it is known as today very early in TBC.
---
bene is easy to do. And farming demons in wintersprings was nice pvp tbh.
---
&gt; Being able to pull 1 mob from a pack with a ranged weapon
---
Strangely enough this doesn't seem to work in Classic. If you pull one mob and other mobs chain with it, the other mobs do not reset even if you don't damage them at all. I tested this multiple times, using a ranged attack to pull 1 mob, and not touching the 2nd mob that came with it, and even though I completely killed the first mob while kiting it away, the second mob kept chasing me even with 0 damage on it.
---
We're going to be seeing this no matter what. The only time this doesn't happen is when AV just releases.
---
*My* cognitive dissonance? :D I have literally proven you wrong and you did nothing to address it. Oh well. Since you can't take the hint, get blocked.
---
this morning my friend instead of saying the number he got he just said nice and i did not get it for 20 sec
---
When you already pick  horde for those sweet pvp racial trait, complain about others for minmaxing is just hypocrisy.
---
Chicken or the egg.
---
I really really like this. Shift, ctrl and alt.
---
Big dick heals!
---
Yeah I use true aim and hit ring to cap in raid
---
Also, with the broken ammounts of honor AV yields you should grind that for ranking. As horde u get 3.5-5k honor per match with matches usualy lasting like 10-15min. EU horde ques about 10min.
---
Clearly hax
---
?
---
This is one of the biggest reasons I didn't roll Alliance when I saw the census pre-launch, it's only going to get worse once the queues get bigger for Horde.
---
Thank you
---
I'm not here to throw ad homs back and forth. You clearly lack some introspection. If you are not currently seeing a therapist, I'd suggest you try one out.
---
This is exactly what I said though: alliance are too slow to adjust to new horde tactics so they lose.
---
Same. We haven't even seen a mageblade drop yet.
---

I just want fun and rep.. Honor.. Well lets be real, i dont have the time to go higher than like rank 6 so its not a priority for me
---
Player undead were considered undead early on in the game, but it was too imbalanced, so they made them humanoids like everyone else.
---
Didn't expect to hear my favorite song here!
---
Oh man I already know this threads comments are gonna make me wonder even more haha
---
afaik they ban in waves... But they probably just don't really care about it.
---
You forgot ‚ÄúI have seen the ice lord and/or forest lord in AV!‚Äù
---
I know this to be the case, I just wish they could still somehow remain undead without giving them the pvpbreaking undead abilities like immunity to fear.
---
If they could still be classified as undead so that paladins spells could still work on them while not being immune to fear or polymorph, etc, it would be a net gain for alliance for sure, but not gamebreakingly good.
---
Although, I know this will never, ever happen, so one can only dream.
---
There‚Äôs no definitive or right answer.
---
Choose what‚Äôs comfortable to you, and it will change as you learn and adapt your rotation.
---
I normally use 1-5 for my main spells, and E R F T G X C V etc. for totems and other spells.
---
Horde win AV maybe 1 in 6. It‚Äôs really shtty.  Alliance are steamrolling. 
---
Also, queues are up to 11min now.
---
Cringe
---
Fake, no wf procs
---
PM me the URL that was sent to you i want to check it out, obviously it's a phishing website but i just wanna see how it looks.
---
Funny you should mention, this fix only came a couple days after [a Rogue posted a video about abusing the Reckoning functions through the Hand of Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5283U9X9M).
---
Then they wont make it. Here m8. You go down to tarrenmill take a left. Pass the wall check elementals go back. go north take the inbetween to hinterland check alliance hub go north take the alliance path check scholo entrance. 4mins tops.  Just because ppl want 14 doesnt mean they will get it or even have a realistic idea. Ppl on your list wont make it if they do what you say. Also go check twitch there are several ppl streaming 18h a day at...no botting. Doesnt mean i disagree thats its ludacris and def not worth it. Say you top your bracket since release. A that means your a rogue or mage and are falling back to bg competition. B it still means playing 18h a day till aprox half feb. You dont top your bracket. Add another 2 weeks. Cold hard facts.  I did it twice once on nordrasil vanilla (osmosis lock if you dont believe) and once on pserver.  And trust me its not healthy or worth it especialy now that most of us are adults with jobs missing classes np missing steady income no tnx.  90% of the ppl going for it will drop off due to burnout or the gap. 9% will never make it past r 12/13 . 0.5 will be a gen1 r14 and the other 0.5 after. Ppl have unrealistic ideas that its ez. Classic honorsystem is bad af and doesnt reward skill just ingame time especialy with the min max mentelaty atm. I rather have a mmr system in place but that would make the nochanges autists rage
---
Kirtonos?
---
&gt; now it's completely dead (if they don't revert or fix this change).
---
Why would Blizzard revert or fix this change if they're keeping things consistent with 1.12? Sounds like Classic+ material.
---
No one gives a shit about winning. Its a rep grind. Who gives two shits if it takes you 14 or 17h.
---
&gt; the only reason reck bomb is getting fixed is because it's a poor paladin
---
From Blizzard's mouth it didn't work this way in 1.12, unlike the other classes' combos that weren't taken on a rollercoaster of changes every other patch.
---
It will spam of doom.
---
I understand the mods reasoning, but from my experience: people DO NOT use pinned messages, read FAQs or  google the solution to their problems. Hence, we are trading slightly more google results for a completely unreadable front page. I hope they know what they are doing.
---
Level with double gathering professions and decide at 60 if you want to change, a level 35 alt can be level 300 alchemist so I find it easier to have an alt craft all your pots and stuff
---
To be honest, I just want exorcism to work on them. I don't care are fear immune and shackle undead, literally just allow paladin abilities to work on them since thats kind of what paladins main thing is all about.
---
When I said:
---
&gt; If they could still be classified as undead so that paladins spells could still work on them while not being immune to fear or polymorph, etc,
---
That etc was including shackle undead, and whatever other CC type abilites work on undead. Sure paladins have turn undead which will fear them, but again, from a lore perspective paladins spells should work on undead characters. But I understand from a gameplay persepctive why this doesnt work and will not work.
---
I think the first hit was WF, with a Nice 1337 Cherry on top of it.
---
What the actual fuck is this meme supposed to be....
---
Alliance won nearly all of the first AVs as the BG structurally favours them- easier tower layout, less choke points and there's probably other factors too. However horde have adapted stratagy and atleast in my experience win 60% of games now. Seems alliance arnt used to pvping in AV as 5 defenders can quite easily wreck their whole advance.
---
I guess depends on whats happening? I haven't lost my last three matches, and when I started a few hours ago I won about half (little more).
---
I think there are people who still dont realize theres diminishing returns on killing the same player. The default UI makes it seem like your gaining honor when your not. My last WSG game was both teams defending flags while the majority fought in middle over and over..
---
Its so weird seeing how this av meta has changed from private servers, probably has alot to do with the nerfed npcs too. I remember alliance would always turtle at bridge and we would Get raped by the archers since they hit like twice AS hard on private servers.
---
30mins on my server :&lt;
---
And this is why mages in my raids straight up refuse to remove curses.
---
I think the easier red flag is the people with top Honor this week but did 2000 honour or less before that in previous weeks.
---
Anyone serious about the game would've been world PvPing as you could've got rank 8, that's nothing to scoff at for someone who cares. Now with an easy que east abuse system you have countless names you've never heard of at the top. Their MIGHT, be the odd exception where someone got back late to the game, but honestly 99% of these people should just be outright banned.
---
I would not even see it, because people would downvote it. Unless you would post to the dolphin porn subreddit.
---
Ah see, I didn't get to play Tuesday - Thursday. It was raid night, plus, I'm old so I don't play much till weekend.
---
&gt; I think the easier red flag is the people with top Honor this week but did 2000 honour or less before that in previous weeks.
---
I get what you are saying, but there's lots of people that hated the wpvp.  Gangbang gank squads and corpse camping.  PvP should be fair.  If they can't fight back, then they're just an npc.
---
So they learned nothing because you dont actually want to win.
---
Getting exalted comes as a bonus. The real bottleneck is honor.
---
&gt;Being the "wrong" race will not stop you getting invited to anything.
---
Oh it deff will stop you besides casual pugs maybe.
---
Yeah but how often are these waves? Plenty of bots have farmed for weeks and dinged 60 and are now just auto farming gold for gold sellers. Like the waves should be frequent enough that bots don't have a chance to generate hundreds of dollars in gold before they get banned
---
As a Rogue, this week has taught me one thing: Don't play with your food. Give it 1 inch of room and my leather armor will become this warrior's new living room rug.
---
As a 60 Alliance priest on Shazzrah, I think the release of battlegrounds helped a ton. For a while the game was almost unplayable, but two days ago I was farming some items in Eastern Plaguelands for about 5 hours and I only got attacked twice. That‚Äôs a huge difference from when the honour system was just released and you got ganked the second you landed at a flight path. You can even run to Blackrock Mountain without having to do twenty corpse runs now. It‚Äôll get better, no need to reroll.
---
In Slovenian language, "Drek" means "shit"
---
Russians are everywhere what are you on about?
---
But yes languages and even realm type should've been seperated. But blizzard puts literally zero thought into the impacts of their actions
---
Imagine rolling the race with the best mounts in classic (Kodo) then buying any other mount. Like trading in your Rolls for a Honda.
---
It shouldn't. People who care are the ones truly hurting this game.
---
I agree that trying to wipe us at Balinda is a bad idea, the whole zerg passes by there and it would take at least 10 allies to overcome us.  If I was playing ally on a slow mount, I'd lay low until the zerg passes and then back cap.
---
Us 60% Andys..
---
Feels bad man
---
Should be ‚ÄúYOU LOSE MONKEYBOY‚Äù
---
This guy shamans:D
---
lmao the numbers popping up is legendary. Wish I knew how to do this
---
Running piercing howl all the time. It‚Äôs just QoL in so many situations.
---
rng
---
Hmmm, that's disappointing. I'm playing Alliance and I was hoping for some decent games of AV, don't know why I would expect that of course. Is it really just a washout like you say?
---
The numbers popping up made me laugh everytime.   
---
What program did you use to do this? I have a lot of free time today and would like to put some towards figuring this out and maybe making one of my own!
---
Doubt bracket 1 players are pushing rank 14, thats where all the 15 HK people are
---
Been having fun leveling an alt there, but not gonna lie, it's a bit disheartening how many multiboxers and "xOrcSlayerx" aliases I've encountered. It's like, why are you even playing on a RP server...
---
Random RP has also been very very light, which I guess is fine. Feels like I'm rolling a dice which decides is it gonna be any interesting playing there. So far, no natural 20.
---
since vanilla i always thought they were weird. like they were floating/skipping.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt kill people who are questing except when I do.‚Äù
---
They used to be days so I guess that's what he means
---
On Deviate Delight the population is much closer to a vainilla experience, isn't too big to keep encounter the same people, but it could be a little empy on early hours. I'm on a roleplay guild and we stay IC almost every time in /a, about 40% use the addon Total Roleplay and we have a 60-40 balance in favor to the Alliance.
---
People also level and pvp here since it's RP PVP but if you are in the correc guild the RP will be every day, there are Tauren-only and Undead-only guilds on Horde, they are awesome!
---
Fair? HA! It‚Äôs literally about fucking the other faction.
---
The honor system is broken and should be laughed at instead of no lifed. The pvp stuff is the best looking in the game. Will I ever get it, no. Am I salty about that, no. 
---
I‚Äôm more upset about the bots that directly effect me, like hunters moving in the exact same pattern for hours, characters clearly on click to move going to coordinates. Farming my quest mobs...
---
This happens in all regions.
---
Also would like to see if you actually own much more than goats.
---
That paladins name ahaha.
---
Play the lottery, quick!
---
For cutouts Photoshop. 
---
Then After effects for composing. 
---
And premiere for sound + final render. 
---
   
---
I think all 3 could be done in after effects,  but it just feels awkward. 
---
Hope it will help, and if you have any other question, can /w me anytime
---
Yall need to spend some time raiding Coursera or Khan Academy instead of MC.
---
Did you really respond with "No suck my dick" to someone politely asking you not to cap? Why just just say "no". 
---
You seem like an asshole.
---
I'm one of the people you say don't exist.  Find word PvP boring as all hell, no just now started to rank.
---
Jokes on me though, I'm not running fun WSG premades like I thought I would be so I might as well have done shitty wPvP :(
---
Lets be real. This dude probably has his kids or significant other running to this spot in AV and jumping every 4 minutes. Of course it's acc sharing if they're playing 72 hours straight.
---
exactly.
---
so when someone comes with '' it's fine if I do low damage cause I bring utility like one brez per 20 minute and a water-down innervate'' .... the tanks, and heck smite priest,  outdo you.
---
I got 1300 rep from a 50 min game. I wonder what we did differently.
---
It's ItemRack, simply alt+click on the slot on your character screen to add the menu for that slot.
---
You just made up an extremely unlikely scenario to replicate.
---
I'm exalted with AV, my longest game was 23 minutes and the majority of my games were approximately 8.
---
If you have a die hard 10 man wsg group, you can inefficiently compete. And if you lose a wsg (in this scenario it's not a quick loss either because you've said your team is good)
---
Druid probably kept attacking during reta, I've made that mistake before. Pop Nature's Grasp and heal, bear root/stun in and should be an easy kill.
---
That being said it's still easy to ignore the reta animation and play yourself..
---
The opposite actually. They have always zerged the hardest, but when you manage to defend against it and wipe them they sort of lose their way and start turtling.
---
Even on retail back in MoP and WoD playing a Russian team as horde would mean almost certain loss due to how effective it was with a full 40 zerg.
---
Stop pulling my leg my man, I almost believed that.
---
Didn't think Shamans could DW in vanilla? Thought that was added in BC.
---
If you don't mind the grind, go to the raptors behind the arena in STV. You can get to 42/43 without much hassle.
---
Literally any resource they put into Classic is a waste of money for them. They'd rather just let people pay for the sub and provide no support.
---
buy FAPS and pop them before you pick up the flag. bring a mage with you to peel the melee off helps a lot too
---
BS or Eng cheaper to lvl to get the required door-opener? or should i even bother and just farm devilsaur and mara instead
---
We have a mage pull with iceblock. That gives the tanks just a smidge extra time to pickup or for banishes to go out
---
Nice.
---
For sure it's a bug
---
Wow, such creativity it blows my mind.
---
Yes, and he is able to afford to pay for it. That was my whole point.
---
It does give another chance to proc a instant shadow bolt.
---
Bad Bot
---
It's funny how memory fails us, since I've only ever ran into you in Winterspring once as I never farm there, and killed you 1v1. You must die and get camped a lot since you're confusing me with other horde. Maybe try being better at the game?
---
I had to stop farming in Burning Steppes as I am solo 99% of the time and you and others camp me in groups. It's OK bud, I know this game is hard to play sometimes. Safety in numbers, right?
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers, horde
---
There is less than 300 total horde at level 60. I received 200 honor on the first week and had a standing of 156... at most times throughout the day /who 60 will show less than 50 players.
---
There's a bug in durotar, it would seem, that dead carcasses aren't despawning.  There have been the same dead boars at the gates of orgimmar on my server for days.  its pretty strange.
---
Only if we get immunity to fear, charm, and can see stealth like other undead can.
---
You're lucky then, the queues were great but it really was not pvp, plus losing sucks. I think what lots of redditors miss is that there are plenty of people that will swallow longer games in order to have a better chance of winning. If turtling annoys alliance too then that just the cherry on top.
---
Do any of the Alliance side players stream?  Wonder what their comms were like on their side
---
The site is down... for the second day now... HELP!!!
---
It's no fun preparing for sunken temple without your awesome page. :-)
---
I would give you a gold if i had the money, fucking good quality content
---
1. Nobody sat in that same battleground for "days"
---
2. multi-day AVs were not a common thing, by claiming that AVs were commonly multi-day shows that you never actually played retail vanilla and instead just passed around those few screenshots of AV scoreboards
---
&gt; I keep getting told 10 min queues are the punishment I deserve for being the meme PvP faction 
---
People were saying Horde will have 3 hours queues, not 10 mins. 
---
&gt; And, I keep seeing ally threads mocking horde for slowing up games and not knowing how to PvP 
---
That's just the salt.
---
Protip do partial item names, that way you ahve more than enough space. Example: to equip Azuresong Mageblade just do /equip Azur  
---
As long as you dont have multiple items that start with the same few letters, you can cut the name as short as you want. Same as the /target macros.
---
Exactly
---
The hell. Is this a Photoshop? What's the context of this pic?
---
&gt;"BLIZZ ISN'T SUPPORTING CLASSIC!!!!"
---
...he says, after dozens of hotfixes, bug patches, changes based on community outcry, etc
---
As if warriors use shield wall more than 1/100 of their cds lol
---
I was talkin about rep not honor
---
Yes you did.
---
&gt;This is much like a bug, that would naturally occur in an implementation of RNG. A random number generator needs an input. A so-called seed. That seed has to be unique enough. You can achieve that by having a counter that counts up every raid. Or use a time stamp. Or... cough... accidentally your GUID. Because seeds are usually a combination of things, to ensure they are unique enough.
---
They're not seeding the RNG with your GUID. That's ridicilous.
---
No the weapon is legendary

&gt;level 1Snowjob\_tvScore hidden ¬∑

Fully agree but they never even think for a sec.

---
And yes you should bother.
---
Also 
---
&gt; Leveled my hunter Skinning and Tailoring with the plan of "dem sweet sweet bag golds" 
---
This is a terrible idea to be frank with you. Go engineering and optionally enchanting(you don't need to skill it). Enchanting increases the gold earned in tribute even further and you will be swimming in gold with this method + get engineering for all the gadgets. It's a nobrainer honestly.
---
-flamelash rant-
---
Imagine saying this with a straight face when you have paladins and dwarf priests completely broken in comparison to what horde has, and gnomes being close equvilient for pvp racials
---
1k rep per hour is a downer, isn't it?
---
-_- gonna be like 500g to level it though 
---
ima have to skin a lot of fkn devilsaur -_-
---
That's so much gold hahah. I was doing middle two lines in one pull then and ice block pull with the other graves and what I could get out of the pillars, could never get it to one pull on 60 mount
---
If you're on an american server you've had 1 more day of honour updates so you can't compare it to eu day to day, only on reset day
---
The funniest thing is people bragging about getting their epic mount so long after a launch.
---
I dont mind downvotes
---
Engi leveling is cheap as hell till 225 at least.
---
I'm always like "Sorry tank, I didn't heal you because I was making IRL money instead. Please paypal me $5 if you want heals. Time is money."
---
A lot of them use a mod to change into alliance races.
---
I didn‚Äôt know mark wahlberg played WoW
---
FeelsWarriorMan, I get to sometimes play my character which is neat.
---
&gt;we don't want to be cliquey  
---
  
---
Classic WoW is cliquey by definition
---
yeah i too like playing for 40 minutes and get 2k honor, much fun
---
This happens in pretty much every AV I‚Äôve been a part of. People have been suspended for it by Blizzard. I really don‚Äôt care as I‚Äôve been around since vanilla and won‚Äôt fall for it, but newbies will.
---
Wat
---
Horde? Just queue up and do whatever and you'll be exalted in no time.
---
Who's going to get upset about what?
---
I provide food and water to my groups as long as they are people from my server with whom I have opted to play. If I were in your dungeon group, or your PvE raid, or anything other than Alterac Valley, I will provide everything necessary for the group no questions asked at no cost.
---
You didn't read the OP did you? Maybe you should actually read what is written before jumping to conclusions?
---
The ONLY time I won't provide that service for free in a group is in Alterac Valley solo Q BGs.
---
At least we can play enh to be a totemic warrior!
---
Probability is 1/100 for rolling 82 and (81/100)^N where N is the number of other participants for winning with 82. A tie is considered a failure, but that's up for debate I guess. 0,8% Chance if it was just those two guys rolling.
---
The game is 15 years old mate, you'll be fine.
---
You don't need to max it or anything. 225 is fine.
---
I think my favorite caption for this pic is ‚ÄúPardon me sir, do you have a few minutes to talk about Cthulu, our lord and savior?‚Äù
---
That really sucks.
---
I hope people who do that get suspended ASAP. There is nothing worse than people who waste your time.
---
Heeey I was in that AV! I think we lost so that guy is probably safe :D
---
People are people, it's the same shit on horde.
---
ally is instant for every bg
---
Yes I am still gearing up! 
---
Will definitly look up and try this spec! Thank you so much for your answers!
---
What are you Gold Farmers on about this time..
---
ne, ne prevodi se?
---
this morning people were putting 1 Small Egg for 4g, I'm glad prices has plummeted down to 30s already
---
Mind visioning the ice lord
---
Workin' man's mount
---
Reminding you.
---
Imagine being this mad for someone saying ally queues are instant.
---
1.- obviously people logged out. 
---
2.- false, leaving AV to go to school and coming back to the same AV was normal. And leaving Xu Mouse for 10 hours farming rep afk in some corner of AV was very normal (that's how I got exalted back then).
---
To your stupid claim of me not playing vanilla (which I don't know why I even entertain), my characters were Undead rogue Unixtreme and orc warrior Ktxonda in Agamaggan (EU) and later in C'Thun (Spanish server). I played an average of 12 hours a day so I'm pretty sure I've done more vanilla AVs that you have ever done or will ever do, what you fail to realize is that depending on servers the experience in AV was very different.
---
So maybe you didn't see this in the 2 hours a day that your mom allowed you to play but it was pretty normal until blizzard changed AV precisely to avoid this.
---
Works fine I‚Äôve played a lot on an old MacBook Air
---
Its okay, youll turtle the game for 56 mins to even it out.
---
Raid pieces? I was talking about preraid BIS. I'm sure with raid gear it's quite a bit higher.
---
&gt; As a healer, you can be replaced. Neither Druids, Shamans, Priests, nor Paladins hold a monopoly on healing spells.
---
This is a totally meaningless distinction. There's also lots of mages. Just because in one case the population is made up of more than one class is literally meaningless. If they all decide not to heal you they hold the monopoly.
---
&gt;But, as I said earlier, you don't seem to be here to have an argument in good faith. Enjoy your trolling.
---
I would have assumed the opposite, your points are really bad.
---
Furor IS for cat dps. the best DPS you will shift out and back in for 40 free energy.
---
It's way better rep, which the majority is there for.
---
Plus, it gives about 6-7k honor, not 2k.
---
You're an idiot
---
Niceniceniceni
---
Sorry for late reply. I remember your name from the forums. I‚Äôm a pesky horde player though.
---
I must be in the minority because I‚Äôve been doing 90% WSG. Just a more fun game thus far. Alliance has mostly been waxing us though with their pre-made groups..feels like their revenge for the world PvP
---
I‚Äôve run this build. It‚Äôs fine. You don‚Äôt really need furor, it‚Äôs just min-maxing for solo efficiency.
---
If you actually run to the FP near the tunnel in Moonglade, you can get to org in about 6 min
---
this is the best kind of trolling
---
Cool man, keep being shitty. There's tons of decent mages out there not acting like shitheads over a couple seconds of a game. I'm sure your essay will live on as a turning point in accepted behaviors.
---
If only that was what we actually got.
---
Exactly. 99% of people there are there for the BiS-till-AQ items that exalted gives. In 2 months from now, where mostly everyone has done the grind, the majority will want honour. Till then, aiming to win will always be the meta because that is what the vast majority benefits from.
---
Baby has mailman's eyes
---
Easiest matchup?! Locks are the hardest matchup for us. That's why we need to come prepared with all that shit. And even then if your cooldowns are down, you die.
---
If you cast frostbolts on a player with 90 frost resistance you are on average doing 22,5% less dps on that target.  
---
If you cast polymorph on a player with 90 arcane resistance you have +1% of the spell being completely resisted.
---
You can do it different ways. Alliance -&gt; have a paladin run in and bubble While NOBODY  does anything. Mobs will attack paladin and the tanks can easily pick up adds and banishes can be done easy. A mage with iceblock can also do it. It just requiires nobody do anything or the mobs will run the to raid.
---
More fool prove way. All raid stand together with tanks ontop of healers who will most likely take the first aggro from healing MT. You send a hunter pet in and suicide and they will all just run to the raid where tanks can pick them up.
---
you shouldnt have said that last line imo. 
---
Just drop the mic and walk away.
---
Lunch.
---
Having furor will be a massive gain for when you are not tanking. I would recommend taking points out of think hide if you want a hybrid spec.

---
Oooooooooooooooooooohhh
---
Leveling was a part of P1, there wasn't a lot of pvp happening in there: also we know alliance is dominant on PVE realms where this argument is hardly relevant.
---
Dismounting is usually a death sentence.
---
&gt;   Alliance have [...] slightly better towers
---
What? Stonehearth is completely avoidable. Horde has to pass through Icewing. Alliance has to pass through both Iceblood &amp; Tower Point. 
---
In the Horde base both Horde towers fire on Alliance that pull commanders outside. 
---
On the other hand Horde just skip the Northern Alliance tower by backdooring First Aid station and are never fired upon by it unless they actively try to take it.
---
the elite threshers in the lake in Redridge
---
&gt; That's the reason transmutes are worth anything, because it takes time for them to be available for use again?
---
&gt; So, my exact premise, time is money.
---
When you calculate the value of something, the cooldown is in the numerator. What's the cooldown on water summoning again?
---
DW was given to shamans to increase their pve dps and reduce their PvP burst damage to help "normalize" them. It was arguably only better when you could have two different ranks of WF on each weapon to get around TBC's 3 second cool down on WF.  But that was nerfed straight away so even if we get TBC classic, it won't have DW dual WF .
---
They already fixed it, if you still have chat delays, it's not honorspy
---
As a rogue, I find warriors to be a super easy matchup. You guys don't have the gear yet to survive our full CC chain, and evasion + ghostly strike is definitely worth using because you absolutely will not hit me.
---
Few seasons**
---
Wow what a show off. I imagine this level of customization took hou- no wait... days!
---
Have the warlocks sick their void walkers(and taunt) on their banish targets when as warrior pulls.
---
I can though if i use the bottom of my fork while standing in altrec mountain where it auto pops if standing in the instance portal.
---
Theres always a way
---
&gt; 90% of the allies are spawning back in the cave
---
They are spanwing back in the cave because 50% of the people in the bg abandoned as soon as the zerg died because the 15 min timer is faster than dealing with a stalled turtle. Those people spawning in the cave are the unfortunate souls who queded into the bg
---
He drops Foror book and lots of plants.
---
I have never seen a single ally defend the stormpike GY (the one right before the bridge).
---
Our go-to tactic is cap that GY and hold. If we are enough/have the opportunity, take the main base. Else just cap SP and defend. The one time this didn't work? When 10 organized allies stormed us and uncapped the GY. Then we all teleported in the mid, got fucked and allies won.
---
You can't complain we got the advantage when allies are not trying to counter our tactics at all so far. We teleport back en mass and defend after we cap north. You can do the same.
---
[ItemRack Classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemrack-classic)
---
At this point if they so intent on making it that close to the edge of TBC they should just release the pre-TBC talents where people could go 41 points deep while still being 60
---
Should have copied and pasted it back to them
---
Ad hom
---
&gt;step outside your bubble.
---
&gt;I'm not here to throw ad homs back and forth.
---
Really?
---
&gt;But that raises just another red flag.
---
Uh huh, no insults here, just telling me I am a walking red flag. Everyone likes to hear that about themselves, definitely not an insult.
---
&gt;You clearly lack some introspection.
---
Yes, you do.
---
How sure are you of this? This seems like something that's true in other versions of AV than the one we're playing. I've seen turrets/bunkers capped plenty of time without this happening.
---
Alliance on the bridge? A guildie in voice chat? A friend who you queued with and know? Basically, it's just a dick move to troll some unlucky rando by killing him in the middle of a BG. You're supposed to be on the same side.
---
Terrible idea to roll enchanting on your non bank alt also. You only need character level 5 to disenchant every item in the game, why waste a profession slot on your main/gold farm alt?
---
I hope blizzard picks up on the call for party queues!
---
Imagine getting triggered over something so benign and trivial that you feel the need to make a bitchpost on reddit about it.
---
Not really, it's a linear point system, so the ranks are just every 5000 points.
---
Rank 3.98 (9900RP) to Rank 5.0 (15000RP) needs 7080 RP, which is just barely Top 10% of honor earned. So approx standing 500 or lower if there are 5000 earning that week on your faction.
---
As comparison, if you were 4.0 instead:
---
10000 to 15000 would need you 7000 RP exactly. So basically it's no difference. More or less the exact same standing and honor requirements. Basically 1.2% harder.
---
Once most alliance get exalted with AV horde queue times will increase significantly.
---
Honor is pointless if you are employed and have commitments outside of the pvp grind. There's always going to be hundreds of NEETs ahead of you every week. You'll never rank up past the blue items.
---
If you are a NEET, then you'll rank regardless just buy sheer volume of time invested.
---
No, alliance have every single advantage
---
Everyone. Each of those pots is an extra 3k HP for your raid. Everyone uses them.
---
Dead dps do 0 dps.
---
Then replace the who query with something like `z-"Scarlet Monastery" c-"Warrior" c-"Priest" c-"Shaman" 30-40` or whatever you want to.  
---
Maybe even looking for people in Molten Core is fine, who goes there without group anyway?
---
This is how it works.  Check for herald speak when a tower is destroyed, following a marshal / war master spawns shouting they are from the tower.  Also if none are destroyed the ones up correspond to a tower.
---
You decide for yourself. Set them up, see what feels good.
---
It's not funny.
---
Snowballs knock you back?
---
What does stonk mean?
---

---

---
An afk person in the spawn cave? (Towards and out the portal üòè)
---
Turn ins cap out pretty quickly, so preferably you don't want games that go much longer than 25-30 minutes.
---
This will become bannable before Tuesday
---
Paid someone for that Rhok
---
You're better off, mate.
---
It increases Alliance bridge defense quite a lot.
---
Maybe you happen to attack 60's stacking fire resist for MC haha
---
It helps to tell your priests to dispel the slow on the offtanks at the beginning.
---
How is not wanting to provide free water to randoms when I am spending my time and mana buffing them with Arcane Intellect being shitty?
---
I don't have infinite mana, and I only have space in my bags for about 6-10 stacks of water myself, so I can't give everyone water every game or I'd be sitting the the starting cave for way longer than I want to or is necessary.
---
And again, why is it a bad thing that people write words to explain themselves? Do you want to tell me why you think you should be insulting my willingness to explain myself thoroughly.
---
I guess it's because your reading comprehension isn't that great so you have to tell people in a clever way to "write less, I can't understand". I suppose it's a decent defense mechanism, but all it really proves is how short your attention span can be.
---
Now if I could afford a screen to see that, that would be great.
---
Yep easily my least favorite mechanic in classic. Makes everything from looting to fast reactionary healing feel clunky.
---
ok so its a way of respawning the ones that are already dead then?
---
How is that a reply to what I typed? You agree then that the class angle is meaningless then, I assume?
---
I don't ask anyone for water, but people ask me for it all the time in AV. Never had a problem summoning for them.
---
Awww... I can't gank those lonely 1-5 enemies heading to dungeon run with 40 of my friends in open world anymore... Oh the end of the world!... Now I have to actually fight without numbers on my side... Can I get some sympathy at least, pleeeeaase?
---
Making the the game more difficult and time consuming for your side isn't "screwing min-maxers" 
---
You can have a full game with defense and offense that only lasts 15-20m
---
Bwahahaha!  Well done.
---
What are you talking about? World PvP has been happening since way before p2 started, alliance have been complaining about a majority of areas being harder for them to level in due to more horde for ages. Where you hiding under a rock the whole time?
---
Battlegrounds are cross realm, so even on a minority of servers where your second point might apply, it doesn't since horde players are still better geared overall and get queued with everybody else.
---
That's it, I'm enforcing that *all* screenshots *must* be taken with your phone. All PrtScr-based images will be removed as a Low-Effort Screenshot (Rule #9).
---
I could not care less about the honor. As long as I can maintain rank 3 I'm fine. I want the rep
---
The herald is indeed what made me look for it. I was wondering why someone called Dun Baldar Northern Warmaster, or something of that kind, would yell: For the Horde!  
---
And in the games I checked the warmasters in Drektar's room would correspond with the bunkers that were destroyed.
---
You could make an alt character up to level 5 and learn enchanting. Then you can disenchant any bind on equip items on that character. You only need level 5 to disenchant max level items.
---
I'm enjoying it, but it feels like 50% of matches I get in we face Russian Ally premades that have Drek killed in 8 minutes
---
Just farm the eye on winterspring demons with like 4 ppl it took me 40 min of killing everything except the dogs. All priests I know in my server farmed is and it took no more than 4 hours for the unluckiest one..
---
Make sure you add a "picture of screen" filter
---
Clickbait
---
That is a fun, RP, way of putting it.
---
Or they just want to get rep for gear ASAP because they are busy people, don't really care about 'winning AV battle #194', and are going to go eat or tidy up for 15 min and re-queue.
---
I think the base resist is 5% for your level. Adding resistance is a % chance to fully resist or partial resist. There is some great documentation on resist on google if you need more info.
---
I get more rep/h in a won 40 minute game than a lost 7 minute game. Because a 40 minute game meand 52 minutes of time invested whereas a 7 minute game is 19 minutes of tome invested.
---
I‚Äôve seen them try this with ice cold milk, too.
---
Can't wait for tomorrow.
---
I luled so it's funny. Prove me I'm wrong
---
Seeing this makes me sad because of the dumpster fire that GoT became :(
---
gr8 meme tho 8/8
---
1) When you lose in 7m there are 0 tower caps.
---
2) You often don't even kill the lieutenants because you can't push fast enough past all the bs.
---
3) A win is 350 + 125 + the towers + the lieutenants + turn ins. You never turn in when you lose because the NPC for the turn ins is occupied by allies. Turn ins happen when the allies are wiped and you control the base and can actually do turn ins.
---
My math is entirely correct *in fucking practice*. I am exalted, i did this 100 times. I can provide a screenshot if you want. This isn't up to debate.
---
All the people complaining about the av grind when I need wsg rep to get the shit I'm after :(
---
Every loss gives me about 35 rep. That's only another 115 losses to get from neutral to friendly!
---
Jk after doing the math I gave up already
---
Raiding on a 2014 Macbook Pro, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be fine
---
The only differences between servers is PvP vs all the other servers. PvP servers allow for open world PvP in all shared zones. The rest of the servers all function the same the only differences are the players who join then and the experiences you will have.

Way to be wrong and not comment back! Lol
---
Google ‚Äúafk bot av classic wow‚Äù.
---
No!!! That's impossible!!!!
---
Huh
---
That log is a 40 man.
---
Excited to see the cosplays and wedding cakes in 2 months at this rate! Great job mods!
---
Two posts up *you* said a win is 1k rep. In this last post you contradicted that with your own math. 
---
1k rep, per match, is impossible with a rush, with the math you provided just now. 1k rep, on a win, is only possible with tons of turn ins and all objectives.
---
You also claimed a loss is 300 rep. That is also incorrect. 
---
It feels like you aren‚Äôt even reading your own posts.
---
&gt;My math is entirely correct in fucking practice. I am exalted, i did this 100 times
---
There wasn‚Äôt a math test during that process though. So it adds nothing to this discussion. Not sure why you‚Äôd even pretend that matters...
---
Gotta pay the fap tax
---
&gt; Not one person in this thread has actually given a legitimate reason why a standard that has been established for over 3 months should change.
---
They have, you just aren't listening.
---
&gt;Water has never been free in Classic WoW except under very specific circumstances (you are in a 5 man, PvE raid, or Premade group with a Mage).
---
Water is usually free if you are in the same group/raid which you are in AV. You joined an AV and you are in it together. Giving them water enables them to do their job in the AV. It's far far far more important than (for instance) AI which you already said you give out FOR FREE!!!!
---
&gt;This isn't tortured logic, it's not very hard to understand, and what you are seeing here is a vocal and angry group.
---
The tortured part of this part of your argument is where you need to contort to make the distinction between your team members in this game mode vs another one.
---
&gt; can actually provide a legitimate reason why mages should give random people from random servers who solo Q into AV free water and food, I will not change that opinion.
---
You are super dug in and you won't change it regardless. A good motto for grouping in WoW is to just do your job and don't be shitty about it and this is where you are failing.
---
How many people do you need telling you this is the classic raid frames? :P Because it is
---
Go to interface &gt; raid profiles and play around with the settings
---
It is the classic raid frames, you just have to customize it a bit. Open the interface options, go to the Raid frames tab and turn off borders, turn on class colors, group vertically and enable pet frames.
---
They removed this feature in 2.3 in TBC. I was curious since it was new to me too. They also removed the ability to pull the warmasters individually and added the hp and damage buff they give to each other when they're alive as well.
---
Yeah, no wonder that horde likes it.
---
Idk, I like AV. I do whatever I can do prolong the game so we can win. Defense, loot turn ins, harassment of reinforcements along the path. It's all about the journey, not the destination
---
Ally have map advantage and always have. It‚Äôs the reason when both teams Zerg, alliance wins 90% of the time, since they can simply get there faster.
---
I feel the horde queues will get longer now. I'm exhausted now for alliance and I don't care anymore about rep, I will want all the honor. Once games take longer, the wait for horde will be longer. With more alliance getting exaulted now, they won't be as obligated to do AV, which will increase times more so.
---
Sure thing, cringelord.
---
I'm having fun. :)
---
As someone who joined a pvp realm to pvp, everyone with my opinion lost.
---
Honor open world wasn't "pvp" just like continuously bolting to the end of av isn't pvp.
---
I'm a little disappointed with how pvp has turned out, to put it lightly.
---
Turns out phase 1 was the good old times for pvp, and we didn't know it
---
You're right. Even had the "BOOM" for extra flair.
---
I'm alliance idiot, l2read
---
That's not a real strat. There's 0 npc support at Stormpike GY. If 10 alliance are outmuscling a raid full of horde on nothing more than the merits of the gear, the horde in that game would have lost no matter what they did.
---
Funny, then why are alliance winning 75% of my matches?
---
Dude....re-fucking-read what I wrote above.
---
*I am horde*, okey? I specifically mention how horde *doesn't rush*. That is the whole fucking point.
---
If the allies rush and push past and win in 7 minutes, it's about 350 rep in total. We agree so far, great.
---
If the horde turtle down for about 20-25 minutes (as is the current meta) and the horde win, *THAT* is about 1k baseline rep.
---
And I gave you the fucking math:
---
350 win + 125 + a bunch of towers + all the lieutenants is about 900-1k honor. Then you pile on a ton of turn ins which can happen *only during a victory if the allies are pushed out of the horde base* and combined you get, on average, more than 1k. Usually about 1.1 to 1.2k
---
Which part of that math is wrong? Seriously. You are driving me insane here.
---
Even if they‚Äôre not intentionally stacking fr, a lot of T1 has FR.
---
Who you callin bog brained?!
---
Alt modifier as well, so 8 binds
---
i loved my ehn in classic, it was by far my favorite class. the dual wield completely ruined it for me and i never went back. well, the dual wield and the change to windfury (old windfury was literally 3 swings happening in like 0.05 seconds, they changed it so it just made damage 3 times without the BADOOM triple swing - which also made it unable to sequence procs, there was also a long standing bug with a windfury proc guaranteed after stormstrike that was removed at the same time - worst update ever).
---
Fake as F
---
This is why I come to this sub. Quality fucking content.
---
Why would you sac such good bindings for generic totems? Anyway, welcome to keybind Hell bro.
---
This used to happen to me on my druid, every time I logged in I was at 80% health, even if I healed myself to full then logged out and back in, I'd be at 80% again. They fixed it a while ago though, hasn't happened since.
---
Same here
---
So now instead of the occasional meme *every* post will be whining about horde on PvP? Ok goodbye!
---
How did each person get into their own private AV instance with no other players at all? Everytime I join AV there are 79 other players in the zone with me.
---
And that's a tiny tiny fraction of the thousands of alliance queueing for AV. This isn't a real issue, its just horde QQ.
---
For horde, shell fish quest in desolace is repeatable and pays out really well for the level.
---
Are you insane or something. Those are the values those give. 
---
Logic and math has proven you wrong. It‚Äôs normal to leave a losing match with 200 or so rep. Fast wins are in the 500ish range. Plus the token. 
---
If you add the rewards that‚Äôs what it totals. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre too stupid and defensive to accept reality. 
---
Might help to look at the wowhead page on AV and accept how wrong you are. If you got 1k on a win, from revered to exaulted, about 300+ of that rep was via turn ins other people did, during your match.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt understand that, but‚Äôs it‚Äôs fact.
---
Yes and that's a tiny fraction of the overall players in AV. I swear you fucking zoomers will find any reason to cry.
---
Season 6 (which is what the OP is from) was very solid
---
Im alliance at the moment but I will keep this in mind. I didn‚Äôt realize the quest was repeatable!
---
It‚Äôs not. The guild was oringinally &lt;BOOMERWAFFEN&gt; and it was dissolved by GMs within a couple weeks because of how badly against TOS the guild chat was.
---
Do they want you to bear or cat the most? Or 50\50
---
Natural shapeshifter and furor are core talents for cat Powershifting, a long with the wolfshead helm:)
---
Shedo is the cat guy on youtube if you're looking for more info
---
Skarmtank is the Bear guy on youtube:) (he also has warrior videos)
---
What ever direction you specialize your talents, you'll still be able to do the other job just fine:)
---
Do you actually think he‚Äôs being serious
---
I dont mind it too much from a pure rep grind perspective.
---
earth elementals that drop solid stone. A stack goes for 3-4g on my server
---
It's 10 not 20
---
IDK but I‚Äôm Horde on Windrunner and just started AV a few days ago.  Feels like we are only winning about 1/3 of the time and also not getting much honor.  Small sample of course.
---
Laughs in orc
---
You can get 20-30gold/hour just farming mobs as pretty much any class. Bots don't need to sleep so they are able to farm 24/7. It would only take a couple hours to earn the 150g or so they would need for their sub. It would take 3ish days of bot farming to earn 2000g
---
You assign a pull for each tank and let the warlocks banish. 
---
Place a tank and a hunter at intervals across the room and coordinate pulls for each of the tanks
---
The alliance base backdoor is a lot rougher than the horde one.
---
Hell with the horde base you can literally just walk to the GY uncontested, the backdoor is more useful to the horde even
---
Alliance have it real easy
---
I can't believe the hardest part of Benediction is affording Eye of Shadow off AH, quite disappointing when compared to the hunter quest.
---
&gt;typiing up a giant textwall with no tl;dr
---
Great way to get your post ignored.
---
No, we're not going to artificially drag out battlegrounds just to please a vocal minority that wants to sit in a 5-hour stalemate endlessly killing the other players and not advancing. No, we're not going to change AV just to please a vocal minority that wants it to be 110% PVP even though the battleground was literally designed to be "the pve battleground".
---
You asked for vanilla, we got vanilla. Stop whining.
---
When you are too busy to play the game - don't play the game.
---
&gt; **Why AV needs to change** 
---
It doesn't. It is fine as it is.

---
Check this for last 2 weeks, not perfect but gives a somewhat good picture.
---
Oh wow, I‚Äôm on Anathema.
---
Except the one that rolled after he said it.
---
I dont mind the ques, everyone has them, so the honor gained pr. hour is mostly the same for every Horde. Instead of non stop grinding, I can watch youtube videos, twitch, IRL stuff or farm gold meanwhile. Its much more relaxing. But hey, im glad you are enjoying the game as Ally.
---
Yea, plus you find big iron fishing poles every so often while looting shellfish cages, those usually sell for a gold or two, more in the neutral ah since alliance needs them more than horde does.
---
Pyrewood is eng realm though.
---
72 hours, on top of 200+ hours to hit level 60 in the first place.
---
That's because omitting furor for no reason isn't good. If you want kitty dps then you powershift
---
Yeah how can you say that isn‚Äôt satire
---
Sry, climate change
---
Yeah same... Weird I thought something looked different on my lockboxes so this is it
---
I think he was complaining about the Hunter having his melee abilities bound, while zero of his ranged abilities are bound.
---
I hit exalted in the first two days because I took off work, so I really loved the fast meta.
---
But started queuing up to help out some friends and guildies get their rep, and the difference in the horde strategy was huge. They actually adapted and started winning. But what's funny is most of alliance players were complete dogshit and still trying to bumrush drek without stopping for any reason, and getting absolutely slaughtered because of it. 
---
You'd have 4 or 5 horde players able to slaughter 20 moronic alliance players because the alliance players would get dismounted and picked off one by one and not fight back, while the rest of the team just ignored them and kept running, leaving only like 10 people to rush drek and then getting slaughtered. It was idiotic. There's absolutely no reason that 4 horde should be able to kill half a raid effortlessly 
---
So what I started doing is just straight up lying in the /bg chat. I made a macro saying that it was a premade from my server, and laid out the strategy - everyone stay together at all costs, if horde try to pick people off dismount and kill them. We started killing galv and AoE'd LTs , then moved as a group to the South leaving five people behind to hold FW GY to prevent endless horde reinforcements. We would cap the GY near drek and clear out the towers, then kill drek 
---
The games went from 40 minute losses with less than 1k honor, to decently fast wins with buckets of honor. 
---
I'm actually having way, way more fun with the slower games. Obviously ive already hit exalted and don't care about rep, but now I get to absolutely wreck other players and have a blast. That unstoppable force is HUGE for a paladin, if I get lucky I kill people when I first open up on then.
---
I'm having a blast now and winning consistently, all it took was taking control of the BG and make them stop acting like idiots.
---
Disgusting damage. Well done.
---
Basilisks in desolate have some solid drop tables and almost always drop vendor trash. Not the best but secluded and decent money.
---
The trick is to have a casual conversation with them until they say something that looks good in a report.
---
I was asking that same question 2 months ago.  I dropped herbalism and alchemy for mining/engineering JUST for the DM north solo.  Please heed my warning: spend a couple hours practicing the run, getting to the inner gordok door (which is the easy part).  You might not have the stomach for it, you're going to die a lot.  If you have a lot of time to play and don't mind spending hours and hours dying over and over again perfecting the little quirks of the run, it's probably worth it to level engineering, if that's the way you like to play.
---
As I said, I started on the path 2 months ago and still have yet to even attempt soloing the last boss.  I've got the run down enough where I can get to the gordok inner door, and I'm getting better with what  to do when things go slightly awry.  But, you're going to be putting in some major time before it starts paying off.  It is difficult, and it requires your full attention 100% of the time.
---
I'd regret dropping alchemy if engineering wasn't such a cool profession that pairs pretty well with hunters.  I've held on to mining for DME jump run solos, but I havent put in the work to get that one down either.
---
TLDR: Try out the solo runs without engineering to see if you like it.  If you're like me, after I die 3 or 4 times I move on to something else.
---
P.S. I am fairly sure that the reason Blizzard hasn't nerfed the DMT hunter solo is how difficult it is, and how much work it takes to perfect.  Lots of people try it, not a lot actually do it.
---
P.P.S. I'm not the worlds greatest hunter.  I know my way around game mechanics but I probably fit in the "marginally above average" player skill level.
---
The basilisks are decent. I farmed them for a little bit but ended up just wanting to run dungeons instead
---
In fights under 1 min 30ish seconds, it doesn't matter. Go look at the logs, spriests are crushing mc right now, with the top ones pulling 5-600 dps.
---
only as long as undead can have a passive permanent fear, sleep, and charm immunity, then you can have pally spells work on undead
---
i would be ok with it, it would make pvp more interesting and give it more dynamic of gameplay
---
race should always matter, just as much as class does. balance be damned, the beauty of classic is the dynamic of gameplay.
---
Thank you :-)
---
That time I wanted to grab the Kargath flight path and decided to go through Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge to get there.
---
More fun or more upset horde? Bridge anyone?
---
Fucking redditors always concerned with the most inane meaningless shit.
---
This thread brings up arguments as to why its not fine the way it is. 
---
Where is your argument? Where, in my line of argumentation, am I wrong?
---
I'd like to hear what's so great about the current version and implementation of av.
---
Ofc it worth it. Alliance on realms like shazzran is on death sentence. Reroll to a more balanced realm if you plan to play classic one year from now as well..
---
One note. Lot less ppl are leveling on pvp realms currently. If you want to have low level groups, then roll pve. Plenty or people level there currently, and probably this trend will continue as you can‚Äôt get ganked by 20 undead rogues every day.
---
Yeah, I mean I agree. It‚Äôs terrible design for an MMO. I was excited to do premades as a guild in WSG. Now all I do is solo queue and open my guild pane to see all the rankers in my guild in other AVs. As I write this I‚Äôm in bed on my Remote Desktop click to moving to prevent the AFK.
---
Good joke.
---
Never know i might end up doing the same thing!
---
The #Nochanges people kind of fucked us again. AV is terribad rn. I was trying super hard to win the first few days til I discovered the horde were playing to lose and move on, and that I would get the exact same rep whether I played or not. 
---
So now I do the afk strat to get the same rep while playing Frostpunk. I feel like an ass, but the game mode blows and I just need to hit exalted.
---
Dark pact... that is the real reason
---
It's pve realm.
---
I did this a dozen times yesterday hahaha, dying at the bal choke to give the team an extra 10-15 seconds is glorious :D
---
This is strangely common for me on Skeram. I'll be fishing and some Alliance will roll up, we'll exchange a /wave and go about our fishing.
---
Yes, even better would be to have a full gear set that gives you the maximum amount of spirit (but this is slightly overkill unless you have a lot of mana).
---
It sorta makes sense tho.. Alliance has a huge chance to win if they make a determined rush directly to drek. If they get enough people, it gets hard for horde to wipe em, which is pretty much hordes win condition. 
---
So if you get wiped as alliance, it would be pretty tempting to lose quick so you can get out quick, since coming back from being wiped is gonna take alot longer, and usually you're stille going to lose. That coupled with the fact that they have instant queue, makes it a pretty good gameplan if you are going for fast rep.
---
Obviously i know rep and honor isn't everything, but still.
---
You might find 7min speed dungeon runs fun, many of us do not
---
Unsurprised. Just join a better guild.
---
TB is nice, too bad it‚Äôs a backwater, not a hub. It‚Äôs unnecessarily expanded, which is why I prefer UC
---
How so? I‚Äôm just confused how that tactic would ever break a horde advance.
---
I‚Äôm grinding exaulted really hard. 9k left atm. In all of those matches the Horde has *never* intentionally stopped near Bal to interrupt the Ally Zerg.
---
So the concept of a frost trap somehow breaking the Horde‚Äôs advance legitimately makes no sense so me.
---
Despite the changing meta, when the meta has been ‚Äústop at bal‚Äù it‚Äôs never been ‚Äústop at bal *and* also PvP a bunch‚Äù. 
---
So I legitimately have no idea how the above could have occurred and am asking for, essentially, clarification or more detail. I also expressed absurdity in the process because, again, based on my experience, that is an absurd claim. To the point that it sounds more like a made up fantasy, than an actual thing that happened.
---
Arguably best raid DPS spec for shamans, but only because of much better sustain than Ele. And lots of gear shared with other classes which might make it harder to find a group.
---
Is there a hunter brave enough to do a series on wiping dungeons with those every mob in the dungeon pet pull?
---
Lol, ikr? These aren't the 12hr AVs of old. Worst case scenario it lasts an hour
---
You're forgetting the blood, flesh, and armor scrap turn-ins which easily total more than 500 rep. I'm not sure on the exact numbers, but from experience I'd guess the limit is about 100 of each type. That would put the max possible from turn-ins at 1000 rep.
---
[Edit] I looked up the numbers, and the maximum rep from turn-ins is actually 665.
---
Sounds like a scummy guild taking advantage of the stupid or apathetic.
---
This. I always see people say warriors deal ‚Äúomg such damage‚Äù, yet my warrior‚Äôs auto attacks hit for ~300 dmg every 3-4 secs, and my MS hits for ~500-600 dmg. Wow! Such damage! Meanwhile my mage throws out 900 damage frost bolts and 700 dmg instant casts.
---
We mostly have at least 1 yelly dude on the horde side telling people to teleport back/stay on attack depending on circumnstances.
---
Horde strat needs a bit more coordination to be pulled of. It's mostly a balancing act. Enough people on def to wipe the allies, enough people on attack to cap the graveyard(s). That is taken into account with someone doing the needful.
---
The only times I hear alliance saying ‚Äúyou lose‚Äù is if they got a single flag cap in Warsong Gulch while we have two, or when we are smashing in AV.
---
Honor doesn't matter unless you're already a ranker on your server. You will never, ever hit rank 14 if you're not already devoting your life to it. 
---
But you can easily get all your PvP blues if you run BGs semi frequently, even without optimizing your honor. 
---
So why would the average person give a shit about optimizing their honor instead of reputation right now? The rewards from exalted are HUGE. The rewards from ranks 12+ are even bigger yes, but they're completely unobtainable for the vast majority of the playerbase. AV gives so much honor that just running it a few times a day will let you leapfrog past the majority of the playerbase, especially as time goes on and more people hit exalted and stop running it. Hitting rank 11 isn't difficult at all for the average person and it's totally possible without optimizing their honor gain. Theres no way the average person can compete with the rankers, so why should they even try?
---
No I‚Äôm not. The person I replied to said this was a rush, and you don‚Äôt have enough time, during a pure rush, to turn that much in.
---
You are 100% correct in the sense that you can easily get more than 1k for a match that drags out. I know I have and honestly am starting to prefer 35 min wins to 7 min losses for exactly that reason.
---
Edit: actually he said a 20 min win. I personally haven‚Äôt seen 1k from those as that isn‚Äôt quite enough time for 300+ rep of turn ins.
---
Why would mages be able to trade conjured food and water if they weren‚Äôt meant to trade food and water?
---
I don‚Äôt believe you either, seems like you are making huge assumptions here.
---
Can't wait :) not that I afk....
---
Someone is getting a lump of coal in their stocking this year...

Go to IF
---
Why do you call it turtle? Turtling means putting a heavy emphasis on defense. Having 10 people defend is not turtling. It‚Äôs how the game is supposed to be played. I can count on one hand how many times have actually seen the horde turtle. It may sound anecdotal but I‚Äôm already exalted, as horde, so I've played a lot of AV games and I think my opinion carries a little weight. And I've seen the meta evolve since the patch. Turtling rarely happens. 
---
When I hear people say turtle, I feel like they're pushing a false narrative. Presumably, by the people who want to zerg/rush through AV.
---
This is great. Well done!
---
Holy Paladins are made for if you just can‚Äôt be asked to wait more than a second for a spell.
---
My queue as horde is 7-10 min. I‚Äôm ok with that.
---
Don't get me wrong shaman are amazingly fun, and have insane burst as elemental.
---
But even with that, yeah population difference is pretty huge.
---
That's pretty good! I wasn't trying to be insulting so sorry if it seemed that way.
---
My fucked up mind read the whole post with a Russian accent.
---
Ah okay you were being earnest I apologize! I took your cool story comment differently. I am exalted and have seen 5 or 6 horde attempt to slow alliance near Belinda many times. Often times that one move results in the win of the Belinda Galv race, which often breaks the alliance mentally (very easy to do sadly) and leads to a H win.
---
Isn‚Äôt windfury an air totem?
---
nope.
---
in our premade i play in def, and i see all the time how allys run throught our base (horde) and very often they're pulling 0 npcs, sometimes pulls 1 small patrol pack
---
ally's base have a lot NPCs (with a lot of HP) infront of main castle (with final boss &amp; co)
---
horde base have 0 NPCs infront of main castle
---
Nice!
---
Lies.  No one bought druids.  They get geared day 1, and still are Brez  and innervate bots.  It would be like buying a high school diploma.  Everyone has one, and it wasn't that difficult to get.
---
&gt;thinking kiddo is a insult
---
What are you doing playing wow if you get offended to something like this?
---
So actual causality in a video game instead of just following a loot treadmill?  Say it aint so.
---
Based in what I've seen from osrs. They dont "share it" they sell it to other people wanting to bot
---
The entire point of Evocation is to restore mana *while in combat*. If you're just using it because you don't like to drink, it's pointless.
---
Since weapons are all you can switch in-combat, it doesn't make sense to have a full set of Spirit gear.
---
Sulfuras!
---
I dont get it can you explain?
---
Can't swap armor in combat
---
In before no changes reeing
---
If only enhance shamans were this useful.
---
So many warlocks say this, and they never perform in the matchup. "12k EHP!" That's nice, but locks boil down to a target dummy with anemic DPS when they cannot cc and cannot cast.
---
And just FYI, if you're wasting time on howl of terror vs a fury warrior things are going to end very quickly for you. This isn't really a matchup where you can make them burn one fear immune and then fear them, fury warriors can cycle through immunities for 50 consecutive seconds.
---
They can go for 20 gold each in the alliance ah.
---
Kodo is literally the ugliest mount in the game....
---
Then I got one. I spit in your general direction if you don't ride a kodo!
---
His name is not even in there ......
---
Ally players realised if they can convince horde to Zerg that ally will win.
---
This has resulted in them non stop trying to convince horde to Zerg so we get less honor and rep.
---
I prefer to play D for 20min and get 5times as much rep than to play a lose game for 8 min.
---
One of the translations for Flame is "–ü–ª–∞–º—è", looks like theese words are close ethymologycally
---
You would have liked 1.5 AV a lot better.
---
is it actually missing? Have you tried going into combat and see if you die when you lose the hp?
---
If yes, it's a blizzard problem, cant do anything about that.
---
If no, then its a client problem and you can try deleting your cache.
---
If a mage opens me up, I just give up now. No way I'm spending a FAP to just have a chance at it.
---
I did spend a FAP once, the mage just ran away with 5% HP near NPCs. Couldn't get him anymore. Do not recommend
---
Met my wife in WoW so... different state, different spouse, probably no college degree so different career...

Thanks WoW
---
As a enhance shaman currently grinding AV you nailed it.
---
The quest itself isn't that easy for bad hunters though.  Maybe that's what they mean.
---
He's got a good dent though
---
Firemaw?
---
The Ally mage that's kitting them
---
Should be occlusion culling or camera culling.

It‚Äôs useful when culling the renderers you are not supposed to see in the camera like a chair inside a house or a character behind the wall. So there would be less pressure in CPU to do the drawcalls toward GPU, with less drawcalls you get more framerates. And this stairs seems to have a error collider will cull your character by mistake.

I didn't play classic when it originally came out so I must ask: Why are eggs so valuable all of a sudden? I mean, it's called Winter Veil, not Easter Veil.
---
Used to make the cookies for one of the quests.
---
Depends on your serveur and if you have addons like TSM you can get an estimation of the value of an item in shards so you can compare if it's worth vedoring or sharding.
---
Idk man /r/2007scape has incredible meme game and still is a good community board.
---
4/4 on Horde. Every game we've had more people on defense than alliance did.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stonks
---
It‚Äôs our revenge for the start of phase 2 horde scum. WE SHALL CONTINUE OUR DREK BUM RUSHES!!! ONLY UNTIL WE ARE ALL EXALTED WILL WE STOP. MUHAHAHAH
---
Nobody invited enh shamans to raid, resto only
---
You guys are trying too hard, just let the sub correct itself, and moderate posts that go against Reddit rules.
---
This really isn't hard, and should never require paragraphs of explanation.
---
You haven't gamed anywhere close to 5 days straight.
---
Inb4 you stun lock and run away to recharge cds
---
That's true
---
The price is fluctuating wildly because you can only do this once. Small Egg npcs are overcamped by level 60s right now which I think is completely insane.
---
/r/azerothporn (I shouldn't have to say whether or not it's safe for work)
---
It‚Äôs all about survival tho
---
Yes, and generally you will not use evo when you are taking damage. In this case, you are more likely to go out of combat and you can have the option to change your gear.
---
Funny, but a dick move. They get 10% durability cost.
---
No, they cannot.
---
I just respecced to Enh from Ele/Resto and I'm really really sad about it
---
You should add an option that says:
---
"...hate Blizzard." or
---
"...hate minmaxers."
---
That's how a lot of posts here tend to go so
---
Legend.
---
Haha. Fortunately the AV snowballs that knock you super far are only usable in AV.
---
I liked the daily questions thread, but my reasoning was that the rest is the sub was just bullshit memes and people complaining constantly. 
---
Maybe the rest of the new rule changes will make the daily questions thread unnecessary.
---
&gt; I literally just wouldn‚Äôt heal you in a BG.
---
As I have said to countless others, I am self-sufficient when I BG. I do not need, nor do I expect heals or buffs from other players. I carry consumables that heal me and I use them when I need healing.
---
On the other hand, healers seem to think the NEED my mage water to perform their role. You are mistakenly thinking your heals or buffs are important to me (they are not). Sure, they may help, but I don't need them to PvP.
---
The standard has been, for 3 months now, that mage water costs 1g for 6 stacks from a friendly mage service if you are not in that mages 5 man group, PvE raid, or Premade PvP group (then it is free because you share a common goal). If healers want mage water, they should get it before Q'ing for Alterac Valley. They are likely in a guild, and can get free water from their guild mages. The only reason not to do this is pure laziness.
---
How is this hard to understand? People are using Alterac Valley as an excuse to circumvent a long established standard. I am not ridiculous for expecting the standard to stay the same.
---
Drinking takes time and evo is more of an ability that gives you near instant mana with the added bonus of regaining that mana during combat.
---
And remember, even if you get flagged for afk and get the debuff, any combat will remove it. Not just pvp. Just go for the closest poor ram.
---
Alliance not getting past 2k honor in a 2.5 hrs game.
---
The trend has been games are taking longer and longer, and the alliance are not winning as frequently. Also the quickest wins in av tend to have less bonus honor than the 1350 you get from wsg. But honestly since the "meta" changes every 4 hours ymmv
---
3 totems is like 25% of the mana bar man
---
Nah it def couldn‚Äôt be raid queues. Party queues would be very enjoyable though
---
This is why I didn't bother pursuing honor ranks back in the day.
---
It's a very popular spot and coincidently it always slows horde down, because they all wanna see what the fuss is about! IQ 2000!!!
---
I offtank on Garr, and I usually just stand just behind MT then intercept+Taunt whoever my target is just after he pulls.
---
More like nothing happens? Mages on the other hand
---
Or maybe because horde are busted lol
---
True, Molten Core is probably better for searching.
---
Before BGs? The 3 or so servers alliance ended up dominating due to xfers.
---
To be fair, I‚Äôve done this for the lulz, and a premade that was in there all mass reported me and I got the insta-boot. Goes around something something comes around something something.
---
Noticed this on my 29 mage as well, but more like 1/4
---
I had more experience in the first day than you have overall. Sounds like you're making stuff up to save your ego?
---
I see it every time.
---
Blame the guy that always takes stonehearth graveyard.
---
Guys stop, that‚Äôs this man‚Äôs name now.
---
People who evocate out of combat. ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Meanwhile mages blink in and frost nova 5-6 people and then ice block.
---
Fuckers.
---
Not sure what games you guys are playing but I havn't lost a match since like friday.  Alliance has been steam rolling in my matches.  I'm exalted already.  Had one match turtle to 61 minutes though.  We summoned tree boi and druids and shoved it down the Hordes throat when they left like 30 people on D from start.  If I had to guess my win rate from tuesday to now is like 75-80%
---
Lol thanks!
---
If you only used Evo when in combat you would rarely if ever use it... Cooldowns are meant to be used, not saved as bailout buttons. I try to use Evo in dungeons when I just AoE cleared but the healer is still good on mana so I can save a drink break for the group. In the open world I use it on CD to avoid a drink break
---
Ahh ok
---
What the only good thing was Ramsey and botb
---
meme can only be posted on sunday lol
---
Anti afk. Cheat using addon
---
Goebbels coined the term for propaganda purposes and the allies simply adopted the term. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
---
What's the best way to get ench to 265 so I can make the trinket and drop for another gather prof? Just DE everything or buy cheap greens off the AH?
---
I love AV in its current state. I can acquire the pvp gear to use in pve, by playing pve. It's great. All I need to do is to be on the premade discord and rush zerg Galv, Lieutenants then Drek. Quick and easy braindead wins. Once I have my rank 10 I can stop doing it. But until then it's 30-50 hours a week of zerging I guess.
---
Dayum
---
Imagine grown men snowballing each other in 2019...
---
Yea, idk what games these dudes are playing but alliance has SOME sort of advantage.
---
Ohh thank you, this sounds great for twisting
---
Idk why it‚Äôs the orc noises of all things making me lose it
---
Would it hurt not having mining? I'm going to pick up Herb but I need to level it up first so that'll take a little while.
---
I'd like to keep enchanting so I can make the tank trinket and DE directly on my main, but I'll drop it for mining if it'll make me significantly more gold.
---
No they are not. They are 8-15min today and they will rise more
---
No.
---
NoChAnGeS
---
Not here they aren‚Äôt and I wish we had the 3 min losses tbh.
---
Can you guys send your better players over to kroncrush so we can finally lose some?
---
If you have the money to invest I highly recommend a gaming mouse. I like the Naga razer trinity. You can use your thumb to cast a lot of spells while also controlling the mouse and your left hand for other keybinds on the keyboard. It takes a little practice but I can‚Äôt imagine going back.
---
Agreed.
---
If you fall for this you deserve it
---
Bruh I didn‚Äôt know the knock down cancels casting as well XD.
---
You just aren't seeing the point I am making, which is fine.
---
Your point is, "You can do this thing, why wouldn't you do that thing if you can?"
---
My replies are showing you how ridiculous that concept is when applied to other situations. It's not really my fault that you can't see that.
---
Let me try it this way.
---
If you have a job that makes you money, you can go give that money to every homeless person that you see, so you should do that, right?
---
And imagine someone like yourself feeling the need to interject with your worthless opinion lol.
---
THE IRONY
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
I realize my earlier answer might not have been the most helpful, even if true, so here's the expanded version:
---
First the basics: You want to think of your keys in terms of real-estate; the ones the easiest to press are better keys to bind than ones which are not. Also, if you have to look down at your bars to see what keys to press, you almost might as well be clicking, so you have to be able to build muscle memory. This will make you suck worse than you did clicking for a time.
---
So, the usual prime real estate on your key-board is 1-2-3-4, tab-q-e-r, (caps lock)-f. Most people will almost never missclick if they try to use one of these. Shift and ctrl is usually reliable as well, and makes shift or ctrl + a prime real estate key good choices as well.
---
If you haven't already, you should go into your keybindings and key-bind a and d to strafe right and strafe left respectively. You should get used to turning by holding right click on your mouse, or holding both buttons if you're moving forwards and don't want to hold W. If you end up in a weird situation where you need keyboard turning for whatever reason in an emergency, you can still use the arrowkeys to keyboard turn. Also rebind the Reply-to-whisper key to something on the right end of your keyboard. Rebind the open-all-bags from shift-b to B.
---
Subprime real estate is f1 through f5, tilde-5, t, g, z-x-c-v, the key with symbols left of z, alt-spacebar.
---
Subprime real estate is suited to things that you rarely use, but nevertheless want to have access to. It should also be things that won't fuck you over if you missclick, because these keys are subprime because they are awkward and easy to missclick. A lot of them involves your thumb, or taking the three middle fingers entirely off of wasd.
---
So now that we know what keys we wanna use, we can figure out what to use them for.
---
This is where you'll have to use your own head. Personally, I like associating a keybind with stuff. So for me, I always keep interrupt on R. If I have two kinds of interrupt, I will put them on shift-R, and if I have a third, I will put it on ctrl-R. If I were rolling a shaman, I'd bind rank 1 earth shock to R and max rank earth shock to shift-R. But that's just me; someone else might choose to associate shocks and go "this is part of my rotation so it goes on 2" or something.
---
Any "oh-shit" buttons you have should be bound to prime real estate. If you need an oh shit ability, you can't run the risk of missclick, and must be fast to click. I personally like F, in the sense that you press F to pay respect. I'm a warrior, so I bind Death Wish (any stance fear break) to shift-F and shield wall/retaliation/recklessness to ctrl-F. The reason I don't use straight F is that I'm a bit prone to missclicking it; I bind whipper root tubers to F instead, and sometimes swap potions into that slot. If it's an out-of-combat missclick nothing will happen cause of full hp, and if it's incombat and I was trying to pop shield wall it's never a bad idea to pop a potion too. For you, I imagine this is cleanses that you need to access quickly, or maybe a big heal? IDK I don't play shaman.
---
So outside of oh-shit, you should bind all the spells you regularly use in combat to prime real estate, with the most important things going straight on the keys, and the less important things taking a shift or ctrl modifier. If you pvp, you should put potions, grenades and sapper charges on here too, and any trinkets you regularly use. Striking a balance here is key - you never want to have to move part of your rotation to sub-prime keys to get room for consumables, but it's important not to neglect consumable keybinds either.
---
For sub-prime real estate you want to bind anything you click regularly, but not multiple times per combat, out of combat abilities, and things that don't matter so much if you missclick. Food, water, really weird totems, Bandages if you're not big into pvp, shock armor, mount, ghost wolf, that sort of thing. You should also bind the most common dungeon marks to subprime keys. Skull, Cross, Moon and maybe Square. I personally like to keep T bound to attack.
---
One last trick to get you to rely on muscle memory for keybinds; hide your bars in combat, and set the alt-key to reveal the bars in combat. That way you'll be forced to remember what your keybinds are. This will make you worse for a time, but will then make you a lot better.
---
You may want to consider getting weak-auras to keep track of your cooldowns for you. It's better to have that near the middle of the screen instead of on your bars, since tunnelling the bars is a real issue for most people.
---
I also would like to join some premades. 60 mage, decent gear, epic mount, US server (Deviate Delight).
---
Hahaha dozens. Dozens he says. Thanks for the Sunday laugh.
---
enhancemen
---
Which is both less effective than permanent ones, further reducing the almost minuscule value of the proposed bans, AND not what many on this sub are calling for.
---
To be fair, the show had been slipping off the tracks since S4. The whole bAd PoOsI thing, and that derpy *Jamie and Bronn Rescue Rangers in Dorne* thing. Respect to the writers though for recognizing that they were out of their depth, and ending it with some bangarang episodes like the Battle of the Bastards and the Winds of Winter. 
---
Hope some day another team can pick up the mantle and finish the show off right, but at least they didn't try to tie everything up in 13 rushed episodes with no narrative consistency. Imagine the horror.
---
My man!
---
A convenient cop out.  Player strategy has a far greater impact than the slight PvP slant of horde racials.  Also, it is well accepted that paladins are the PvP gods of objective based BG's.  The amount of times my hunter resists stunning mechanics has little to do with how the battle is fought and won.
---
Reroll alliance.
---
Yeah , got my 40 mount or got my dungeon set with 1k+ upvotes and original videos , I remember the solo hogger one, getting like half of it.
---
This sub is just full of casual dads
---
Jump runs are the most enjoyable gold farm and one of the few good ones I know of for druids
---
Before you dump a ton of gold getting Smoking Heart I'd just like to warn you that it's less good than often sold.  While it is a situationally useful trinket the 3 bis trinkets for bears are Mark of the Chosen (bis mixed/ overall) mark of Tyranny (bis mitigation) and Drake Fang Talisman (Bis threat). 
---
I have the heart and occasionally equip it but wouldn't be heart broke if I didn't have it
---
This aged extremely well
---
Totally reasonable question...  
---
God help the shit heads who read your post and think "WUWZ U TREGURD GHET UVER EHT".  
---
God.  
---
Help them lol.
---
First, pick up herbs, it's an awesome money maker.
---
Second, either farm Winterfall in Winterspring or Legashi in Azshara; I normally do WS in the morning because it gets busy during peak hours, and Azshara at other times. You'll get a good amount of coin drops, grey/green items to vendor, and runecloth. WS will give you icecap, fire water, and ekkos, and Azshara will give you dreamfoil and felcloth.
---
I make more farming this way than any other method, unless I get lucky in dungeons and grab a lot of vendor trash.
---
I believe you stop getting skill from DEs eventually, but not 100 percent sure. There's guides if you Google something like 'Enchanting guide wow classic efficient'. The flipside of this is that it's probably gonna be reasonably expensive, but as a Feral tank? That's almost five hundred armor. An extra piece of plate, basically. You want it.
---
If I were you, I would go the 'unneeded blues and greens route': that allows you to pursue your preBiS while securing the mats you need to level enchanting. That might not be the fastest way to get gold at the moment, but it's the most efficient use of your time in the long term.
---
Dude for real. 
---
Having a good job in this climate? Fucking fantastic
---
Does anyone else notice that druid bear tanks are always complaining and rage quitting
---
Thanks for the tag u/Dalarrus \- I'm not aware of any current issues but these types of reports to pop up sporadically. Our usual troubleshooting includes: 
---
* Making sure your WOW account has game time. If you don't have game time, you'll be limited in where you are able to post. After adding game time, you may need to logout and login again.
---
* Login to your characters in-game. If it's been a little while, you may need to hop onto the character and run around for a bit to update the server information. 
---
* Reset your account password. This is sort of a last ditch suggestion to force all of your Blizzard account data to update.
---
Other than that, just check back later - hopefully it'll have cleared up. I'll keep an eye out for reports of this going on in a more widespread/long lasting way.
---
Well none of that answered my question and instead you resort to just making fun anyways.
---
1. I wouldn't be freeloading, I would fight in BGs. Not go AFK. You gotta start somewhere.
---
2. I didn't go resto because how can you farm things in the wild and kill shit if you are hitting things for 200 damage with your shitty lightning bolts? Plus it is boring.
---
&gt;"haha ur wrong ur wrong!!"
---
&gt;no evidence or argument other than "haha ur wrong"
---
Wooooosh!
---
Level 5 you can skill up to 75, level 15 you can skill up to 150, level 25 you can skill up 225, level 35 you can skill up to 300
---
Sooner or later, someone with skinning is going to see this as amazing
---
Absolutely amazing as always, Blizzard should hire you to make their art o O.
---
Btw, how on earth do you manage to push so many out in such a short time?
---
Poor doggo
---
The hottest DW was for elemental/resto actually. IIRC some spellpower daggers were only one handed instead of main hand. They nerfed it pretty quick.
---
If only pvp was actually this cool.
---
Dunno all sorts of people in av want their rep more than you want your honor, guessing they are gonna sabotage your quest. You had better get into Reddit and convince them you are gonna hit rank 10.
---
Don Julio's is the only av rep reward worth using as fury imo.
---
Why
---
Every. Time. I. Try. To. Portal.
---
Wait until you see 2-3 mages do frost novas on everyone then start spamming arcane explosion and use sappers
---
Its def Whitemane
---
Condescending doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you‚Äôre copying a youtuber and that doesn‚Äôt make you better than me.
---
Also another druid who doesn‚Äôt powershift can just make you sleep and walk away so I‚Äôm not really worried about your pvp situation.
---
Also a priest can just melt your mana and then you‚Äôre fucked because you tried to play a gimmicky strat you saw a youtuber do.
---
Most of you guys talking about this are acting like your pvp opponent is a combat dummy just sitting there letting you unload on them.
---
Not to mention that PVP players SHOULD be using different talent sets than PVE players.
---
All good, it's a special type of dog breed that looks like a wolf, noone got hurt, besides rule 7
---
What actually happened: clicker op capped SHGY one game and got chewed out and super butthurt over it. Now he goes into every AV with a vendetta and the only way to make himself feel better is by doing this every time.
---
Haha, I didn't even notice; I'll bet he still clicks them.
---
By playing BGs you will be able to earn/purshase some really great gear for your character from BG specific and honor rank vendors. Also the pvp class sets aren't half bad, even for PvE.
---
I'd say go for it.
---
Good luck!
---
Honest work rarely is.
---
Wow 2.0 will be amazing...
---
Also Kurinnaxx alliance here. There are a significant amount of racist/bigoted guilds it seems like. Not to mention the massive amounts of obvious and lazy trolling that goes on in world and looking for group chats. I've legitimately thought about abandoning ship multiple times because the majority of vocal folk on the server are pure cancer.
---
i was wondering how i saw people above that arch
---
Thank you mon! i will, but it has to be posted in the /wow comunity ;D
---
Thank you :3

---
Blizzard should use the last bit of 2019 to make a smart move, hire this person immediately.
---
Correct
---
I've had run-ins with both of them too. I can also confirm their assholery. Also also, if your username is close to your in-game name, we might be guildies, NSBrowny.

I don't have any pictures, but recently came across a pair of Edgemasters Handgaurds while 3 manning arena runs. Posted them on the AH with a starting  bid of 375g and a buyout of 700g....not even an hour later they got bought out.
---
I now have Epic riding and couldn't be any happier. Now if I could just get 6 more Abomination stitching I'd be golden.
---
horde learned day 1 (the good players that is) that you kill bal, kill lieutenants, and commanders, and then youll lose and get ~3.3k ish honor for a 8-9min game. But then people decided to go against it for a bit extra rep and grab 3.3k honor for a 20-25min game.
---
Uhhh #snowchanges
---
Venruki is a nice streamer! Good player and very vocal about what he does, you can learn a lot from him
---
God my graphics do look like crap.
---
You and a rogue, maybe two if your undergeared, go do DM Trib stealth runs. There are some YT vids out there.
---
As a person who is also grinding the hell out of AV and is exalted, it is legitimately very surprising to hear that you have not seen this, to the point where I'd say you should probably get your eyes checked.
---
 It happens in over 80% of the games I am in (I'd say at least one person tries it every game). I see this without always being in the front or back.
---
oh lol sorry, didn't notice which sub I was in - I've seen you in both!
---
If adds are being tanked/banished you shouldnt even touch the adds until Garr is dead. Everyone tunnel boss so he doesnt purge all your consumes/world buffs.
---
It is :) who dis is
---
You absolutely can, but it'll take some farming.
---
In AV I doubt people would notice/care about you being dps specced, being a 40 man raid and all. More people would probably notice the 60% mount, lol. :p
---
You might run into some people being very upset that you're not playing the way they want you to play, as you might notice from this thread, but pay them no mind.
---
&gt;Yeah, sure, you just forgot to mention the best threat gen by far. I mean, a warrior needs to fury/prot dualwield with Thunderfury(!) and another epic weapon to catch up to bear's threat.\\  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Bear tank easily is superior to warrior in current content AND in BWL (except for Nefarian).
---
Sure the threat is solid, but they still end up tanking a shit ton more damage than a warrior tank. the lack of viable def cap and or parry/block certainly makes them more challenging to heal on some encounters. There are some bosses in MC i dont tank for that exact reason
---
Hold the door

---
One class is one of the worst 1v1 classes in the game and it needs a dedicated healer and consumables to survive.
---
The other class has ice block, frost armor, ice barrier, blink, polymorph, and wide spread montages where it emerges victorious from 1v3s.
---
...you mean engineers making scopes?
---
and now what do you want to tell us? of course there are lot of scum in wow classic since its the number one game for all the nolifer virgins who abuse clown loot council with their friends. 
---
just leave and find another one.

Mother fucker... I have 300 small eggs in the bank and am on the road to st Jude for my daughters follow up and was going to post them tonight

This reminded me of the strangest WoW dream I've had. Somehow ended up in a level 80 starting zone but I was only level 1. Suffice to say, I died quite a few times before waking up.
---
LOL YOU HAVEN'T EVEN PVPED WITH A DRUID AT 60
---
You do you bro. Someone asks you to heal, you say no. Want to mash AV for those shit hot rewards? Do it. It's a 40 person BG, plenty of leeway for a few 60% mounts. Ignore the jerks like zwhy who want to make you as unhappy as they clearly are. It's a game, do what you find fun.
---
Where is the bitching about AV all day long selection? Seems like that one's been used a lot lately.
---
D A P yu VB
---
Yes, it is also a good reason to have a spirit weapon fot a druids innervate. :)
---
Still my most favorite episode
---
Deilas the rogue is my main
---
Herro deilas :) see u in raid tonight friend.
---
do you have ‚Äúof the eagle‚Äù gear on? at some point in vanilla there was a bug where when you ressed in BGs, you would be missing the mana and health from the eagle gear. It sucked - that was the best pre raid paladin pvp gear at the time.
---
Eh. More like the ‚Äòbetter‚Äô players (lets be honest the no-lifers are better on avg) are hitting/have hit exalted and whats left are the scrub watered down teams that cant win decisively.
---
Our guild sends all the warlock voidwalkers in
---
That's because horde are forced to play AV more intelligently because their base is so much harder to defend
---
Got to experience how great community while giving away tons of free cookies and milk this morning. Must have given away over 300 cookies, every time I would get low someone would donate more stacks to give away. Really goes a long way to show how great this community can be, even with all the negativity and toxicity we hear about.

If you are on Sulfuras, send a letter to Owlcoholic and I will send you some free cookies and milk later this evening after I finish this half level to 60!

---
Ill be a bit late, so youll have a good head start ;)
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs never happened in any of my matches lol. 7k from exaulted.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a horde advance stopped at Bal. Are you EU? I‚Äôm US. Maybe our metas are just 100% different.
---
Allies just rush by. We let them. There‚Äôs no interaction there.
---
This is ironic because I see more posts complaining about this shit than the actual thing at this point.
---
Damn Drek's got a good memory to remember his own birth!
---
Snowball griefing has been around since vanilla. People do it all the time on the bridge.
---
Oh shit plot twist
---
Hahahahaha....ofc the sentence drops. "WhY DoNT YoU Go tO ReTAIl!!!1111". Try one mythic+ key or heroic raid and you'll get defeated greatly. Classic is the easier game by far (said as someone who enjoys both game modes)
---
So how are people supposed to ask and answer questions then? A simple question will never get upvoted enough to be visible, and thus will often not receive a proper answer.
---
With bad queues and too much turtling it might tip the scale
---
It adds about 5-10 gold per run actually. The largest increase is typically on the greens which you won't be able to sell anyway.
---
Herd of elves running by cracked me up
---
I am a horde, and fully support any alliance for killing that guy trying to cap SH GY.

Back in the day, every AV would have around 3-8 people just botting doing nothing
---
Sadly that's what happens when you have a shitty honor system that doesn't have any caps and is competitive purely on time spent
---
Yea, that‚Äôs certainly worth it. Thanks for clarifying my blunder, my fault.
---
I‚Äôm just telling you what my experience has been with warriors so far. If there are warriors out there who are going to destroy me. I guess i just haven‚Äôt met them yet.
---
shut up babies
---
You got this, i believe in you
---
Oceanic Horde have amazed us by sending 28 back and having 10 people fail to cross the bridge... Its like this particular group was more interested in not losing than in winning.
---
We won eventually because we had 35 down south lol
---
I've never lost durability for fall damage death.
---
Those spots dont give honor
---
"newer player"
---
You're the one moving the goal posts. 
---
Discussion is about customer service and community support. Updates and bug fixes aren't even relevant. Then when someone posts an example of a blue literally saying they won't give customer support because it's Classic, you dismiss it. 
---
Go find some self awareness and get a clue
---
Haha this is gold. I used to tell people to type /afk because it stands for "auto force kritical" and causes you to crit 100%
---
Amazing , by far my favorite ! I did suggested more stuff on the last Westfall art but damn this one is totally blowing my mind of strong details and powerful colors. I can feel the dangerous suspense of that jungle filled with voodoo fools. No doubt ill be looking foward to have this beautiful art on my wall. You got so much talent ;)
---
Yah this left me questioning the meta as alliance, for I hadn't ever seen this untill around 3am on a Thursday.  Turns out we lost one.
---
In Vanilla in 2005, I made a UD lock. I was questing in Trisfall and found my way to the Bulwark and then ran into WPL at level 10. One of the level 50 (or so) spiders destroyed me.
---
I only just hit revered, fuck
---
So.. you win mostly and we rush mostly.
---
The bridge is a strong defensive point, but being hold up at the bridge gives Horde time to get flight masters, ice lord, and other buffs. I've won most turtles, and lost almost all rushes.
---
This is the exact same thing that happened back in the day. When grinding Battlemaster by far the best tactic for winning was either a turtle or back capping towers.
---
7/8 nightslayer with epic tiger mount as a gnome and don julios band already. I'm actually very happy, I'm more geared than 99% of the people I run into. Want to know how I did it?
---
Loot council and not being a piece of shit freeloader to my team.
---
 I just think it's ignorant this guy dismisses his main contributing function to his team so he dismisses raids, then since he knows he's useless to raids and that's not an option he opts to be useless to PVPers as well because he knows they can't choose whether they want him or not.  I was getting my preBiS and farming for my epic mount at his phase. He wants his laziness for raiding to bleed into the PVP scene for everyone to carry him.  
---
You don't have to acknowledge it, I will though. I bet this guy is the type to show up to raid with no consumables and 57% durability.
---
10/10 quality sound effects. Who was the rogue looking face at the end?
---
400 runs of sfk.  No blade or fang
---
I u see stand your pain, brother
---
it's not that serious
---
Juicyyyy
---
Too soon
---
Cant go wrong with bleach
---
I checked and it is happening to all the "of the eagle gear." You nailed it.
---
I agree.
---
druid shoulda gone travel and rooted you at range then laughed as they moonfire kited you to death.
---
Bear Bone Mace, drops regularly from bears in Felwood and up.
---
This is giving me Nathan Drake/Tomb Raider vibes! I love it.
---
Because innocent people get ‚Äúkicked‚Äù without knowing why they were removed from the BG. It isn‚Äôt funny.
---
I like how he put "asap" there, like he's fully aware of the fact he's physically unable to separate himself from his PC while a BG is running
---
\*Balinda
---
Can someone explain what happened?
---
It's also on an extremely updated engine, game looked nothing like this back in 2004.
---
I'm lvl 58 and I get to drek without to much issue.  I just stay with the zerg and break right at fields of strife if the horde flanks there to slow the rush.
---
The buffs were added in 2.4
---
Dual wield is an enhancement talent
---
Its almost like... The game is running on the current WoW engine!
---
Once I hit exalted i'll def want more honor and more turtling. But I also want the epic mount for 640g vs 800g. Tired of my fat kid mount :(
---
The rush works fine when there is minimal horde resistance and the people pulling the warmasters know what they are doing.
---
It breaks down if things don't go almost perfect.  Each person you lose in the midfield, won't be there for warmasters/drek.  Each person you lose to defending horde won't be there.  If you start to lose too many, then warmastrs/drek takes too long and the horde capped towers spawn more warmasters which takes longer.
---
Does it work?  Yes it can.
---
People are stuck on a meta which happened and horde adjusted.  Sometimes Horde don't defend enough and they get rolled.  But if they defend enough they make it a turtle and alliance don't ever adjust.
---
Dude WTF are you talking about? I want to play the class that I want to play and get told by everyone to play what I want and you think I am freeloading or some shit? 
---
It was just a simple question and you're giving an crappy answer. And to be fair I have heard that raid is not even that hard anymore due to players just simply being better and most guilds go too elitist on an easy ass raid so I figured people should be able to play whatever spec they want.
---
Damn dude.
---
Took me a little over 8 hours to farm mine with a 3 man team.
---
If you're at 60% I do recommend saving up for that milestone of 100% however its prob best for you to be the type to intercept at balinda to give galv team more time.
---
Appreciate the mage with a paper bag over their head.
---
Having more +healing allows you to be more precise
---
I've found the sweet spot lately is if you're on raid healing, you can easily sustain fh4 on the entire raid with zero issues
---
as Alliance i usually win 1 out of 5
---
Forgot "only have 45 seconds to play every night and I only quest after I've explored every pixel in the zone while I work 3 jobs"
---
It just delays the game pointlessly long to allocate resources caping and holding towers when you can just end the game after killing captains and lieutenants.
---
Tho we have begun ninjacapping towers just as we end games to grief the honor from horde.
---
This really gives me a dead Island vibe.
---
Faerlina üòÑ
---
LOL you are so redundant. 1. You tell me to go farm and get a mount. 2. You tell me to go resto while doing so. 
---
Those mobs are gonna die easy to my lesser healing waves, let me tell you.
---
And I don't get the freeloader comment, I'm literally just asking if the honor gear is worth it and if I don't have waste my time for hours to maybe get 1 BRD dungeon then why should I?
---
A two letter name and one of the most common pun-based names. I fully expect these two to exist on every single server in EU+NA.
---
Left: St. Louis Blues
---
Right: Toronto maple leafs
---
Sorry man, internet janitors do it for free.
---
Dude. Incredible
---
going left at balinda instead of right is the new way alliance can rush very easily.
---
Being aware of it makes it totally okay in my books.
---
Off topic but I like how hockey isn't the top sport by any stretch but its trophy is basically the biggest /most popular personality in the sport
---
Warriors do more DPS than a rogue. You‚Äôre basically useless because another class does better dps and has more utility as a back up tank. You‚Äôre a freeloader in your raids and you might as well reroll fury warrior.
---
It‚Äôs crazy how much time people spend on the game. Unfair to say they‚Äôre all NEETs (had to google that one), but if you actually have other hobbies, commitments, and responsibilities outside of WoW, there is absolutely no sense in trying to ‚Äúcompete.‚Äù I play WoW a LOT and I‚Äôm a few bars into honored with AV. A few people in my guild hit exalted TWO DAYS after it came out. Like, what the fuck. I can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt WANT to compete with that.
---
It‚Äôs amazing how much more fun the game is when you play at your own pace and don‚Äôt try to rush things or be ‚Äútop tier‚Äù
---
Looks like alot of casters 2pc blue set is pretty solid for pve aswell.
---
OP, try to do a thought experiment. Imagine that mercenary mode is removed from retail and Horde goes back to really long queues. Do you think Horde players would be stoic about it or whine a lot?
---
Druids, for their 4 piece bonus.
---
Until you show a clip of them gaining the stacks and then mounting up, these clips are just confirmation bias.
---
"HE CLEANED MY ASS"
---
Definitely not a ninja when done to the other faction
---
Good advice, honesty the easiest part about a tribute is actually killing King. Hardest part is just getting there.
---
How about 'I logged onto flamelash and there were -3 allies in ironforge'
---
They better remove the ability to do like 20-30man premades as well then
---
Always a guy named Quest
---
My guild has a warrior named MT.
---
He is not a tank.
---
Saw streamer, had to downvote. Sorry it‚Äôs the rules.
---
the map is heavily skewed in favor of alliance. that's why horde adjusted.
---
depends on premades at that point. Rush is still the best way to handle that many people.
---
Those are the pug players you just discribed. The people that will remain to play AV in coming weeks are the ones honor farming and 99% of those do it in organized groups. I still have +90% wr with organized groups even with horde stalling 60% of them.
---

---
Because we also give up neltharions tear and the hit ring and stuff to locks. We give them on a class basis because it feels good to get items that are super impactful for your class. It's not about being greedy, it's about giving up good items to those they are better for.
---
But you do gimp your damage. And your hp. And your mana.
---
AiS is perfectly usable. Just don't rush into the frontlines and expect to get a cast off. Yes, you don't use it all the time, not even half the time. But "almost never" in AV? Completely a player-issue.
---
It's a top-5 single target spell that wrecks healers (who have half their gear being cloth at least). AiS-MS even without a crit is over half the health of basically anyone who's not a warrior. You can't give up that kind of power play against an enemy healer because "it's a 3 second channel". Your auto-hits only go off every 3 seconds or so. May as well fill the rest with an aimed shot.
---
It does crit, but you won't *have* any crit, when you go for spell power gear.
---
PvP is a lot more than 1v1s outside Orgrimmar or that one 1v1 you had in AV that was awesome.
---
&gt; Engineering is inarguably the best profession in the game
---
ftfy.
---
There's an add-on that helps with counting down and works out when you should all press join to try and get you in the same game. Pretty sure if you sort your add-ons by popular you'll see the one.
---
I honestly hate it when they open trade then ask
---
Nope... Gay young boys.
---
I recently got 265 ench on my druid. For me the fastest way was buying ench mats off the AH. If they are under average value or at average then 1-200 isnt that expensive. It starts getting expensive at that point tho. So depending how much gold you want to drop into it you can spam trade with enchs you can do or do instances for greens etc. Usually buying greens off ah ends up being more expensive than just buying the mats. 
---
Also prepare to 1v1 a 56 fire destroyer in BRD or do brd with a grp in order to craft the trinket once your 265.
---
Not planned for classic
---
Imagine being ret and thinking youre getting that before every warrior has it
---
Extremely frustrating as horde to be unable to group queue. Anyone find a solution?
---
The movement speed one? Interesting.
---
For me it was very difficult. Took something in the area of 6-8 attenpts
---
You'd have to delete the old main then create the new character with the name you want.
---
Eh in most cases I prefer the two marks
---
Your passion is inspiring
---
Personally I went for the eye. Depends on how much you want the weapon.
---
Felstriker
---
The other night
---
Yeah but for some reason alliance keep going right like a bunch of bots
---
Wrong, change youre way of thinking
---
They are immune to nature damage, thorns and hurricane don't work.
---
 **One Dwarf,alone, betrayed by the country he loves, now their last hope in their hour of need.**
---
That‚Äôs sort of a broad way of looking at it.  By that definition anyone who‚Äôs ever killed anyone on a PVP server is ‚Äúshitty‚Äù.
---
Get your name mass reported although I'm sure they can tell if all of a sudden a bunch of reports come in at once. Theres also some method about creating a level 1 and deleting and restoring your main account or something like that but idk.
---
Yea this. I'm pretty sure the gorillas are the best to grind money wise in STV.
---
I hope your daughter is okay. But most of the profits were already had today I think :(
---
Lookup how much ghost mushrooms are going for on your server. If they're 90s+ go farm maraudon purple side for a day and make 300g. Its mindless but you net like 6-8 shrooms per run and you kill Tinkerer for his blue that you vendor. Real good gold.
---
Best use I found for dark pact was using it OOC instead of drinking, or in an emergency if all other mana restore options were used already. 
---
In combat I still relied on Life Tap
---
Any chance for Mulgore coming soon? You would do an amazing job capturing my home :)
---
There's no sources, but there was always a wave of whiners on the subreddit/other forums about "I GOT UNJUSTLY BANNED" every 2 months or so
---
Wait, has it started? I thought it was tomorrow.
---
They‚Äôre easier for sure but it still takes a level of skill to get them.
---
... b r u h
---
ur really something
---
I thought that was just for low effort/template (shitty) memes. I think this is pretty high effort.
---
Lol
---
Well their AP/Strength/Regen all became much more easier to work out too due to powercreep from items in TBC and talents granting bonus based on str/int along with tons of way to restore mana.
---
It sucked for pvp because you didn't really gain that much utility but for pve you gained a ton of sustainability and pve dps along with powerful buffs like blood frenzy or w/e it was called.
---
I have been playing wow av for a combined 3 years. I have no fucking idea what I am doing ever. I just follow the crowd.
---
Is this really the only way?   
---
Because I've seen that the streamer Sodapoppin change the nickname of his Druid. How did he do that?
---
She‚Äôs been doing well so hoping for a quick check in to verify and back to Wisconsin. Guess I‚Äôll be vendoring a load of eggs.
---
When 2.0 first came out and honor became a currency everyone started AFKing AV to passively farm honor so they could go buy r14 weapons and r13 gear since the honor system of old was gone. You'd easily see 20+ people in every game AFKing in the tunnel.
---
Since 2.0 came out around the holidays we would use these snowballs to knock AFKers back through the instance portal in the tunnel, kicking them out of the game and getting them deserter. 
---
Good times.
---
I have tried this before. But it doesn't work. So how did Sodapoppin do it? So confusing....
---
Ye i wonder about this to, my player portrait stays put now but my enemy portrait keeps going back to its original position.
---
You are naive if you don't think there is still theorycrafting being done.  The meta is always constantly shifting.   For example,  resto druids have been completely eliminated from top level speedrunning and boomkins are being brought along in their place,  because as of right now a druid's only function is applying faerie fire and they might as well be giving 3% spell crit to the casters while doing it.   Bringing a boomkin to a competitive raid would have been completely unthinkable a year ago.   There are also certain items and abilities that perform differently here compared to pservers.  Classic is quite different in mechanics from the mangos core that has been used private servers for years and there is still much to be discovered about optimal setups, and the amount of such differences will only increase in the future as more raids and items are introduced.
---
Tfw taming Broken Tooth is the hardest one here.
---
this is just plain dumb. so they are basing their releases on the old release schedule only when it fits them and change it when it all goes wrong. don rodrigo should come out now to help casters out who are grinding and melee get what they want. releasing things in the order they came out is idiotic as you are basing it off people who had to come up with things to answer problems that when you copy paste and already have all the info does not apply anymore.
---
This is peak orgrimmar shenanigans. There's always some fuckery going on with a random dancing orc in the background.
---
This is how I get water from mages at raids.  Maybe they think I'm a dick for just opening trade, but I'm just saving them and myself time by not sending them a tell.  It should be obvious why the trade window is up.  No need for small talk.
---
2g an hour is absolutely terrible my dude
---
If you want to be really hardcore you can put a bunch of melees in shaman groups for windfury and other stuff like that, but not much. You can change loot rules too.
---
It is a TEAM capture the flag style battleground. Enough said. 
---
I feel bad for anyone who ever has to work with you in real life if this is your attitude.
---
Says the guy who felt the need to interject and tell me my opinion is worthless?
---
tHe IrOnY hUrRrRrRrrrrrrr.
---
just ignore them?
---
u see ivan
---
Fantastic content
---
The in-game tips tell me that it's polite to whisper somebody before inviting them to a party or to trade.
---
Pull your tampon out mate. It's all fun and games. Every1 laughed at it afterwards.
---
I‚Äôve used Dominos since TBC.
---
if the alliance cap SF then capping SH is fine, otherwise leave it
---
Yeah I was in a guild that was really efficient but also pocketed everything. Decided to quit and try my luck elsewhere. Its just not worth it.
---
Update: I got 3 more robes, 1 more belt, then finally my legs. I think around 30 runs total :)
---
As givemeadrink learned, 90% in the AV don't give a toss about the honor. It's rep and winning is waaaay more rep.
---
Should be building out raids for BWL ZG and Naxx. Taking a ret probably isn't that bad but they are totally useless on rag because they can't even sit in the melee group. Holy pallys are hugely beneficial and are often in low supply.
---
2 possible things.
---
Logout the normal way. Dont alt f4 or close the window.
---
Go to your wow directory, right click, properties; uncheck read only.
---
Idk if itll fix it but its worth a try.
---
If a guild is using loot council in classic, please be highly suspicious of what that guilds goals are and who they are prioritising with the gear.
---
Very often it is just friends giving each other loot over everyone else.
---
Not saying it cant be done right, just it is terrible when done wrong.
---
Some games you should cap it tho
---
You're talking about the highest end optimized speed runs.  Which applies to almost no one.  Which isn't at all relevant to this sub anyway.
---
Please read the OP. You clearly didn't bother and went straight from the post title into your rant.
---
This is specifically in relation to Alterac Valley, which is decidedly NOT a CTF style Battleground. No one at level 60 is doing WSG.
---
If I was doing WSG, I would premade, and give my healers everything they want for free, obviously, because we are players who share a common goal and want the same things out of our WSG experience.
---
Only a handful of people in Alterac Valley may share the same reason for Q'ing into AV that I share, and I don't know who those people are. It's not helpful to me achieving my goals to give BobbyDruidxD water if he wants to go turtle in mid for 2 hours.
---
If you are going to comment, at least read through the thread.
---
The orc axe frostbite is very good
---
Those were flowers
---
Once you hit revered you get exactly zero rep from LTs and commanders. Zero. Marshalls only give 5 each. One kill can drop 15 blood that turns into 15 rep.
---
As far as rep is concerned you will get 125 for Belinda and 500ish for winning (not sure the actual amount) and only 150 or so for losing. Out of 21,000 that you need. Yikes.
---
Additionally, turtles are Horde favored while rushes are heavily Alliance favored. Offense players cannot turn in items without leaving the zerg, so by default turning in makes you a defense player. Strong defense leads to slower games with higher win percentage for Horde and increased rep for everyone. Win-win.
---
The zerg will always do Marshalls and Belinda, half the raid could afk and that would still happen. Honor grinders will see to it.
---
So if you still advocate for rushing on Horde then you are straight up making your grind longer. Horde loses the race 80% of the time which cuts rep down from 650 to 150, then you further decrease your potential rep by letting insignias go to waste.
---
I thought these were disabled in Battlegrounds?
---
Oh wow a npc that does frostbolts such experience much fantastic
---
A sickening, toxic realm.
---
Just open trade and say "thank you" after
---
Correct, you'd put a lot of points into enhancement even as resto/ele
---
Read better.  Horde intercepts alliance rush, not alliance stopping belinda rush.  No wonder you're off in lala land.
---
Wait untill monday, start queing again when all the dads and kids are away :)
---
You're not losing because *you* have a 60% mount, try get a premade with the guild, /afk the games where you see all the people that *"wants to have fun"* and "*farm honor",* 3k honor for a forty minute game is just stupid and not worth it.
---
Ret paladin hosting pugs here: I did this. :)
---
whats the context of this?
---
The funny thing is the epic pvp gear and weapons aren't even THAT good compared to raid gear which is much much easier to get lol.  I just want rank 10, if im feelin it i might go for the mount at 11 but once im rank 10 im probs just gonna pvp for fun.
---
fuck you I hope your parents die, I want free xfers in maybe a couple of weeks time at most.
---
Screen shot a combat log of +1 and +5 reps that add up over 25 minutes to 1400?
---
The struggle quest.
---
Not for me  but sure I'll give you that one
---
Thata pretty normal.
---
Why would it not be relevant to this sub?  This is a sub for discussion of classic wow correct?   You must not understand the effect of meta creep if you don't realize how changes at the top levels of any game tend to trickle downwards over time and end up being implemented by the masses eventually.  Classic is a living testament to this concept.  It is being played completely differently to the way it was played in 2005-06.  Theorycrafting would be much more relevant and productive discussion than the 9000th "It took me 4 months to reach lvl 40 and i finally got my mount!" karma-whoring thread.  Also, I find it funny how quickly you changed your tune from "there is no theorycrafting to be done"  to "GTFO the sub with your theorycrafting".
---
Are you using TitanPanel?
---
I had the same thing and found it was due to a setting in Titan.
---
rip gothic
---
Or maybe it's a case of selective memory. Everyone remembers the shit RNG happening to them, but not when it goes in their favour. Without hard data to back up claims like this, they are meaningless. We have no good reason to believe that Blizzard would have changed resistance scaling or anything like that.
---
Not trying to dump on you or something, I do this kind of selective memory thing all the time. It's very easy to get caught up in it.
---
What if the hunter wingclips you?
---
that's got nothing to do with horde or alliance lol. you realize we are all the same players right?
---
If you‚Äôre allowed to be a stationary turret, sure. Which only happens in a 1v1, so prior statement stands.
---
hey i got an undead warr, deathbringer main hand.  Mirah's offhand.  Almost exalted, should i use lobo, frostbite, or mirah for offhand?
---
So, now you are sidestepping my question, and not even giving a reply that I can parse for the answer.
---
Pot, meet kettle.
---
I will ask you one more time. Do you, or do you not freely give your money away to every person that you pass by who asks you for money?
---
I'll assume that if you don't answer this question, then no, you don't freely give your money away to every person who asks you for money, and the reason for that is because it is your money and you get to decide what you want to do with it.
---
Similarly, I play WoW because it is a fun video game and I want to play it the way I want and no one else gets to decide for me how I choose to play that game unless I decide that's what I want.
---
Stone Guard Marcq from Final Destiny
---
You are the real MVP.
---
Horde can easily win by rushing. The problem was people too busy farming honor to care.
---
I‚Äôd honestly be okay with mods locking every ‚Äúis it too late to try classic‚Äù post and single word answering them ‚Äúno‚Äù
---
What world do you live in? Maybe at launch it was a 90% winrate. horde wipe us constantly at galv now. They pick off healers in the fields then wipe us when we have no heals and Alliance is too tunnel visioned on the super fast win to realize they have no tanks or no healers.... MAYBE the Drek race is successful 50% of the time....  Objective race is ALWAYS a consistent rep/honor...... Even when the game turns into a turtle, noone does turn ins, or people loot everything with no intention of turning it in.
---
Nowhere is safe for Leafs fans.
---
So if you want to aoe, then spec aoe.
---
If you want to quest, spec single combat.
---
Im on Smolderweb, I was just shocked because the average market value said around 350g. Either way I'm happy haha
---
What level do you need to fish here?
---
A spec that is 100% reliant on RNG? No, I don‚Äôt agree, because the spec simply is flat out boring. What weapon you swing changes nothing for me, because it‚Äôs all down to the casino.
---
I do, I want to actually fight, but by not giving the rep grinders something they will never try to actually play the BG. instead the moment it looks like a turtle half will afk or ghost walk for 7 minutes...  
---
Best thing to do, when you see people ghost walking, is report them AFK halfway down..... it results in them gettting AFK kicked.
---
If you win every game it should be more by my calculations. However if you get 3-0'd in a Gulch game it's a massive waste of time
---
If you're not running a 100% speed mount it's basically the only chance they have of getting the "assault a GY" quest done, so yes it actually does.
---
We are literally giving them away
---
Look up a YouTuber who did a guide on it I think it‚Äôs frosty or something along those lines he has a great video and written guide that shows great spots to aoe farm, specs, progression, and even questing zones that have quest mobs that are aoe-able
---
There's a lot here to account for but here's my recommendation.
---
1. Join the Fight Club Discord - https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw
---
2. Go to #spreadsheet-updates and download the spreadsheet
---
3. Input your current gear/spec.
---
4. Change weapons around to see what could be a better dps increase for you.
---
5. ????
---
6. Profit!
---
Sucks yall have a 10 min queue but I dont feel as bad due to all the corpse runs I had to make into brm
---
WATCH OUT GUYS BLIZZARD FAN BOY COMING THEOUGB
---
I don't care about honor, I'm only playing for rep and to win.
---
Lol take my updoot
---
There isn't any \*relevant\* theorycrafting to do.  You must not understand that this sub is not a super high end raiding sub.  Take a look around, you see much of that talk going on?
---
Not too confusing. Only way to do it is to make a new character
---
Great start, I still suggest not having mods that are also mods of r/WoW due to conflict of interest, but this is a great first step to cleaning up the sub.
---
Frig honor spy. Play pvp alot and get rewards or dont. I'm glad it's broken ya tryhards
---
But why would you inflict yourself such an horrible thing ?
---
Seriously, you'd need to PAY me ( A LOT) to do something as masochist as going to rank 14.
---
So cancerous tbh, you can randomly stumble across them at a camp in the mountains north of Tarren Mill and you're just totally dead
---
i fished up a bunch of lobsters that don't stack, aren't used for anything, and aren't offhands like the fish  
---
im gunna hand them out with water during next raid :D
---
I picked horde cause i was alliance last time
---
It's the opposite for me. I don't care about honor at all, the PvP ranking grind is not my goal. Frostwolf rep is the only thing I'm looking for in AV.
---
If what you just said isnt proof of the entire problem then you lack the intelligence to understand what you are even proposing.
---
Going galv takes both sides RIGHT into each other...... You are forced to fight or lose massive amounts of people trying to run through them....... It also shows them your plan so they can return to FWKeep via trinket right after they lose the bonus rep race. If they lose it they are even more likely to turtle you all day at FW Keep.
---
Allowing them to win the galv race gives them a reason to want to lose quickly..... if you do not understand this then find a near unknown horde streamer and watch the in game chat.
---
With that said, it is widely known that a premade can go Galv &gt; LTs AND STILL brute force their way into FW RH with high rates of success, but this will NEVER happen often in a pug over a long play session.
---
Live in reality, not in your black and white fantasy world.

Who really gives a fuck. I mean hes not hurting anyone hes just lazy.

they're a bot, not a witch

What is the actual talent spec? ?/?/? Looks sick.
---
I got another sub for my twink so I can run myself through wc/dm etc. pants dropped and I Clicked need on my twink, alt tabbed and clicked need on my main. Bam rolled 100 on my main rip pants
---
There's no perfect loot system. Name one and I can tell you it's deep flaws. The biggest problem with loot council is usually the perception of things being unfair, regardless of whether or not things actually are. It's the ideal system, it just requires fair leaders and and a raid full of people who are capable of being adults and not feeling entitled to everything they want.
---
Hey gave the guild name and called them out, that‚Äôs a witch hunt, I‚Äôm not talking about the bot, he also gives the names of the raid lead and GM which are also witch hunts, also an attempt at brigading even though no one will join in most likely
---
If you're a druid offering an innervate will increase your chances of hydration by a lot, most of the time I get pst for water I don't wanna drop half my Mana bar on a couple stacks especially if I still need to make myself some or a Mana gem
---
Nah, snowballs are used to pvp your own faction members off your rich thorium vein. :)
---
But a Warrior is already getting some Overpower procs from Rogues because they have innately high dodge chance. So you're trading getting hit by Mortal Strike, Whirlwind or Heroic Strike/autos for an extra Overpower or two.
---
Whoops

Arabian Prince need help getting a bank transfer, will give you 500g, must send 5g to apply.  Please mail to.....
---
No.. it's not irrelevant because there's a chance he could have rolled an 82 and still not satisfied his prediction. When you're talking about chance, you have to take into account the entire prediction and all of the chances into account. There's a 1% chance that he will roll an 82. There is a .81% that he will roll an 82 *and win."
---
Just because he did win does not mean that the chance that he could have lost is just forgotten.
---
I‚Äôve played wow for 4 days straight on stimulants. It‚Äôs completely possible and who are you to say how I spend my fun time? If I spend money on te game and choose to stay in it for 72 hours that‚Äôs on me, not blizzard. Sounds like you‚Äôre just salty that you aren‚Äôt ranking.
---
As someone who has pvpd for almost 10 years, no it does not make a difference at all and you would have better luck stacking more crit. Say what you want but its wasted.
---
Works on my 2012 with average latency 60

He doesn‚Äôt purge all your buffs at a time. That is why you tunnel him. Fewer buffs purged.

You just have to be guild master and/or a big streamer.
---
I remember when snowballs first came out in vanilla there was a bug if you snowballed someone who just initiated a flight it would instantly take them to their destination.
---
Useful trick
---
You didn't really get removed as you said you quit.
---
People roll them because theyre the one class that isnt very technical. You said it yourself 90% of it is auto attacking which almost anyone can do and if that person isnt a fan of having 5 bars of abilities and downranked spells that they will most often always use then the class is perfect for them. No hate just laying it down how it is.
---
Most weapon debuffs are low priority so higher prio debuffs will replace them. 
---
If i have understood the system right, the debuff with highest priority belov boss icon is the upper left one, so if you want to see what priority lobotomizer debuff got you can try to apply it some mc boss during raid and see where does it locate, if its in lower right or dosent appear at all then its safe to use, in case its in upper right or in upper most row then dont use it outside trash.
---
It‚Äôs totally fine, you can fps dungeons and do quests just fine using the AoE spec. It does get boring after a while though.
---
Nice blurring btw
---
Technically stormwind is as we drop the heads there, but the vendors are easier to get to in Ironforge and also it is a more central location and faster to get to menethil and the plague lands
---
Platform 9 3/4
---
&gt;Id take a ret or two anyway,
---
Its not like raids are struggling to fill dps. I have to reject lots of dps players. Unless the ret pally is a personal friend, I can't imagine why I would take one.
---
Need info, what is your strat? Why are you wiping at 60% and how are people dying? i.e is the tank dying then you wipe? is the melee getting smashed by not running out? Are your ranged/healers being knocked into lava because they aren't against a wall? Is your DPS so low he is at 60% when he submerges and the sons are getting you? 60% seems an odd health to be wiping at, how many are in your raid and do you have enough healers?
---
People will say to kill him before the submerge but you probably won't have the DPS for that.
---
You do not need to wear fire resist (only tanks), just use the pots like people mentioned. I'd tell everyone greater pots for now but once your raid is clearing him easy and your guild is more geared you can probably have ranged drop down to normal fire resist pots after that (and eventually get him before the submerge too). Tell them they need at least 2 pots per attempt.
---
Wrong reddit, stupid cosmetics fan service is at r/wow

Don't play classic, or even wow, for years. Saw hor enh on r/all and had to swing by, you know.

Anyway, I read that thinking "wait what does this guys masturbation habits have to do with a mage?" until the all caps dawned on me.

I like the cats on stv better as the hairs go for 7s
---
I see you in AV! Hi from Kromkrush
---
Title says you were removed from guild. Yet you clearly quit yourself.
---
I made 80g this morning and I farmed about 150 eggs today in like an hour and a half
---
I think it got price cut somewhere along the way in retail. My guildie was shocked today to find out it costs 640 (with all discounts), he read somewhere that it's only about 200.
---
gtfo you dont make 100 each per 5 runs in a 3 man dm east.
---
Yes.
---
Premading is about honor per hour, if you take that away by forcing them to play versus other tryhards which will drag out the games forever, then the rankers will simply stop premading and do small groups like 4mans or something instead. In order for premade versus premade to work you would have to somehow sufficiently supplement the honor gain from these games, in a way that's not abusive,  and that still leaves pugging as a fair alternative.
---
Too much power
---
Ah yes the bane of every raid.  Adults that can't act like one.
---
Since they have such good Honor and all
---
I meant the guy replying. Not you fam.
---
Hey now, they aren't the worst. Boomkin is the worst LOL
---
i recap that GY as ali all the time
---
i simply respond with "some men just want to watch the world burn" when people start complaining in chat
---
literally the only thing SW got going for it is the fact that onyxia buff pops there. If it was in IF none would ever go to SW except to escape the zerg.
---
Mages. Say in raid open trade for water. That way if you have stores people know who to talk to.
---
Now the entire transaction has been completed start to finish and no one is a dick.
---
*wink*
---
People take shit too seriously, makes me wanna cry but I'm scared Chuck will punch me if I do
---
Just made 24g each the last 2 runs. We get crystals pretty frequently compared to other teams
---
Not true, ive had plenty of russians in my AV team
---

From other posts sounds like ya cant skin em.

Witch hunting is also now allowed on sundays only. There‚Äôs even a new flair for it
---
Ok thx !
---
Im about to go make this problem a lot worse.
---
Had the same question, but so far the general consensus is these kinds of debuffs get pushed off by almost anything else
---
I hit 999 exalted 34hrs after BGS were released, I also slept for 9hrs and cleared MC an onyxia in that window.
---
&gt;I was getting ganked in the fucking barrens
---
Hmmmm
---
Reporting for model changer
---
Ok thx what server do you recommend on eu?

its a low prio debuff it will not knock off anything important

So 4 hk and 17 griefer kills.  Slow claps abound.

it works JUST like gutgore
---
Fresh 60 not geared, RFD. Raid geared 60, all of ZF.
---
Reminds me of Gimli at the bridge of Helms Deep xD
---
Lol horde or alliance? On alliance side smolderweb theyre going for like 250
---
That's a valid point
---
not on any of the actual top ones, doesn't sound like a real thing to me tbh
---
Ok Thx for the answer!
---
Drekeesha
---
fastest in my guild was exalted Friday morning
---
and thats nothing. some people had finished on Wednesday
---
i finished Sat evening
---
Dont trust average for rare/epic boes. Thats meant for like mats and shit that sells all the time, always post them highest you can and if you dont know the price ask someone or find someone buying and see what theyre offering and add 20% to the price their offering and ignore them and post to AH.
---
While you're at it you can add posts that complain about common posts too.
---
atleast on the horde side, when an ench shaman bid for the crown of destruction they can point to lionheart helm when warriors QQ about it.
---
if I was a retardin in a MC guild i'd be happy people let me raid on a crap meme spec... wouldn't push my luck taking rare BIS loot off the DPS carrying me.
---
I do this as ele, now I realize I doing it all wrong. So very wrong.

I would be ok with 20 minute games with some defense on both sides. I cannot stand 45 minute games. Ultimately it takes 2 factions to turtle, and there are behaviors on both sides that lead to a stagnant game state.
---
This would make sense if all the world-first rank 14s weren't going to be bots.
---
10 minute que times and going up means we want to stay in game a while. Allies got so many free wins to exalted that a lot of us are stuck trying to finish the grind on horde side
---
The proc rate is so low I don't think you'll have any problem.
---

Lol them little gingerbitches are 50s each on Horde side Sulfuras. I farmed for an hour and turned out like 80g.
---
A fine gentleman like yourself who partakes in Westfall chat would always take a proper screenshot, only those dastardly barren's chat goons would use their phones.
---
To the people who say it‚Äôs just one button or that we‚Äôre lazy. Try leveling a mage and see how you feel after you‚Äôve been asked for water/food for the 1000th time. It‚Äôs not too bad at first but it gets old real quick after people open trade spam you dozens of time a day.
---
No. Hit chance and crit/str/agi are much better than +15% threat on sunder.
---
What opposing argument?  You literally just made an incorrect statement, and with conviction, making you a moron.
---
Left: drafted player
---
Right: player after 2 years of Babcock‚Äôs coaching

2m queues vs 20m queues. It's 30m per match vs 40m per match for a third of the rep.

Allies get instant queues but not the horde.

Or may be they don't care about pvp. That's why people roll Alliance in the first place when you mix maxing for pvp.
---
Longer by 3-5 mins hasn't made a certain impact for sure. Early losses of rep were for people who rushed base brainless without leaving a bit of defense or not using backdoor themselves, I haven't encountered this much, maybe the first day only. 
---
I was working, watching some movies in evenings yet I hit exalted yesterday as a horde: I'd say plenty manageable for others. Alliance who cared hit their exalted Thursday.
---
Oh it's probably off your screen. Go to Group and change the X Offset so it's more center.

---
I open trade and immediately put in a nominal amount of silver. Just 10 or 20. It saves having to dance with your mage in PMs and communicates appreciation at the same time.   
---
Tip your mages. Be polite.
---
Wrong.
---
Not with 13-15 min queue times. It‚Äôs better rep by winning. And a 25min game is the perfect time so people can hand in scraps and blood. I get around 1k rep from those rounds.
---
I have female orc named ‚ÄúDude‚Äù. It adds some spice to quest dialogs.

Youll be there for a while, everyone else afk‚Äôs out lol
---
did you consider some people are having fun pve?
---
As long as they have enough people actually carrying the raid, sure they will kill Vael if he doesn't gib their best DPS right away, and they actually use full cons. Some of the wheelchair guilds with 12 healers and a handful of wheelchair DPS will get turned back by Vael because they run out of cons for attempts, and come back the next week and clear it. The real problem will be when they get a Chrommie doing bronze and they run out of hourglass sand, cus once you're out, no more attempts.
---
Good. Memes ruin subs. People don't care about anything but trying to make the most karma whoring meme possible.
---
Just play as a premade yourself, this is the way WSG/AB should be played anyway. You have AV for solo queue.
---
We've gotten a lot of comments here and DMs requesting us not to remove that. Passed it on to the rest of the team and we're discussing. I'm traveling today so don't have a good chunk of time to talk it over, but just wanted to say that I've read the concerns and am not ignoring it.
---
Yeh dunno man. More efficient maybe but not better. I'm enjoying actually playing AV compared to losing after 8mins. With all the turn ins from people on defense and the rep from winning the grind still went by pretty fast (rep wise)
---
I can't stand these types of guild so I joined a guild on my server (Deviate Delight) that's explicitly anti-racist. Sure is nice to be in a guild where I don't have to deal with some asshole saying weird shit about black people.
---
Because you can afk play while doing other stuff then still demand gear from specs that are hard carrying someone worthless.
---
Come to Deviate Delight. People get dunked on for saying racist shit in world chat here.
---
I usually just whisp them then open the trade. Also i only ask for 1 stack which is mostly enough for one bg. So far there werent any issues.
---
I like how the meta changes yes
---
What I don't like is people deliberately turtling when they know they lost. This goes for both factions. Quit wasting fucking time.
---
El Dorado type shit. Keep it up!
---
buy a bunch of the parrots and cat carriers if you want to be nice
---
if you want to be rude just use any old trash you find
---
Idk who forces 45 mins turtles. Based on my experience, it's 4-5k honor for every 20 min AV. Before it was 3.5 for 10. With queues being longer now, this is still the best way. After queues being longer than 15 mins it's time to switch to WSG premade for honor.
---
Who need alliance when you have this!?
---
 I feel for you. Coming from paladin going for shaman is pretty much different ends of 2 extremes. You switched from the class with least necessary keybinds to the one with most.
---
You‚Äôll have to use every reachable button in proximity to WASD with alt and ctrl modifiers
---
&gt; 40 minute turtle where alliance completes objectives and quests 
---
40 min turtle where alliance loses though: that's the most likely outcome unless you get horde pug with 20 afkers.
---
I distinctly remember doing SSC in early TBC and enh was always on top 3 but later doing TK and BT and seeing them being about mid tier on the meters. So they were pretty good but weren‚Äôt really S tier after the nerf
---
Why would you ever want this over, say, a 14/32/5 build?
---
The 4 points in Thick Hide don't multiply with anything, making it an expensive investment for just some minor mitigation, and I'm not convinced that an extra point (or any) in Primal Fury is a huge deal if you're either never rage starved in raids or can just do on-demand Furor powershifting in bear form instead.
---
Rotting bear carcass
---
pretty common for naga users
---
The voodoo piles look like panthers
---
ok.
---
The turtles are caused by Horde because Alliance just charge south with minimal defense.  As the horde defense kills Alliance and sends them back north, the turtling begins.
---
Which is what you want if you have long queues.
---
50% arent hitting rank 11+ so honor isnt relevant to that many people.
---
it's not the full duration
---
I don't because I couldn't play the first weekend so everyone got 300k and exalted
---
And now it will take me weeks...
---
Its possible to only pull one warmaster and then drek if the tanks or a leader knows what to do. If everyone is on the same page and no one ninja pulls the whole room you can get galv/lts and still win in 9-12 mins with extra rep and twice as much honor.
---
Played on an air too, i5 is cool enough
---
The answer is simply because they can. 
---
Even if it helps the slightest, or just has a small chance to help the guild it should be done if your end goal is to down bosses as efficiently as possible.
---
Also, you keep saying evenly contributed but that is not true.  Playing a meme spec such as ret is a burden to 39 other people in your raid.  If you simply played a non-garbage spec or class you would save everyone time.  Over the course of the expansion you are looking at hours upon hours of time saved.  We will use your exact same verbiage.  Purposely choosing to play a subpar spec, and demanding to be treated equally is moronic, petty, and narcissistic.
---
You most certainly can kill Garr before he removes all your buffs. Only the top % of raid groups will ever clear him that fast, but it is possible.
---
All bets are off for me if it's a black lotus for me, regardless of faction :)
---
He‚Äôs right, people are gonna use it to stop the horde getting over the bridge and it‚Äôs going to be bannable. People will cry too much, well, if you can even call the horde scum ‚Äúpeople‚Äù
---
Trading time for pixels
---
How did Sodapoppin change his name then? He changed his main character's name. He did not make a new Druid.
---
Thank you for your suggestion, but I had a few specific details that warranted a post tailored to my specific character.
---
Hi FP thanks for offering water and food next to the battle masters! :)
---
I have gold on a horde char on ZT and would trade for alliance gold on Razorgore. Perhaps some else can tune in and we can get a three way trade somehow.
---
Can always trade over neutral AH if the rake isn‚Äôt awful.
---
You pretty much don't know what you're talking about.
---
I disagree on it being strictly pvp weapon. I'm 2h fury and I'm only slightly behind our dw fury warrior on boss fights. Trash fights I'm way ahead of them. And when the raid is done I'm top 6-7 overall damage. Our two ret pallies are sitting dead last.
---
Alliance BGs have always been full of complaints
---
Thick hide is negligible once you unlock Dire Bear form at 40. Here is why:
---
Let‚Äôs assume you have some decent pieces of armour once you hit 60 that equates to 2500 Armour Value (AV).
---
Normal Form: `2500 AV = 29.824% Damage Reduction`  
---
Dire Bear Form: `2500*3.6 = 9000 AV = 60.474% Damage Reduction`
---
Dire Bear Form + 5/5 Thick Hide: `2500*(3.6 + 0.1) = 9250 AV = 61.127%  Damage Reduction`
---
So from the above you can see that 5/5 Thick Hide only gives 0.653 more damage reduction.
---
Personally I would rather spend those 5 talent points into something more useful. I went with Brutal Impact as it gives me more time to get a Heal off in PvP and 1 point in improved shred or Blood Fenzy, both are good talents. If Thick hide was perhaps 1 point for 10% bonus armour from items rather than 2% I would definitely consider it.
---
Ironic considering your comment is just bitching
---
That‚Äôs a good idea! We‚Äôre getting somewhere:D
---
Most likely. Not sure why it wasn't included in the screencap
---
Well yeah only so many priests in a raid group.
---
Did you make the move after all? I'm juggling between my PvP server 52 lvl main and almost 27ish PvE alt. My friend rarely plays but I'm still fancying my 300 alchemy I have my PvP main. Although I do seem to enjoy PvE gameplay, there's always this shadow of what I'm leaving behind.
---
Maybe if you pvpd for like an hour a week over 10 years you'd think that's the case, but not being hit capped in pvp as a warrior is fucking awful. Spend one weekend in WSG with 2% hit and you'll be wishing that 26% crit you had was 23% with hit cap instead.
---
It's not just the undead, the Scarlet Crusade does not like anything that is not a human. They would kill dwarves, gnomes, elves, and all of the horde races equally.
---
&gt;if I was a retardin in a MC guild i'd be happy people let me raid on a crap meme spec... 
---
Yes, how gracious of them to let you farm Molten Snore week in and week out with no opportunity for character progression and no chance of even competing on parses because the guilds that don't treat their hybrids like subhumans have rets/enh/ele/ferals/balance with actual gear that you will simply never compete with.
---
The attempts isn‚Äôt the problem so much as the 2hr respawn timer on the quest NPC if you fail
---
The biggest change in later expansions was skill based MMR in rated arenas and BG's. You actually had to be good at the game to get gladiator.
---
Classic ranking is a neckbeard challenge.
---
He got banned before he went left
---
After Sundays raid 10 of us went to Winterspring to farm an Eye of Shadow for one of our priests that just got the Eye from MC. We had 2 Eye of Shadow drop back to back as seen here. And 1 minute later 3 people of our raid (out of range to see the roll) got a third one!! We spent a total of 20 minutes in Winterspring.  
---
Did we get extremely lucky or are these not as rare as I thought?
---
i only vendor items, to make sure i dont put offense to people.
---
Imagine showing up for raid night to be told you‚Äôve been ‚Äòbenched‚Äô 
---
Hahaha that sounds so fucking shit Jesus Christ
---
just a reminder that while wf can't proc itself, it can proc anything else that gives extra attacks and be proc'd by any other extra attacks.  
---
a good proc chain with windfury, hand of justice, and ironfoe is a sight to behold.
---
At least he let us know he has no idea what he's talking about lol
---
Yulp, my rogues an alt and i hadn't played for awhile so i thought I had imagined the tooltip
---
Best i could find to skin and loot, doubles it when you sell garbage.
---
You can also do it at their own cave by running through  their portal and hoping they chase you.
---
Undeads look dope on kodos
---
The difference here it that 1. Its not random people and 2. The time invested is vastly different.  Imagine you start playing a pickup basketball game.  One of the guys on your team asks for 3-10s of your time.  Of course you would say yes, right?  Well, you might not but most people would.  Its not like you‚Äôre working 14 hour days in the conjure water sweatshops just to give it away to random people.  Giving a couple stacks of water takes like 10s out of a 90s time where you‚Äôre not doing anything anyways.  Of course, you can‚Äôt see this and will continue to copy/paste the same tired old responses.
---
Ret pallies will always be dead last. I‚Äôm speaking from a pvp perspective I don‚Äôt care much for 15+ year old scripted encounters but if we want to talk pve it‚Äôs not optimal for alliance pve as you said it yourself the dw fury warriors will always be ahead of you on boss fights where parsing actually matters.
---
You‚Äôre kind of right, strictly is too absolute of a word. I would say 90% it‚Äôs a pvp wep on alliance side since the try hard parsing warriors won‚Äôt be using it on boss fights, except on trash like you said.
---
Can you use it in combat?? And how long does it last? Don‚Äôt bleeds and shit break it?
---
I had a bank alt full of eggs thinking I was going to cash in. Woke up this morning and there were over 400 auctions for small eggs. Oldest were 5g, newest were 10 silver. Too bad I can‚Äôt egg people in game.
---
I‚Äôd go as far to say they‚Äôre playing harder because of the 40 min queue times as well (Argual) whereas ally have insta queue less incentive.
---
Well lemme get video of this I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll see it again. I‚Äôm just trying to get my fordring necklace.
---
botb is the most overrated episode of any tv show in history
---
Its ironforge. Middle of the continent, and a short fp to menethil to go to kalimdor. Only reason to set your hearth in stormwind is if you're below level 30
---
Staff of Dominance, I didn't think you had that one? :D
---
&gt; classic.wowhead has 19 logged Ragnaros kill. GL proving anything with that.
---
It logged around 12000 geddon and garr kills.
---
We are all in discord , we have chat open and do a ready check then pull timer , on go we que and type the number , if one or two don‚Äôt get in they un que and click que and scroll to bottom to find the one we all joined and que into it , works very well
---
I just checked the AH for whatever was available and not over priced.
---
Blackrock stronghold in burning steppes. Stealth in past the orcs and clear the inside. Check for chests and black lotus outside then repeat. Easy money, but boring.
---
I write back, spank me daddy, I've been a bad, bad girl.  That ends it.
---
Interesting, I had a VERY similar chat like that in Ungoro about a month ago hahaha
---
&gt; I mean in the context of a raid (or AV) it's the mage's job to provide water
---
I never said it wasn't.  Being a rude ass hole isn't going to get you water.  People are too lazy to even ask politely or are entitled and expect it and just open trade without saying a word.
---
Don't expect a mage to give you water if you aren't asking for it, guild raids are obviously different circumstances.
---
Dangle snipe celly boys
---
1. The posted drop rates aren't posted by blizz. They are an amalgamation of player reported drops over time, and as such are guesses. Really good guesses, but guesses at best.
---
2. Yes it is. It is exactly that. That's how The Law of Large Numbers works. It's akin to playing roulette and getting surprised if 00 hit 3 times in a row. It doesn't mean the wheel or table is broken, that's just how probability works.

I love battlegrounds. I had just landed and was watching YouTube and trying to do my fordring neck quest. And then ran into those clowns.
---
I hate those bot.
---
Wait really...? So it‚Äôs a get outta bullshit free AND. A hearth? I don‚Äôt get it. My queues are always instant.
---
Anytime :)
---
Odd, my server isn't even high pop and it's still got people around at all times. Especially if you go to the warmasters...
---
You can also combine modifiers [mod:ctrl; mod:shift] or something like that. I use combos a lot
---
Was looking at a discussion on the warlock quest.  Thanks for the info!
---
The pvp vendors are there too
---
Thanks and sorry to see the show end, but cheers for doing it! I'm listening to the Raph Koster interview right now and it's great stuff, even to someone like me who never gave a shit about Star Wars, much less Star Wars video games.
---
Sometimes, I rip the skin.
---
Thanks for listening mate, glad you‚Äôre enjoying it :) it will be sad to see it go for sure
---
If I rolled (for example) a priest, I wouldn‚Äôt spend several hours writing reddit posts bitching about how people get mad at me for not using spells and just autoattacking.  In reality, you want to dictate how others play.  The accepted practice is for mages in group content to give water to the healers.  You didn‚Äôt do this, so the healers were (understandably) annoyed.  Now you make this post because you want people to stop getting mad that you wont use one of your abilities.
---
I always make my mount my first buy, every character I've leveled in vanilla and in classic hits 60 with around 500-600g so the farm isn't that intense from that point.
---
Hello, it's me, your (not so) helpful reindeer riding companion. Thanks for the cookies and milk!
---
Why not just ask a guildie to make water for you before you queue? Would rather do that than rely on asking for water once people load into instance
---
I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of people who want to do exactly this.
---
&gt; Iirc wowhead info is only as accurate as those reporting the info, it‚Äôs not pulled from some API that‚Äôs automatically uploaded every time the boss dies. With this, the info is going to be skewed.
---
That does not make sense. It gets the data from people that use the addon. That sample is independent. So nothing is skewed because of the concern you are raising. Quite literally.
---
Is there a reason to fish in AV?
---
Who drops furor book and lots of plants?
---
If your guild encounters a wall in classic raiding you should find a better guild
---
The BRE proc is only useful in pvp and on trash. On bosses the armor is already 0 via other stacked effects so it's just good for it's naked DPS value. I believe that for non-humans OEB is better just because weapon skill is overpowered. It's damn close for humans too.
---
Echo Isles was the name of my server in Vanilla ü§ì
---
I ended up going down a similar route. Gave more active members Prairie Dogs I picked up from neutral AH, my main tank a Tranquil Mechanical Yeti, Siamese Cats, and Black Tabby's to the semi active members, and Ancona Chickens for the less active members. All in all spent about 50g on everyones gifts.
---
Heavy Snowballs from AV did, normal snowballs didn't

Underrated post
---
?? if you do only 1 raid group (like during progress) that is the reality. sometimes people get benched
---
Do you know if the spirt buff stacks with food/priest buff?
---
It's part of the territory. I'm the designated water boy for our raid, on raid night I will get super stoned while filling my bags with water. It's nice to be needed and plus I'm not emotional or anything, I know it's appreciated by others so that's enough for me to do it willingly and give water to anyone who asks
---
I hope you're not trying to imply that's an issue. Nothing wrong with playing a game in your free time and I enjoying it your own way.
---
Miss me with that gay shit
---
I don‚Äôt remember anything about specific AV snowballs. Do they only work in AV? I remember knocking people down in Warsong Gulch with snowballs.
---
&gt;putting in the same amount of effort,
---
Oh you are assuming much
---
&gt;But my mana pool with the BiS items is so low...
---
Downrank more.
---
You can path between those pulls safely instead of around the back of the hut and thru to van if the flag guards are gone. People don‚Äôt know this. You take maybe 3-4 shots from archers at the worst and then you‚Äôre good to go. Avoid the bulk of cleave from the marshalls by standing on the block at the end of the little left wall extending from the front of the ally base which you jump on from the little incline on its left as you face the building.
---
Ret has more buttons in their DPS rotation than rogues, mages, locks, or warrs in PvE.  All of the "DPS" classes in PvE are completely faceroll, max 3 buttons.  To say playing a ret in either PvE or PvP is "easier" than a DPS class is just ignorant.  No class in classic is hard.  But CERTAINLY none of the main DPS specs are difficult at all, parsing is literally all about your gear.
---
Even our MT still doesn't have t1 gauntlets.
---
Close!
---
i actually enjoyed it, as i wanted rep not honor, 6 min 385Rep. got exalted in 2-3 days n will likely never AV again on my own .
---
I go with a polite whisper and then open the trade - if they close it I pick a new mage and repeat but 99% of the time I get given what I‚Äôve asked for. I say thanks, usually get a ‚Äúyou're welcome‚Äù.
---
Seems a fair compromise to me, I‚Äôve asked and done everything I personally can do to make it easier on you to help me. 
---
Also your odds go way up if you get in the game as soon as it pops and sort this out right away so the mage has time to make a bunch more and drink if they need without being delayed.
---
What about when you get gouged the second you switch to battle stance?
---
u/EluneNoYume https://youtu.be/Ag1o3koTLWM
---
I'd appreciate a link to that as well if possible!
---
I was in one of those AV's OP griefed with that move , he took it even when we asked to not do it , then our team cleared the alliance from the base forcing a turtle for more than 1 hour wasting everyone time.
---
Its really sad as a 30 years mouseclicker you enjoy griefing others and making a post about it in reddit
---
"this is garbage" IS constructive criticism.
---
No I‚Äôm not
---
When I‚Äôm on my rogue, same. I will unlock anything for you, for free (though I don‚Äôt turn tips down)... if you ask. If you just open trade and stare at me then I‚Äôm gonna sit there staring right back.
---
In vanilla someone opened a trade then just whispered me ‚ÄúUNLOCK‚Äù. I put my MH in the trade and replied ‚ÄúCRUSADER‚Äù. He left.
---
NBA finals and S√∫per bowl are more popular
---
&gt;no you cant afford to spam your holy spells with howlong fights are. and you scale like shit anyway so warrior / rogues will dump on you regardless.
---
Nothing that can't be fixed with mana pots. But even then you won't be better than a real player making less effort lul
---
If you choose to bring a ret pally to a raid the guild is obviously not min maxing anyway
---
&gt;It's a game meant to be played for fun after all.
---
Yes, and carrying wheelchair specs isn't all that fun.
---
I do this when I hit up mages in IF for water. Soon as they start casting I hit them with innervate and they always take it as a challenge to make as much water as they can before it runs out.
---
Trinket my crippling and I'm blinding you.
---
havent tested it with food but it works with the priestbuff
---
My guild is so ass backwards. We have 2 Rets. Holy Paladins cant roll on Mageblade over Mages and Warlocks but Rets can roll against Warriors for Girdle. I may need a new guild.
---
Not in the game yet. Nobody is sure if they will be in by phase 4 or 5.
---
As a rogue, I feel you. Especially as my server doesn‚Äôt seem to have that many, though I guess a lot more people have levelled up recently as it‚Äôs not as bad. First couple of months I got a dozen whispers every time I was in a city.
---
That said people always tip me so I‚Äôm cool with it.
---
Yes you can.  I've done it plenty.
---
The window is just smaller than it used to be.
---
This could be different if fighting a taurean warrior though.
---
Or you could... take people that enjoy playing what's best? don't see why its one of the other.
---
Yes, it's largely why the pure rush strat is absolutely idiotic at this point.  When horde weren't defending and alliance can kill drek before the towers cap, it works fine.  If horde defend at all, the delay just adds more warmasters to clear.  In the end, Horde have to kill 2 marshals while Alliance are trying to kill 6.
---
I just say, ‚ÄúTrade water if you want healing. ‚Äú Then people say, ‚ÄúFuck you, go buy it outside.‚Äù
---
Ah.... Orcs...
---
A warrior trying to parse horde side pulls aggro and dies. Blessing of Salvation is biggest DPS increase in the game.
---
Zero sum dkp
---
99% guilds are not speedrunning.
---
if you are not speedrunning then resto druids do decent enough healing and are useful to bring.
---
if you are speedruning than moonkin and resto are both absolute trash but you tolerate it because of buffs and ff and moonkin might be sligtly more useful but its not like it even matters.
---
Yeah, OP sounds like a self righteous twat just from how he wrote the post. I'd rather play with botters than people like that
---
Well, that's an easy one. When they miss its OMG BAD RNG UNFAAAAIIRRRR! 
---
When they crit an execute and two shot someone it's, OMG I'M SO SKILL!
---
I spent like 70g to get engineering up to seaforium charge. Dropped skinning for it at 60. Made back all that cash straight away
---
this sounds exactly like the ranked BG system we have on retail!

---
It *was* literally unplayable for the minority faction of a lot of servers.
---
What a whiny fuckhead
---
You shouldn‚Äôt expect to get a sulfuras. Everyone wants a sulfuras.
---
At least you can derive your enjoyment from being a griefer.  I'm not particularly impressed.  Grief on griefmaster flex.
---
This is what most people are in AV for.
---
Filthy alliance.
---
&gt;Even if it helps the slightest, or just has a small chance to help the guild it should be done if your end goal is to down bosses as efficiently as possible.
---
This shouldn't be your goal though, or at least not at the expense of playing the actual bloody game.  "The slightest" is the issue here.  When you completely axe a hugely integral part of playing the game from some of your raiders for the most absurdly nominal increases to efficiency you're being an asshole, and a dumb one at that.
---
&gt;Also, you keep saying evenly contributed but that is not true.
---
It's absolutely true.  If they are playing their spec as well as any of the mages, showing up to raids, consumed appropriately, playing their role properly, they are contributing evenly.  The fact that they have different mathematical limitations to their spec is utterly irrelevant.
---
&gt;is a burden to 39 other people in your raid. If you simply played a non-garbage spec or class you would save everyone time. Over the course of the expansion you are looking at hours upon hours of time saved.
---
For starters that's not how time works.  You don't get to stockpile bits of errant time and then oh look you have an entire day off to yourself because you saved 60 seconds on each raid day for two years.  Not to mention raiding is already such a minor portion of what people do in the game per week, and even when raid tiers start piling up that won't change all that much.  Finishing your weekly raiding even quicker when you're already doing it quickly should not be something you prioritize over your raiders getting to play the game.  Hybrid DPS of course, but this also comes down to people not respeccing out of PvP specs once content is on farm among other things.
---
&gt;We will use your exact same verbiage. Purposely choosing to play a subpar spec, and demanding to be treated equally is moronic, petty, and narcissistic.
---
No, playing the game is none of those things.  It's a fucking RPG and playing the race and spec you want is a core part of that experience.  We've received a wonderful gift by raiding the easiest version of vanilla content with the most powerful version of class specs.  The fact that this spastic, sociopathic community of sperglings has decided to spit in the face of it by somehow becoming even *more* restrictive of what is "officially" allowed in a world where there's no question of if you're going to down content but rather only how quickly you are going to farm it each week, is absolutely fucking gobsmacking.  In vanilla proper it was a legitimate concern that you might not progress and that even if you played content correctly bringing certain specs might mathematically bar you from doing so.  In classic we know that if you play the content correctly you will progress and absolutely blow the required metrics out of the water as a raid.  There is not a single guild that ends up not progressing where the problem won't have been between the chair and the keyboard.  In zero instances will it be because they ran the guild fairly.
---
Demanding to be treated equally because you are another fucking human being playing the game and investing equally into it is not moronic, or petty, or narcissistic, and wanting to play what you want in a fucking RPG is also none of those things.  Wanting to strip the game down to an efficiency simulator and treating other raiders as subhuman trash and as if their time isn't worth as much as yours because they're living out their fucking fantasy in an RPG is absolutely *all* of those things.
---
a shortcut to the GY
---
&gt; (the real one)
---
The earliest record of a game called football featured a rule forbidding kicking. Football refers to any game played on foot, rather than on horse like the nobility. The origin of the term "soccer" began in England to shorten Association Football, while Rugby Football took the short-lived name "Ruggers." It was dropped in most of Europe after it gained popularity in America and became "Americanized."
---
Not possible in classic
---
Wow...what an original concept...maybe even gO bAcK tO rEtAlE?
---
Drekquanda
---
I was thinking more in the sense this would apply in PVP rather than in PVE. Sure, in PVE you would have moments to drink. But in PVP, where 8 seconds versus 30 seconds makes all the difference in the world.
---
Or with a snowball
---
You know you can include this stuff in the setup that you publish.. and if someone is gonna sit on an actual bench to keep themselves ready for emegency sub they will receive EP/DKP for that. Nothing fucks with the morale of a player more than not taking them and having them know 5 min before the raid. Gotta respect people's time. At least for current content absolutely doable.
---
It says there is a comment here, but I don't see it :/
---
If you played horde and had an enhacement shaman who's tanked everything pre raid and wanted to try raid tanking as well, would you let him?
---
I love the meta. I get to actually fight people. Got exalted in the first 2 days so I am just having fun for a couple of hours now.
---
Yeah, it's hard packed snowballs. They worked on friendlies as well as enemies.
---
what
---
Yes but we win the BG, if i not do that alliance just zerg the boss and win.
---
Say me thank you, and suck my dick.
---
Hey hey hey relax with that
---
In vanilla it's always been easier to raid for PvP gear than PvP for it. Personally I also find it more fun that way, it's nice having a balance between PvP and PvE. Too much of either makes people cranky heh.
---
I just run to to a rogue open trade put money in the trade then the lockbox. I get a ty from them every time, lol.
---
Thanks for the warning. my background for MMO's back in the day was solo farming GW1 content. but that isnt a bad idea at all. thank you :)
---
If it could be done id do it for shits.  Or if its possible with better gear down the line, why not let them tank farm runs?  Its just for fun anyway.  Im not a very serious raider these days obviously.
---
what shoulders are you wearing?
---
Yes. Effort should be rewarded in a loot council. If your leaders are the last one to get loot you know its a good guild.
---
You need an alt account for it to work
---
Our warrior tanks got Corehound Tooths (all fury/prot) before our dagger rogues. Any guild worth its salt is gonna maximize tanks' threat before DPS' DPS, especially for a non PVE-optimal class like rogue
---
I'm pretty sure your wrong
---
Amazing!
---
There‚Äôs an update for CT it‚Äôs fixed once you update it
---
Everyone just want to get Don Julio‚Äôs and get out!
---
I literally read a few lines in and wanted to stop because you are just flat out wrong.  You are being petty, moronic, and narcissistic.  Not even trying to be funny now.
---
You can be the world's best moonkin, spend the world's most amount of time preparing for raids, and still not contribute as much as a warrior, rogue, warlock, etc.  
---
Join an RP server and create your own guild that advertises open rolls on loot if you want to play "whatever character you want".  Some may already exist.  They are out there.  There is absolutely zero reason someone who is interested in progressing should HAVE to allow a subpar spec or player into their raids.  
---
If you want to progress and get gear as efficiently as others you should contribute as much as they do.  No matter how hard you work, as a subpar class or spec you will always be contributing less.  There is simply no other way to look at it.  
---
On a separate note we're delving into the realms of people receiving participation trophies and prizes in today's society.  It teaches kids being subpar is okay.  This is a bad thing and leads to feelings of entitlement exactly like you are expressing here.
---
You're an idiot who knows nothing about the game lmao
---
i don't trade water in av's cause idgaf about anyone from another server. if you can't give me money then you are useless to me so why should i be of use to you.
---
Over used and annoying imo
---
Try to take a less butthurt and douchey approach
---

---

---
Great,  so did I. I'm trying to change the meta to actually have some pvp in this battleground
---
There was a mount rework in tbc, where they basically flipped the prices of the mounts and the riding skill
---
yeah, an alt battle net account=not the same account
---
not two wow licenses on the same account
---
that's not the same spot... that's the south end of BRM not north
---
That's cause alliance gives up and doesn't try. Cause they are stuck in a not worth it mentality. Which is what I'm trying to change.
---
Yeah, but if your water totem is mana spring and youre not spamming shocks like a moron, you can keep that other 75% of your mana up pretty well
---
You‚Äôre a pretty shit guild if you need to maximize efficiency in molten core lol. 
---
Rogue is one of the top dps in molten core. Get the fuck out of here with nonpveoptimal class. Just glancing at WCL I can see rogues in the top dps across all classes.
---
you've most likely seen people above the south entrance, not the north one
---
* Nothing better than the gold ole vanilla leveling and rewarding grind.
---
Ruined by the players rushing to 60 and primarily rolling AOE spell cleave farm classes.
---
*how is someone else rushing ruining anyone elses leveling experience? Even with rushing they are still taking 6-7 days to 60?*
---
* Nothing better than the challenging raids
---
Easy mode raids with no mechanics that are cleared by non 60 players in greens
---
*It's phase 1.....*
---
*People already said before launch MC and Ony would be easy with 1.12's itemization*
---
* Nothing better than the classic world PVP
---
World PVP is entirely gank fests where people camp flight paths and dungeon entrances 40v1.
---
*And if you left reddit a lot of people actually enjoyed that world PVP phase and were waiting for the big clusterfuck that they knew it'd be. And a lot of people talked about more fair fights BEFORE the honor drop and when the world settles down with more content and people hitting their PVP goals it will go back to that. Not to mention nochanges was against the high server pops (which were a change) and layering (again a change) which led to how extreme this phase was so yeah your comment here is just wrong.*
---
* Nothing better than the classic 3 day AVs
---
AV last 7 minutes now and no PVP takes place. If people force PVP, half the raid leaves.
---
*The tough no changes crowd actually wanted an earlier version so this point is just silly anyway, even so 7 minute AVs aren't happening often now. It's usually longer now. Even in 1.12 vanilla AV we had successful quick rushes now and then though. The people nostalgic for 3 day AVs either did not know what version BG we were getting at that point or were just stupid. How is that a nochanges thing?*
---
Overall your post is stupid, all your points are wrong and you just want to bitch and moan about things for the sake of bitching and moaning.
---
Did you forget about the alliance problem of getting reported afk and getting kicked from the av?
---
Good question!, i'm not too sure i'll test it later :)
---
Wow that comeback.
---
He said it sounds like satire and you go straight to insulting. Makes me wonder if you're not worse than that guild you've mentioned.
---
Ok :)
---
Or just do what i do, if we are still waiting for raid to fill up, automatically trade a stack to priests. You can split one stack into 2 if you want to be more efficient. This way you get free fort buff, &amp; get in the good books of the priest (heals during dire situations).
---
And that's a wasted evasion.
---
You got extremely lucky.  With that said, the drop rate isn't as low as people think either.  One guildie I helped got it in 7 kills, another 2 hours of farming, another 3 hours of farming, and a third we farmed 4 hours one day and 5 the next and never did get it to drop and had to buy it.  So that many in that time span is ridiculous luck, but it's also not *that* rare either.
---
Yes. There's plenty of characters of all levels in azeroth
---
ive done 546 jump runs 2 man, at ~7200 gold earned, at 5 jump runs an hour thats ca ~65 gold per hour. thats 2 man. so dont spread horse shit that you make ''100 gold each for 5 runs'' as a 3 man team.
---
What's wow 2.0 and what's this have to do with it?

You might not have good DW fury warriors. I'm a solid 300+ DPS higher every fight than our token 2H fury.
---
shhh
---
this is reddit, EVERYONE hated the world PVP phase and no one was looking forward to it or enjoying it. Everyone was an alliance level 55 getting ganked over and over and there were no level 60 players who had been looking forward to a big messed up pvp phase.
