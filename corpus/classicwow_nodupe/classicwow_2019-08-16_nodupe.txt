Of course ret is good in retail, everything is good in retail. Every spec is basically the same thing.

Lifestone was my first epic. Never equipped it, because I wasn't sure if I wanted to sell it or not. Eventually equip it, stop playing vanilla days later.
---
TBC and Halo 3 that year! Went to both midnight releases, was a great year.
---
My children are watching spongebob next to me and I heard the music and thought the tv was playing through my phone
---
As someone who has been struggling with what spec to play for shaman, so far enhancement seems like a a leveling spec that turns into a meme. Elel better for pvp, and if you are gonna raid heal why not just go deep resto?  Though will probably still be able to get into a raid group regardless because totems are so strong.
---
What addons should I have for classic?  TBH I need tomtom(quest tracker) and the dps tracker.  Anyone got suggestions?
---
[removed]
---
I personally would really advise against such a module. Yes, that means you may not have quests, but the wonder by itself would be good ;-)
---
I am just waiting for all the crying to begin.  Lol
---
The memes on this sub are straight fire
---
Agreed MC only took a few hours to clear when grouped with decent players. A casual that might be able to squeeze in some extra time on weekends to join a group will be fine.
---
&gt; I personally want to know what the layering backup plan is now that Herod will most likely be overfilled for much longer than anticipated.

---
How do you think you know that?
---
Already reserved
---
The guy that died playing WoW was in China...
---
Jo, sehe ich ähnlich
---
For me, in the stress test, all of the Details plugins were broken. So things like damage and healing worked, but threat did not.
---
Uhhhh what?
---
So to ensure I’m clear: if I sub, I will be able to access the option for to download he Classic version?
---
Try the swim instead of the run. Much more pleasant and definitely faster. I prefer drowning and rezzing in Dun Morough. It's quick trot and tram to Stormwind from there.
---
You should ask some questions about those issues then.
---
624 hours God damn
---
Buy spells/ranks conservatively, only buy what you NEED for leveling. Pick a gathering profession or 2. Grind a lot. Vendor everything.
---
Should I roll hunter or mage? I'm caught right in the middle. I've played both in pvp at 60 (instant 60 servers) and enjoy both play styles. I love the utility each class has for dungeons and leveling. I want to experience all of the raid content eventually though progression but is not my main concern. I'll mainly be focused on pvp even before phase two just because Its a ton of fun to me. I have more experience playing hunter on p servers so I perform allot better between the two. I'm still getting there on mage but getting better the more i practice and I think I could easily be just effective at both. I know on official servers freezing trap and scatter will share drs, which hurts hunters allot in 1v1 but not too much in group pvp. Being able to defend myself from ganks in wpvp is obviously very important. So at this point I just want to see what you guys would pick and why. I want to just stick to one til 60 and not end up jumping between the two.
---
Someone make a STV playlist
---
I'd never bring a ret to a raid. Raid as holy and pick up pvp gear like everyone else.
---
Shifting cloak does not require an AQ reagent, it is phase 2 tho, same with hide of the wild...
---
Have you considered going enchanting first?
---
I really REALLY recommend AGAINST doing this. Yes, you could use it but the problem is that the majority of the Classic charm is that you're not getting free info on where to be. By using the mod, you're removing a lot of what makes it good.
---
Not really 
---
The same 1 maybe 2 mechanics but sighly faster kill times
---
Sp50 definitely got the priorities straight
---
These events still happen unplanned all the time. Of course, you'd most likely have to be on an RP sever.
---
Yupppppers.
---
Welcome brother Gnome. Ignore the naysayers, you have made a wise and noble choice.
---
Can you prove this?
---
That‘s my fetish
---
Those raids are still progression. It's not like expansions that make previous content null.
---
There are always alts that need gearing, new players, etc.
---
The content will always be relevant until everyone stops playing.
---
Um thats not how WoW works. There will ALWAYS be guilds forming. My Guild will run MC ZG every week for 2 years.
---
What are these things they’re saying that are so egregious? The blacklist shit was shitty for sure, but can you elaborate on what you mean? Also, that bit about how people that have an abrasive on stream persona using it as a cover for being shitty people is pure speculation, and a huge leap.
---
If there is only 5 US pvp servers... YES
---
There are always new raid groups being made with people that have rerolled, or were slow levelers, or just a group of people that couldn't get into a raid group running regular Pick Up Groups or something.
---
Everyone will be fine.
---
Ye I login once in a while to look at my characters.
---
Yo thanks so much!
---
I've taken everything you said into consideration for future content. IN regards to advertising my streams, I had to put in my method and formats for the project into the pitch vide, I wasn't a fan of how it came across either :P
---
Premade battles are the real deal and gear based off progression for big fun. Res gear or whatever it is call now (quit during wrath) is a joke. Purest pvp form is vanilla and the best imo no gear giveaways. Makes you play the whole game to get nice stuff or go for rank 14
---
Well I know that they can do Terry Crews he says he's a big fan of World of Warcraft, even owns most of the collectors editions.
---
Honestly, the most frustrating thing is the res timer when it caps at 2 minutes. That’s what breaks people. Standing over their corpse for two minutes or longer, until it looks like the coast is clear, only to die instantly.

Not really if layering is as bad as shown on streams and explained by blizzard

Ruins wpvp this is true
---
Itll be fine. I was an altiholic and didnt get around to raiding MC or AQ until about six months before burning crusade released. It was a great experience overall.
---
Well yeah, but those alts and new players are going to be funneled into existing guilds, to be carried into higher gear by people who have been gearing for 2 years.

Pathetic. I’m over 9000.

Depending on layering it will be packed regardless of where you go.

Only way you'll get ahead of the pack is

- being one of the first to log in

- spend an unhealthy 30 hours straight at launch 
---
:)
---
Well, actually i do not need such kind of addon at the start, i could do all the quest in a given zone, continue to the next quest, to next chain, etc. but eventually after reaching 60 and questing in every zone, it is not possible to be a completionist without checking everything has been completed.

If you change one thing, there will be something else that people will feel very strong about needing to change. And it'll never end until we end up with something unrecognizable and the fight to have official legacy realms will have been for naught.
---
The point of this project is to experience the game -as it was.- Not to go back and tweak it to be a better version of itself. 
---
THAT BEING SAID. I am 100000% for SEPARATE Classic+ servers, where they can experiment with tweaks like this/new content/new special events etc.. 
---
But Classic needs to remain just that: Classic.
---
That can't be right!? Can iiiit!!?
---
The population will drop.
---
Won't be out
---
Obviously it was a very shitty move to shore up short term investment and milk bonuses for the execs who got rewarded for thinning out the company by 5%.
---
Bobby Kotick is a parasite on the game industry as are most of the top level execs in these companies.   Blizzard post Activision acquisition is a shell of what it mean to be Blizzard before.
---
Same with Bungie being acquired and then freed by Activision.
---
Huge companies are not needed nor beneficial to the game industry.  But most will sell out short term for that capital or payout and let their business become a money farm for millionaire execs.
---
yay
---
I'm playing there because I think it will be a fun and really unique experience. If I want I can roll on one of the fresher servers.post launch for a more authentic experience. But a server where a few people can whip up massive events pvp and pve related is something we've never seen on this scale. I think it will be a super unique experience not just for wow but for gaming in general.
---
And what's wrong with that? New players can create or join a fresh guild that needs to gear up.
---
Gaming culture is too different now. I feel like this is an occurrence that will be lost in time. You went from working men who loved WoW as an escape (professional closet nerds) and actual nerds who were passionate about their small community and the MMO genre. They were trailblazers and all of this was exciting and new. Now everyone plays games -- gone are the intellectual nerdy adults and in are the kids who grew up on edgy memes and Fortnite. I'm saying this as Gen Z person too, although I played WoW since Vanilla as a child. Just my observation.

Awesome. I’m very intrigued!

I guess it comes down to if you enjoy fighting it out with other players in the world (chose PvP) or if you'd rather have that be optional (chose PvE). Alot of people feel that PvP adds a level of excitement to the game but it can also be a bit inconvenient to be killed while trying to quest. 
---
Than there is roleplaying variants of each. RP is a PvE server with roleplaying and RP-PvP is a PvP server with dito.

If you decide to roll zandalar tribe on horde faction let me know if you need some help in game. gl

Lol didn’t realize my comment would generate so much butthurt from so many people.

No. Guilds progress at different paces. There will always be guilds just getting in to MC.
---
Yes. It works similarly to Mortal Strike.
---
You don't need 5 days played in ideal server circumstances
---
Yeah
---
So why is layering needed?
---
How does he already have epic mount?
---
Big mood
---
There will always be people with alts wanting gear so there will always be people doing older content.
---
Immersion never came from lore. It came from the mechanics and open world. We aren't playing because we care about makirk's wife. We're playing because we actually have to run to get places, we actually have to talk to accomplish things, the world is trying to fuck us up rather than a world made for us to fuck up and we write our own story rather than following cutscenes of over the top fantasy knights with anime hair and backflips.

It’s not as friendly as you’d think. There’s orcs in these woods.

I’m hoping I can force myself to read quest text.
---
You could just read through the bottom part of the quest to know where to go and what to do. Most you had to do is skim through the text. Probably a very small part of the playerbase actually read the text to understand the quest chain.
---
!remind me 13 days

Yes because creating a new guild is so easy when 95% of people are already locked in and new players are going to be funneled into established guilds.

Vanilla is different. Attunements usually require you to finish the previous tier before you can start the next.
---
The optimal profession guide for mages:
---
The exact proffession vary on your gold making method. Generally you have 1 gold making profession and engineering. I don't know what's gonna be best, safe bet is to start with skinning and find out whether mining or herbalism is good for you. So, start skinning and save all your cloth. At 60 you buy all the cloth you need to skill up tailoring and get the archmage chest. Then you abandon tailoring immediately. Now you find out what gold making profession(skin/herb/mining) is best for your gold making method. You can rock 2 professions for a bit while you are working on prebis and gold. Then you abandon the worst one and go engineering. Now you rock engineering + gold making profession until ZG comes out. At zg you remove your gold making method and get tailoring to wear bloodvine. Now your new gold making method is aoe farming crocodiles, this is great money and requires no professions. Later you can drop tailoring when wearing 3set bloodvine isn't worth, and go back to something else.
---
Yeah - just take it as it comes then, be efficient while questing if speed is your concern but very very few will be "ahead of the pack"
---
Have fun papa!
---
1v1 mages have a hard time vs druids in vanilla, the only way they can beat them is through attrition and keep kiting the druid until he's oom wasting mana trying to catch up to him from shifting in and out. Even then it's really dicey as the mage should be holding off from doing DPS to conserve his own mana against the druid.
---
Stress test had 60k concurrent. As in online at the same time. And theres no way people think a stress test is near representative of the pop. N ost return stress test had 1/3 of the players that consistently played during bwl patch, nor thdale stress test had 3k peak when it held 11k during bwl patch.
---
Every hunter is a weapon hunter
---
Exactly like N dales launch. 12 000 people playing on the same server at the same time. Dynamic respawns worked perfectly.
---
Krol blade dropped for me while getting help with a quest and the other person won it 😭
---
Sigh I feel old AF because I remember these commercials like they were aired yesterday FUCK
---
Tbh stress test was just fine for the most part.
---
If you haven't already practiced a route you're basically boned. The zerg isn't too bad though assuming the same effectiveness of dynamic respawns we had in the stress test.
---
Non shadow priest will get wrecked in wpvp solo. He can kite and prolong the fight but its a downhill battle.
---
I'm not saying it's unfair, I'm saying that acquiring new players is going to be very hard for vanilla and the population is going to be unsustainable after a couple years.
---
Papa Gates personally tends to your health, while his hype man Ballmer screams incoherently in the background
---
Valid point. I played the entire time during BC but I was still technically a clicky noobface at that point. Didnt get into raiding until LK naxx, and going back and face rolling heroics with a 120 demon hunter in BC didnt really give me much of a challenge lol. Some goofy fucking gear tho
---
Oh man, my heart strings! But I'm pretty sure I got a ring that I used for the next 15-20 levels.
---
This wouldn't be my first large-scale launch for a vanilla server, but I do fear that official will be 3-4x the scale of those. Due to that I expect some of my old tucked away spots to be contested when they never were before. IT should be intersting.
---
Bad. It used to be hard as hell to communicate cross faction. Now the mafias will be able to exist here on Classic.
---
Don't worry, it's called edging. When classic drops you'll blast off so hard you'll have a hole in your pants.
---
Wait what? People do that? Shiiit

You lost me at "You rolled. You won. You were bitched at to equip something you fairly rolled for and won."

Choice between leveling ele shaman or feral druid. What's your best argument for druid over shaman? TIA.
---
Storyline is a similar add-on, both have their pros and cons!
---
Its a little time capsule.  I even  have some hand written notes and bookmarks in mine.
---
Like, it's the whole idea and visuals of elves, not drow elves or dark elves, traditional tall, pretty, fair skinned elves fighting alongside orcs, trolls, and even *the undead*, against humans dwarves, and other elves.

Are you talking about adding an icon to your Reddit account? I’m not sure exactly what you’re asking. :)

Love me some goulash, but Unicum I can do without.
---
I have 12 alliance characters and 7 horde characters (different servers) that are max level.  I have two projects I'm working on...getting to exalted in Mech and Naj, and also getting everyone's professions to 175...or better in some cases...
---
My route is practiced and refined to 25. After that I'm a victim of joana's guide syndrome. However, I feel like some of the quests that were worth toughing out the bottleneck -- are going to be now not worth toughing out due to even a larger bottleneck.
---
My first character was a hunter who I got to level 40. It wasn't until I quit playing and came back that I realized I hadn't used a single point up in my spec...
---
He didn't actually quit, he was fired for spending more time with his children since Blizzard wanted a class designer without a family so they could put all their efforts into WoW. Work/life balance is sadly not a thing in game design.
---
He is a brilliant man, Kevin. Highly recommend his stream.

He's also telling people to avoid food and water in favour of breathing. We got us a real medical professional here boys

I doubt that Stalagg is that populated just from the discord. The discord shows 370 horde and 434 Alliance.

lets see, one position is about being skeptic instead of naive, your position is: "sToP WhInInG AlReAdy, iT'lL bE FiNe". You and your position are stupid.
---
You are a bit slow... and preaching to someone who knows everything you are trying to say......
---
Private servers have huge corruption issues, longevity issues, critical bugs that are still hotfixed and patched today and they are hosted in fucking EU and Asia...... so like I said they quite literally cannot compete in quality even if you prefer the old graphics.
---
I do not care what you make...... the point was open ended and should be understood by any adult to mean that no one gives a fuck about 15$ unless you are already well below the poverty line...... in which chase you shouldnt be on this reddit and you should not be playing Wow at all......
---
It seems like you do not even know what layering is in its current stage.... and while I do not want it or like it.... you seem to be in the dark as to what it even will be.
---
Yes, I said that.
---
Please stop trying to hold a discussion, if and when you do not have anything insightful to actually add or discuss.... it is boring and a waste of time for both of us.
---
Layering sucks, but will be removed by the time I am bored of farming MC......., private servers for vanilla are dead in the water until further notice........... life moves on.

It's dps you fucking scum. Welcome to the blacklist

Player created events were some of the best experiences I ever had playing WoW.  So, I totally agree with you on that.
---
Yes and make 3 characters for name reservation.
---
I say dps out of habit, but damage dealer makes way more sense.
---
"Looking for damage per second!"
---
first tip, don't go to stv at level 30, try for level 34, there are other questing zones, and even grinding a bit is worth over getting camped, unless of course you're going there for the fight
---
I was considering for the heart of the mountain (265 enchanting?) with that nice armor and resist, but would essentially lock up my trinkets. Mostly though, for my first character on the server, I can't imagine investing all of my money into as well as not selling rares to get that one item. Seems a bit hard to constantly market services to make any money with it in order to maybe make a tip, because all mats are somewhat prohibitly expensive.
---
Really isn't that much interesting story in classic anyway tbh.  No cohesive story etc.  That's one thing retail has improved on imo.
---
The speculation of when phase 2 hits is based on Blizzard's indications.  I wouldn't say they're prophecizing.  Just extrapolating.
---
I mean if you've practiced a route to 25 you already know exactly which quests are bottlenecks.

Fedex questing is a meme propagated to push people out of starting zones so everyone else has an easier time leveling while you're wasting your own time
---
Aznamir is showing no interest at all in porting PallyPower.  I hope someone will pick it up.
---
Decursing manually isn't so bad once you get used to it.  Lucifron and Chromaggus will break you in.  It's no worse than whack-a-moling with Flash of Light.
---
That on pvp servers is why dungeon grinding will be so popular.
---
Even though I think 90% of groups will fail at dungeon grinding :)
---
Keep in mind we aren't going to see phase 3 until early 2020 so there really is no reason to blitz through to 60... of course people are going to say "gold and market" but who cares - if you play long enough you'll make plenty of gold.
---
When I go to my user settings there is a place to add a banner. I add the banner and the next day it seems to disappear. I did not know if maybe using screenshots were against Reddit tos.

Here's my experience, taking Ele LW as my profession playing a druid on a phresh server.  
---
I leveled up the profession as I was leveling, and in phase 1 [Living Shoulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19061/living-shoulders) is one of the best shoulders for druid, paladin &amp; shaman. I made a lot of money selling these for 3-4 times what the mats cost me from the AH (no one is really using Living Essences early on so they're cheap)  
---
Another great item that sold for much more than the cost of the mats was [Helm of Fire](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10632/helm-of-fire) which is an amazing helm for any rogue/druid looking to gank (~300 damage ranged finisher) with a level requirement of 45 to boot  
---
The main appeal of Elemental Leatherworking is ironically that Tribal Leatherworking is a lot better, so you're as rare as a shiny pokemon since everyone goes Tribal specialization (often resulting in good tips from people wanting stuff crafted)  
---
Past early raids Elemental Leatherworking falls off HARD though, and the more the server progressed with content, the more I wish I had a more useful profession like Alchemy or Engineering.  
---
If you like feeling unique and get added to a bunch of friendslist as "that one guy who can craft some specific niché items" then Elemental Leatherworking is for you, but if you want to make money past the first couple of months, I would steer clear of the profession.
---
"Ugh! It's hideous!"
---
Something like that haha. The community is just super toxic too and I get toxic and don't like it

Um, yes it is? Naive can mean having a lack of experience, and he made that decision based on lack of experience.

There’s no best argument. Both are good and fun to play. The biggest difference is probably the burst potential. Elemental Mastery and some of the other Elemental tree talents make you able to pop off and really blow someone out of the water. Druid is more about grinding people down. Druid’s have a lot more flexibility and can stealth. 
---
Either way you’ll be doing just fine.

i was agreeing with you but go ahead and blacklist cause i dont wanna grp with scrubs

Additionally, you won't be pissing off tanks in places like Nazj and Mech who are actively trying to tank the mobs.

Agreed, I know I'm gonna get downvoted but dual spec in classic would be so nice

It can't be entirely relative, everything is full other than like 3 servers at medium. They must have some hard threshold built in.

The nice part of classic is... none of the content truly becomes obsolete.  There's always a reason to do the older raids; usually legendary gear or quests, plus a lot of people have alt guilds that level up eventually.
---
I never leveled alliance so I’ll have to look to see what zones to go to at certain levels, but there’s no way I’m following a step-by-step guide.

I would keep a dummy character on Herod if you think you might ever want to play on Herod.  Blizzard may lock it after launch when even more people pour in.  If you don’t already have a character on that server then you won’t be able to create one.
---
I have 2 on Grob (where I intend to main) and one on Herod just in case I ever want to roll on Herod I will have the opportunity.

Actually no, the loot is generated when the mob spawns.

I dare you to find jasperlode mine when the bottom line says “fully explore jasperlode mine.”
---
I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
&gt;being able to go tank a dungeon without visiting the trainer twice and paying what after a few times amounts to a king's ransom.
---
The point of the cost was you weren't visiting the trainer constantly.
---
People got reputations as tanks or healers precisely because they weren't switching constantly.

Still makes it a repost though, right?
---
Warrior 100%
---
You are either totally forgetting how much DPS pets actually do during the leveling phases.... or have very little experience with leveling a hunter at all.
---
A single growl at the start of a fight, followed by continued full focus dump and attacking from pet will not pull aggro on mobs you should be killing, This is of course taking exception to the rare double crits.... which hardly happen when your crit rate is sub 12 for a large majority of the leveling phase.
---
I mean more like would people have a game chat that breaks the fourth wall; should I use x spell when he does Y?

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [What Should I Play Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread.

---
Yeah that would be nice. It’s the same game in gameplay and doesn’t need to have the same old models when better is avail.
---
No. The words you put into my mouth are stupid. But those are your words, not mine.
---
Yeah, I've thought about this \*a lot\*.  Vanilla was some of the most fun I've had (over a long time scale), and that good memory sort of pushes me to play.  I'm still not sure I'll play to 60, but I'm gonna give "casual wow" a ride.  If I let myself go hardcore, I'll probably toss away all my friendships in the process.
---
My past habits with wow were definitely destructive to my life as a student.  With that in mind I purposefully decided not to take any time off from work and not join a guild ahead of launch.  If I ever hit 60, I'll be far enough behind that being "competitive" isn't much of an option.
---
Seems likely that I'll just stop playing because I don't really enjoy the game much if I'm not hardcore, but hey we'll see how it goes.  Maybe I'll just log in and do an instance or BG every now and again.  Level mostly on rest exp.  Dunno.
---
Yeah, I miss this guy.
---
Sweeping strike, slam, Berserking stance. All the goodies at lv30
---
Isn't whitemane full as well now?
---
I'd recommend everyone play 1-60 without this first, it's far more satisfying to adventure on your own instead of have the game basically play for you. Not sure if it will work with Classic but that Immersive addon might be a great one to use for your first run.
---
Thanks, tips. Anything else you'd like to shout while you're up on your soapbox?
---
Very expensive to craft/buy but yes.  A very good Blue BOE!

I'll ask if you'll be able to farm Zul'Gurub bijous and coins equivalent to how you were able to in Vanilla, as a mage with the current state of melee leeway.
---

may i ask what this is all about? i think ive been living under a rock
---
Awesome! Getting your order ready buddy.
---
Id like the entire world all doodads, objects, actors, whatever. Id like it all to get new textures.
---
I want the same models in the same places, but new 2019 textures would be dank. Sort of an SCR treatment.
---
Thalnos &lt;3
---
I don't recommend leveling as Ele from the get-go, Respec to elemental at level 40, but before that you'll struggle to keep mana and kills mobs efficiently for leveling. It has to do with the way the talent points are set up.
---
For me about half the people had that old school attitude. There were others that wouldn't say anything and just drop group.
---
My plan is to go herb/skinning until 60.(probably after I get my epic mount).   Then drop one of them for enchanting.  Then solo low level dungeons to power level enchanting.
---
Lol pvp
---
I have an outfit I wear to events, Black long sleeve shirt, black pants, white Ivory tie, and black fedora...I've been told I look like a person from a movie.  I was at a horror convention and they had a costume contest after hours...so I asked if I could enter...I was in line with a bunch of mosters.  when it became my turn and I stepped forward on the stage they asked who I was, I said: "I'm Harry the Horse from Guys and Dolls."  Everyone applauded...I'm guessing no one knew who I was, but clapped so they wouldn't look like they didn't know...lol
---
What a hassle.
---
Phase 2 is 100% in 2019.
---
It adds so little.
---
Only way phase 2 gets pushed to 2020 is if server pops are too high and they don't want to offer free transfers to dead realms at the time.
---
I'm basing what i'm saying off what Kevin Jordan, the vanilla wow class designer, has said about his design philosophy. In modern WoW you have to choose a spec...in Classic you have the option of dipping into each spec's talent tree which not possible in retail. I agree that classic's specs are more detailed and involved I was more pointing toward the idea that a class's in vanilla aren't divided into 3 specs and rather they can incorporate all 3 at one time.
---
Kids these days.
---
I didn't see Cata heroics (pretty sure I logged off at 83 and never logged back on) but from what I hear they were TBC-level difficult, which would have been great for me personally, but the WotLK-era player base hated them because they were not used to that level of difficulty. So they got nerfed.
---

Why? They can literally just do the run and level to 10 together. That‘s a couple hours they could be playing together, why wouldn‘t they?

Bottom text.
---
Maybe if the Druid sucks and doesn’t have good gear but that’s still not 10 levels. 10 levels big variation in character strength. Just go in a bg at min level and try to fight the 19’s or 29’s in the second bracket. It’s not really going to happen without help. Open world you’d have to have a massively clear path to kite someone 10 levels above you and them have the brain of a chicken.
---
Why would you need level 5 on your bank alt?
---
Do yourself a favor and replay War3 and TFT for maximum hype
---
Group finder as a way for players to find each other was fine.
---
It was the automatic matchmaking for dungeons that warped design.
---

---
That's a bit silly tbh
---
Yeah the name Hemorrhea is still available but i don't think its a real word. Haemorrhage is still available aswell, the UK Hemorrhage
---
I main a ret/prot pally and want to play Pally in Classic. Now, I don't mind healing, but I prefer being up in the fight. I know what everything does and how to use it effectively in groups. Is it really as bad and limited to Holy as people say or do I have options?
---
Barrens chat moved, now it's in the Barrens
---
Yeah, but like.. Why worry about reposts when you're on reddit? There are millions of users seeing reposts as new content all the time.
---
Hey I was in MalGanis! Swordfish from Myths fury
---
Not colorized
---
I mean anyone could play Classic that was 98% the same on private servers for the past 8 years (and many have), for free with about a 15min download. So yeah, the fact that the same models and text quest for TBC still exist in modern WoW means jack shit compared to actually having the game come back.
---
Luckily we live in the real world and you have more than those two choices.
---
I have Soylent for lunch most days while I'm at work, and have done for about six months. I've gone several days at a time having nothing but Soylent, it's fine.
---
4 or 5 would've be enough. I was a little upset about the fact that blizzard opened a new english one instead of one or two for german especially when some of the english server had the "new" or "normal" status... Lets see what in the next days will happen, I guess :(
---
Thank you!
---
Warlock or Hunter -- I guess? Pet classes tend to have more tricks and ins-and-outs.
---
Fear juggling and CoReck to bring fears back - Succ for the &lt;3 - VW shields &amp; insta re-summon. Warlocks would be my number 1 ranged based on fun-factor.
---
I'd like to commend the original authors of cWoW, mangOS, and cmangOS. Nostalrius gave the effort the big push it needed to enter the lime light
---
Yeah for sure that will be a thing. The 1.12 questie tracker should be in shortly after launch, and it will be movable. Might be possible to add a way to move the blizzard tracker, but I think its important to get the questie tracker in first
---
&gt; you’ll say BS or they were bad mages
---
He’ll say it because one of them will be true. 
---
I personally believe you, but the mages were probably not great. A T1 hunter beating T2 mages just isn’t mathematically possible, assuming equal skill level and consumables.
---
I mean, great is subjective
---
I think starting zones will be less populated, or as populated at most, in Classic because of layering. They've said they want layers to be similar size to vanilla WoW server sizes, which was ~3k players online. On private servers there was no layering so all 10k players at launch were in the same areas.
---
TBC heroics were so fun
---
I taught a guildie how to tank in Heroic Ramparts. Many many wipes later we cleared the place. So many memories of bonding with guildies in TBC heroics.
---
oh, I must have answered the wrong post...I was reading "What will you do until the game is up" or something like that...
---
Since on launch day the whole server will be bombarded with new players, mining and herbalism will be hard to  advance, considering all the competition. Skinning however is extremely good, because you can skin your mob that you just killed, and the Light Leather and scraps at low level help a lot if you just vendor them for money. You can actually afford most if not all your spells if you do this. Maybe make your 2nd prof Tailoring just to make yourself the 6-slot bags. Can drop either one later when you're OK for money.
---
whatever is in that pot looks delicious
---
This is accurate for raid content; you have some utility spells but it's mostly spamming Shadowbolt. Bosses can only have 16 debuffs, so it's really important to use those slots for stuff like curses, nightfall, sunders, winter's chill/imp scorch, etc. leaving shadowbolt as your main DPS.
---
In PVP, leveling, and dungeons? Dot to your heart's content
---
Some of the trash in The Underbog would one shot non tanks in heroic 5man, that is how overtuned it was. We used to do our own speed runs of the place, where we had timings and paths memorized to skip as much of the trash as we could.
---
Nothing is funnier to me than entrapment + frost trap as a Hunter on AV weekend.
---
You think that DB bridge is bullshit? I'm about to make it worse.
---
I'm mildly surprised that nobody mentioned the Stormwind Park! Then again, I don't think many people in this sub RP.
---
Me 2 man right after wotlk playing VAnilla private servers
---
Maybe this time something new will happen!
---
I just remade my char which has a three letter name on a full server, absolutely no issues as long as your quick you should be okay. Good luck bud!
---
As far as 40 man raid chats, I could see people using teamspeak or vent still. Discords quality really starts to suck after so many people in 1 call.
---
Waste of time
---
I'd say that Warrior and Rogue skill is mostly represented in what they're fighting.
---
Lmao
---
Lots of buttons, bars, and weapon/stance macros make vanilla/bc warriors a little tougher to play than some classes. I always thought of rogue as a pretty high skill cap class though.
---
If this catches some attention I could see it being a game changer for selling it holds true to the classics too as others have mentioned. Great work can't wait to see where it goes man!

---
If a class can heal you will be expected to heal, with that said you should play what ever you want but don’t be surprised when you are not invited to a level 60 group because you won’t heal.
---
I also want to know the answer to this question.
---
29 yo vanilla wow players finally coming back
---
it's been awesome as well as entertaining watching this subreddit grow. Each time there is a stress test or some sort of publicity and a new wave of people comes in you see the same questions or threads pop up for the 10th time. Overall the hype level is off the charts!
---
We formed a casual guild called Hoggers Henchman. Sadly, casual guilds don't last long.
---
Mmm probably mage.  
---
Hunter is fun because you have great movement and mobility, but your scaling is terrible, aimed shot/multi-shot/arcane shot are all very unsatisfying abilities for a rotation, and your pet is just an annoying pathfinding liability at 60.    
---
    
---
Warlock dots are shit, so you just become a goth flavoured mage with no blink or iceblock and worse aoe.    
---
Mage you get shatter combos, awesome aoe and great cooldowns like blink/IB/evo.
---
GodDAMN
---
Now that we’re close to launch we’ve come full circle with the “hype -&gt; slightly subdued hype -&gt; anger -&gt; acceptance -&gt; hype repost” cycle.
---
All of the people you hear saying rogue and mage are highest pvp skill cap are wrong - its warriors. They’re also the most terrifying.
---
-healing priest
---
Rogue with cooldowns has a huge skill ceiling, same with mage. Especially when fighting multiple people
---
awesome thx
---
Dude stormwage on a druid is meta. The shoulders are fucking MASSIVE lol
---
I can understand this. In the old days the German servers had a higher portion of RP servers than both English and French.
---
well ppl allready took some names..... literally .
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
It’s about the same, rogue takes a bit more planning before the fight.
---
They will have to add atleast another one per region before launch for good measure, considering they can't predict how many more people will come out of the woodwork on launch day.
---
&gt; I just see it as phasing being rather trivial
---
And I don't.
---
If it was done on private servers before 7/8D on fresh realms then it certainly will be similarly quick on live and the servers like Nost and Lights Hope had far more in the same areas due to lack of layering. Don’t deluded yourself.
---
“I’m a full on rapist”

I remember sitting in a 20 something degree parking lot waiting for Lich King to release! I was too young to remember the OG release but this is my fondest memory for me! Cannot wait!
---
mine's 2 letters :p
---
The only difference is that you'd have a Feat of Strength achievement to link tied to the old vanilla title, but yes. Other than that you can get all classic PvP ranks through RBGs, and at rank 7 or above you can transmog the entire grand marshal PvP gear.
---
That's why RP-PvP is the way to go! Even if you don't RP the player created events are awesome.
---
I hope they both enjoy it!
---
Do consider an alt because you will likely dedicate more time to the game then they are and/or they should do some solo stuff too if they want.  Trio leveling is awesome but a few little discoveries and even mistakes are best done alone.  Like maybe they want to wander up that mountain but feel like you don't so theykeep questing. But fuck it's fun to just ADD run up some terrain and peak over the edge in a solo everest climb. :)
---
Promote their own playstyles I hope!  I'm jealous my IRL that want to play are all veterans.  It's fun seeing a vanilla virgin light up at this wonderful world.
---
Why is there a big ass broccoli in the first scene..?
---
Did it the 1st time w/o add ons, pretty sure I can handle it this time.
---
Bind your ”A” and ”D” skills to strafe. The default is ”Q” and ”E” for strafe, gives you room to bind “Q” and “E” for other spells. I usually have keybinds like CTRL 1-5, SHIFT 1-5, ALT 1-5 and other available keys.
---
Use your hearthstone as much as you can, alot of times I forget to make certain Innkeepers my home but i always try to remind myself to do so.
---
Dps meters and threat meters are important for dungeons/raids, especially threat meter. 
---
And still, this is not a MUST to enjoy the game, classic wow has a great learning curve, you have lots of time 1-60 to learn certain basics and you’ll meet people along the way that’ll teach you 1 or 2 things.
---
I started with a human warrior...on alliance, I have at least one character of each race, and at least one of each class.  I also made at least one character with each profession...of course, I tried to keep the professions to those characters who could best use them...I have 12 characters on my allliance realm.  I also have a horde server with 7 characters, though I didn't necessarily take the proper professions for their classes on my hoard server, but each is a different race and a different class....I have created the new races from BFA but I haven't really played them much...mostly still playing the leveled toons...
---
I agree. I love helping people through instances! Just pay attention to chat, and take the advice they give you. A lot of people are kinda proud of what they know of the game and are more than willing to share.
---
Lmfao. Doesn’t make it ok or right? Using someone else’s properties lol.
---
Sir, I think it's the day our lives end lol.
---
That a skunk? :0
---
*sips tea from my seat in the normal servers* 
---
Let the peasants fight it out.
---
Is that a skunk
---
Hold up
---
Ironically, at the 40 second mark he discusses his day job
---
Nice ensemble.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
Personally most of vanilla's quests are go here, kill that, deliver this, collect that. Having some guidance on where to go means I don't waste time going to the wrong mob because I read the text wrong.
---
Even without a quest helper I'd just end up on Thottbot / Wowhead for half my leveling time.
---
I've leveled each of them a few times to 45+, and I would say &lt;5% of warriors are actually playing it right. 
---
That being said, once you get down stance dancing and learn to properly time your abilities, and anticipate enemy actions, it doesn't seem overly difficult. Rogue on the otherhand, just by virtue of the amount of options they have in abilities, it likely has a bit higher of a ceiling. Doesn't mean it is better or anything.
---
Woah man, save some pussy for the rest of us.
---
Yeah I have a descented skunk as a pet.
---
I can think of several worse things. Like playing a night elf.
---
Fair enough, to each their own
---
Yup. That’s my little Atari.
---
To my knowledge, they are both up there among the top skill cap levels
---
your floor is covered in shit bro
---
But having armor or not having armor doesn't make them prestigious.
---
Crazy do they actually make good pets?
---
Very good points. Thanks a lot
---
That means nothing. Only blizz has accurate info
---
Things will probably be a bit more crowded on official servers though.  
---
Don’t deluded yourself.
---
Depends on the scenario but I'd say Warrior for all the points listed in other comments but also rage management.
---
Wow these comments are toxic.
---
Absolutely!  Super smart animals.  Very mischievous but sweet and loving.  Like a very smart cat.
---
I was asking in hope there horde so I can feel goods killing them.
---
Don’t click, keybind. Invest in a gaming mouse, you’ll hate playing without one once you’ve tried it. Above all, make friends. WoW is not meant to be explored alone. Also, do research on classes before you pick, or you may regret your choice later.
---
Victory!
---
Yep, people think stalagg is gonna be "dead" but I can guarantee it'll be full on launch day and it'll probably become full before then
---
Epic skunk brah
---
Wicked.
---
I think it‘s because you can disenchant everything with even a rank 1 enchanting character.
---
weirdchamp looking at post history, but i  figured it was just my genes that caused it
---
And Stalaggs been out for what 25 hrs? Blizz seriously underestimates how many people are going to be playing classic.
---
Love it!
---
The fact that you once could acquire them early on in the game and no longer can does
---
Warlock by far
---
Ah so you admit you've never read the lore then?
---
lmao.
---
Typically you cannot be subpoenaed further than 100 miles from your abode or place of employment unless you purposefully availed yourself to the forum to which you’re being subpoenaed to.
---
Layering is meant to combat overcrowding, that’s the point I was making. It won’t be more crowded than the lights hope realms with 10k online around launch.
---
#Calm down
---
Unsure where you get the first one from to be honest.  
---
Having played both, warlock was more of a handful than mage.
---
I love this, and I want it. Thanks for doing this!
---
Can you make it also work with professions? It'd be great to set up a list of pot recipes and fees for crafting them (especially if it told them the mats for a "BYOM").
---
Balance is decent in PvP, moonkin is terrible however.
---
Great video. Thanks
---
Seconded.
---
I have zero issues with someone saying they're new, takes about 30 seconds to explain a boss. Takes a few minutes to corpse run because someone pretends to know what they're doing.
---

A lot more people had them. Most people traded them in when they offered trade ins because the armored ones are just a lot cooler.
---
Maybe, just maybe, he doesn't really want to be resto?
---
Except the fact there is no way to check server population apart of that random word in server list
---
Snooore
---
I didn't!  Thanks, makes more sense now...though following an Apocalypse Now reference with a Sponge Bob reference, just doesn't really compute.
---
on private server I have a lvl 60 hunter named "but" and he has destiny equiped.I did not know back then I could have sold that stuff rather than equip it.thou I ama play warrior this time araound.
---
For some people it's about actual nostalgia. Blizzard sure as hell seems to think so.
---
And I'm usually not a fan of the slippery slope argument but, right off the bat you throw in AoE looting and skinning as well, which is a pretty drastic change to the mechanics.
---
It's classic wow. Comments like that are the very reason people are so stubborn about wanting no changes no changes.
---
Before you know it you've got LFG, LFR and everything else which just makes it a slower version of modern wow with less content completely defeating the purpose of making CLASSIC wow.
---
Anything that's non-optional or affects gameplay needs to be unchanged.
---
I fully stand by my belief that the worst thing to WoW happened during its best expansion.
---
LFD ruined any chance of making friends with the people you grouped with.
---
I ran prot paladin and my buddy was a disc priest during Wrath.  Before LFD we'd go to Dalaran and say "LF3DPS chain heroics PST!" and find 3 DPS.  We'd fly the loop and spend time actually talking to the people we were with.  I made a bunch of friends (who quit during WoD) doing that.
---
In LFD there's almost never any talking.  You zone in at the front of the instance and just chain pull until the end.  There are no real mechanics you have to discuss and no down time traveling to the next dungeon to get to know each other.  There is nothing social about it.
---
Which will be 100% meaningless in Classic if that is the available mount.  It's like saying "the brown pony is better than the grey one!"  No it isn't.  They're both on the same vendor.  It won't make a bit of difference if they put the armored and unarmored up at the same time.  You won't be a special little snowflake.

---
Short answer is no,  the addon system is a combo of the vanilla and retail, specifically to prevent automation like this and decursive. I remember those days of everyone over healing because they were automating healing.
---
I doubt it's going to be that populated at all tbh. If it remains low pop maybe that'll entice more people to roll there on launch day instead of playing the server queue lottery, but we'll just have to see.
---
Then have to work longer hours, no time to raid. Backfire!
---
How would you do jump attacks? Pretty sure space bar is already part of my standard melee rotation.
---
As far as video games or chat rooms in general go, WoW is one of the nicest communities. Barrens chat was always pretty clean humor, memes, and general discussion... most of it quite silly. I think the generally good-natured aspect to the game is why there's a lot of nostalgia about it.

Or im underestimating my que time ):

if you struggle to collect $15 then WoW shouldn't be on your list of priorities anyways. I know thats hard to say because the game is so fun, but come on. $15... get your shit together.
---
The people that want them are people that missed out the first time around who want to pretend they are a special because now they have one... along with *EVERYONE ELSE*.
---
music had me crying /u/fullbusta
---
Undercity is underrated as fuck. I love that creepy place. So much shit to look at! A lot of lore too.
---
Names are locked to your account for 90 days following character deletion.

Yeah they are too goofy and happy (disney) and not enough minotaurs of destruction and carnage who can rip limbs off.
---
I'm going to be an ugly wyvern and you can't stop me!
---
They were made even more rare because they offered free trade ins for the new armored mounts and most people took it because the armored ones look cooler.
---
Offense and defense, so you brawl?

yes, just Leave off the rank parameter

/cast Hunter's Mark    &lt;--- Max Rank
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure "full" is just code for "go to a different server to even out the populations"
---
The pserver community does not say only warriors can tank and priests can heal. Pservers run druid tanks frequently, and all healers are taken to raids. Paladins are considered equal or better healers than priests. Get your facts straight before you hate boyo.
---
Yes. 3 pm Pacific, 5pm Central, 6pm Eastern.
---
Ugh, you're gonna make me type the whole thing out... Nazjatar and Mechagon.
---
Throwing the lever on inverting the sleep schedule for launch...
---
That's some serious shit!
---
You’re asking about a situation with two rogues but one rogue uses two weapons, thus a poison on each, so your question applies already in this case. 
---
Basically in most PvE situations, people use 2x instant poison. Because it’s obviously the best for killing mobs and also the best for raiding since you can’t waste debuff slots. 
---
In PvP, most people use double crippling, not because it stacks, but because the chances to apply it are doubled and you usually want to apply it as fast as possible. Now you can also use Crippling + Mind Numbing, for example, or Crippling + Wound or Instant but it is possible you won’t get the desired poison to proc at the right time. Up to you though.

---
I’d like to know why there weren’t any CST or MST servers. Also why no LatAm or BR server?
---
This is without the people not reserving their names too lol
---
I think people underestimate how many people are cool with paying blizzard money to shave off half their sub so they can get a chance at their name. Quite a few friends I know that will play said fuck that lol.
---
I can’t wait for all the kids who were never around during vanilla, to get on classic and realize how much harder it is. 
---
Like, I kind of wanna sit there and see how many try to run up and solo Hogger before realizing he’s elite.
---
I remember coming back to the game after a long ass break and being shocked at how much had been nerfed. I’m imagining chat being filled with complainers, and the rest of us laughing at them.
---
Yep. They are only cool if they are rare. If they aren't rare, they aren't really cool or prestigious. If they had them in classic, no one would care about them. You wouldn't be "cool and different"
---
This is false. It immediately reopens as soon as deleted.
---
I rolled a warrior to 60 retail and was not good. I just rolled a warrior on a private server and still have a Whirlwind Axe at level 52, rushing to 60 and still not good. 
---
I am being a dope by still thinking I should be a warrior? I die a lot!
---
You had 5 months to get the mount in vanilla. Unless you're a single boomer supporting 5 kids and at community college everyone would easily get it.     
---
     
---
Turning it into a fast levelling achievement by making it only available for 2 months would be a big deliberate change. #changes?
---
thats right ma boi
---
what’s the best class for soloing dungeons starting with deadlines? Would it be mage, hunger, warlock ? Or something else?   
---
This would be for mainly getting gear for my alts soloing dungeons respective to their levels, and for farming gold to be used for anything (higher level dungeons than Deadmines obviously).
---
Those aren't zones in classic so you can't blame me for not knowing what they are lol
---
Mostly from the Blizzard comments when they opened Stalaag to compensate
---
Man that’s a long question. To answer it: no. Going for difficult titles or accomplishments isn’t inherently toxic. When I say tryhard I’m talking about people who take themselves very seriously in game to the point of harming other people’s fun. Pretty much the same as your “blowhard.” When I say tryhard I mean it less literally than it sounds.
---
beautiful. i can't wait.
---
Run back to your corpse and keep playing. That’s a true warrior :P
---
Keep it up!
---
It's a waste of time at this point. If anything people have shown themselves to be incompetent enough to never understand it.
---
And just in beta? They definitely have to get more servers up
---
What is the meaning of this intrusion?
---
How dare you.  Female tauren are the cutest
---
Wouldn't there have been a fishing competition in the beta than on one of the Sundays it was open? Just wondering if there's any info on whether there was or not.
---
warrior is all about positioning and targeting, the actual "gameplay" is super easy. Rogue has some tricky mechanics and tight reflexes stufff.
---
My crappy laptop from 2008 ran WoW BC. I'm convinced a smart phone could run WoW classic.
---
It's different when it's official and the classic lovers are a part of it. I had a ridiculous /played and never once came back to vanilla via pserver. I have to assume the majority of people are the same, and here we are.
---
Once is enough, but might be per character.
---
Have you played Warlock?
---
That's pretty amazing.  What would be more amazing would be if there was some sort of link to this thing you've made.
---
Ragnaros can see the future of Azeroth where the world is engulfed in an elemental blaze... but can he see why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
---
YES thats it exactly
---
Teebu's was a big deal lol, that shit was on the box art. You were certainly a part of the 1% back then.
---
Lmfao xD I guess I'll buy it then
---
Step 3 is the hard part though
---
how many other classes have bleeds and poisons? (I haven't played in years so I don't remember) I feel like its just warriors and rogues isn't it? maybe hunters? 
---
I feel like getting out of movement impairing effects or stuns would be better and apply to more enemies.
---
I remember the gnome one being decent because it didn't share a cool down with the trinkets, but I never played vanilla so did they even have pvp trinkets?
---
I’m all for the time zone display... that makes perfect sense.  But no thanks on faction balance.  Would just make imbalanced realms worse.
---
Sounds like a cool census, wish I could see it.
---
Your spells/skills don't auto upgrade.  They need to be trained, and the new ones taken from your spell book to the bar.  There are uses for the lower lvl skills/spells in a lot of cases.  So you might use a rank 5 icebolt/heal/etc and a rank 1 icebolt/heal/etc in the same fight.  Thinking about things like cast speed and mana usage come into play so the highest rank isn't always the "best".
---
I don't trust anyone who uses an initial at the start of their name.
---
That will run WoW just fine. Can you build better for the same money? Certainly. But you will have no issues running classic on that machine at mid-high settings. Hell if your a #nochanges kind of guy or gal and run graphics at “Classic” preset it will be a bit of a beast.
---
Everyone gets Classic at the same time. It's just going to be Monday here while it's Tuesday elsewhere in the world.
---
What if your a representative of the business?
---
Yea that why I said “if everyone”.
---
Even after all these years I'm not sure I could have ever expected anything else.
---
What's really ironic is that I'm practically nostalgic for it.
---
!RemindMe 12 days
---
5min loading screens to dalaran was my jam lol
---
Nah, wake up at like 6.
---
Go for a run.
---
Have a nice heavy breakfast, with a little post-breakfast Indica I picked up the night before. Bum around on Reddit for an hour or so.
---
Extended nap from 9:00 to 4:30.
---
Game time, well rested.
---
Jesus dude, this man/woman may or not have had a family!
---
can you though? how many pro roller bladers can the average person name, if its more than 0 I would be shocked
---
Oh god the nostalgia!
---
From the line "you think you do but you dont" i have a feeling we wont let them drop anything
---
Idk if you have any interest in trying to build a PC but if you wanted to build a computer that could run classic Wow you could probably do it for like $200-300 if you head over to /r/buildapc
---
Smith's hammer here I come!
---
Barrens Chat always be teching for weapon removal
---
Damn, maybe I should just be a warrior and pretend my sword is lighting up.

Thanks man tbh I have no idea about anything computer wise so building isn't much of an option for me atm. I'll just probably buy this and upgrade as u move in and learn what I am doing!

Rad! That was really helpful. Gonna check those links out later.
---
I've heard about Azeroth Auto Pilot too, but in all fairness there are too many to keep track off. 
---
The real question is how well everything synergises, I'm trying to lay it all out on private servers, but I guess the actual classic client is going to be different.
---
It’s depends on what actions the business took.  If you placed a product in the stream of commerce that the business knew or had reasonable knowledge of the possibility of entering into the forum, then the business (or representative thereof) can be subpoenaed.
---
Classic+ is the only acceptable answer in my opinion.
---
You won't hit 60 over a weekend.
---
Don't feel obligated to get your first class to 60 if you don't enjoy playing it.
---
That’s literally how I played this game as a kid and it was amazing.
---
This was amazing and I didn't expect to laugh out loud as much as I did. Great work!
---
Thrall and jaina lead azeroth together, the factions merge. All zones scale to player level and cap is 60.
---
Sounds like more work than it's worth. Pass
---
The best class for soloing dungeons would be hunter or warlock, the best class for boosting/farming would be mage. Depends on what you want to do?
---
Damn, I had forgotten about Warcraft 3 reforged....

Paladin DPS/Retribution is also a meme. Paladin's do less damage than feral druids and probably do less than balance druids as well. Paladins are only good for healing in pve and for their heals and utility in pvp. Paladins having plate armor and wicked buffs make them possibly the most annoying class in PvP, but no one is afraid of them, certainly not druids.
---
TBH it kinda sounds like factions are a pretty pointless relic in new WoW.
---
You would think you took the wrong turn at some point because the ground is white but at a closer look you realise the ground is covered in bones. You try to log out before its too late but you get a red error message saying: "You can't do that while in combat"
---
In this thread, people who are neither marketing experts nor game developers pretend that they are both and complain about shit they think they understand.
---
I'll be shocked if they answer any questions about layering.
---
Pretty sure Richturpins most recent video showed him making a character on faerlina
---
you don't know? I didnt either. It was a pre Battle For Azeroth Event. Effin' horde burned the world tree to the ground. I should say spoilers, but, fuck, I cried watching that cinematic. Find it on youtube.
---
Man I knew I shouldn't have posted now I want to try again hah thanks for the info
---
You can run classic on a potato
---
This is plans for the next retail expansion?
---
I remember a buddy of mine used to farm shards in AB this way. People would come and he would just throw a few bolts and succubus someone and pick up 5 shards at a time.
---
How about rogue? I thought rogue went Combat spec for both PvP and PvE?
---
Surprised it wasn't blocked tbh
---
My first time reading this. What an absolute shit show. Did Woody Harrelson ever acknowledge the backlash of this AMA? Whoever answered the questions are so out of touch with people it’s insane.
---
You can still use it via the console commands.
---
Which server and which one you got ?
---
 I got 'Gj' on Gehennas.
---
Speculation on what could happen.
---
it was sylvanas
---
They gave people what they wanted yet people are still pissy about paying them for it 🤣
---
If they don't say "We're removing layering entirely" then I think we have every right to continue complaining.
---
Let's be honest here, Warlocks will still be underplayed. They've been one of the least popular on retail for the entirety of WoW. 
---
Sure there will be a lot more Warlocks in comparison to 2004, but I wouldn't worry.
---
Perplexitycya on twitch
---
Probably Tauren warrior with how long their leeway is.
---
Alright, looks much clearer on my phone.
---
I’m not really seeing the problem with this though. If I was planning on doing a dungeon while I was leveling back in the day I’d do it over the weekend when I knew I had 1-4 hours I could dedicate to completing it.  Dungeons during leveling aren’t all that efficient regardless from my understanding. It was the experience of completing challenging content with a group of people that you grew to know over the course of however long it took. Plus those sweet upgrades that gave you an edge over the competition for the next x levels.
---
Shit I comment on this sub every day and I'm not paying a sub until at the earliest the 25th.
---
LAWL I saw this guy this morning too was down near slacks creek :P
---
I just hope that the next time they open a server they give more than a 2 hour notice :/
---
Ah fair enough.  Yes I think the "wannabe" tryhard is the important distinction.  Those that do playhard are some of the best members of the community in my opinion!
---
Pick your guild wisely and you won't have to worry much about blowhards.
---
For What It's Worth - Buffalo Springfield
---
Rogue PvP specs are honestly all over the place. You got your prep specs, your hemo specs, your seal fate specs, your premed specs.
---
I'm sure something has been optimised by this point, but back in the day there were quite a few rogue specs that worked, Combat relied very heavily on adrenaline rush though, so it was the least used in PvP.
---
Warrior probably.
---
Ret pallys really aren't that bad leveling until you get to the later levels 50+. At that point it becomes painfully obvious how shit your damage is compared to everyone else, and then you realize you invested hours and hours into a mistake. Every time you log on, you see that 56 paladin stuck in Blasted Lands and you just can't bare to go on so you re-roll. Congrats! You just spent a month leveling a bank alt.
---
The only class that I know has an ideal PvP and Raiding build is SM/Ruin Warlocks. 
---
Frost Mages need to spec a lot in frost for PvP, while in Raiding, a lot of the deeper frost talents aren't helpful, and they should spec Arcane/Frost to maximize dmg &amp; mana efficiency.
---
Congratulations on being half of all the real dps and still below the bad players that play them!
---
Been waiting almost 7 years!! I knew back then they would eventually have to rerelease vanilla! It was inevitable!!!
---
Am i missing something? Don't see much being changed for it to be considered "even worse now".
---
If you get buffed and have a buff to give, buff back.

Don't forget to /dance.

---
MC is something that will typically be led by folks who've already done it in Vanilla. They'll give details on handling encounters over Discord or whatever so as long as people listen, it'll be gtg.
---
I just want to be good enough to raid and have people want to raid with me.
---
I've used Questie for a long time, even dropped a bit of cash on ya, but it irritates me that you're here plugging your addon in another developers post. Make your own for shits sake. It's not his fault y'all "only had one dev with beta." Shameless.
---
Cabin maybe
---
How is 1 extra casts before oom infinite mana? Sounds like you've got the reading issues.  No one ever said infinite mana...
---
A) I don't believe them.
---
B) This solves nothing. It's a hack that actually creates even more inconvenience. Imagine trying to get a group for a dungeon, but you have to filter out anybody who is not on your layer? It's terrible. Just separate the layers into their own servers.
---
C) Same
---
D) Stop pretending like the only alternative to layering is this. I'm so tired of this shitty argument.
---
These aren't "answers" to anything useful.
---
If you DO have a 60 friend to help though, it might be easier to get this done than WW axe.
---
Lulw they should just watch the Vurtne movies :P hes undergeared owning t2 players :D
---
Combat alone is the worst PvP spec for rogues. No control and completely dependent on AR and BF.  Once your crit is up to ~20% unbuffed, seal fate daggers will do well for PvP and PvE. Hemo is strong early in for PvP, but you will most likely not be allowed to raid with it. It does piss poor sustained damage and takes up a debuff slot.
---
Same - what I would give to have mystery around every corner.
---
Made my day! Thanks alot!!!
---
I would love a fully realized TBC. As much fun as expansion 1 was, I..
---
 Well hell, I loved everything about it except for the introduction of the Resilience stat and killing Illidan.
---
Regarding killing Illidan, I felt his part in the story was far from over. He seemed destined to have a rematch with Arthas.
---
Then he's brought back several expansions later via retcon (though a creative, carefully veiled retcon to Blizzard's credit) and so... What was the point? I've grown apathetic towards story developments in WoW since expansion 2. So this Classic business is a real solid move on Blizzard's part.
---
Well yeah but it's not the same as having a toggle for it in the settings or interface menu, which was it's planned development.
---
Thank you :) I'm hoping to come out with more guides in the future about Classic.
---
They’re gonna basically turn retail into the single player version of Skyrim. Also thrall and Jaina finally bffls.
---

Fire mage. No snares. All gas, no brakes.
---
Sunken temple will be quite confusing to those unfamiliar with the pre-Cata dungeon
---
People said that same shit about Fairbanks. It probably rolls over to full in a day or two. 
---
If I was a betting man I'd wager on more servers before launch.
---
Can agree on that one too. Went in to the discord to see what people were on the server. And first thing I am bombarded with is gore and racism. So ye the server seems to be filled with toxic kids
---
Yeah not sure what the problem is cause others are obviously getting a clear image and this is the only image that looks like this for me. Whatevs.
---
I haven't been a lore freak since the Orcs and Humans days, but I'll be taking it easy. I quit FFXIV to look for an RPG experience, or at least a social one. I expect 75% of my time will be spent fishing and talking in guild chat.
---
Not true, classic is on the modern bfa client
---
Ah, I see you're also a man of culture. Don't listen to Ondore's lies!
---
They don't use daylight saving time?
---
pfft.  Whale was +sta +spi, which for leveling was actually good for warrior. 
---
Spirit was a super under-appreciated stat always, but had a pretty big effect on downtime reduction.  Stamina had a pretty noticeable effect on health pool.  
---
Str and Agi had more visually noticeable impacts by making your numbers higher, but Sta kept you alive and Spi was secretly awesome.
---
The increased damage from Str made a super marginal difference to normal fight times, especially when you consider that you're overkilling every time.  You get lucky if you can shave one swing off a mob with a big swing in str.
---
On the other hand, a big swing in Spi actually made a noticeable impact on your passive health regen, meaning your time between mobs was shorter, when you got to the next mob your health was higher, you're less likely to need to sit and heal or bandage which also saved money, but you don't see that as bigger numbers showing up.
---
Now obviously in dungeons or raids this is irrelevant, but for general leveling and questing, Whale gear was actually good.
---
Oh shit I forgot about that one, yeah that one's probably the third one I'd dread navigating
---
I wonder if anyone has been scammed for names yet?
---
On the tooltip when hovering over an enemy, does the color change depending on how many of an item/kill/etc you have?
---
For example, Wastewander Bandit 0/10 shows red in your screen shot. Does it change to yellow or green depending on how close you are to completion?
---
Goldtooth
---
I don't think TBC is anywhere near as bad as you're making it out to be, and in my opinion it brought more solutions than it did problems. 
---
But if you're doing Classic, you should do Classic, and I think Classic+ is the most loyal way of continuing post-Naxxramas. There is much that could have been and never was, and while some of it came in later expansions, for the most part the game was too different by then to be comparable. 
---
I would have loved to see a Classic take on Uldum and Gilneas, without phasing or flying or a world reshaped by the Cataclysm.
---
If i could've tagged my names on Stalagg, I'd be playing there. I'm not too worried about the queues, they're just queues, and I'll be happy when I'm in. It's the high population breeding anonymity and trolling that I'm worried about. Like with ND, when the pop hit around 12k, there was a lot more shit flinging, because the amount of other people shit flinging made it seem non-incriminating.
---
So you hate shamans? Thats the only reason i can think of for you using that god awful movie
---
Yep it adjusts
---
You won’t be.
---
Played yourself my G. Same age as you. Been gaming since 88' Duck Hunt and Super Mario. WoW 2004-2008 hands down have been the best gaming experience of my life.
---
I really just want to play with all the old Paladin abilities we've lost like exorcism.
---
Iron jaw with the mad scientist hair.
---
Can someone ELI5 on and this is about, please?
---
If Illidan and Stormrage don't have queues on retail then I doubt Herod will either after the first few weeks.
---
I was a pally and after getting out of the starting area I didn't realise that I had more than 1 talent tree so I was fully holy playing like a ret.
---
Once I was around level 30 things were taking a while to kill, then I found not only other talent trees but also I had only being buying holy skills from the trainer. Then I ran out of gold and had to slowly catch up.
---
Good thing I got a free mount at 40 lol
---
On retail I got Sulfuras, Thunderfury, Shadowmourne, Val'anyr on Pally and Thoridal on Hunter, I also have one of the two Warglaives on Demon Hunter and I'm halfway trought Dragonwrath on Druid. No rogue to farm Fangs tho. Love them legendaries and them achievements :D
---
Noooooooooooooooooo~ 
---
=P
---
This was great, laughed 10 secs in and lost it when the quillboars murdered the priest, the screams 😂😂😂 ...10/10 the whole vid
---
I thought it was super dope and convenient for the 11 levels I used it during the stress test last weekend I was using an add-on with it called “Questie,” but it was my first time using both, so I am not completely sure which add-on was going what.
---
I recommend Azeroth Auto Pilot (and Questie) from that experience and plan to use them myself, but I couldn’t really compare them to Joana’s guide or anything else - I don’t have much/any experience with other guides or guiding add-ons.
---
Your graphics card should be able to get close to 144fps at max settings in Classic. Classic isn't multithreaded, so not having a lot of cores won't impact performance, however my experience with Zen+ is that the single-thread performance would sometimes hold back Classic from hitting 144fps. Overall though, you'll be close to what the monitor can support at max graphics settings.
---
I feel like they would want to do 3 realms (rp/pvp, Pve and Pvp) if they were going to cater to one language/region. And you have to take into account that that would be a large amount of resources to spend on a small section of the population. Especially because you have the spanish speakers in South/Central america as well who would get shit ping on a euro/spanish server.
---
Hopefully the devs restrict it more.
---
I can vividly recall WotLK's release night. Spoke with an old man also waiting, talked for hours. Midnight came, all four people waiting in our small Walmart got a copy (I bought the Collector's edition.)
---
Got home, so much hyyyyyyyype!
---
"Your computer does not meet minimum requirements."

---
CLASSIC GOOD, RETAIL DED HAHAHAHA
---
Am I doing it right, guys?
---
Lol not 1 month and not 5 months.
---
We'll see phase 2 in 2019.
---
Not only that, but just leveling now feels so pointless.  You level up, so does everything else.  It just feels like a grind until you hit max level to play the "real" game.
---
Joana already hit 4d 20 hours back in 2005.
---
Im pretty sure were gonna see someone real close to 4d played as first lvl 60.
---
If you want an easier leveling experience go with the druid. The only problem druid tanking is that you will likely not be the main tank in a raid, and feral druid raid spots whether they are tanks or cats are limited, they may want you to heal depending on how many people roll Druids in classic.
---
I’m curious just how long the queue will be, since all my friends chose Herod 😅
---
They really have been they would be better off to do this at this point... I have thought of it for awhile they really have done this back and forth to working together to war to much. I am not sure what would need to be done to live though to actually want to play it again.
---
My mate got Ra which is awesome because it actually means something
---
Blizzard doesn't speak Spanish so you must not be saying anything
---
***taps forhead***
---
I’m excited if anything.
---
False
---
The sad truth
---
The classic devs are the same devs that created retail. Why would you ever trust them in designing new content and not expect them to fuck it up. Atleast tbc is pretty damn good. Literally can't fuck that up.
---
Yeah you right. Druids have Atiesh.
---
Just level arms and don't worry about a tanking spec. Just keep a sword and board on hand with some stam gear and you'll be fine.
---
There are too many to keep track of and you aren't the only one thinking that:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/clwdkr/has\_anyone\_reviewed\_leveling\_guides/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/clwdkr/has_anyone_reviewed_leveling_guides/)

C'mon, we are not that bad.
---
Level as arms. You’ll be fine.
---
Chuck Norris.
---
im pumped to get a second shot at vanilla.
---
Shadow priest and warlocks are THE top tier in pvp. Warlocks win out just due to the utilities they have and aren't as mana strained as spriest. On the upside though, you can face roll your keyboard and win 1v1s as a spriest.
---
You're going to have a rough time getting gear for a shadow priest in raids. And any raid is likely to only bring one shadow priest. This is assuming you're in a fast progression guild and not a casual one which is fine if you are. You're also competing against locks and mages who do way more dps than you could hope to achieve. So any loot council is giving them gear before you. Honestly, like paladins, you'd probably get pushed into healing. On the upside though priest rank12-13 gear is great and Benediction/Anathema is fucking boss.
---
Kids went to Vietnam...
---
*Men went to Stranglethorn Vale.*
---
Priest mind control shenanigans though
---
Any word on Reforged? Cant wait for that.
---
I doubt they are gonna try to learn a new language just for a game. Also, there are people who are really really incapable of learning new languages.
---
That's like saying I'll be the best at high jump in the special Olympics.
---
It's actually me, played on silvermoon
---
These threads are obnoxious. Stop
---
The 99 cent eBay mic is authentic Classic though.
---
If playing at release don't get stuck on questing off the bat, find a place with mobs and kill them to level. Its fine to quest but at release there maybe too many people killing quest mobs.
---
Not all classes are the same. For leveling some classes are hard to level compared to others. Some classes do shit dps at 60 compared to others, and races also meana  bit more in vanilla than say MoP on. 
---
Leveling is far more of a grind than in retail where you just follow quests everywhere. Kill every = ish mob you see. 
---
A quest add on is still super nice. You could skip them if you just want to explore but sometimes the instructions are really bad. Other quests are in places you would never find without pre-knowledge or addons. 
---
Grouping is super useful grinding and questing. Only hunters, locks, or priests could be sad to be as well, or better, off solo.
---
So accurate
---
Did they release something current on the populations? I can't find anything
---
I want to play bear so badly, but I love dwarves and hammers, and Rez.
---
Have you seen HBO's Barry?
---
"That's not Flight of the Valkyries thats Flight of the Bumblebee."
---
AAP is very similar to joanas, but there were a couple of small differences and it’s easy to get tripped up with AAP, especially if you find yourself wanting to skip something in it
---
Rogues are ez mode for hunters homie.
---
Do blood elf and can you add maybe a class option to so u get the shirt and the maybe on the sleeve you get the class logo
---
Oh no... I read your replies and went to look it up... now I'm so sad... I guess it could be worse... but the zergfest av was barely a shadow of the old multi-day games. Bummer.
---
Why not consider warlock? Just curious because of your love for spriest.
---
Thanks for the great answer. I'm actually quitting a bad vice (devil machines). So if I don't touch them and just game I'll be winning long term.

The requirements are still stupid low (scroll down):  [https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-subscription](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-subscription)

The recommended GPU is from 2014 and the recommended CPU is from 2013.  One of the reasons that WoW has endured is that it will run on a potato.
---
there's a difference between overhauling them and making them balanced
---
You can easily make them viable only with number tuning, but obviously they need more than balancing.
---
And making them balanced/viable was the original topic

They will dodge all important questions and give half baked responses in lawyer speak as per usual for blizzard.
---
Horde or alliance?
---
I have never, ever found my way out of that place. 
---
The last time I floundered my way through it was playing Burning Crusade--I was a 50-ish Draenei mage grinding rep for a cat mount because I was sick of my elephant. The good part was, I wasn't dying; the bad part was that I couldn't find that last damn relic. Or the way out. 
---
There was one other guy inside--after we crossed paths I messaged him "I'm gonna grow old and die in here" and he offered to help. I replied "Nah I'm a goner--save yourself!" I finally found the last magic doohickey, and rather than try to find the exit I just hearthed back to Stormwind.
---
I sure am! You don’t get second chances very often, and I’m not going to waste it again.
---
Take a stand and stop the race.  Get in the way, back cap everything.  Slow it down.  Every game.  There are literally dozens of us!
---
Martin Sheen is bae
---
The same people that were defending "layering" are now going against it? How could you not see this from the start that layering and sharding are the exact same thing
---
You still need to add a separate subscription for this starter account right?
---
no the weather app said it's 96 and feels like 131.
---
Why do you like pet classes? Not that im against it I just want to see your personal reason
---
Hopefully will work through to newer races, but starting with the classic ones so far. We are trying to stay away from trademarked stuff so blizz logos would probably be a no-go sadly.
---
I can hear Battlefield 1942 theme playing.

---
Your playing on Private Servers, that is not the same community that will be playing Classic WoW. Most of them will sure, but they will have to adjust to the masses or they will most likely be seen as unfavorable players among most.
---
Fair point, but I read a lot more posts from people relishing the longer experience.
---
Things to add:
---
Private servers use the old officially released 1.12.1 compiled client as it was at the time, this gives them a lot of behaviour for "free" that doesn't need to be recreated, reverse engineered or modernised. 
---
Blizzard, for reasons stated in their Blizzcon panel obviously don't want to do that, they instead take the old  data and the source code for the modern client and patched holes where was necessary in order to create a new client that is the modern code running the old data. This is more ambitious and maintainable for them but requires more effort  to get right. 
---
The private server-side software baseline behaviour was partly written by analysing and reverse engineering sniffed network packets and has been an ongoing project for a long time, prior to TBC at least, it took far longer than Blizzard has worked  on Classic. These implementations were generally open source and versions for each expansions maintained by enthusiasts to work on off the shelf hardware and in a modern software environment.
---
Blizzard instead retrofitted their Modern server software due to the challenges of returning to a 15 year old codebase that was designed specifically for hardware, software and infrastructure that is not practical anymore. They have an advantage in that they don't need to reverse engineer anything as they had both the new and old software to look at, but their goal is also different, instead of attempting to match the interactions of the original server &amp; client they instead need to adapt the behaviour of the modern server and client to be more similar to the original. 
---
Behaviour is one thing, but a lot of WoW's design is simple behaviour driven by a lot of data. Private servers "strip mine" the official client for as much info as they can (collision data for example from which they build pathfinding meshes etc) then supplemented with previously data-mined info, that we generally believe was TBC era. It is then hand-tweaked for cases where there are gaps or where things are known to be incorrect, and then server-side lua scripts authored for some of the more elaborate encounters and quests. This wasn't done all at one, it was generally handed-down, project to project as it approached an acceptable approximation of the original product. 
---
Blizzard doesn't use any of that work, they build entirely on their archived 1.12 data as ground-truth, refitting it as necessary to work with their modern server software and then attempting to compare behaviour to a version of the official 1.12 client and server that they run internally. 
---
In short, though they both have the same goal they go about them in different ways, with different limitations and strengths. The work to create an authentic private vanilla is truely a community driven one, with limited resources but a lot of manpower and time thrown into it. Blizzards is a much more ambitious and professional approach, they have the resources they need to do it all from scratch in a reasonably time frame, and to a much higher quality but due to various factors, technical and legal, cannot just pick up from the communities work.
---
Did Joana make a new guide for Classic or is it the same one as before?
---
ah yes – weaponized autism
---
Yep, that's exactly what this meme is about.
---
Classic is bringing in more subscriptions then they’ve had in 5 years
---
Bind strafe to A and D is best way to move. Keybinds are whatever you find comfortable. There should be many videos of people explaining different setups you can copy from. I persoannly use a mmo mouse but thats a bit of a investment.  Some addons that i think are real important is ClassicCastbars which will let you see enemey cast bars. RealMobHealth which will let you see enemy hp. Recount which will lets you see you and your groups dps and other combat stats. VendorPrice is super useful as it will let you see vendor prices without going to a vendor. A threat meter is almost really important for group content. Aparently someone is working on one and should be around soon. My best advice is to find a casual leveling guild early on that will help you with any questions that might come up.

Iron jaw is BiS

"This isnt Flight of the Valkyries its Flight of the Bumblebee..."
---
If i could shadow create a character on the other realm to confirm my names, i'd happily reroll, but it doesnt feel worth deleting characters just to find out that the names are taken.
---
i dunno, i just do. 
---
it's fun to go around killing stuff with an animal/demon companion at your side :)
---
Thanks for all the replies everyone. I think I will just stick to regular questing!
---
How do I view sticky posts in the Reddit app? iPhone btw
---
were people hyped for vanilla? (genuine question since I was 6 and have no recollection of the internet at that time)
---
Yeah I realize that leveling will be easier if I go Druid but my main concern is tanking and potentially tanking in raids so I’d prefer to be a main tank.
---
Also, I’ll have a great group of people that’ll probably constantly be near me and will do runs constantly so leveling probably won’t be too bad...
---
You think I’d have a better time if I go the warrior route or Druid? Also I heard warriors are good in pvp or was that a lie?
---
Cata through warlords I played sporadically when I wasnt overseas
---
LET ME INNNNNNN!! LET MEEEEE IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Roll on an RP server. People can clown all they want, but they've always had the best communities in my opinion.
---
Definitely will be doing the same!
---
Esfand already beat you to it, bud. 🥶
---
Are half the people on this sub even old enough to shitpost that way?
---
Blizzard have the numbers and they have a certain threshold that the Spaniards apparently didn't meet it. That's just it.
---
Paladins &gt; Totem bot. Totally not biased btw
---
Which one of you is adopted
---
Mage is better solo but rogues are definitely safer in world pvp. Mage takes some skill - I think rogues do too but not sure if as much as mage. They're very mobile mages are. 
---
Rogues are a lot more class fantasy with their poisons and lock picking and pickpocketing etc. imo
---
Work at blizzard or be a streamer
---
I'm all for them adding all the things that were supposed to be in vanilla
---
You probably should have waited till august 26th to sub but whatever it's only 11 days you're missing out on.
---
Someone needs to seriously ask them what the server population caps will be per realm in Phase 2. That's seriously big information we all likely want to know.
---
But Im worried people will waste questions on dumb shit like "Is layering really gonna be gone in phase 2 like you **already told us it would be?**.
---
And we will get basically no new useful information at all. Just reconfirmations of old stuff.
---
&gt;Well I’m not sure what wording you would use
---
Like I said, "mid tier". I know I wouldn't use the word "terrible"...definitely not the lowest in the game either.
---
3 locks minimum for curses. That's not a lot, I get that, but they aren't nearly as bad as you like to paint them.
---
He's right though. The game isn't unplayable just because a lot of people are on a single server. Private servers have proven that. 
---
*However*, Blizzard is really packing a ridiculous amount of players into very few servers. I feel like they have very unreasonable retention expectations but I guess we'll see what happens.
---
Pretty sure most people here played Vanilla, so... maybe ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
They are starting to a little, the nameplate distance addon probably won't work
---
About the same in the EU, 4 full 3 high and the rest medium.
---
Back in the day I raided as arms, not private servers, live before all the optimisation, and I got a few bosses into Naxx, tanking as arms, being healed by enhance/ele shamans and feral druids, and no one batted an eye.
---
The elite guilds are likely to demand certain specs, but unless you're wanting to be at the pinnacle of clearing naxx early on, no one should care if you're slightly sub-optimal.
---
I don’t know what you mean by this? We play traditional sports all the time for fun and the rules hardly change. Why can’t you make similar game products and expect good results? If you have a proven product it’s up to the competitor to top you. Go ahead and innovate but don’t lose track of why the product worked.
---
You’ve helped me decide to stay a warlock main lol! Thanks so much :)
---
Warlock SM/ruin
---
Are human mages ok or do I need to go gnome? Playing on a pve server btw
---
2004? This was 3 years ago.
---
It covered nothing.
---
It's doable but there will be a VERY select few people that actually do it. You not only have to have the whole thing planned out but seriously no life it.
---
Oh god. I just realized that I quickly made all my characters on Herod as alliance. Will I be able to delete them all and create a horde?
---
When I first started, I asked someone how to get new weapon types and they told me "Weapon Master"  
---
I spent the next 3 weeks maxing out my weapon skills, including punching yetis.
---
Mankirk Alliance here also. It will all even out in the end, even 40/60 split isnt bad.
---
Lol my boy Chad at the end. 
---
Went to high school with him, he's been slowly grinding away at YouTube for years. Crazy to see him.
---
I'm right there with you, I'm starting my MBA in September and can easily remember the lack of dedication to school while playing wow. Obviously now that I'm an adult I can manage responsibilities but the urge to nolife will be strong.
---
They did say that servers that say "full" are expected to have queues at launch. That might mean a small 10 min queue or if lots of people flood in at the same time even hours. We will see.
---
Warrior for main tank. I think the Druid is underrated, but not that underrated. 
---
The Warrior is more complex and more gear dependent, but he has better mitigation. Also if you are the main tank threat isn't such an issue because you get the first choice in gear. If you get +hit gear for early MC your armor is negatively affected but your threat is greatly improved. In early raiding threat generation is an issue for Warriors, but quickly it becomes a non-issue.
---
The Warrior also takes more concentration Warriors have more skills and abilities in their tank rotations, more they have to pay attention to, and they are not great at multiple targets. But you really can't beat their mitigation.
---
I think Hillsbrad tends more towards big battles and raiding each other's towns, whereas STV is all about your throat getting slit behind a tree and nobody hearing your screams.
---
shadow bolt spam isn't exactly riveting. Can't run the DoT builds in classic raiding.
---
Maybe but in a decade I've never heard of it happening
---
*and our social lives will end

No it’s got legion being positive, it skipped BFA
---
Yes. It has always been like this
---
Yeah these so called software engineers are fabricating shit. Anyone who things this would be as easy as code rollback is delusional.
---
Tauren gets a green 2h mace from a level 8 quest in Mulgore, the one where you go into the mine to kill the Venture Co. mobs.
---
No need for sword training :)
---
alliance! though all my friends rolled herod so i'm probably going to have to as well, even though i don't want to. fairbanks will be bestbanks.
---
Lol I can already taste the salt that this meme will generate
---
In regards to sanc, While you get the 60% damage redux, but’s it’s hard to say if you want to just spam it to really have the reduction work into your encounter. You really need it for the fear brake and the damage redux is bonus to help you regroup on the fly. 
---
The trinket, while the defense is easily countable, the use is small but handy use only you the person would feel over time. Seeing it trigger from your POV, only you would really be able to gauge it. Hard to calculate. 
---
That’s sort of the fun of classic is all these weird procs can be powerful but un predictable
---
Ok but what you said was incorrect, Wow classic was not designed to run on a potato even if 2004 vanilla was.
---
Will warriors b as op back in vanilla wow in classic?
---
This is cool, thanks for working on it. My question is... when are the Thorium Brotherhood recipes available for those with the required reputation?
---
You mean like this?  http://classicwow.live/guides/992/classic-wow-addon-guide-how-to-find-install-and-update-addons-my-addon-list
---
You could also just look in the video description
---
Since you’re not interested in building your own, You should check out /r/BuildAPCSales before you buy, there may be other prebuilt rigs with better specs or value.
---
Layers will keep things to 3k across horde/alliance during the level experience. Private servers have closer to 10k. He isn't really deluded. Its been done.
---
I think a lot of this will go on early in classic as well, for a week or two.  People are thinking they need to rush 60, and have day dreams about how perfect things are going to go for them etc.  But soon after things will calm down and it'll get back to normal.  So if new players can stick it out for a while and get into the game without minding the jerks it'll be a great experience.
---
Consider this, most players on private servers pay nothing to play there.  They are toxic because a ban has little to no consequences for them as they can just create a new account or play on another server.
---
With classic, the players (even if they are toxic) have more to lose as they will be paying the subscription to play there.  So while you most likely will encounter someone toxic (all gaming communities have toxic players), the number of toxic players will be substantially lower.
---
&gt;level 1
---
What does ra mean lol ?
---
I love your character name.
---
Keep in mind that the name reservation is on every blizzard game's launcher page right now. So obviously people will get curious what the hype is all about
---
I highly doubt it that any of these servers will still have its current population 2-4 weeks into the game.
---
Especially when they leave the relatively gentle/generous starting areas.
---
IIRC this was a selectable option back in the day.
---
Yes, you should be able to do that as long as you delete them all.
---
&gt; Private servers have proven that. 
---
....what?
---
Private server launches were always hellish nightmares of 2000+ people in the popular starter zones, forcing you to just run off and get exploration xp just to level.
---
The most recent pserver only did well because it had insane dynamic respawns were mobs were literally respawning ~3 seconds after they died.
---
&gt;I feel like they have very unreasonable retention expectations
---
Blizzard's data on how many players created characters, played beta, played stress test &gt; your "feelings"
---
How do you feel when you're too close to your monthly bandwidth cap for another eight days and can't even play other games in that time (my situation)?
---
I want to play WoW Classic when it comes out but I've never played before. Where I can learn about the game? What kind of character should I make?
---
a 7.5 hour nap during daylight is not inverting your sleep schedule?
---
I feel there is a fundamental difference between private and live. But we'll see.
---
sounds delicious
---
And you pulled infinite mana out of yours.  Now you're getting it.
---
gnome is min/max, but the intellect gained is very minimal and not worth going if you hate gnome. pick for aesthetics because u'll be staring at that toon for a long fcking time.
---
Sounds kinky
---
I used myself and my class as an example. You’re going to have to work ten times harder to get comparable DPS. That was my point. No need to get defensive. I really don’t care what class you play.
---
GTX 1650 should be good enough, even if you are only getting sub 100 framerate at least you got some gsync to make use of.
---
My PC runs every game at 120 and when your FPS is that high my gsync is kinda completely useless, since it's optimal usage is somewhere between 45-90 fps. so either way you'll be fine.
---
better a totem bot than blessing bot
---
There’s also a mob in BRD that gives a 30 spellpower buff. But it lasts 5 minutes iirc
---
Nope. That is factually accurate.
---
u can only receive the buff one time and it is per group so u gotta have a shaman in each melee group
---
got upvotes, compliments, and even a salty troll who's jealous of someone who's just happy. seems like he figured right
---
...you’re obviously trolling. If you read the explanation I gave, it makes total sense. I’m done wasting my time with you.
---
please, do it, fraps it, make it ol skool wow video. black/white intro, closeup slowmo walking. full thing, artists, rides, noggenfogger abuse. i'd watch it.
---
There was a reason all the original developers of wow jumped ship when blizzard was sold to the triple A company at the end of vanilla.  They understood what was coming and moved on.
---
You will most likely be happier if you define the terms of your fun.
---
Its really more that you need go into it aware of the situation.
---
unless u are rolling a hunter, dps rotations are mostly very boring in classic. healing rotations are also pretty boring but you will be downranking your heals which provides some variety.
---
I'm confused on what you're talking about 60% damage reduction? Sanctuary is a flat damage block plus a thorns effect. I don't think you're aware of what the ability I am referring to is.
---
Also, none of this addresses my questions, I am aware of the proc rate of Force of Will, and I am not concerned about its proc rate, I am concerned about its damage reduction calculation.
---
Thanks mate. Super excited however it's also the most money I've spent apart from some flights so the buyers remorse is real today.
---
Large fat ass Tauren hiding behind trees always makes me laugh
---
I imagine 3-4 months for most phases is probably a pretty reasonable estimate, I could see them extending phase 1 a little longer than the others because of the time it will take for the majority of players to get to lvl 60. I’m sure they have a basic idea by now but they might change that based off of the speed the players get through each phases content.
---
Warriors are the tanks, paladin is a healer class, why would you give it taunt? Healer classes heal.
---
Good morning STVietnom!
---
Sounds like Alliance propaganda to me.
---
^^^you ^^^have ^^^some ^^^points ^^^though
---
Oh I was only able to decide on my main because I decided on having 2 characters. One solo and one with my buddy
---
In the in it's totally your choice. If you want pure, raw DPS I'd say go with rogue, but take it with a grain of salt. You'll have high competition for gear and is a very popular class to play. 
---
Druids are way more viable than many people give them credit for, but the best of the best druids are able to fill any cracks in a group/raid. There's tons of videos that cover it but for me, I'm rolling a druid because I don't want to be locked into one role forever. And they're fun as hell to level and PvP with!
---
Ah you're right it does. I'll edit my comment
---
Class balances just isn't going to fly. There's nearly 150 comments here at the moment of my reply, so I'm not going to tell you what everyone else undoubtedly has. 
---
But what you're asking for is something that could be discussed when the time comes for a potential Classic+ (Classic design philosophy with new content, gear, and balance changes) or Classic TBC servers.
---
Almost as good for griefing as Fear!
---
Is there a way to get addons with out the twitch app like doing it old school? Personly dont like twitch and would rather not take part of their activitys
---
One thing I learned during vanilla is that life is overrated.
---
I went to university for the first time 10 years ago and fucked it up playing WoW all day every day.
---
Now I'm going back to university in 5 weeks just as classic launches.
---
So...
---
This is awesome. What a baller pose too.
---
Lol yeah. I'm just starting a new job and have a long-distance gf. She said she will try it so that will alleviate a bit of pressure.
---
Fire stone secretly OP. Melee Warlock best DPS
---
It was always toxic on pservers (literal racism). While on live, it just generally waded into dumb shit and dumb early memes.
---
Downvote that thread and move on.
---
Wouldn't be the Vanilla experience if there wasn't queues for days.
---
Im cleaning characters out in BFA for classic game time.  🤣
---
yea, I hope. all I want to do is enjoy the game slowly and get the same experience that people had 15 years ago. I'm sure people will be more aggressive since they are going to want to get to level 60 fast
---
Grob mob!
---
I used both Questie and pfQuest on private servers, and pfQuest was definitely the superior addon imo. In addition to a better looking questing interface, you could track things like chests, resource nodes, specific NPCs, etc.
---
ClassicCodex is based on pfQuest so if things shake out the same way as private servers this will be the better addon. Of course this is all subjective and just my opinion.
---
&gt;Warlocks are terrible dps and not needed in raids
---
Yeah this is fake news just stop. I raided as a lock vanilla-tbc farming AQ40 &amp; Naxx. Warlock DPS pre ZG is mediocre but have ton of utility. Locks are top DPS in Naxx and most of AQ. Locks in PvP are absolute monsters.
---
Throw fireballs up on Garr and confuse your raid lel
---
you IRL [https://clips.twitch.tv/create](https://clips.twitch.tv/create)
---
Regardless, the earliest you can solo WW axe is 37.
---
This is basically what my rig is and I run most games on high to max settings.
---
Care to elaborate?  Each layer can hold as many players as a vanilla launch server, guilds and friends are more likely to be in the same layer and chat is universal so I fail to see any drawbacks that aren't trivial.
---
What do you consider a completed class? I’ve been really torn for picking a classic class. I don’t have the dedication to hardcore anything so hearing is iffy for me. I mostly want to just pvp around. I will be playing with an irl friend by our schedules do t always line up so there will probably be a lot o solo pvp, I was thinking a mage. Pros cons? I’ve been trying out classes on retrowow but nothing feels right.
---
Side hire a Scottish actor for the dwarf quests!
---
Azshara was an interesting zone even before the goblins set up shop with a lot of interesting contrasts. It wasn't very relevant once you leveled up, though.
---
While it wouldn't make for a very authentic vanilla experience, I can't say I'm opposed to having more than 3 BG options either.
---
So, put me down for "why the fuck not?"
---
They are thinking long term. There will be a big drop off after launch.
---
The Classic announcement is there for Nov 2017. We did add anything related to BfA because frankly the thing was gigantic already and Classic was announced at that point.
---
It has already been proven for the most part that private servers were pretty close and in most cases was actually harder than classic. So the estimate time for a Rag kill should be faster.
---
Haha. I swear it’s not. I’ve just seen some younger people still seem unsure of what they want for themselves and like another user rightly commented, it’s just about going in aware of the situation. That’s all I’m trying to say.
---
I think there's also going to be a big surge of players 1-2 days before launch who didn't want to pay for two weeks, but are willing to sub a day or two early to beat the launch day rush.
---
If Sulfuras is phase 1, it's BiS for Warriors.
---
What life?
---
The entrance to Booty Bay also... Some people stayed there just to gank low levels coming to Booty Bay.
---
C'est effectivement très toxique comme page... J'étais content de jouer avec des québécois pour la première fois depuis Burning Crusade mais la je suis plus certain... Ça joue au petit boss chacun son tour.
---
If you delete them all and stay on that screen you should be fine.  Just create a new one.
---
You can always choose to not complete the quest and go back at a higher level too...
---
I'm sorry, Horde have less ease of travel? They have two zepps outside their major city that take them to the top and bottom half of another continent, allowing them easy access to STV and lower Eastern Kingdoms, Tirisfal Glades and all of the upper Eastern Kingdoms. They have two cities smack bang in the middle of goddamn Kalimdor.
---
Not to mention you have ease of access to way more leveling dungeons than Alliance, with the likes of Barrens containing 3 Dungeons, and Tirisfal Glades containing 4, with Silverpine Forest having another 1.
---
You ever made the run at level 30 as Alliance to goddamn Scarlet Monastery Graveyard? Ease of travel my arse, mate.
---
&gt; Private server launches were always hellish nightmares of 2000+ people in the popular starter zones, forcing you to just run off and get exploration xp just to level. 
---
This is only the case in the starter zones, and only for the first couple hours or so. And even then there's other options, like finding a partner and grinding mobs just outside the starting zones.
---
I always mention in layering discussions that no solution is perfect and it's a matter of weighing pros and cons. And I'll take a few hours of inconvenience over a few weeks of layering.
---
&gt;On top of there being like 3-4 hour queues just to get in.
---
I've never experienced anything like this on any private server that I've played on.
---
&gt;Blizzard's data on how many players created characters, played beta, played stress test &gt; your "feelings"
---
None of this data can help to correctly predict retention.

Imagine getting 2k upvotes and gilded for a repost. What a joke.
---
I like the Alliance propaganda, it will prevent the Horde from waiting forever in bg queues down the line :D
---
Hey, thanks!
---
Technically I believe hunters can use marks/survival but they will be giving up true shot aura so it can end up being a loss for the raids dps as a whole, it will be up to your guild leader/officers on whether or not they mind you raiding in that spec. Late game hunters dps isn’t as important because they are more for kiting/tranq so your guild might not give a shit.
---
As someone who raided as Priest &amp; Warlock, play both. Both classes are boss PvP. Both classes extremely important PvE (especially Locks AQ/Naxx).
---
If you want to get into raids ASAP and build good reputation start off as Priest. Level your Lock as an alt/2nd main and by the time Naxx/AQ drop you'll have 2 of the most desirable classes to pick from (or play both concurrently).
---

I really enjoy the quest lore so I will definitely be doing this. I remember playing wotlk with my friends and they blew through the content hit max level and didn’t even know why Arthas was a villain. 
---
I mean, I get it, you want to complete the content so you can get your bis gear and all that. But if you hit max level and can’t tell me what the dungeons are about, or why you are even their killing a boss. Why do you even care to get bis? I mean whats the point lol?
---
Like [this?](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Diminishing_returns_
---
lol, why not just wait to the 26th for those extra hours, instead of even consider the 25th.
---
I've played horde shaman and will do so again, and I cant argue with this advice.
---
I don't have any links but google will surely do. Essentially DR exists but a lot less things share DR than in retail. And it's 50-75% reduction then immunity. The length of DR is 15-20 seconds randomly.
---
This. With exceptional timing you can pull off some crazy stunts on a rogue. Right time right place kind of thing, the true masters can do it regularly.
---
Because for most of the world it is the 27th
---
Classic+ but I don't think they need to (or will) go to the trouble of designing new dungeons or zones. They have over a decade of content to pick and choose from and I think what they should be doing is taking that content and rebalancing that around the gameplay systems of classic WoW. There's no need to reinvent the wheel by building brand new content but there is a need to use that content in a way that avoids them going down the path to retail that TBC, WoTLK, Cata etc takes you.
---
I think they can easily retcon the content in a gameplay sense and all the crap like group finder and heirlooms and talent tree changes you leave out. But the big questions for me are what to do about levelling post 60 and flying mounts. You need levelling post 60 for newer zones but how that should be managed I'm not sure. And as fun as flying mounts are they make the world feel small and ruin world PvP.
---
Same, zoomer unite

Yeah dude I can’t believe this guy is getting 2k upvotes when we already went through the STV war images phase. Repost trash, no credit.

Recommended races for Priest/Warlock? Just asking since it seems like it actually matters in Classic
---
They up to a rough awakening. I remember how consuming it was and just plain frustrating.
---
*overestimate
---
They're gonna have to make a few more servers before launch for sure.
---
Absolute POS karma wh0re.
---
More
---
There's going to be at least a new west coast pvp server.  Nice to see that at least it's clear Blizz underestimated the interest in classic.
---
I believe you meant Mark Kern instead of Mike Kern
---
I always did this shit. I'd give people water breathing on my warlock all the time just in case.
---
He’s a karma ho fo sho
---
I want to say if it wasn't, something like Bartender or Dominoes did it.
---
Klhtm beta version was available before bwl opened.  Not sure about QH.  Sorry for misinterpreting your tone.
---
It’s absolutely brutal.  I did it in just over three days played (almost consecutively because I was nuts) and I thought I was going to die.
---
That was 12 years ago, I’ll be damned if I could even attempt that now.
---
...shit
---
You gonna have a bad time playing Classic as a Ret Pally. Just don't do it to yourself my g.
---
Your last sentence I read wrong at first pass and it came off way sexier.

Just a heads up: it's Mark Kern, not Mike.
---
How dare you exclude THE ALMIGHTY GROB MOB
---
As someone who played WoW during RotLK, but fell off before MoP, I had a few level 80s and raided - explain what the fuck this is and why I should get excited about it?
---
Haha it’s all good. Mistakes happen. :)
---
I know this thread is all but dead but i'm still struggling on Troll or UD for my priest. I plan on playing disc primarily and want to prioritize utility in PvE and PvP. I was sold on Troll but i'm weighing the racials, primarily for PvP.
---
Troll or UD for Disc in PvP?
---
Yeah, the typo will have to live on as a testament to us being fat fingered at this point.
---
&gt; Retail guilds are just chatrooms outside of Mythic raiding easy access, everything else can be pugged
---
you aren't gonna have any luck pugging mythic+ dungeons at 15 or higher. one of my favorite things about the guild i'm in is we've got a nice squad of people who like pushing keys.
---
&gt;Vanilla-WOTLK it was important to find a guild where you could call home, someplace where you fit in and your goals aligned with others so you needed to communicate and meet people, maybe you want to be a server first raider, maybe you want super high arena score, maybe you want to Roleplay. No matter what you wanted to do guilds offered a place to call home and be around others who were also interested.
---
i don't see how modern wow guilds don't achieve those same goals. what does LFR/dungeon finder do that prevents finding a guild full of RPers or arena pushers?
---
i agree that modern wow is a lot less social, but not for the reasons you've listed here
---
the "times change" was a great choice
---
You havent tanked an instance to get better gear?
---
fucking lold
---
Dualbox a priest with your WAR, and then when you are way ahead of him, call him a little bitch with both accounts.
---
What a douche you are.
---
But have you ordered a box of adult size diapers yet?
---
As I said the updates would be to the hosting stuff aka the sever infrastructure. This is one reason why it’s common practice to not couple your code to specific infrastructure. So you can easily port from day sun spark boxes to red hat boxes or whatever. M
---
As for database driven things. SQL ports pretty well upwards. As long as your schema actually had the migrations programmatically done your fine. 
---
I just finished doing DR testing on a 8 year old production project and I fully believe that I could checkout the 1.0 and we could run it fine. (We would need to update database drivers and the links and some other small caveats ofc). It all depends on how well practices were followed / if they had them at all.
---
Just because they only have 1 viable raiding spec does not make them "incomplete". Raiding isn't everything.
---
God damn, that was beautiful. Fuck I love Horde.
---
He threatened Vol'jin first. And also tried to commit genocide on the darkspear tribe.

I don't necessarily agree but I'll leave you with this video from the Classical WoW period.

Healy priest/druid for fast groups/raids.
---
Engaging in 5-mans. Especially bad groups.
---
People will worship the ground you walk on.
---
Shadow priest is a poor mans aff lock.
---
Strong 1v1 and can be nice in dungeons. 
---
Scales horribly with gear and has serious mana issues in longer fights. 
---
Threat monster. Mind flay is 30 yds.
---
Shadow form is cool as heck! 
---
Gets the coolest staff in the game.
---
No CC to speak of. 
---
MC is humanoid only and you do 0 dps.
---
Shackle is undead and melee only.
---
With some practice, lock can CC several targets. Fear, seduce, banish, enslave.
---
Scales very good. 
---
PVP monster. 
---
Buffs! Debuffs! SS! Tanky pet! Summon! 
---
Bolt spam is boring, but as an old pve shadow priest it was nice to be able to stand at 40 yds and see those crits light up my screen.
---
Think I convinced myself actually!
---
If it's a coherency issue then yea.
---
i think you should get a reputation for a role by excelling at that role and becoming "that amazing prot pally", not by being pigeonholed into the role you play most because you can't afford to have fun in the other roles.
---
It's been updated a lot and there's an alliance version in the making.
---
Layering is the elephant in the room here.  How many layers? how many people per layer? 
---
Until we know these things (which Blizz won't tell us) we don't know how many servers will be needed.
---
Movie. Literally the whole point of the scene.
---
Guaranteed this will run classic on 60fps easy.
---
Calm down nerds.

Its basically the same thing as day 1 naming your character, they just moved it to pre launch and made your dumb ass pay for it.
---
For the record I'm also a dumb ass
---
My dear wasn't STV as much as Ungoro. Seriously still get anxious flying over it in the current game.
---
A tip tho, delete them on after one, just to minimise the risk of losing  a name.

They don't need to do all 3 realm types. Korea only got one PVE realm. Whatever numbers Blizzard has suggested Spain couldn't even support this.
---
Ahh, plainsrunning. I wish.
---
Dont want to waste time making characters on a server that is being water boarded as is.
---
Funny :)
---
Yep. People are going to drop like flies after a while. I don't think people understand just how difficult Vanilla WoW was compared to what they are used to now days.
---
Going to be an interesting first couple of days.
---
Blizzard isn't in the habit of sharing their data just because you want them to.
---
/r/roastme
---
Yeah I didn't realize full didn't mean really full so you can't even join.
---
I'd argue that most people are going to be taking their time leveling up and experiencing the world again. The Reddit and private server crowd that want to nolife to 60 are probably a super small portion of the overall playerbase. Could be wrong but I'm betting that's the case.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqzyae/grobulus_mobulus/).

Yea, and I see that. But in context to the scene it's not really applicable. 
---
I think a better choice would have been a Gollum related one.
---
Yea they haven't cured you yet.
---
It's kinda a trade off isn't it lol? 15min buff and spamming flash of light vs dropping totems and spamming chain heal. Pallys still win out because the blessings especially salvation, raid protection tools, and the most mana efficient heals in the game.
---
&gt;the general consensus here on Reddit is that phase 1 will last 1 month.
---
Sorry what?
---
No.
---
About 3 months +-2 weeks is what most are thinking. If we look at blizzlike progression it was 7 months from maraudon to bwl release.
---
 I honestly would've preferred these over the female human wearing troll skin, that we inevitably got. I like the odd "ugly" female race.

During the stress test it was Barrens chat in Deathknell.

I don't remember Rankill personally, but I do remember Ænigma.  If I remember right we were always fighting to clear content before they did, and typically were around the same pace.  Though I do think they cleared BWL before we did.  Maybe even ZG, but just had bad luck on the drops and our DOW dropped on the first clearing.  :)

Learn how to play the AH like the stock market. Get lucky and find a super rare recipe and AH that shit for 100's of gold. By simply being lucky and knowing how to play the AH you can make hella bank, cause that's what I did.

Mage is a completed class. Basically it’s the three hybrid classes that are incomplete. Like I said, doesn’t mean that they aren’t fun, they really can be. But they can be a bit more challenging not only in their general game play but even in the fact that you may want to have multiple gear sets, which is exhausting.
---
Does anyone know if blizzard will have the unarmored mounts at the start!?
---
Ah nice! Is it on the same page? Just want to make sure I’m looking at the updated version
---
They have said that. 2ish for phases 1 and 2 and longer for 3-6 is all they told us.
---
LF Honor on whitemane can trade honor honour honored on Fairbanks or gold in retail
---
Depends on the quest.

Some you can do that way but you kind of defeat the purpose of a group quest.
---
"Many" actually more ppl speak spanish than english
---
Warlock.
---
Thank god you'll never be in the position of a game designer yourself dude - itemization is about more than just offering the best / optimal gear all the time. If you like that garbage, go to retail.
---
Does it auto check them off as you complete? And show quests by zone so you can go back and do any you missed?
---
Oh wow! You’re only the 74th person to post this!

For dungeons it's fine to be pvp specced but for raids it won't work

Rogue is fucked in trying to do both at same time. It simply cannot work.

Top contenders are:

---
healer/hybrid/tribid priests
---
hunter in mostly pve spec
---
deep frost mage with winterchill
---
30-0-21 elemental shamans who heal in raid
---
They might need to re-start layering temporarily for an event such as AQ gates opening or whatever. Ages ago before Vanilla AQ release, we did some testing of the questline to open gates. When we got to the part of Eranikus in Moonglade with the shades, there's a world announce that happens as part of the interaction. We had so many people porting into Moonglade to see wtf was up and what we were doing there, that the server crashed and had to be re-set a couple times. Same deal with when we opened gates on AQ, there were just so many people that it really didn't go smooth at all. People were lagging all over the zone lol. So ya, something like that, they'll likely turn on layering to cope with even just temporarily.
---
Fashionably late .
---
And honor.
---
Yeah the ease of travel bit is way off, they have a far easier time getting everywhere not named Blackrock.
---
i have always played alliance. Thinking of going Horde for Classic.

Personally joining the minority faction is better because you get really short que times.

---
I see, guesss 'Gj' would be semi rare to, common phrase for 'Good job'.
---
I’m gonna cry
---
Does anyone know the threshold for what “high” is? Are we talking thousands? Millions?
---
Haha X-D
---
When my husband and I were discussing how and what we were going to do in classic the question of going back to alli came up and that was his argument. The BG queues are shorter! Lol.
---
My searches indicate that about 450 million people speak Spanish and that 1.5 billion speak English.
---
To answer the original question though. Demand drives what servers are stood up.
---
Ah confirmed, appreciated! Thanks
---
Stalagg will be listed as full by tomorrow with people shedding off Herod.  Blizzard will have to more than double server count by week one of actual release.   The influx will be huge.  Its starting to look like classic might actually eclipse retail in the early days, how long it holds on is hard to say.

This was me but with the ZA gear. I LOVED the ZA gear and thought it was SO badass. I used to love spamming that dungeon/raid just to make sure I got all the set pieces so I could wear them in town.
---
Same here. I'll probably sub on Sunday just so I don't have to worry about character creation when it becomes playable.
---
praise shenna the real vanilla hero
---
At this rate I have no idea how many extra servers they will need to add.  This is all the hardcore crowd trying to just reserve a name.
---
For us hybrid classes it was life changing when it got implemented.
---
While I agree it's a greedy move. The insane traffic for name reserve should help them gauge the interest, and take appropriate measures. I mean they already opened more servers.
---
Seems even worse when you factor in that in retail you can create a character and play to level 20 without a subscription. For classic you need to be paying money to go farther than the server list lol
---
All the Horde leaders were a big part of Warcraft 3 (except Vol'Jin though he was in it). You're right about the Alliance leaders though (except Tyrande).
---
I know it says vanilla but that table has the Death Knight on it and spells from TBC and wrath so other values on there may have changed since vanilla. Pain in the arse trying to find vanilla data often because this shit keeps happening to me.
---
Looks great!  When was "You think you do, but you don't".  That would be cool to have on the timeline.
---
This sub has grown almost 20k players over the last 24 hours.  My ticker was showing 167k yesterday if I remember correctly.
---
I know that pain, I was a shaman constantly respeccing between elemental and resto in BC
---
Technically if you are min maxing you’d only bring 2 locks, the 3rd not being necessary because warlock dps is too low to warrant needing a 3rd for shadows.
---
unfortunately, yeaaah. barrens chat will be just as bad as trade chat in live, with angry bigoted rants and spam
---
Old Pal Garrosh if she wasn't a psycho and died...
---
honestly a good percentage of people will realise they dont like the class they picked around 30-40 and re roll
---
its not really a big deal there will be so many people leveling even if you get to 60 and re roll it wont be a huge deal
---
Exactly. It was great for being a new game but damn after it has evolved and you want to go back to the beginning?
---
It took me a minute to get that your name wasn't thema dmonk just the day it reads to me idk
---
!remindMe 12 days
---
&gt; If I was planning on doing a dungeon while I was leveling back in the day I’d do it over the weekend when I knew I had 1-4 hours I could dedicate to completing it.
---
If you can get a group at all, mind. 
---
Even still, that's asking a lot for people that don't have a lot of time, ***generally*** to play the game. The vast majority of people don't have that kind of time. 
---
&gt; Dungeons during leveling aren’t all that efficient regardless from my understanding. 
---
Getting the quests done for that dungeon makes it worth it, as well as the gear that drops. Leveling strictly off the dungeon can be beneficial depending on what level you are. 
---
&gt; It was the experience of completing challenging content with a group of people that you grew to know over the course of however long it took.
---
That depends entirely on the group. I've had some groups where everyone is patient and willing to work together. 
---
I've had one group where one of our DPS was an asshole. Worst part of it is, unless you ***really*** dislike them, you won't kick them because then you'd have to go all the way back outside of the instance (or to a city) to spam for another person. 
---
In the case of the asshole, we were kind of stuck with him. : \
---
Nope your explanation was trash and completely blown out of proportion.
---
The question is how many people left Herod to go over. Also you gotta remember its just names reserved and not people actually playing. I know at least 20 people with a character on Stalagg and Herod unsure of which to choose. Those numbers will be very inaccurate until sometime after launch when people are settled.
---
Warlocks can dot half a zone and kite for ultra efficient farming. Warlocks do NOT lack burst damage lol...Nightfall.
---
Man I love these!
---
You just repeated what I said ? Lol did you not read the rest of what I typed ?
---
Layering has always been based on the gamble that a huge portion of players quit by the time phase 1 is over. If that doesn't happen, layering will either stay or we'll have to get a lot more servers to accommodate the extra people.
---
Cartographer is working
---
YEESSSS!!!
---
I dont want an addo. That tells me what quests to do but do either of those auto turn in and auto accept quests
---
Bare in mind though this IS with all the tens of thousands of retail players who probably have little interest in swapping over to classic full time.
---
They get to come over now and grab names for free as its included in their sub. 
---
This will be massively inflating numbers.
---
As a horde druid, I want this. Blizz change!
---
Sure, you get the original developers to implement it though as consultants.
---
On some of my toons, yeah!  Walking when they don't need to run, wearing travel and sleep clothes when travelling and sleeping, rest and sleep breaks where and when those make sense, both eating and drinking even if they don't need health or don't use mana, all make basic sense for immersion and I'm planning to try them.
---
There's a patch changes list at the bottom so I'm guessing it's accurate. But yeah vanilla information is hard to come by.
---
scheduling and prioritizing tasks is going to be essential this time around for classic.
---
highly recommend having a morning routine that MUST be completed before any play time occurs and also make a list of 5-10 things that need to be accomplished for the day.
---
also, drink lots of water and set a timer for every hour to stand up, stretch and maybe do some push-ups or squats :)
---
Ask them about their decision to locate the only RP PVP server in Los Angeles instead of Chicago when the majority of RP PVP players are East Coast.
---
Ya, you’ll just be made fun of lol
---
Imagine that a lot of us don't comb this sub every day and therefore didn't even know it was a repost...  And don't care.
---
&gt;  Have hunters lost a ton of power in 1v1 and 1vx because of this?
---
They didn't *lose* anything.  That's how it was in Vanilla for almost a year.  It never even crossed my mind while PVPing.
---
Oh? So it adds some character like responses? Huh.
---
lbrs wolf (about 2/3rds in) for highest rank of bite and furious howl
---
New to classic, what is this place?
---
Ah that's right, forgot that part...still to much retail in me apparently.
---
WSIP? I’m old and lazy so I want easy mode leveling but also to be able to kick ass in BGs. Not that interested in dungeons, definitely won’t raid. I played a rogue and druid from vanilla to wrath so I don’t really want to redo either of those, I’m leaning warlock now.
---
Alliance - No opinion never played Ally

What auction house addons are people using?
---
/aap skip should work for skipping the current step. Sometimes makes the addon a little wonky if you skip something important for a future quest etc tho. Ill normally only use it to skip pathing waypoints it didnt update automatically
---
It's a Rick Roll, isn't it?
---
Do the populations go off people sitting in the character creation menu or the amount of characters registered on the realm right now? Anyone know?
---
I see people saying they will have alts for professions. Most say they will be level 5. What is the significance of 5 and are there any character level requirements for profession advancement?
---
Er, doesn’t lightshope close in 7 days?
---
I wonder if Classic will also get the expansion content at a faster rate?  I assume if retention rates are great they'll push content out and, slim chance, remove Classic sub from 'retail' thus making it its own subscription.
---
Probably tens of millions imo. I think overall classic will have around 250 million, give or take 5 million for rounding errors.
---
If you're Horde, go Pagle... We need more Hordies to kill. I can say that cuz this time i'm playing Alliance side, unlike in Vanilla. :D hehehe.  I secretly just like having Ghost Wolves dancing on my corpse.
---
HoTW druids. Your favorite jack of all trades!
---
As far as PvP is concerned, I would recommend going with 2/2 into Clever Traps under the Survival tree if scatter trapping into burst is what you're looking for. This makes the Freezing Trap  ([https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=14310/freezing-trap](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=14310/freezing-trap)) last 20 seconds as opposed to 15. Diminishing Returns in classic are 50% then 75%, so you will still be able to scatter and trap the target for 10 seconds even on DR. 10 seconds is plenty of time to gain the required distance to reopen with an aimed shot/multi-shot combo. I wouldn't let this one aspect of 1.12 keep you from playing hunter - they're going to be great in PvP!
---
Releasing BWL almost immediately seems pretty dumb
---
We play traditional sports, we don't constantly invent new sports that are supposed to replicate existing sports. That would be pointless because everyone would just keep playing the old sport.
---
Same applies to games. If you're just trying to replicate other good games, people will just play the other good game.
---
&gt; also make a list of 5-10 things that need to be accomplished for the day.
---
1. eat
---
2. sleep
---
3. drink
---
4. WoW Classic
---
apparently I only need 4!

If you were to guess, where would the Steamwheedle Mint be? What kind of security would they have? I feel like this is the Raid I've always wanted and never considered.

wanna make the horde angry and frustrated?

Gnomes have the most irritating appearance of all races + very good racials for mages = win

Make a female gnome mage with pink hair + macro /lol and press that macro every time you kill a horde player and taste victory and they will implode in front of their screen at home.

---
Native speakers yes, but many people speak English as their second language, probably more than spanish, it's very hard to compare the two because we don't have accurate data on who speaks english who isn't a native speaker.
---
All that is irrelevant though since this isn't about world population this is about WoW players. Blizzard does have data on how many people from Spain play.
---
Also worth mentioning, almost everyone in Europe speaks english, but not a whole lot of people speak spanish outside of Spain.   
---
Plus the number of native spanish speakers is high not because the population of Spain is so big but because of ex-colonies of Spain have tons of native speakers. I would imagine having spanish and ofcourse portugese servers would make more sense in South America than Europe if we go by population. Blizzard has the data on players from the region and they didn't include a server there either.
---

Right, so will it block me since the server is full?
---
You're the human version of earth worm jim, and i'm okay with that
---
On pservers barrens chat is alive and well just like the old days 
---
The thing is times have changed, and instead of bush and chuck norris jokes, it's Trump spam. It varies from people spamming Trump 2020, to people having extremely cringy political debates
---
Say what you will about Illidan, but that was some cold ass shit to say to a motherfucker right before you end their whole shit.
---
So you wanna spend 3h in MC?

Hi, /u/realyp93
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cr07n3/classic_wow_professions_guides/). 
---
Phase 1 3 months, Phase 2 3 months seems reasonable
---
I remember it being pretty smart though
---
&gt; Again, wrong. Level 1-20 zones were nightmarish for the first WEEK, at the very least.
---
I'm guessing you're just going by what you've heard and haven't actually played a private server. I was level 60 after about a week on Nostalrius and that was before dynamic respawns.
---
Lots of players and competition? Sure. Impossible to progress? Absolutely not.
---
&gt;Because you've never been around for launch.
---
I did the launch of Nostalrius PvP, Nostalrius PvE, ND, and SH. None of those had any sort of queues that I can really remember.
---
&gt;I don't know what you're whining about.
---
I'm not whining about anything. You seem like you're just trying to start a fight for no reason. I specifically mentioned player retention and the timeline for the removal of layering, so I don't know why you're trying to argue a completely different thing that I didn't even bring up.
---
That's a good point too. If they're already seeing the servers filling and yet forums they view are showing LOTS of people who say they're not subbing until just before... They'll know to start carefully watching subs and the servers on the days before and if needed, add some more servers.
---
Layering is going away after phase 1, 100%. There's going to be a max limit of players allowed on a server when layering is removed. People will sit in queues or transfer to another server using free transfers.
---
Thanks :D
---
Strange. My experience has been the total opposite on pservers. Haven’t played wow in 10yrs, have tried two different pservers and only getting to lvl 30ish. I expected hard core toxic players, but everyone I grouped with had been awesome, giving me stuff and gold I never asked for....always keen to help me. Even spent half a night grouped up with some crazy Russians, was fun. Doing RFC and WC, being healer, the main tank goes down and only a few DPS are still alive…expected to be screamed about it, but the tanks were chill. Better experience then I remembered in old wow.
---
Thank your for your hard work I'll leave these and get ready for the launch 🤘
---
I thought this was going to be a time line of wow classic... Not shit in retail from 2010.
---
This is 70% worthless to classic players.
---
Thank you for the re-assurance this is great!
---
You do realise Blizzard still holds to 'you think you do, but you don't'? Classic is proly the cheaper PR move they could do. Any change to retail WoW is a risk that while you might attract certain players, twice as much players might leave coz they didn't like the change.   
---
Classic on the other hand is risk free - if by any luck it's popular then cool, they might even release TBC and wotlk after that.   
---
If it flops? Not Blizzard fault, they were asked to recreate vanilla, and they delivered. No matter what happens with Classic it's +ev move for Blizzard.
---
I mean, it's not like $15 is a lot when I make $15/hr at my job. Like the other guy said, I'll gladly pay $7.50 to reserve the names that I'm going to be using for the next couple years.
---
[https://sixtyupgrades.com/](https://sixtyupgrades.com/)  This is probably more in line with what you are looking for.
---
Me too bud, and I mostly agree. But let's take what we can get at this point, lol.
---
I turn 30 in less than a month.  In 2004 im not even sure i had terribly stable internet, didnt have a computer that could run it, didnt have a job (and theres no way my mom was going to buy me a game called 'warcraft' and pay 15/mo for me to play it), etc.
---
I didnt start until the summer after Wrath dropped (7-8 months in i think?) after i was out of college and when i had a semi-stable (though shitty) job so i could pay for it.
---
Im really, really excited to see how it started, and to play a game thats built around the leveling experience.  When i started in Wrath i downloaded a leveling addon (carbonite?) when i first started and just kind of rushed through.  Hell, it still took me 5+ weeks i think (lol).  This time around ill be reading quests and figuring it out that way for the most part (unless i get stuck on something for a while, then ill alt-tab and google it).
---
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Are we there yet?
---
To be fair, it could be seen as a perk to those currently playing retail that they didnt require you to even have battle for azeroth for.
---
This is the best guide I've seen posted on this sub and is easily the most helpful thing I've read. Out of all the things I'm ultra-prepared for, I'm absolutely not prepared in the culinary department.  
---
Absolutely awesome of you to write this.
---
for sure, everyone used them back in the day, decursive was a must
---
Are you the real SoupaSoka?
---
I lost a two letter character name on Herod after deleting it for 5 seconds at 2am.
---
Pagle needs more Horde, just sayin. heh.
---
Make a rogue.  Name him stabbz.  Kill horde.  Now you love gnome.
---
They were already full at one point and people jumped off.
---
Full disclosure: I can't stand gnomes. However:
---
1) They're said to be the best pve Alliance mage race because of their intellect racial;
---
2) They're said to be the best Alliance pvp race because of their escape artist racial;
---
3) Because of 1 &amp; 2 a lot of competitive/ min-max guilds will probably have quite a few gnome mages running around, so possibly not as rare as you think
---
4) Do you like their animations? How they walk? Their mounts? It's quite the undertaking to grind another faction to exalted so be sure you enjoy them mechanostriders
---
5) I've tried playing gnome in the past - it's really not for me, but there are definitely some avid gnome enthusiasts out there. On a general note in regards to becoming more attached to your character: pick a name that has meaning for you, and, if this is your thing, give them a backstory (just for yourself) that gives you a connection to them so they're not just a walking ball of pixels. 
---
Since gnomes are so small you also won't notice clashing gear colours as much, I suppose? There are plenty of those moments to come for the larger races out there. Wowhead has a classic dressing room where you can try gear and looks (no barbershop!) and even various animations. Find a design you enjoy :) Good luck!
---
There was a Gnome Mage on my server back in the day, quite popular in the PvP circuit Alliance side, in the premade PvP group regularly, that kind of stuff. He was a bit of a legend among the Horde community, not just the PvP circuit but pretty much the whole faction, and understandably so..
---
You see this mage respecced every AV weekend to maximise his Arcane Explosion damage as much as humanly possibly, and he asked... No.... He demanded, that every single druid and discipline priest focus their attention on him almost exclusively, and he screamed his face off when people didn't listen. He was a baby rager but let me tell you, this little git was a god damn pocket rocket.
---
A handful of Noggen Fogger to make himself tiny. Power Infusion. Innervate. Arcane Power. That madman charged into Balinda's bunker with his handful of helpers and single handedly increased the suicide rate of Horde for the entire server. 
---
You see, this was way back when people weren't overly aware of their surroundings and kind of tunnel visioned things down, this was an era where people tried to click on a player to target them... This was an era where a single tiny Gnome Mage and all his cooldowns could totally wipe out a Bunker of Horde players without a scratch.
---
Roll Gnome. No regrets.
---
Love it, thanks for combining it all then sharing it. Wish I had more than one upvote to give.
---
Has this been tested?
---
I'm gonna be in Vegas that weekend...
---
Yeah fuck it I'd pay. Weekend of WoW from the hotel!
---
Nope.  The most they said was players on herod should consider moving to another server or expect q times.
---
&gt; I'm guessing you're just going by what you've heard and haven't actually played a private server.
---
I've been playing pservers since 2015, but thanks for the "NO U", really helps your case.
---
&gt;I did the launch of Nostalrius PvP, Nostalrius PvE, ND, and SH.
---
ND and SH both had queues, you're lying.
---
&gt;You seem like you're just trying to start a fight for no reason.
---
&gt;you're trying to argue
---
And now you're resorting to ad hominem attacks, so I'm gonna go ahead and block you.
---
what the hell is an rdudus
---
I leveled to 40 on beta and every group I got into or made everyone was completely silent, it felt just like BFA only with extra steps to make the group, people were more social back in 2004.
---
I'm sorry are you saying you think classic will have 250 million subs? Are you insane?
---
I have personally never left the start area without being level 6, but from what I understand, you need to be level 5 in order to be able to train professions.
---
There are level requirements for profession advancement. I think from memory the first gate is level 30
---
Hi, /u/profHam
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cr0dcb/how_much_is_the_sub_fee_for_classic_wow/). 
---
That's what i am worried will happen on Shazzrah and Gehennas, i have my name, but need to change my appearance...
---
The second server listed certainly didn't "fall apart." It was going strong until this month.
---
I'm sorry but this is a firm *no* for me. Dual specs effectively halves the number of playable classes in the game. You want a tank? Level a protection warrior. You want a DPS warrior? Level *a different type of warrior*.
---
If you change your mind at level 40 and decide you want to play aggressive vs defensive, you can use your cheap respecs. But at some point this should become permanent/too costly to keep doing.
---
If you want to be able to heal some times and damage others, **make a disc priest or a fucking druid**. That's the point of these hybrids -- they fill a gap that is not supposed to be trampled on by allowing a spec switch option to all the specialists. You are shitting on the hybrid classes by telling them they suck as a hybrid, since you can fill any role you want via respec as a *specialist*. This is very damaging to the game's intent.
---
Individuality is what makes this game; dual-spec switches dilute this.
---
Welp, my friends decided to roll Alliance on Pagle instead of Horde on Mankrik. Feelsbadman my names were on Mankrik. 😥
---
Why don’t they just release more servers and if their fears come true that realms start to die just merge them?
---
Anise was on my server! Darksorrow represent!
---
oh, sorry
---
HAHA LOL GOOD JOKE OP XD I LOL'D SO FUNNY EBIN MEM
---
is that a more appropriate response
---
Hi there!! Thanks so much for the kind comment. I'm glad you liked the post and that you think it'll be helpful! I love your mention of chewing gum. I almost put it on there, but then I was like, "It's not food, though," and by the time I put a section of non-food tips, I'd forgotten the thought again. I'll add it in with a credit to you! :D
---
I would also like to know if a 2 handed fury build uses  edgemasters handguards?
---
You can update add-ons via twitch app now btw
---
Depositions are not in-court
---
Gnomes are awesome... to punt.
---
I am suddenly very glad I never saw Avatar. Just that one scene looked like hot garbage.
---
File&gt; Make  a Copy. Input your own information for your class. that would take entirely too long to do for every class. For me it took about  2 hours to input all the information just for Holy Priests.
---
Early phases on Pservers 2H fury was actually better (with something like BRE). Once BWL &amp; R14 gear comes out then DW is better...at least as far as pserv numbers went.
---
Also make sure your battle.net is up to date. I ran into that issue when looking for the client download.
---
This is one of the reasons I stopped playing years ago
---
Idk man I grew up pocket healing my dad in DAoC, beta testing vanilla wow with him and playing up until now. I’m in my mid twenties, the old type of mmo player still exists. I do agree the more mainstream gaming culture really has shifted.
---
Frostdamus has some good vids on profs
---
I really don’t understand everyone complaining about subbing early to get your name reserved. Like even when I was broke I would have still put the money up somehow.
---
$15 is nothing. Incoming downvotes from all the brokeasses.
---
The processor is the most important thing to running wow smoothly.  3.6Ghz is plenty of power.
---
I booked vacation as soon as they announced the date!
---
The only thing more satisfying then running them oom is seeing them burn a consumable on a 200 mana 0 cd spell.
---
Blizzard refused to provide a product that existed already and people wanted
---
Did some one say??
---
My point was in regards to ret paladin dps.Holy paladins are absolutely needed in every raid. If you're rolling holy you'll have no problem being welcomed into a guild with open arms and showered with loot lol.
---
/train is the best in a gnome
---
And do it like in the middle of the night or something.
---
Na still prefer keyboard turning and clicking abilities.
---
It's been so long since I had them that if I see them on a shelf the weekend before launch, I will be buying some. They weren't a part of my original WoW experience, but back in my wee little mageling days of the real life, I ate a lot of them for lunch because they were the cheapest thing in the a la carte line.
---
Wow that's a lot of good info. Thanks mate
---
Trying to reinvent the wheel....
---
Will prob run the paladin as my main then, played a caster through vanilla and my first max level was a warlock in wotlk. 
---
Any tips for leveling ?
---
You couldn’t clean your carpet for us, like not even a little bit
---
The only people who will make fun of you are the ones who care about min/maxing a 15 year old game, and they can fuck off while everyone else enjoys the game.
---
Of they ever remake Diablo II... I don’t know if I’ll ever need another game.
---
The old server list for NA:
---
https://i.imgur.com/VeCUTyO.png
---
I dunno how many they need to open, but I'll bet "a lot".
---
For whatever reason Brazil &amp; Latin Americas players as a whole are just bad at video games. Idk why, but whenever I encounter them on my teams online (wow, battlefield, etc.) they just suck so bad that they drag the entire team down.
---
You're very welcome! I hope it comes in handy!
---
You might wanna get close to me at this point
---
I feel like people have a warped sense of whats correct in the "rolling system". To me if its a BoE Epic it is fair game for every one in the group because of how important gold is. Unless you are in a guild group and everyone's main focus is advancing the team then this should be how its done always.
---
Yeah, the OP did.
---
So everyone else in your analogy is also in the special Olympics and losing to you...try trolling without misusing analogies.
---
Loot EVERYTHING and vendor it or sell it at the auction house if it's worth anything. 
---
Always have food and water in your bag. 
---
Level first aid regardless of your class.
---
Use your mouse to turn your character more dynamically and not your keyboard.
---
They have staff developing the game. Just be glad it isn’t at a premium sub price.
---
I know a guy who maps his WASD onto ESDF so he can have extra keys to the left.
---
In Germany even the PvE Server is full...
---
&gt;You're right about pallys tho.
---
Okay, first of all: How dare you?
---
And second: I know exactly what I'm getting myself into with Paladin. I like to think they just require a more open mind than other classes (except maybe Druid). I'm curious to see how much I can accomplish on this "meme" class.
---
I'm gonna make it a new meme where it's a normal Paladin coming after you and you sleep but when Lothenar, Hero of the Alliance comes for you, it's real shit.
---
Paladins are arguably the strongest PVP healer in many contexts. Ever try to kill a Pally/Warr duo?
---
Did we get 50k members in one week?
---
I remember having los issues with my gnome where I couldn't attack as easily as other races
---
Here's mine
---
Main bar: 12345QERTFZX
---
Second bar: Ctrl+12345QERTFZX
---
Third bar: Alt+12345QERTFZX
---
Fourth bar: Shift+12345QERTFZX
---
Fifth bar: mouse3 ctrl+m3 alt+m3 shift+m3 mouse wheel Up mousewheelDOWN
---
Tilde key is Special Action 1 for Stealth
---
Ctrl gets bound to mouse5, Alt bound to mouse4, Shift remains.
---
respect
---
We are past the no changes phase. Changes are already implemented whether we like it or not. 
---
Vanilla had plenty of cinematics/trailers. I for one would not mind a modern blizzard touch on the cinematic front considering it would not affect gameplay but rather simply serve to better immerse us.

You're definitely right about that. Not being able to afford spells 'cause you chose to buy a 6 slotter from the vendor? That alone will frustrate a few people, I'm sure. 
---
I do think gold will be easier to get in Classic by virtue of all of us *starting* the game already knowing so much, but it'll still take work/consideration to save up what we need.
---
It was a good challenge on my paladin too but the rewards were definitely worth it
---
I hate most modern mounts. I mostly use some variation of a nightsaber.
---
Hunter.  
---
SPriest are very strong 1v1, but in BGs, it's rarely 1v1. Priest durability is simply too weak.
---
Where's the meme?
---
My finger can reach the 7 key if I use max effort. And my clicking speed is through the roof for the rest. See you at rank 14.
---
I didn’t even know stalagg had a discord
---
Rebind r (reply) to t, f (assist) to g, and then c (char sheet) to b.    
---
You can now bind 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, q, e, r, f, z, x, c, v, mouse3, mouse 4 for 16 binds.  
---
Now add another version with all of that plus shift for 32 binds.    
---
If you're really keen add another set with alt for 48 binds.
---
Alliiance lock is SL, circle never starts.
---
Oh for someone reason I had thought you had to skin the crocs, and so I was convinced I would have to keep skinning and not pick up tailoring which would obviously suck for bloodvine
---
Is it possible for people to get in full realms? My 2 friends are playing wow for first time and subbing at launch and were on whitemane where the rest of our friends are currently are with characters reserved.
---
Upvoted for truth
---
Don’t give blizzard your money then.
---
OH shit... I forgot about ropetown.
---
I get it, and I thank you and the other folks whose hard work made Questie so great for so long. It's just a little off-putting seeing you plug (and let's be honest, that's what you're doing) your addon in another dev's post. 
---
I stand by what I said. Make your own post. It would be really well recieved!
---
Luckily, my wife will be going on an extended work trip abroad around the time classic comes out. I have no other obligations other than coaching a soccer team, so we're really going to get close to my vanilla experience where I only worked nights in a restaurant.
---
You can't get it with 34. The PreQuest in Desolace requires you to kill 30! Level38-39 Skeletons and good luck getting a full SM Group with Level34!
---
add me to that list..when i realized theyre trying to scam off half a month i was like ..nope  ill wait lol
---
hunters are one of those classes
---
So the retail guys with little interest downloaded a separate client to reserve a name for a game they’d assume just doesn’t exist?
---
Don't know if it surpasses but druids come close.
---
yeah, full does not mean locked. if they get too full they will lock them though.
---
Even with reserving each run after roughly 50 runs, I still went around 110 runs total without even seeing it drop. Got probably 30 people their offhand.  Run it once on my mage alt a month later and it drops.
---
My luck in a nutshell.
---
Pet classes tend to have a decently high skill ceiling, yeah.
---
I think the question of skill ceiling depends on the scenario at hand. You mean in PvP? PvE? Farming? Leveling? RP? 
---
Cuz Paladins have the highest skill ceiling in RP hands down.
---
hunters are always a mess to fight. even bad ones
---
Kk cool thx.
---
what class
---
I bought a predator gaming lap top for like900 almost a year ago. Semce  your budget is 3k I would recommend somthing along those lines. 
---
For me playing wow on a big screen is to much, and it sounds like you don't have a desk set up.
---
The only thing that would draw me off of Herod is a CST/EST RP PVP in Chicago.
---
I really hope Pagle falls into the sweet spot of being not-Herod levels of attractiveness, but just enough to hit a consistently high population.
---
Anyone else find these spreadsheets just mega cringe? its a video game, just play and have fun.
---
I have a few professions guides on my site: https://shadowpanther.net
---
Which means near guaranteed raid spot if they have a lot of melee.
---
Building it yourself would be cheaper for more power.
---
Thing is, ally will have those same warriors. Alliance will have pallies from the get go though, which puts horde at a massive disatvantage right out of the gate.
---
What's wrong with ED? Its one of the better servers on retail
---
I believe so. With all of the advertising they’re doing and the hype that’s ever growing as we get closer and closer, I don’t doubt it at all.
---
You've never played a warlock lol
---
Both. Except I have a Forsaken Mage.
---
HD remake with higher resolutions supported. Take my money.
---
If Blizzard did not use load based scaling systems we could as well be living in 2006.
---
smol
---
I feel bad for the poor saps rolling on Faerlina
---
Every dungeon while leveling can be healed as retribution spec. Just make sure to keep your holy gear updated through quest rewards, drops etc. It's pretty easy to do since you can wear everything(plate,mail,leather,cloth), so don't stress that part. Other than that just level as ret. Make the switch to holy at 60.
---
They probably just started with conservative estimates. 
---
You can always add servers but you can't take them away
---
I have a sneaky suspicion that a server or two will pop up post-launch at minimum.
---
That's awesome! Seems like a cool fella
---
Except we exist in real life. Games having a gatekeeper defined by the machines ability. You can’t win this argument due to above stated things. Csgo is widely popular over 1.6. It’s the same game but difference is graphics. Why is 1 more popular?
---
That used to be the norm, but I wasn't sure if times have changed.
---
I’ll just pay Blizzard with my mortgage payment
---
Ah, I see. I misunderstood what you were talking about then. Figured you were referring to ingame cinematics, where the only that really are in the game are said race introduction cinematics. I do not think those will be changed, on account of them having been part of the stresstest and there only being a bit over a week until launch.
---
As for trailers for patches and the like... who knows. I could see them putting together trailers for the new phases they had planned out. Personally I don't think so, though. There's just not much reason to.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxg1ia/perhaps\_my\_easytolearn\_keybinding\_makes\_it\_less/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxg1ia/perhaps_my_easytolearn_keybinding_makes_it_less/)
---
I and one other friend are the only ones in my group that subbed, and I only did it so I could fix my addons during the stress test. 
---
That's two out of the nine to ten people I'll play with at launch.
---
To play devil's advocate you could argue it was more to see how many people to actually expect. They really could have no way of knowing how many people are serious about jumping in at launch and this gives them the most clear outlook.

Yessir

He said “weren’t many” which is true.

So much misinformation here it hurts. This is coming from a horde player myself.

it would not be classic or a blizzard product if you got to play
---
Heck, even the Oceanic servers are both sitting at medium.....nice.
---
Brokebois rationalizing hard how 7.50 makes you a consumer slave lmao.
---
You get a free combat drop with shadowmeld...can stealth after that. Pretty OP racial if you ask me :)
---
Can I still make character on a full server?
---
One of my favs is the hunter quest line for the staff and bow. One of my favorite memories.
---
&gt; is now on their 20s and 30s, they will have much less time available
---
Even in my 40s, I will fucking *make* time, or be sleepy a lot.
---
Priest is arguably easier but shamans are always in high demand
---
Stalagg looking better each day.  Not a shill, just considering...
---
At this time there are no plans to add expansions to classic. -per blizzard.
---
I think you can change the tracking settings on questi to show all quests even if you out level them. At least that’s what it sounded like when I glanced at the settings during the stress test
---

Fucking ded

They've said each layer will emulate maximum server size during vanilla, so around 3k
---
It's so bad! I'm literally sitting here 15 years later remembering endless ganks, upon unsuspecting ganks, that escalate into skirmishes that morph into full on battles as 60s swarm from no where to take vengeance. 
---
If all this sounds epic, it is, but equal to the agony of being 98% towards leveling up and being unable to finish  your last quest is maddening.
---
as opposed to alliance shaman
---
When I was playing the stress test, I was surprised that the grey items that were dropping in the starting area, were sometimes better than the quest rewards.
---
This is amazing.
---
The best bit is that the WoW Classic Timeline BEGINS in 2010 with Cata. 
---
Also, I have to say, looking at the Phases 1 through 6. Every phase has me exited. Every single one is going to bring awesome stuff that I'm so excited for. 
---
Guys and gals we are staring down the barrel of 2 (or more) years of the finest gaming content ever created.

Textbook Shadow Priest. Hunters don't really shit on people, they are more obnoxious and help their team through defensive utility. Shadow Priest doesn't really offer anything to their team aside from offensive dispels (can be important on Alliance) but they're really strong 1v1.
---
Well, I got this Macro on classic/TBC. Im not sure if this still works:
---
/use [nomodifier]Deadly Poison IX; [modifier:alt] XXX; [modifier:ctrl] Mind-numbing Poison; [modifier:shift] Woundpoison VII; 
---
/use [button:1] 16; [button:2] 17
---
For Deadly poison click left for your Mainhand and right for your offhand.
---
If you want to apply Mind-numbing Poison, just ctrl-click the macro,
---
for wound poison shift-click, etc.
---
Don't forget to change the ranks of the poisons!
---
Druid are great for 5man. They can fulfill all roles (though Moonkin probably OOM faster). Their just stuck as healers in Raid.  
---
Lock rotation is a bit boring, but they get quite strong toward end of Classic due to scaling well with gear. Also we have 16 slot debuff out the gate, making Locks more viable than Vanilla was.  
---
For Priest, you're going to be healing near full time. If you remotely don't like the idea, don't roll Priest. For pvp, their strong 1v1, but in group fight, their squishy.
---
Not the video the community deserves. The video it needs.
---
Also discord. Me and the boy back in the day would be on the home phone for hours not knowing about vent and stuff like that.
---
Now that I think about it, OG wasn't even ahead of us.. it was ropetown.  OG was mainly pvp until later on.
---
I don't think attrition is even about difficulty.
---
I think it's more the fact that you can play Classic for 'free' as long as you already have a subscription to retail. So anyone who is paying for retail is potentially someone who is going to try Classic for a little bit, even if they have no plans to stick around long term.
---
Priest imo with warrior friend. The armor talent for him is nutty
---
If you ever find yourself thinking: "wow there's a lot of skeletons in the ground here" you're already dead.
---
Damn your really playing with fire 😂
---
Nah. Part of the difficulty was access to good information and the learning curve of being a newer player. Most people are well beyond that, and there are unlimited vanilla wow resources now. Yeah, the game is harder than retail, more time consuming, tedious, etc. But it doesn't take much skill to get to 60 and be a successful raider.
---
Private servers have nothing to do with the client.
---
Yeah seems like it's really easy for them to add servers so it looks like they'll just add them as they fill up, which seems like a pretty good strategy to me.  The hard part is evening them out with transfers though, especially after launch.
---
Vanilla WoW still technically existed prior to Cataclysm. They started with the Cata events because it fundamentally changed all of the Vanilla zones.

Compared to retail, vanilla is pretty anti instant gratification, or delayed gratification.

Do you think Druids will be needed more on Ally or Horde?

I want to play pally cause the toolkit is great
---
Which one is in more demand?
---
!remindMe 11 days
---
Going off of replies below, I would like to say that one of the reasons I chose Paladin is because, as Ret, I can just auto and buff and supplement my autos. I like that idea. Same for Shaman on Horde side. I don't want to be given anything. One of the many, many reason that Ret is bad DPS is because you just auto and you spend a lot of time doing other, utility thing. Going by DPS as a metric for raiding in Classic is just bad play. Maybe for your main DPS classes, but if I'm 16th (is that a good guess?) on the dps meters but I've also kept buff uptime and healing on point and avoided mechanics and followed instructions, then I shouldn't be laughed into rerolling just because I can't do Warrior DPS. I mean, who even can, anyways?
---
I think this feeling is what has gotten a lot of people riled up about "balancing" and such. To say that entire classes shouldn't be played because they're bad DPS in a couple early raids, is insane and only 1% of the population is going to think that way.
---
I work from 7-5:30 and go to bed at like 10 during the week. I got like 4 hours do what i need to do after work. I can feel wow is gonna take all of it 😂😂
---
Holy crap this was very well done, I ha to watch it once for all the video sequences and then again to just read the chat log. Great job!
---
Wow is the nicest community you are going to find anywhere.  People just act hard because they scared as you are.
---
You could when I recorded it also, the problem was it did not update to the newest version. Then the other issue was it doesn't have every addon on it so it won't detect all the ones you have also.
---
I do this
---
You wanna go into work for me in 2 weeks?
---
Yep got a group of around 10 waiting to play, the money isn't an issue but none of us were willing to sub early for name reservations.

Hey. I don’t know if anyone else mentioned this. But it’s Mark Kern.
---
Where on earth are these posts that say it was 6 bucks
---
Wouldn't say cringe worthy I would just say that if a new player, or a player new to Warlocks is following this whilst playing they aren't going to have as much fun. The fun is in making mistakes, working things out for yourself and developing a style of play that you enjoy. Warlocks also have quite a lot of utility and ability to adapt to new situations which you are not going to know about if all you have done is follow a guide that says 'do this, do that, use this spell rotation'.
---
Been rushing to 60. It’s not the worst.
---
Warriors have no heals outside of food. And only 1 cc. The caster acts as a peeler when he gets overwhelmed along with spot heals.
---
Naivety does mean a lack of experience but it’s generally used in terms of worldly things that aren’t taking your feelings or well being into top consideration. If you trust in someone you love but they just want to use you, you’re naive. If you thought something in a video game did one thing but it did another, that video game wasn’t trying to take advantage of you or trick you. A better term to use that provides more clarity on the context would be “I was mistaken” or “inexperienced”. I question what the point is of having such a broad yet intricate language if we aren’t going to push ourselves to take advantage of said intricacies.
---
They will give the same vague answer.
---
Because they’re smart and betting 50%+ quit after two months. This prevents dead servers. People will be happy in the end. You might think you want it, but you don’t. 🤣
---
Yes? Legion and BFA were seamless
---
Priest are better healers than shamans by far
---
Since the stress test, I can't play anything else.  Every game seems stale and boring in comparison.  I've installed and uninstalled 10 games in the last 10 days.  That's how addictive Classic WoW is.  You don't want to miss the launch because games that good just don't release anymore.
---
No. It's precious.
---
What vanilla did you play? Ninja looters were all over left and right.
---
This is gold
---
When you lose half your player base, servers seem to have more space on em 😂
---
Sounds uncomfortable, I wouldn't play if I were you
---
Probably alliance. A shaman is wanted in every group for raids and that cuts down on healer slots for other classes. Plus, priest are absolutely needed in horde raids since they don't have paladins to dispell. So, that again cuts down on druid slots.  
---
Flip side, pally buffs are better than any totem for druids. Windfury does fuck all for feral. But you get warstomp for pvp on horde side and that's way better than shadowmeld.
---
Settle down you chad, that was a pretty interesting read.
---
I have always wanted a completionist addon as well. The existing quest-related addons are so bloated and UI-distracting.   
---
I just want a quest-complete log. I haven't seen anything like that though.
---
Females are a race? I learn something new everyday

"there's a lot of excitement around Classic, and it's really exceeded our expectations already. But it's really difficult to predict sustained engagement post-launch"
---
Game is dead in a year.
---
Jajajajaj
---
Spec only matters in dungeons. Level up in your damage spec. But if you got a dedicated leveling buddy then you can play tank/healer/whatever, most things will die easily 
---
To answer your question, role doesnt matter in world questing.
---
/r/woooosh
---
Troll or Undead Mage? I want to focus on pvp but I'd like to gear up in pve as well.
---
Would not make a difference.  These are people that think BFA is the second best expansion after Legion.  I prefer my mmo's to be more RPG and less call of duty so I will stick to classic.
---
Yep clique works for hotkeys too (at least on retail it does). I have my despell set to 7
---
Spriest is countered really hard by shamans so I wouldn’t advise going it on ally. Ele shamans will purge &amp; 1 shot you, and tremor your only cc :P
---
I think hunter is better across the board , especially for AV and turtling AV. Can trap/flare choke points, hunters have a really easy time vs rogues, and are great defenders. Spriests have some good matchups 1v1 but get blown up really easily, and their burst damage is really low so it is easy to dispel and heal through. As spriest you are just always better off as disc :/
---
absolutely disgusting
---
Boar is low deeps. Cat produces more damage thus more threat.
---
Such an anti Community vibe
---
Your warrior and rogue friends are getting hard thinking about always having windfury totem.
---
r/whoosh
---
10 days, 18 hours and 45 minutes now
---
I agree.
---
that reminds me of one of my favorite interactions when I was a youngling (though bc I think) poking my head into hillsbrad foothills a little early and finding someone at least 10 levels higher than me from the other side around there trying to pick a fight with noobs and somehow my good old warlock bloodmage fought him off long enough for him to back off for whatever reason it was a good win
---
Pretty sure Layering only exists so the Blizz devs that worked on retail can take credit for something.  Afterall, if Classic is successful, that kind of makes retail look like trash (not saying retail *is* trash objectively, only that it would *look* bad).
---
That is part of the original experience, we account credits because of the servers.
---
Agree with others there will be a decline and then good server levels.
---
Title: FNG
---
Yeah, I think I agree with this. Under typical norms, people can be pressured into wearing items that they value less than the gold they'd get from selling it, just for the sake of defending their right to roll on it. 
---
Actually, the ideal norm would probably for the group to split the gold from the item's sale, because that would make the gold gained more consistent, less spiky. However, that would require lots of trust between participants, and keeping track of it could be a little difficult.

Ah, the Overwatch players, what’s that? I think I hear mother calling you for dinner.
---
This is what they want you to believe and what they actually want to happen. Because its a massive slap in the face if it doesn't. Its pretty much saying your most up-to-date WoW is dogshit.
---
That's what they say now assuming Classic will fail after a couple months, until they get 1m+ active players and decide that doing some sort of alternating release schedule with retail (kind of like call of duty) would make them a ton of money. Then all of a sudden burning crusade is on the table.
---
If you think they'd launch phase 2 on some servers before others depending on population, you're insane. There's absolutely no way in hell that would ever happen. Can you imagine the shitstorm that would cause?
---
Thank you if there are recent.
---
I find that in the last 10-15 years, my tolerance for playing games has decreased. I used to play every game until I beat it or got 100% completion. Now I'm lucky if I get through half a game.
---
I'm excited as hell to play classic, but I can't ignore my responsibilities like I used to.
---
Do you have a source for that?
---
Yes lmao..especially people that ask for guides on how to stretch and what to eat..like bro relax

---
First I want to say great style. Why is her hair dark though?
---
Well honestly in a raid situation you tend to use 5-7 abilities all the time. And have 5-10 for situational issues. 
---
You want to set up strafe as your a and d keys. Using RMB to adjust direction. 
---
If your a healer you need to learn click casting macros and addon systems (more mouse based). 
---
If you are a dps you tend to have more macros then a healer or tank and he majority of the binds tend to be keyboard based simply because of the shear number of keys you can bind on a keyboard vs a mouse. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
I am currently applying for jobs I almost hope I don’t start til mid September
---
Sorry I just skim read.
---
100% keen but it would have to be in a later content patch after all the Original classic content had been added.
---
They could do something like where they release all the old content and then start releasing stuff they never got to release or was just a concept at the time.
---
Out of curiosity what kind of gear was that?
---
Was it hard to get etc?
---
windowlicker dude
---
They could please both. Same talents, same skills, maybe even gear of TBC. Just classic+ world.  Maybe a mix of TBC and classic +.
---
Perfect explanation. Just like in real life, reputation goes a long way. Hopefully there won't be many shitty people after the first month. All the autistic impatient ding dongs will get bored and go back to retail
---
No buddy, there will be a totalnof 3 jimmies and 5 Bobs playing classic so stay assured that you'll be absolutely and exclusively the only one playing with such a unique and absurd way.
---
You sure about that?
---
So that’s what they told you eh?
---
i'm going to laugh when I see a hunter with thunderfury all item belong to hunter

Gnomes can run under the railings in a lot of instances saving travel time. I.E. the rail above the shadow panther temple in ZG.

On my twink, i enjoyed using the pink flamingo, mazzaranche or whatever it was called, from mulgore. If there's one pet I wouldn't want to be taken down by, that's the one.
---
Yea hopefully it becomes the best resource because of how easy it is, especially for updating addons. Since updating them manually means that you have to check if there is an updated version for each of the addons you have, which can be a real pain.
---
Can you provide a download link?
---
=O
---
I played a hunter in vanilla. I could compete with the rogues and mages in my guild that was because we only brought 2 or 3 hunters in a 40 man, which led to us getting geared out pretty quick. Once we got to aq 40 and naxx I became less of a priority and loot was based on tokens not drops. Shamans would get the tokens early on for extra heals and progression. Bwl and Aq I was there for kiting and pet pulling mobs and for one Aq 40 fight just a resistance soak with some dps. As for PvP I could one shot clothies and leather with aim shot. If you know how to use feign death, scatter shot, and traps you can be a beast at 1v1. Also in ubrs and lbrs with difficult pull you can double ice trap which can turn a pull from a difficult one to a much more manageable one.
---
I do. I got BC at gamestop at midnight. Huge line, good people, much fun.
---
Mark this one as a lesson learned.
---
Is that because of the 11 points in holy for consecration?
---
I'm for either one, but if they go TBC I won't be jumping on the #nochanges train this time around. Get rid of instanced arena's and modify flying. Let players schedule arena matches with other teams in the world and let the community spectate them. As for flying they could create forts in certain areas of the zones for each faction to control that allow their factions to fly in that zone. Similar to the areas in Nagrand and Helfire Penninsula, but this way it would give more incentive capture them.
---
Somehow i knew what that was even before i clicked it.
---
Thats no what I said?
---
I said "little interest in swapping classic for playing retail." I imagine they all want to try it out for a week or two, hell the name reservation is advertised on the WoW launcher as they log in. 
---
Also the classic client is a few gigabytes which downloads in the background in a few mins, its not exactly some huge barrier to entry.
---
i'd say if the idea of pissing a bunch of people off and then bubble hearthing sounds fun to you, do paladin. 
---
otherwise, priests are super fun with a ton of tricks in the arsenal and are the most powerful healers in vanilla so go forth and heal, friend
---
In the majority of PvP situations there’s really no such thing as “longer fights” in classic.
---
Spell Reflect is TBC though.
---
Warriors are shit without support. It's just how it is. World PvP will be a bummer and your Rogue buddy is honestly better off just going without you so he can stealth around and kill people on his own. But the chances that you are completely without support in a 10v10 (or 15v15, or 40v40) battleground are low. You will do just fine there.
---
Definitely looking for both PVP and PVE flexibility. I want to be able to deal with the massive amount of hunters and rogues that I will encounter on a pvp server.
---
time to show boomkins and feral druids some love this time around bois
---
That's what they all say until they hit that wall.
---
No real concern since you don't really scatter + FD + trap, when a FD + trap macro can do that already.
---
Ppl who use scatter + FD/trap is wasting scatter's potential. :/
---
This is really illuminating, i love this idea exactly why i made this post
---
If it is a retard patrol, it means they are patrolling for retards - streamer is the retard.
---
Whitemane too.
---
Agreed
---
Ive spent more than that on extra cheese.
---
Then certain people get mad when their name is suddenly taken by the person who has it on the server they were merged into.
---
This isn't exactly true, they've posted that the pop levels listed for *all* servers are updated to reflect expected queue times and population come launch. It's not just Herod.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/extended-queues-expected-on-select-realms/253658
---
Yeah armor is much better than windfury, lol.
---
Hopefully with classic being out an more time for people to realize we need help more often just maybe people will become more sociable?
---
Man I love these
---
Arms is not slightly less optimal. Its significant. Even casual guilds will most likely want ideal specs because it makes everything easier. Nobody wants to carry a dps through the content just so that person doesn't have to respec for pvp like everyone else
---
Good to know, thanks so much!
---
L O fucking L, a skilled feral druid can kill any class in the game. Someone has never seen 1.12 pvp videos. I'm going to laugh when you come back here crying when the big bad kitty corpse camps you.
---
But then again, wouldn't hunters have more utility to dick around with ppl? Like send pet at enemy and just hide... etc
---
It’d be nice to know. Ten minutes and I’d roll on Herod. Any longer and it’s just not worth it to me.
---
Or they could do you know... what ever other game does. An open beta. But hey gotta make sure no actual fans of the game get to play, Just streamers and their girlfriends who play for a day and never touch it again. 
---
People bitch about how people in an open beta dont file bug reports, how many of the streamers, their friends and girlfriends ect do you think are putting in bug reports. even if only 5% of players in an open beta did file, would be a hell of alot more then the closed beta got.

I think you misunderstood his point. He's saying that Blizzard would never design an AQ like event with their current design philosophy because they treat every single player like a hero. They used to make you work for that and you'd actually stand out for it.
---
Show some love for Whitemane!

Because mage is better in just about every way in vanilla (except for summons)
---
See that's your problem right there human priests only give like +15 healing with the extra spirit, and you miss out of fear ward.
---
Scrolled way too long to find this.
---
great if you love incomplete and basic info. not hating but the guides are for absolute beginners and they aren’t 100% accurate.
---
Imagine getting offended at a company for selling things
---
I remember one trash pull with two mobs in it, that was considered untankable. So we'd have a hunter kite one away and Feign Death while we handled the other. On trash. Good times.
---
When I did that pull in one go, tanking both, on my tankadin I was like "Aw yeah I am a great tank!".
---
I was just talking about this to someone. If they botch the launch there is a good chance many people will leave.
---
Sea of thieves was super hyped and they botched the launch. Game is actually decent now, but you know what's missing? Players. Why? Because it was screwed up when they actually had people excited.
---
You have to build on the excitement, not let them down. Recipe for disaster.
---
As someone who originally mained nelf in vanilla and then was blown away by how different the game felt one I started focusing more on my priest alt I totally understand what you mean by “incomplete class”. Other people won’t get it but that shit was like night and day. Everything just felt harder on the Druid even being resto. 
---
That said I’m going orc shaman this time. Kek kek zug zug bitches.
---
They won't handle this the same way as actual vanilla; we won't be seeing more servers as pop grows. We will start seeing more *layers* on each server as pop grows. When pop evens out before Phase 2, layers are gone and things should be stable.
---
I don't anticipate them adding many actual named servers unless it gets really ridiculous. They didn't have this tech 15 years ago, and it solves all the problems with transfers.
---
Add RP server to mess with swabians

"Underrated"

Oh no, minor mechanics that have little to no effect over how I, personally, plan to play a game! The only time I would ever follow strict guidelines to minmax and top charts would be when I want to. But if I’m here just to play a game at my own leisure, then I’ve no need to worry about stuff like that.

This made me lol. Ty

The adventure is the best part, just go at your pace. Only 10% of players will rush to 60. You'll be surrounded by people to casually level and experience with the whole time.
---
As a developer you must know how it feels like to pair GUI calls from 2019 app with server code of 2006.
---
You can infinite cc people as mage with engineering. 
---
Scatter &amp; trap sharing DR is a big nerf to hunters :p
---
Mage has more utility than any class in the game for pvp. So much cc :) and good burst. Hunter does very low damage to high armor classes
---
This is super biased. A lot of people preferred Cata over Pandaland. Most will agree WoD was a big miss. 
---
And interest for Vanilla happened when TBC released, not 4 years later.
---
You kite, you drain mana from Mages + Priests, you send your pet on casters to make it impossible for them to cast spells, you break Rogues out of stealth, and you scatter + trap. Hunters are even pretty beefy when talented for PvP (+15% stamina).
---
You always want a good Hunter on your team. You will take a Shadow Priest if you're Alliance because Priests are your only source of offensive dispels, but you don't necessarily seek them out either. Horde doesn't care for Shadow Priests at all because Shaman are much better in that role.

---
So, it’s impossible to roll on those servers now?
---
priests, shamans not as good in the end game dungeons.
---
I just realised the one thing that could actually get me to play through the expansions... reskinning all the models in the game to have giant googly eyes.
---
REMOVE LAYERING COMPLETELY!!!!!!! @Blizzard!!!!!!!
---
Ya, I trained one handed swords on a level 2 rogue in this last stress test. I heard about it and wanted to see for myself.
---
Proud of you for getting to the top! It’s really paying off now!
---
No, ugly is still just ugly. Like, fat people are still fat, even if they love their fat bodies and aren't ashamed of it. Saying "I'm beautiful" when you're ugly is great for your self esteem, but you're still just .. ugly. lol
---
For the horde!
---
Errr... I'm playing alliance this go though.
---
The only time I came close to hating the Horde was leveling in STV when the honor system first came out. I just wanted to kill some fucking tigers but I'd have to pop every cool down and hide in the bushes waiting for roving bands of camping level 60s just out being dicks.
---
Hummus and pita bread will go a looooong way as well!
---
I've never used LUA, but if i'm looking at this correct, they could just comment out line 629 in map.lua, correct?
---
My burning desire to not spend my Game time reading quests in vanilla, taught me how to be very effective at skimming for necessary information. 
---
It’s a sickness now though, even when I want to sit down and read a novel I skim ...
---
It will likely be met with contempt, shit talking, and butthurt jealousy.
---
remulos confirmed for dead server
---
I mean you can create 3 characters, then its waiting til the game actually launches on the 26th
---
So much this. I was probably the only Ret Paladin in TBC that managed to get 2k arena rating needed for the glowy shoulders on my server. Used to have people come and chat to me about it all the time and end up making friends to do battlegrounds. It was good times.
---
Mixed feelings here.. when they first did it if i remember you had 2 specs you could swap but to change any talent points in either you still had to pay to respec. I personally remember this coming into the game and omg fucking awesome!! But on the other hand this would be a big change to add to the classic servers.. ya know, #nochanges an all...
---
If you care about pvp undead is by far the better choice imo. It has a lot more game impact. Going troll will simply be a small dps increase every 3 mins :P
---
It gets worse by the day.
---
If it was up to me I would play Human Priest, I like the extra spirit idea(even though it doesn't add a lot of +healing) and the +rep bonus.  But after looking at the pros of Dwarf Priest with stoneform and fear ward, and desperate prayer it is a must.
---
During the stress test whites were life. I only had 2 greens by the time it ended.
---
&gt;boil 
---
What am I? A chemist? Hotdogs are already cooked.
---
Well yeah, going through as Fury and respecing for dungeons and raids. Thanks for the advice though.
---
Not like that at all.  More like  "I'll just stealth to the back, sap one add, and blow all my cooldowns to kill him and another right next to him in under 20 seconds, then vanish all the rest of the aggro away.
---
Sounds intriguing, I'll be in the hunt for a hardcore guild with pvp aspirations. See you on launch!
---
Prot warrior is the most Saugus after class. It’s the Hybrid classes that are weak(er) at this stage.
---
This is a vibe. With all this political discourse and pedo shit in the news. I just want to stick my ostrich head in a nice warm sand hole I call Classic.
---
Which is precisely the point,  Blizzard stopped developing a game they wanted to play, because as they’ve said, they don’t have time anymore, they play mobile games. Instead, wow started to try to please more and more people, to the point where they had enticed entirely different groups of people with mutually exclusive understandings and ideas as to what the game was and how it should’ve developed going forward. They tried to please everyone and now please nearly no one.
---
Looking forward to the orc one!
---
So, “authentic classic experience”.
---
Well shit.. I'm jumping back in and I have a decent monitor, but I literally am still using a 5ish year old laptop to run WoW at roughly 34fps. Out of college, but dont like spending money
---
Absolutely feel the same!
---
Horde has totems, which is supposed to decrease the kill time of any boss.
---
You can definitely get into a raiding guild as human or night elf but it's not the optimal choice.
---
Dwarf is optimal choice, just go Dwarf and do not even consider Human or Night elf priest.
---
Communication, as a married guy who's hyped for classic. I just told my wife ahead of time that I wanted some time to play this game so she knows why I would be playing video games to an extreme. Outside of the launch days, I just prioritize my family always first and then there is always time for gaming after. It's not crazy amounts but easily 6 to 10 hours a week. Sometimes it's waking up early or staying up late, but I try to dedicate a week day or like a Friday to gaming and then the rest of the nights are family nights.
---
How do you know that Thalnos is the Brazilian server or that Herod is for PvP? I can see how you know Faerlina is the streamer server because they announced it but how do you know about the others?
---
How do u tell which is which?
---
Legend!
---
cool, i've never seen that. Interesting so many people here are saying 'blizz will never remove layering' when, here is a blizz employee giving very specific examples of how they must remove it after phase 1.
---
Warlock lv60 mount still costs 600g
---
You don't need to worry then.  Just don't attack any anyone of the opposite faction, or heal/buff anyone who is pvp flagged. (has the shield in the nameplate)
---
The changes to Cata zones were fairly well received, actually. Maybe not among the peers here, but they did help to make early leveling more bearable as the level cap was now 85.
---
There were other reasons Cataclysm didn't do as well, some reasons being:   
---
As the WC3:FT plot was wrapped up, many saw the original Warcraft plot as being finished.
---
Cataclysm raids returned to a higher level of difficulty, which had alienated some casual players as the WotLK raids were considerably easier.
---
Firelands and Dragon Soul raid tiers were too long, and there were large content droughts.
---
Nobody really cites the zone revamps as the real issue with Cata, and a lot of people liked the new quest style.
---
If you make it clear that it's italian to the folks joining, then fair play, but if you invite an english speaker and then refuse to accomodate without having given clear info on this, then you're part of the problem.
---
Priest actually has very solid sustained damage and can shunt surplus mana into healing. Warrior is very high sustained damage but cannot maintain it as they run out of health. 
---
Both classes like doing dps to multiple mobs (rend, shadow word pain), but cannot actually do this solo without mobs beating on them (as they either lack good snares or they are melee range). 
---
In addition, warrior loves charging, as it's a very powerful ability, but it causes mobs to stack on him and hit him (as charge is a stun, giving nearby mobs which you aggro time to run over to the now STUNNED pimary target). But if the mobs are already running in a different direction... well, it's not AOE threat or anything. It's just a stun and a bunch of free rage. 
---
The basic concept is simple: the Priest dots up mobs. The warrior charges in and starts rending them after the priest has aggroed them. The mobs run to the priest while the warrior can follow them over as he likes, and pull aggro only as appropriate. Then the warrior can pull aggro if any mobs remain once they reach the healer. 
---
This does a several things: it lets both the priest and the warrior use their best spells, which are damage over time abilities that require multiple targets to be great. It lets the pair do this while not actually taking the damage of multiple mobs as the mobs are running at the priest. And it gives the pair a massive margin of safety, as now the priest can spend their mana healing a target with much better mitigation that does not have a problem with pushback. 
---
To be clear, though, you don't do this as prot. You do it as arms. Prot is not for leveling, at all. It's for tanking at level 55+.
---
Man I just want to murder Hogger.
---
Let the priest get the last hit on mobs for spirit tap and neither of you will have to eat or drink unless you do a huge pull.
---
This was a system in an MMO called Lost Chaos i played as a kid in 2007(?) and this system was one of the coolest part of that game. The town square had players everywhere setting up shop and hollering for potential customers.
---
I remember people wanting to set up shop in the most trafficked areas and those spots were highly contested among the playerbase. Something like this would be absolutely amazing imo...
---
I was mainly talking about early level. Everyone always talks about that early mount being free/cheaper than other classes.
---
Of course, happy to share with the community. Enjoy!

dude the game releases in 1 1/2 weeks lol
---
It's a dagger from the Edge of Madness event in ZG, but looks like a sword. Could be totally wrong but I think thats correct.
---
Smallest hit box. Basically the opposite of Taurens. Helpful to avoid melee a little bit. I think they also have a slightly smaller aggro radius making it harder to ass-pull and wipe.
---
shoot, me too... i'm waiting for a bit longer.
---
I'm sorry in advance for any alliance on shazz EU
---
My responsibilities nag at me at until I know for a fact I have everything done. Even after, there's still a voice in the back of my head asking if I've forgotten to do something. It can be annoying at times, but on the bright side, at least stuff doesn't get neglected.
---
And if you got no money honey....
---
Agreed, only reason I subscribed early was for the 3 day stress test this past weekend.
---
Sure. Doesn't change the fact that's what they currently said. I don't remember them ever saying we won't fly in Azeroth.
---
This will be one of the best experiences in all of gaming. I think it's gonna be better than the old days.
---
lol ok dude
---
Hah got em
---
Hosting a server of a game and profiting off of it against the wishes of the creator that’s exactly what streamers do. Exact same situation. Never mind the fact the wow streamers pay the sub and help blizzard out.
---
i actually love to buy the first white items from npc if i can, its actually quite the difference!
---
Oh yeah dude just not necessary til late 50s
---
Tab
---
I’m currently on Herod and Stalagg is the only other server I’m considering possibly switching to
---
In the case of italians for me, I tend to avoid the italian servers when looking for group members for keystones and whatnot, because having to use google translate to explain basic boss tactics is tedious and should be an absurd and rare experience, but I've tried it far too often, and now I simply don't invite people from italian servers.
---
Respec in Classic is extremely expensive after the first few times you do it. You might be able to respec for raids at 60 a few times, but unless you're very good at making gold you'll go broke quick trying to respec to Prot every time you run a dungeon.
---
Fortunately, you can go pretty fast and loose with your talents as you level, so take the bare essentials for tanking and keep a sword and board in your bag and you'll be fine to tank no matter what.
---
My current job pays 120k USD when fully certified. Requires only a high school diploma and you must apply before the age of 31.
---
No I'm going to rush and get lost and only read them when questie doesn't work.
---
this shit will be a warzone, probably getting insta killed right away! can't wait!
---
Glass(es) of whiskey while grinding. 
---
It's basically therapy.
---
Acidic Slime
---
You mean the faction with undead and tremor totem?
---
Rome was destroyed, Greece was destroyed, Persia was destroyed, Spain was destroyed. All great subreddits are destroyed. Why not yours? How much longer do you really think your own subreddit will last? Forever? Keep in mind that the earth itself is destined to be destroyed by the sun in twenty-five million years or so.
---
Really can't decide. I'm completely open to play anything to be honest. I just know I'll be playing horde, my friends are warrior and either warlock or mage.
---
I would love to have a easy time finding a raid at max. And it would be neet if I'd still be able to pvp in my solo time. Any ideas?
---
Great to know!
---
Yea with layering in effect, if you are waiting more than 10min queue, you are wasting your time. If the queues are too long I’ll just jump to one without queues
---
So no plans to release brand new “vanilla type content” after phase 6? If that makes any sense at all....lol
---
where tf do you live that coffee costs 7.50 lol? a large coffee is like a buck-fifty at my local Circle K.
---
Is this tauren taking a selfie? What is this trash?
---
All 4 of the subs ahead of classicwow are basically classicwow.
---
In classic+ definitely. Retailers heads would explode in jealousy lol which is probably why we won’t get it though..
---
Just occurred to me that you never mentioned which faction?
---
"We suggest that players, especially those on the Herod realm, consider creating characters on Stalagg."
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/new-wow-classic-realm-open/253667
---
Lmao that's pretty good
---
Pretty sure it was for fear, poly, sap, sleep, maybe root and yea it’s like each one it’s less and after your 3rd cast they are immune to it. Pretty basic from what I remember
---
I keep opening it and trying to get my name hoping the guy that has it will jump ship to stalagg
---
ugh i hate cosplayers like you always showing skin to try to get attent---
---
nevermind, i like the sword though! :D
---
My friends are all rolling Alliance so i suppose that's the faction.  
---
I am debating between a hunter and a warlock as I've always liked the whole "playing with a pet to tank gameplay", so i suppose it would be helpful if someone can give the pro's / cons to the races i could be and also just Warlock vs Hunter in general.
---
Hey - nice work.
---
Phase 1 being only one month would be ridiculous.  It needs to be about 3.  Phase 2 could be a month or two easily though, just pvp ranking and DM.  A month or two of absolute blood baths on pvp servers and many people will be very ready for more people in bgs and less in the world.
---
And mankrik needs more Ally
---
Minimum wage in my state is $8 or $9, IIRC.
---
Yea don’t go alliance...
---
I won't have as much time to play as I'd like but I'm excited for the ability to just log in and make progress. I cant wait to make myself a nice GnT and grind mobs in the barrens to w/e. It might only be an hour or two, but I'll be one step closer to 60.
---
Herod was called out specifically.
---
I am generally not a fan of changes like these as it's hard to predict how well they are done and the impact they have.
---
I’m going to “try” to get my obligations done first then hop on WoW, but let’s be real we all know how that is going to turn out...
---
You think that Miniature *Platinum* Discs are made of stone?
---
Hes 100% right though. Absolute trash.
---
Prot pally is good for tanking 5 mans and lbrs but drops off after that due to a lack of taunt, meaning a lot of raid tank mechanics are impossible :S
---
So many negatives i have no idea what it says
---
What about mage v sham
---
Medium pop now
---
The alternative is to not give us Classic so....
---
Yeah they saw the horde like it a lot so they removed it and gave it to Worgen
---
But you queue faster
---
I'm a die hard Gnome Warrior fan. I feel like Gnomes look great in plate gear, tbh. I don't think they looks great in cloth though. 100% Gnome mounts are sick, also.
---
no, they do not affect two handed weapons
---
Hi! Friends and I are planning to roll on a PvP server (EST), but wanna try to get on one that's balanced faction-wise. Is there a way for us to reliably tell which servers will be balanced or is that something we just gotta wait for?
---
Have also heard that PvP servers tend to lean Horde because of racials, though I'm not sure how true that is.
---
Sea of thieves was fun for a few hours until you realized there are 3 quests in the game and they are basically the same quest. Item profession being cosmetic only was also shit.
---
I fucking love the revisionist history happening these few years with Cata. 
---
Cata was lauded until Dragon Soul. One shitastic raid made everyone hate it.
---
I do this to its great, also mapped alt and shift top my mouse thumb buttons so my left hand doesnt have to stretch so crazy
---
What’s a 20 min que a couple times v dead server for all of eternity
---
I believe full means the server will have a queue when the game launches. They should still be able to create characters
---
You can create new characters on a Full realm but not on a Locked.
---
Watch out guys. The six figure guy give no fucks.
---
In 15 years, there hasn't been a single thing that wasn't hated on and mocked.
---
Hmm. I havent heard of this issue yet. Have you thried throughing the mac would the window and building a pc for a game that is over what 15 years old?
---
Hey bro... Cata was the last good expansion. It so overwhelmingly good that it spiked server populations for 2 years after a long decline.
---
Take your basic opinions elsewhere.
---
Phase 4b:  They emergancy patch Zul'Gurub's Corrupted Blood to be zone locked again.
---
Which is why wc3 remake is so important.
---
Due to personal reasons I cant even sub until the 30th. Good chance I get 0 names but I'm still stoked to play!
---
Best finger stretching video: https://youtu.be/bJjv998GNZk
---
If I'm wrong do inform but the diamond icon isn't in vanilla. #NoChanges (think added in wotlk but need citation.)
---
I do love head, and I do love grindr, good point op.
---
They just decided to give you the superior wallet
---
All I can ask for is an honest attempt. They weird leeway thing may not be accurate to vanilla, the spell batching thing was an issue I think at one point but I don't care about that stuff because the core gameplay is there. 51 talent points, progression with each level that isn't completely invalidated by welfare epics in the next patch ect. ect. I'm all for no changes but minor inconsequential stuff being off for technical reasons doesn't bother me.
---
2 warriors and a rogue?  Go Shaman!  Wind freaking fury!
---
I think you completely missed the joke of the parent comment...
---
Blood and SOIL(servers space)
---
"you think you do, but you don't"
---
How is it? I was thinking of getting one
---
I see no reason for you to sub friend. :) 
---
But for me and many others, getting my named reserved was really important, its a small but important thing for many.
---
&gt;dead for eternity
---
No, but even accepting that premise the server transfer is the “payment” I was talking about
---
Holy shit hahaha.
---
STV truly is the Vietnam of WoW pvp.
---
Thanks.  That's a relief.
---
maybe a little of-topic but i hear people say warriors get good once they get gear but how good gear are we talking?
---
are they good after they get decked out in lvl 60 dungeon blue gear or do you need raid  gear before even thinking about enjoying a OP warrior ?
---
I think it's more to help people sync up together on which sever to play on, and blizzard to see which servers has what potential population.  The name thing is just how they went about it.  I think most people who wanted to pay early to get onto a server was to lock in one with their friends, and settle on which sever to play on.
---
thanks
---
You need to review your macros. The majority are written with ancient syntax that won't work now.
---
Yeah honestly the best part of Classic for me has already started:
---
Actually having a video game I want to play. 
---
The longest I've been able to be into a game since Cataclysm and Skyrim has been 8 or 9 weeks. 
---
Single player games stop being fun after the second time for at least a year. MMOs can't hit the right balance to keep me into them for more than two months. Other online games are too reliant on entitled and bad players (I'd say toxic.. but that doesn't mean anything anymore). Hearthstone is fun for an hour a day a couple days a week, for two months a year...
---
WoW (vanilla-WotLK) is just the right game for me. I enjoy other games plenty, but there's a reason I'm coming back.
---
Just another tidbit, granted it’s really personal preference for leveling. I always go a few points into arms so I can get 2-3 in tactical mastery talent (keep rage when changing stances), then head into fury. I find it helps earlier on. It is by no means necessary though.
---
And Blizzard daupted in RP-PVP community. How could they?
---
Beard of steel.
---
Longest loading screen EVER...
---
I was at least partially kidding. At that level, anything with stats is awesome, for the ilevel increase over white if nothing else. I was thrilled when 'of the Whale' items dropped at lv10.
---
That said, one can make a strong argument that prioritizing +damage gear is going to be a bigger help leveling in the long run than +health or +recovery will (assuming equal ilevels).
---
It's not "weak" so much as totally forgetting the design pillars that mage the original wow so great.  They put a lot of effort in, changed everything, and managed to really missed the mark at the same time.
---
I agree! This wouldn't be the best format to consume while playing.
---
But for me? I was eating some fried chicken and watched the whole thing, loved it.
---
Tested it, and it works. That+questie are super useful for leveling as fast as possible.
---
Hahaha that's awesome. If only they had put in gnome druids... There's always patch 1.14!
---
Phase 2 I think.  No exact date.
---
Nope
---
Thanks. 
---
This is really nice if Poisoner won’t get updated.
---
looking good

You must be too young to understand how the world works so let me help out. If a company makes a game, they want it to succeed. Succeeding means the company gets money, and the people who made the game are happy that they still have jobs and that people like their game. You also might not know this, but there is typically more than one popular video game at a time. For example, retail WoW and FFXIV both have over a million subscribers. There are also millions more playing a plethora of other MMOs like Guild Wars 2, and Black Desert Online. Furthermore there are even games that aren't MMOs like Red Dead Redemption 2, the Civilization series, and Borderlands! Just like Classic WoW, these games are a lot different from retail WoW, and when they succeed, it's not a slap in the face to anyone! In fact, game developers are usually happy for each other.
---
Also, it's really immature and egotistical to call a game that over a million people still play dogshit. Sure, you don't like it and that's fine, but just because you don't like something doesn't mean it's bad, it just means it's not for you. If you aren't in fact 10 years old, I'm sorry for the wrong assumption. It's just that my last statement is such an obvious thing to anyone who is an adult with a functioning brain that I assumed you haven't grown. I suppose you could be in some other situation where you've never held a job for more than a month at a time. Or never done anything creative in your life. Maybe you just have a really sad existence. So anyway, sorry if I was wrong about your age.
---
Yes it was.....
---
"full" expect more than 1 hour ques to get in.
---
"Medium" expect less than 1 hour que. 
---
"Low" instant logins. 
---
Thats how its going to be.
---
Heh. Add-ons will probably be broken at launch. At least until the add on devs can patch them. Which doesn't take long
---
I wanna play human priest or mage, I'm currently doubting about priest mostly because I'm afraid people will refuse to let me into raids if I'm not a dwarf. Would that really be a big deal outside of hardcore raiding guilds?  
---
I would also love to play warrior but I don't know how viable dps warrior is without good gear.
---
Not really.  Nearly every player that has played from launch I knew left the game during that expansion.  Myself included.
---
you take that back
---
Draenor questing had some solid stories, end game was lame. The raids were actually pretty fun though. Legion I enjoyed a fair bit. I unsubbed for BFA for a lot of reasons.
---
Will use this forsure
---
Mobility and Brez are both pretty sick
---
Outside of hardcore guilds, who are min/maxing, no one cares if you're a dwarf/human/nelf priest. Heals are heals baby. Mages are absolutely fun to play; they have awesome utility. Every group wants one because of CC and the portable food/water vendor of course. Warriors are absolutely gear dependent, but wreak havoc once they get geared.
---
I wonder if any private server ever scripted it? I would love to play it, would rather them no changes though, perhaps add it into retail.
---
Late, but no - I'm leveling a new (non-undead) character and undercity still is in tact for me - but iirc if you go in on a character who it is destroyed on, there's a bronze dragon in belf form around who will let you go to uc again.
---
Warriors start to get OP in BWL gear. AQ + NAXX makes them obscene. LVL 60 dungeon blue warriors are mediocre.
---
Answer is no at most its a place to meet up before you head in.
---
That's good to hear, I barely remember vanilla so in my head back then warrior = tank. Never liked the role but always liked the class.
---
might as well make macro modifiers and save 3 bars :D
---
They are a place to meet at. That's it.
---
Pls share
---
Tbh ATM I'm thinking I'll just roll on thalnos, all my buddies got their names on it. On Herod my uncles name "madhadder" got nabbed in the first minute. I'm from Pensacola Florida myself. I think thalnos will be a great server Herod will be overcrowded and nobody will remember each other &amp; in phase 2 idk wtf they will do about the surplus..
---
It was a lot like this in vanilla. 
---
I remember people congratulating me when I came back to IF after we killed Rag in MC. 
---
And I did the same after guilds killed bosses to. 
---
People were talking about it, there was more of a interest back then.
---
Yes. I accept. 
---
Where would you like to date once sharding is removed?
---
What you heard is true but you didn't hear the whole story.
---
Pally is great PvP healer because he enables other classes to shine. With strong heals and debuff removals, you will be getting alot of *"ty bro"* whispers from people you saved.
---
Druid on the other hand is good at saving himself. With cat form and stealth and insane move speed, he's super hard to kill. But the problem is you will be ignored in PvP because everyone knows they can't kill you and they will kill your group instead.
---
And Druid have very poor support potential for other people. Just mediocre heals.
---
fuck you man i laughed out loud at work..... hahaha you should have seen all the heads turn at me
---
Honestly priest is fun PVP at 60 with disc specs
---
stoooooooooooop telling other people how to play... like jesus....
---
I have had so many people in my guild say   
---
"I WANT to play what the guild needs"  
---
contrary to waht you may think.. we arent all 1 kind of person.. some people actually do enjoy to please others more than themselves
---
&gt;"After less than 2 years, Blizzard throws in the towel on Cataclysm" 
---
It was painful reading the agenda here. TBC also lasted less than 2 years but people enjoyed that.
---
What makes druid a good transition from warlock?
---
Some people find enjoyment through contribution to a team. Best is to accept that some folks want to be optimal and some don’t.
---
Dat footwork tho
---
resto in pve raids
---
ele in pvp
---
owner class
---
Blizzards got more then enough data on its expansion releases and market research to know that these realms will more than likely level out. Herod was a bit of an outlier, since the community just decided it was going to be the place to be. Metrics also aren't clear on what 'full' means in an environment where no one has logged in.
---
How that translates into people playing is big. Then you have to take into account casual log ins, people who will stop playing almost right away. Private server data as well as historical trends show that a good chunk of people stop playing before they hit 20.
---
And, I doubt for a niche product Blizzard doesn't want to support low pop realms. They're just as expensive to run and get nasty feedback loops. Population dips too low and people stop playing because they can't find groups for content. Which causes more people to leave for the same reason.
---
The issue will be not having a resurrection far more than your healing output. Though Druids are the lowest healers too :p
---
I remember back in the day having a version of it was an addon so you could view it in game. Smeone should remake that.
---
Nice deal
---
No, I can't get behind that. Flying was awesome. It led to some lazy level design, but it was awesome. I think they should implement more no-fly zones, but I loved my Netherdrake too much to give that up.
---
If you're main-maining the Warlock, then play the paladin. Paladin's can be decently low effort and perform well.
---
If you want to split time equally between the Warlock and alt, pick Druid.
---
Git gud scrub
---
Yes and no, they serve a function, but that function is completely useless.
---
They were blizzards first attempt at a group finder, it's terrible at it though, so no one uses it.
---
These are the sake people who wants to make wow a singleplayer game.
---
Tailoring isn't alt if you're a caster. Need it to make Robe of archmage which is bop. Then you need it for bloodvine bonus until replaced
---
LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
they're both good. play whichever one you would like imo.
---
Whats the build quality like? Looks pretty nice from the picture
---
my SO thinks this some kind of fucking joke. This shit is serious as fuck. I've been trying to warn her.....
---
And you will lose the first 3 to rogues, and the next one to an enhance
---
No, not when we have discord and grouping addons.

When I walked through the gates of Stormwind the first time and heard the music and saw the city. Might be the most moving moment I’ve ever had in front of a computer. I’ve always used the ‘of Stormwind’ title because I’m hooked. I’d rl move there if I could.
---
Welcome to r/Atiesh, a high-pop PvE realm that will feel more like home than anywhere else.
---
What you won't get is long queue times, ganked for hours on end without consent, or stuck playing alone.
---
What you will get is a large assortment of friendly guilds that cater to all play styles AND **play times**, a relaxing community-based atmosphere for leveling, and plenty of that sweet sweet raiding.
---
besides the low quality alliance emblem yeah id say its worth the money
---
Imagine taking the time to write something like that after someone criticizes a game. I think you need help.
---
 The only thing egotistical and immature is your second paragraph.
---
No it should 100% be a druid mount
---
Fairbanks? A man of quality I see.
---
\*rolls need as hunter, rolls 99\*
---
ty gl next time tank tx
---
I understand this sentiment but at the same time I disagree with it. Sure you've invested alot of time into wow and it's hard to get away now. But you honestly got to take a step back and look at the whole picture. Are you really enjoying the game, or are you just going through the motions because you've sunk a ton of hours into it.
---
For me personally, I realized that I hate what wow had become. BFA has been so mediocre and I feel no attachment to my characters anymore. Hell, I dont even recognize then with some of the new character models. It was time to retire them. As much as it hurts.
---
Of course I hope future expansions can bring back the game in a big way, but I doubt it. I'm more excited for the possibility of TBC / WOTLK servers. What excites be about legacy servers is that you have a clear goal for your character. The fact that you can "complete" a toon is an exciting prospect.
---
Fairbanks is killin it for NA!
---
Could be that you don’t have enough space for it.
---
\&gt; The water thing is kind of questionable. Dehydration causes drop in performance, but it has to be pretty severe. 
---
Recent research shows that even mild dehydration (1%) can cause a measurable decline in performance.

---
seems pretty decent, but only the horde one would be worth it
---
If throwing up dots is fun for you, then resto Druid will provide very similar satisfaction with the management of hots
---
Serious question: I see lots of differing opinion in the community about leveling with imp vs void walker. Is it ultimately down to preference or is one vastly superior to the other (if speccing into their respective talents on the talent tree)?
---
Solo leveling is EASY on a paladin. It's just slower than others. But no problem if you pull multiple mobs, rare spawns are fine, can tank/heal/dps as ret in dungeons on the way to 60 too.
---
In solo PvP sure. In group PvP they have holy paladins, nasty bastards.
---
Fuck that, if I'm not in a guild r run I expect everyone to roll need on valuable boes.  Everyone needs gold.
---
My friend, do I have [the game for you!](https://www.eveonline.com/)
---
Only would have gotten 3 off before going OOM.
---
Saying that Wrath of the Lich king was successful and suddenly Cata started the downward trend is ridiculous. WOTLK was when the game flat-lined in subscribers, and ceased to grow. Some claim it was because the game had peaked or became saturated, but I think it was the design decisions of the game. You cannot look at the rapid climb in growth during Vanilla and BC compared to WOTLK and not see this.
---
HoTW is trash. You won't be accepted for raids no matter if you heal dps or tank and you are shit in pvp too. 
---
Jack of all trades perhaps, but not viable in any one.
---
I love bill burr
---
For pvp? One of the best classes in the game. Pretty much only is only threatened by geared spriests and warriors, and good elemntalists.
---
Thank you so much for your hard work! definitely handy
---
I think you convince me
---
I just spent that much on gas station burritoes.
---
That actually seems like the best course of action, since layering can fuck with Kazzak and Azuregos spawns (you could hop layers and down two of them in a row, or more), which I think begin in phase 2. Introducing queues while allowing free transfers seems like the most hassle-free way of doing it.
---
except for the early morning, when all the streamers go to sleep.
---
&gt;Human body never went through an evolutionary phase where handling severely elevated levels CO2 was a filter for survival.
---
Well I've got some good news/bad news about the 21st century....
---
... Again.
---
Inaccurate, the adults get halfway down the field, then run off the field looking for a new field
---
No dude it was a typo. He obviously meant 250 billion. /s
---
Agreed, been looking forward to Classic for years. Money is not an issue, but I am not giving them half a month of sub money just to reserve a name.
---
Druids are not primarily PvP healers. We have a lot of other skills that mean we can actually turn the tide of a BG. If you want to play an unkillable healer, play paladin. If you want to win BGs, play druid. And when I say win, I mean win the objective.
---
Gnomes - the Funco Pop amongst wow races.
---
Well, congrats. The Shaman player most likely identifies as a punching bag the way he threw himself at you
---
&gt;Your average player will not be hitting 60 for 3-4 months.
---
The main thing that Phase 2 adds is Dire Maul, so it's not like slower players are missing out on anything by Phase 2 releasing before they're 60. The thing that will affect them the most is the addition of honor which will increase world pvp, but players know what they're getting in to here and PvE servers are available if you don't think you'll be 60 in time.
---
&gt;The vast majority of dungeons in Classic contain gear that is equal to or inferior to what can be found in Molten Core. Invalidating them in a month with the exception or rep/recipe drops.
---
You'll want that gear before you go into MC though. And a lot of that gear is still relevant into Phase 3, sometimes even longer. If anything the main argument here is Dire Maul obsoleting a bunch of Phase 1 drops.
---
&gt;Molten core contains 2 of the 3 legendary weapons in Classic &amp; will be farmed the entirety of Classic. There is no rush to release BWL+.
---
If anything this is a reason to release BWL earlier. Do you really want your only raid content to be MC when you know you'll be farming it for a year?
---
&gt;There will not be any new content for Classic WoW. When naxx releases that is the end. 
---
Maybe, maybe not.
---
&gt; It makes no sense from a business/financial standpoint for Blizzard to rush phases seeing as their revenue is tied to monthly subscriptions.
---
Didn't stop the majority of private server players to roll on a new server whenever the previous server was "beaten." Also, TBC may be a possibility.
---
&gt;simplifying the game and destroying the rpg elements.
---
oh do tell
---
There's no sharding in classic.
---
I'm a Mum but I understand the sentiment. My husband is an incredible, hands on and very affectionate father. I would not procreate with anyone less.
---
I'm toxic as a month old tampon, I dont pretend otherwise. :)
---
I love both but my main focus would probably be in the group content and PvP.
---
Yeah this is awfully done, "the desire for classic reached a fever pitch" (in wod) 
---
Hell no? People had no clue they even wanted classic at that point since most wow players didn't even know what nostalrius was, and didn't even think about playing vanilla. 
---
A fever pitch is a peak, a climax of sorts, thats the worst it gets, and honestly that was not even close. The fever pitch was reached when nostalrius closed, which was over a year later. When everyone cried out for blizzard to create legacy realms and they said they wouldn't. 
---
As u/s4ntana said, very amateur and circlejerky.
---
Thief thinks all men steal.
---
 i remember waiting at the meeting stone for deadmines VC waiting for our other memebers to arrive as we were all noobs scared of caves, gave a sense of rp for me
---
Excellent man, great keep doing your finger lunges we have a bit of time now till classic don’t want to see you camp up now. I will fear you if you roll ally on Fairbanks, otherwise let’s be friends then on ugly side
---
classic is retailer btw
---
I'm sure that I am not the only player that is only coming back for classic. Retail subs are at an all time low, and I dont think it would be too unlikely for classic to be larger than retail. That being said, we would never know and Blizzard would certainly not tell us lol.

Dwarf is also really good and underrated. Especially against Rouges you can get rid of blindness and intercept them.

I wouldn't. Warden does clientside checks
---
I feel like this is sponsored
---
Why would I apologize to someone who is running a guild the only purpose of which seems to be to satisfy personal greed? That's no reason to apologize, that's reason to ignore.
---
Speaking of which ...
---
I have had warlock, rogue and warrior as my mains when I played during Vanilla and TBC. This time I planned to reroll shaman because idea playing an elemental shaman seemed so tempting because one of my friend used to play one during TBC. Then after short research I found it will be quite difficult to find a raid spot as an elemental shaman and seems I will be going warlock as my main again. 
---
Generally I have noticed that I am not that set on the class, I prefer to have specific class-race combinations. Warlock on Alliance side would be impossible for me because I dislike gnome and human casting animations. Good thing that I am going for horde so I can play undead female which is the best model in the game.
---
100% banned I promise you
---
Made this in preparation for WoW Classic + Live Streaming and repping that awesome Live WoW Classic Live Wallpaper :)
---
Around the time WoW came out I was into other games, myself. CS, etc.  Then I jumped into EQ2. Eventually made it to WoW in late TBC and feel like I missed so much!
---
Solid stretch there friend, i like this workout might try it myself
---
Just gonna blend in with these other skeletons so don't pay attention to where I am.
---
Pfft east coasters
---
West coasters be chill af
---
Or as we liked to call it. Gankelhorn vale.
---
Nah, just able to smell my own kind like a fart in a car
---
Ah alright thanks. I think you're the only one who talked about the nerf not the final result so far.
---
Damn, we aren't getting Battle grounds until phase 3? That sucks. Can't even do bgs while lvling before 60 on our first characters.
---
I'm pretty sure the damage to a priest shield did not generate any rage. A warrior without rage is pretty gimped.
---
It has been possible since vanilla days but people got banned doing it.
---
I think it's more in reference to people who take the game and the min maxing so seriously that they'll tell you to kill yourself for making sub-optimal choices.
---
I've had this happen to me for rolling a Druid because apparently the fact that some other classes can better fulfill any roles a Druid can makes me such a monumental idiot for choosing to play one that I must be made to defend myself from verbal attacks for playing a fucking video game wrong.
---
“UNABLE TO LOG IN DUE TO NON-OPTIMAL RACE CHOICE ON THIS CHARACTER.”
---
Lol
---
Well then fuck off, the movies changed everything that happened in the books. You want to get all preachy about when shit happened and you use a bastardized retelling. If you are going to be a pedant go to the source material, duh.
---
Its good to know people are so into classic they are purposely mispelling rogue so it feels like 2004 all over again.
---
Blizzard give you 6 month bans for model changes :/ happens at the beginning of the year cause of nude patches etc.
---
That's assuming a lot.
---
Ah thanks for the detail dude. Just a thing I remember being a big deal back when.
---
Don’t be sour, you might just get lucky my friend
---
Hey man, thanks for this topic! I haven't played wow in like 10 years probably and I'm going to be starting up with my gf when classic launches. I was pretty lost about how to go about addon-ing! I'm definitely going to be using this video and making my gf watch it to help her because she's never played wow before. Thanks again!
---
Is it common for people who do this to be hit with a ban for it? I'm pretty sure I had my client edited with this trick for aaaages back in the day was never banned.  
---
I guess these days the modern client has all kinds of psuedo-spyware to see what you're doing so probably more likely to get caught i guess.
---
To be fair, if someone plays retail and does mythic plus and mythic raiding (not that I do), I’d imagine they can handle themselves in classic just fine (See Cdew and Venruki that come to mind). 
---
The video is hilarious and I don’t doubt that a significant number of people are going to have a big adjustment period. But as a retail player who started at the end of classic, it’s sort of like riding a bike.
---
Mained a mage in vanilla, going to play a priest main this time around. Undecided what my second character will be... maybe a mage.
---
Enjoyed Enhancement Shaman and Hunter in vanilla too though!
---
You?
---
It’s one of those “this meeting should have been an email” type things.
---
Anywho, just yanking u. Bored and buzzed. Have a fun night/morning ;)
---
What error does it give?
---
As a rogue, it took me by surprise when I first saw he had crazy shoulder pads.  Which happened in a later expansion.
---
Very true, but I'm not the kind of person who likes the minimalistic Ui look. I prefer to have half my screen cluttered up with shit. I also like to see what's on all my bars and I like to swap things around on the fly
---
Only reason I'm opting to not play herod is because I love in california. Cant beat that 15 ms server ping. Its nice that blizz headquarters is 40 minutes from my place. :D
---
The guy who has Recount installed but no threat meter add-on.
---
That's beautiful
---
My dear sir are you a part of the grob mob?
---
They must had been actually playing the warrior as more than a bank alt at that point, no?
---
I am really not looking forward to hunters ninjaing everything because they need the stat sticks. Having my weapons as a rogue taken from me more than once by a hunter that happened to be guild leaders best friend was so stupid. I'm so glad they removed the stat sticks for hunters in retail. REALLY not looking forward to my BiS weapon going to a hunter to just sit on his side and do nothing, and have to grind for another month for the same thing to happen again.
---
Flatscreen CRT?
---
Personally I want to see something like 2 months of Phase 1 and 2 months of Phase 2. A half of year of MC+Ony being the only raid content will get a bit monotonous especially since guilds aren't going to stop farming those.
---
I said 3 weeks because I'd like to see layering removed before Phase 2. Technically I don't want layering at all but I think if you support it then 3 weeks is a reasonable amount of time for most people to get established on their server and get past the bottleneck of the lower levels.
---
Woooooosh
---
You also mentioned how they mentioned to expect queue times, which this post does. That's all.
---
I've already explained exactly what I dislike about it, you're free to have your own priorities but you asked me which is two options I'd prefer and I gave you my answer.
---
This is what I’ll be doing except weed.
---
Naturally it would be alliance heavy due to the mentality of quitting and running away scared from Herod
---
Do you have the list written down in text form? easier than scrubbing the video then looking it up

Not really no x)

What is the build to get clearcasting and frost?
---
Ah don’t worry. This is just a reddit handle. Due to the limitations of the game mechanics, I would never be able to make a name like this on the game, so there wouldn’t be a way for me to offend any guildie.
---
Infer fire is self cast, no?
---
*whisky
---
So in phase 3 they get to raid? Rough.
---
That's a good way to deter people from playing the game before they even start because they can't roll on the same server/faction as their friends.
---
I wont be reading quests but ill do all of them
---
KEK
---
Words don't mean anything, if they misjudge how many people want to play classic ( and judging by the server count i think they have), its going to be almost impossible to remove layering by phase 2 in 2 months, what happens if 20k players are active on a server on average? If you put a cap at 4k without layering, the queue will be enormous
---
You gear your MT harder than anyone else. Basically no one but the tank needs any gear for MC. You gotta stack as FR on the MT as you can get, everyone else can get by on FR potions. Distribute gear evenly after the tank is as geared as he can get
---
I watched the layering announcement video and it seems like what you're saying won't be possible. 
---
A few takeaways:
---
1) the server mostly keeps you on the same layer (eg, same after log off/on, instance entry/exit), so you meet the same people   
---
2) layer will be changed to bring whole group together    
---
3) the layer is the entire continent, not zones    
---
While it wasn't explicitly said, the implication seems to be that the player won't have control over switching layers. This would prevent your concern.
---
I remember when people didn't know what gear/stats they needed for their class. Hope to hear they bring that back as well.
---
“Don’t come to school tomorrow”
---
I laughed way too hard at this. Surrounding people must have had strange thoughts =\
---
Decursive is bad though, it just randomly picks someone in the raid to dispell and it teaches bad habits for one of the most important spells in the game.
---
research dkp systems
---
Well sham or druid will let you do a bunch of other stuff as needed. If you have more experience with a priest then play shaman this is anewstart! Also if you're running with a full group...chain heal bruh
---
This is so true. I think they made create walk through in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM) video what they had to do. Naturally the biggest thing is that there is so much bugs and vulnerabilities that have been fixed in past 10+ years. Sure they got 1.12 running in very short time but it was 1.12 like it was back then.. with all bugs and other problems. Also huge thing was that it wasn't able to communicate with modern systems (Blizzard Cloud) and also because they decided to use new version of engine (to not fix all bugs again) they had to solve a lot of problems to make new engine to read old data.
---
It is usually pretty easy to make something work and look like it was. But people don't understand how much work there has been that end users never actually see. If they decide to fix major bug with security it is best case scenario that end user will never even know it did exist.
---
I am also software engineer and thing I really hate is when people think our job is super easy, just push some buttons and everything works.

the values are, yes. but no one ever figured out how armor actually works.

Which is essentially Deer - Semen.
---
"Check the ~~Guild~~ Subreddit for more ~~requests~~ memes."
---
Why are people so scared of RP servers? Or is it the inability to name your character "Bumsniffer" that is a dealbreaker? :P
---
The answer will be (as it should be), "let's see how it does once we launch."
---
As fast as possible. Hoping to be done in about 5 months.
---
That's my major gripe with Cata, it destroyed the old world, destroyed old quests, old content. It was cool at first I guess, but then after the novelty wore off I just wanted my old game back.
---
I think that Cataclysm taking so long to launch after ICC patch was a big reason for the flatline.
---
Please dont make it Hunscalp all over again
---
Damn tho, that looks delicious! Can I have some with a slice of that Salami?
---
yes, you are the only one
---
They added Gehennas yesterday, it'll be full by monday probably
---
Frankly I made characters just to level them different routes. The feeling of having to take your time, like it was really you in this world on an adventure, and not some demi-god strolling through armies and just obliterating everything in your path. Sure that is fun for a little bit, but gets dull so fast. I had 5 level 60s, the most out of my guild at the time. Leveling was fun, figuring out the quests instead of mindlessly running at an arrow was fun. Knowing what was happening was great, having to stock up on supplies before a large adventure was amazing. Professions having an impact, having to return to towns and cities to learn skills felt great to me. The experience of the leveling process was great. Now leveling is just a lame obstacle to get to the real content of the game, and that feeling suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks. Even st max level I have a hard time playing retail for longer than 20 minutes at a time. I mostly just AH goblin now, and even that is dull. I long on long enough to send my followers on mission, get rewards from my loot crates, maybe do a battleground or island then I log because I just lose interest in doing anything else. 
---
It really sucks. The classes feel like absolute hot garbage, and they won't fix them until next expansion, which is fucking stupid. Its like they don't give a shit about anything other than what they like, fuck the player base that pays a subscription. Ion constantly saying 
---
&gt;well we think it's fun
---
Just feels like he is spitting in our faces. Plus his lawyer responses are so drab. I'm so tired of him talking for an hour and saying nothing at all.
---
idk about direct statements, but this is pretty exhaustive and seems sourced: https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
Good!
---
Are these the only servers they have? Are they going to add any? 
---
I don't recall private servers ever being full..
---
Rule of Internet
---
I feel like a combination of having a server only dungeon finder combined with an Overwatch like "Avoid as teammate" (Groupmate) could work well and appease both crowds.
---
Honestly no one place, it's gathered from several sources such as discords, podcasts, YouTube but mainly being involved with the private server community for years.
---
I was wondering why it was only working half the time, I will add this addon to the list. Thank you
---
Outjerking /r/wowcirclejerk at this point.  
---
DAE take their time leveling ???
---
I thought the same when I watched it again years later xD  
---
Meh ... can't redo the montage. It is what it is 15 years later :)
---
Every WoW expansion has come somewhere between 21 and 26 months after the previous one. The timing of MoP was entirely typical. The shortest turnaround was actually TBC to WotLK. Did Blizzard "throw in the towel" on TBC?
---
With layering and overspawn, I think you'll be ok (all things considered). Leveling in a few weeks will certainly be faster, but you'll be able to progress and have fun.
---
I'd take off launch day, but then take off a long series of days the next week, maybe? Just in case servers are up/downing or emergency maintenance, etc.
---
Nobody can predict what your specific experience will be
---
Dont do it! Its horde over pop already. If we don't get more allies the PvP is going to be bad for both sides.
---
Because.. you are.. naming.. a character
---
Even the most hardcore gamer could see issues with this lol.  If i had classic  installed I would have done it because it felt like an event but honestly, if i had to add an extra letter or 2 to my name, its not the end of the world 
---
/oh brother
---
I am just going to play and play a lot, so if it happens faster than normal it won't be because I went out of my way to do it. I'll just be no lifing it regardless if I fish for 3 hours or grind
---
As an fyi the reason they ban for it is because some people use it to change the size of nodea or rares to be huge or to shrink things to see through areas and exploit. It's no longer just a personal cosmetic thing.
---
But still, AA max, even with those specs I would be amazed if you were consistently hitting 144 on 1440. 
---
Great though

You forgot ["you don't want to do that either, you think you do, but you don't"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wrw3c2NjeE)
---
As fast as possible.  I've done every leveling quest and dungeon dozens of times.  60 is when the game starts for me.  I may go slower on my first alt to enjoy some low level pvp though.
---
No asking for specific just general launch feedback from those that can recall how it was in general .
---
I played on Illidan and no one ever called it DM in chat. It was always VC.
---
It's been abused since day 1. Months after launch people were changing the huge rocks mid wsg into tiny trees so they could "run through" them
---
[Followed by White Rabbit feat. Steve Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6KENQm9hXs)
---
good point there, thanks for the input and feedback :)
---
I'll be doing both. First I'm rushing to 60 and getting raid ready. Then I'm rolling an alt and taking my sweet time.
---
Why does the default UI not show the players cast bar? It also doesnt show the duration of debuffs like hammer of justice, rend  or buffs like cloak of shadows or ice barrier  is there an addon that shows how long they last like on retail?
---
getting to level 40, especially the late 20s/30s are a real drag. Big zones where you have to travel by foot make the game so slow paced. 
---
Its one of the things i dont like about classic but i'll endure it because i know how much more i start to enjoy the game as soon as you get a mount.
---
The difference between rushing and leveling casually but efficiently is like 1 day of play time. I think the vast majority of people are like you.
---
The thing is just, if they hadn't introduced all those "anti-social" things like groupfindet etc. then the game would've been dying from the edge inwards for years. One thing people tend to forget is that the social aspect takes a lot of time to establish itself.
---
At the same time WoW's core demographic has aged and, for the most part, moved into the job market. So many people simply don't have the time anymore to do it the "slow" way. It might be more fulfilling for those who enjoy it, but huge swathes of players would've quit the game by now if the game still was a time-consuming as it was during Vanilla/TBC/Wrath.
---
I don't think the game would still exist the way it does today if those "life-saving" measures hadn't been taken. We certainly wouldn't have Classic.
---
In that sense, raging against the changes to Retail is pointless, because without them Retail wouldn't exist anymore.
---
MMORPGs are as much a product of their time as the game in and of itself. This is why Classic is more of a nostalgia-trip, a re-enactment of a game that once was.
---
The game has changed, players have changed, gaming and recreational time in general have changed.
---
People curse Retail WoW, but to be honest, they're just cursing the passage of time.
---
Count on it being different this time, count on lag, account on Insta bility
---
&gt; the earth itself is destined to be destroyed by the sun in twenty-five million years or so.
---
I wonder how many times Blizzard will have re-released their classic games by then.
---
There will be more than enough people that get to 60, realize their class is overplayed and reroll another toon that you can level with. People constantly made alts to try things out with, guilds constantly lost certain classes and needed them for encounters. Don't worry about whether or not people are rushing.

I actually made a post about keybinds yesterday. I've planned a lot of my keybinds for various characters I plan to play in a spreadsheet which can be viewed here:

Note:  I use a logitech g600 mouse which has quite a few extra buttons that I try and utilize.
---
Epic costume
---
research lava runs. it's not that hard to get.
---
Well personally I tend to rush through the first 15 levels. I coast till about 48. The reason for this coast period is to level up the professions evenly while questing. And push hard the rest of the way once you start getting disillusioned with the grind. 
---
When I follow this method I usually hit 60 in 6 days played.  So roughly 3 weeks of real word time. 
---
This is following a speed quest guide as well.  But not beating myself over time.
---
The reason I do this is it allows me to ramp into pre-raid bis much quicker at the expense of about 1week of real world leveling time
---
MT &gt; OT &gt; DPS &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HEALERS
---
Has pretty much always been the priority in WoW. 
---
In P1, there are no real "Healing Checks" -- so healers aren't that much of a concern. Tanks, however, need a lot of stuff. You need a bunch of fire resist, stam, and mitigation. Then you want to gear up DPS so the tank has to tank less.
---
Let them come
---
Lich King and BFA Cinematics :) very fitting
---
I wouldn't spend copper/ silver on flight paths so I walked every where until level 30+? It was a long time ago I can't remember how long I did it but my God what a waste of time walking.
---
Yeah i've said for a long time if they ever make wc4 they should just pretend wow didnt happen.
---
You want 2/5 Imp corruption, then 3 in suppression at first. 2 points in corruption matches the cast time with the GCD, also, if the targets don't resist, you don't have to recast, which saves a buttload of mana.
---
What time does the game launch in your timezone? If it's &gt;1pm then you're probably better off saving that leave day and going to work then jumping on when you get home and trying. If it's a shit show you lose nothing, if it's good you're a few hours behind the rush and should have an easier time in the starter zones.
---
That extra day at the end might be more useful.
---
Just came to say that Golemagg was also "chosen" for the Czech community. :)
---
I thought this was a genuine post. This is reddit, without an /s I assume any autistic behavior is real
---
Cant wait to camp rpers
---
You find it stupid that I advise against mods, as they degrade the original classic experience? I think if anything is stupid here, it is your inability to understand.
---
Up to 40, maybe 45 before release. They want to work on the leftover levels. This is according to their Discord channel.
---
this is super cute! May I ask for your twitter?
---
Alliance scum better watch out for Grief!
---
!RemindMe 13 Daye
---
This. I know so many people hyped for classic because it's the game they love without all the shit treadmill grinding. 
---
Most of the retail players I've spoken to about switching or playing at least are not concerned about life or lfg, it's  neck levels, world quests, time gated reputation grinds and titanforging that comes up time and time again about what isn't right with the current game.
---
Blizzard got so scared that people consumed the content so quick that they build systems counter intuitive to having fun. BFA is one big edging fest, it takes weeks to unlock stuff, not because you have so much to do, but you can only a finite amount every day.
---
Great news, now my westfall chiken will be allways with me 👌

fast as fuck boi
---
Oce boys are keen
---
Why would he let rogues/warriors join his group? He is the tank :)
---
If i enjoy something i do it alot, therefore I'll probably level fast
---
Lol, wow. I can’t see that being a common occurrence.
---
I understand tanks / healer priorities. More curious about what to do within each category. For example gear up the same healer or distribute across the different healers etc
---
Yeah that much was always obvious to me. I guess i thought "innocent" changes would go under the radar. Like I said earlier, did this back in the day for ages and never got banhammered. We ain't in Kansas any more it seems.
---
Dad detected.
---
The real question is how much players will complain about overcrowding on PvP servers come phase 2 when they had both the option, information and recomendations to do something about it now?
---
Imp is alright damage, and ranged which is a plus. He gives good buffs. He doesn't have that much mana though, and if he pulls aggro he'll die very quickly.
---
VW is an ok tank, but nothing special. The main issue is that he does low damage, so the majority of his threat comes from his taunt. Abilities don't scale like in retail, they have ranks, and your damage increases aren't necessarily aligned with new ranks of his taunt. Generally the older his rank of taunt is, the easier you'll find it to pull aggro.
---
That’s important information.
---
Are there any other settings which can be dialed up further than in-game ultra like these?
---
A bit worrying when all the other regions have multiple full/high servers and OCE has two medium servers.
---
lets be honest here. Name reservations will not affect your enjoyment of the game at all. We all played WoW for years, and you also know that you'd get over your name very quickly once the gameplay starts. This is a fucking waste of money.
---
btw, I reserved names too.
---
I predicted 250,000 subs by launch day.  We need another 67,000 in less than 11 days!  We can do this!!!  Everyone who subs up gets....ummmm...they get a free month's subscription to WoW Classic!  Yeah, that's the ticket!  A free month!
---
Is that a Tauren? Looks so massacred... :(
---
Tbh, totally forgot it. Still, that doesnt make the rule any different (as th instance name and boss name are the same).
---
Transfers aren't a problem for them, it's money for them...
---
I can easily notice 60 ms and to west servers I will be getting 90-100. It might as well be a European server, and I've played plenty of European servers to know how garbage it feels at high ping and how much of a massive, extreme disadvantage you are at above 20-30 ms, let alone 90-100+.
---
I think we can all relate to the “Picking...” tab.
---
If you can't beat a boss without fear ward, any boss, you're bad and you should feel bad. Fear ward might be optimal, but it's not required. I cleared vanilla as a human priest, less than half our priests were dwarf.
---
&gt; thried throughing the mac would the window
---
I'll pick some fights along the way.
---
Actually they changed the algorithm to reflect their expected population on launch.
---
launches 6pm the 26th for me. Yeah I work midnights too so I would just get off at 6am(27th) that next morning and play. Thanks for the feedback!
---
I actually enjoy toxicity a lot. Adds flavor.
---
And I think wayy to many people overestimate how many people actuslly reserve names. It's actually not that many. Anecdotal, of course, but everyone I know who plays WoW right now will play Classic, but only one guy has reserved names. The others, me included, just dont give a shit and cant be arsed.
---
&gt; it is a must.
---
This is where you go wrong, it absolutely is NOT a must. It's the best, but it's not a MUST. It absolutely is up to you.
---
Did moonkins really have starfall though? Starfire I can remember, but not starfall.
---
Yes it is possible
---
im gonna take my time rushing to 60
---
My plan is to have one healing class main and one dps alt. 
---
Healer:
---
In different circumstances I would have went holy Paladin without thinking as it was my first character ever in wow. A lot of warm and fuzzy feelings here. However, now I enjoy strategic gameplay and priest feels more rewarding. Also biggest deterrent from paladin in classic is having to wear awkward gear and blue dress for healing. Do you even plate bro. 
---
Dps:
---
This is mainly for some gameplay differentiation and extra pvp fun. The choice is between mage and warlock. As i said before, i enjoy strategic gameplay where planning can lead to great results. Mage is great but warlock feels like it has a lot more buttons to press and strategies. Mage is a lot more reactive as opposed to planning in advance. 
---
Any Comments?
---
essentially nothing. 
---
We know there will be crossrealm, but no information on how it will be done.
---
The problem is distinguishing between a guy who's been theorycrafting his Feral build since weeks before release and Mr. 0/51/0 Feral "Dps" who thinks he's a Rogue.
---
1 - 5 q e r t f g c MB4 MB5 MB6 MB7  = offensive  
---
Shift+any of the above = defensive/healing  
---
Ctrl+any of the above = utility  
---
Alt+any of the above = consumables
---
Bunch of swedes going golemagg with me.
---
Thank you! Ok maybe I’ll just start with codex and go from there. I guess the issue there is because MQ can track extra quests compared to default ui  quest tracker.
---
Yeah ask them if they can guarantee everyone will get a full refund on their gametime since launch if they still have layering in P2.
---
West coast is pretty populated and it's a pop server...
---
Race. I've leveled over 10 characters in the past and I thoroughly enjoy rushing to 60.
---
I wanna be excited but I’m so poor and my pc can’t run wow
---
In early PvE usually one mage specc frost down to "Winters chill" and the rest go Arcane Power+Frost Channeling.
---
In pvp you need talents like shatter and frost bite, something that is useless in pve. 
---
In a min/max situation ofc.
---
Welcome to retail Wow.
---
Nah this is fact
---
Any other settings which increase graphics behind the in-game ultra?
---
Is that just the standard Nightfall/Soul link build?
---
Cata was trash. Beginning of the end of the world.. Of warcraft.
---
figure 8-10 days /played if you grind it out nonstop. fastest is 4-5 days and that was highly regimented record making run
---
1 2 3 4 5 Q E R T F G Z X C V Mouse3 Mouse4 Mouse5 ScrollUp ScrollDown 
---
Ctrl + Shift modifiers for all of them, Alt modifier for some of them.
---
Thats what I use at least.
---
If I know them to be trustworthy, I'll bring them phase 1 to gear them and then make them bring a nightfall to progression raids during phase 3.
---
Problem is.. *almost nobody* is trusthworthy. If you carry a ret through all that crap and then have them bail on you, it's a huge pain in the ass.
---
Or worse, NElfs...
---
Wow literally saved my relationship long distance. It's how my highschool sweetheart and I managed to stay together for 4 years of long distance in college. 
---
My only word of advice is to take your time and play suboptimally. The important thing is to enjoy your time together. There are a lot of fun things to do in classic that don't give exp, and it's those memories that I treasure now looking back.
---
Taking hours to corpse hop to an enemy faction starting zone for a rare pet. Jumping off high things just because you both get a kick out of the trolls' "wahuh" fall damage sound. Composing and singing Blue's Clues style songs whenever one of you runs off to gather a random node.
---
Needless to say, we're both super pumped to relive the experience sitting next to each other this time around. She didn't start playing until TBC, so I'm really looking forward to sharing all of the endgame classic content, but we're also going to try and mix up our usual leveling path.
---
Nope it's not the same. Much better actually
---
&gt;Hell no? People had no clue they even wanted classic at that point since most wow players didn't even know what nostalrius was, and didn't even think about playing vanilla. 
---
Way to speak for everyone. 
---
I wanted vanilla and I had never even heard of nostalrius nor played on a pserver.
---
They’re planning to play on the OCE servers
---
It’s sad this only got 50 upvotes. Maybe if you would have added some pizza roll and hot pocket recipes your post would have done better. Thanks regardless, much appreciated your information as well as your writing skills.
---
Starfall is from wotlk. Not even tbc.
---
Is there a list (or a rule of thumb) out there, which weapons it is acceptable to roll need for as a hunter?
---
Which can easily be done with 200, 100 or even 50ms. You don’t need 400ms to time an ability, let alone react to one.
---
You could get lucky in pugs that people knew what they were doing. All bosses had some oneshots and mechanics you had to obey or you had no chance regardless of the amount of healing.
---
I'll be dabbing to 60. Can't wait, I was straightedge my first go through Vanilla.
---
They should rerun the original ads with Mr. T and the other celebs.
---
Gotta trust yourself when instincts are involved. The fact that you've got an instinct telling you what to play is like half the battle. I think you should play mage especially if you havent already
---
It was default on stress, so no need addons
---
In raiding I don't mind healing, raiding kind of sucks no matter what I'm just in it for the gear. I do like being able to tank 5 mans, druid pvp seems fun, and both balance and feral look decent for pvp.
---
On the other hand rogues are rogues and I'm not super into the druid class fantasy.
---
It will take minimum 200 hours for you to hit 60.
---
Don't feel obligated to get the first character you start leveling to 60. If you aren't having fun, reroll.
---
That is quite literally the point you are replying to.
---
It was something I was aware of in vanilla, without having done any research (just playing the game as feral). But now a lot of information is backing up what I'd just kind of intuited at the time. You'll always need a warrior tank in vanilla for their defensive cds and their inability to get crushed, but I'd imagine this time around a guild will have at least one feral tank. Too good not to.
---
According to a recent post, you’ll still need over 10k more rep to exalted.
---
I will try to get to 60 as fast as possible while not looking at any guides other than a talent distribution/important quests guide. I don't want my hand held but I also don't want to spend 6 months getting to 60.
---
Anything medium or low pop at actual launch is doomed to be a dead server in a year.  They're cautious about opening new servers in order to sustain the long term health of the game.
---
Actual best classic wow guide I've read. The grind to 300 cooking irl starts here boys.
---
Thought I was the only one... THANK YOU \*a sigh of relief\*
---
Free Server Transfers for a little fee*
---
If it ain't red, it belongs on your head.
---
It's so annoying you can't select and lock in the name, and then spend time on appearance, I had my wifes account reserve the name, then I create and customise mine, she deletes the char on her account and I instantly create mine with the same name, if I lose my name in those 3 seconds I'll be sad :(
---
Ah fuck man, that’s going to be a literal bloodbath on Herod. 7 players: 1 Raptor ratio. Hunger Games time.
---
And that was challenge no. 1 haha
---
Dude, have someone proofread that for you and you have some good questions.
---
Why are they hardcore?
---
I believe you, and I didn't take the time to investigate why it wasn't available to me during the one day I played. Just absolutely was not an option for me at that time. We'll see what launch brings.
---
HoJ is pretty easy to get. a good group will do lava runs in less then 15min. And tanks will farm it 24/7 for Ironfoe.
---
It's okay, I'll just roll on their bows.
---
\*8 shammies. 1 for every group :P
---
Well, every single BMW is a great car ;) but I get your point.
---
Thanks man, if you a question can always just let me know. Suppose that is what playing eve for 12 does to you. You turn into the excel spreadsheet guy. There was plans on to do more with it, but when classic was announced I kinda stopped caring at that point. Mostly was just making it more automatic / easier to use.
---
[https://www.vanilla-questing.me/](https://www.vanilla-questing.me/) looks better IMO. Cleaner map, I like the lines, and it actually saves your progress when you close the website, unlike [classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live). They said they would fix it not saving your progress for release, but it's yet to be seen.
---
NA.
---
Fair enough
---
Are there large amount of pool spawns in any specific area for these fish?
---
My friend activated his sub when Stalaag got announced, so of course I had to activate early so we could bro out and get those 2 character names. We got our main names and some good novelty names as well, not to mention broing out on the phone during the process.
---
I think that you dont know, or dont remember what Illidan was like when Vanilla dropped originally. I was there man, I saw things. Things thatll keep a man up at night.
---
And the game hasn't even launched yet. Apparently this is also one of the top 5 subs that is seeing the most growth
---
smh, stay ignorant then, I'll surround myself with people who know what's up.
---
Anecdotally can vouch im in that boat
---
I think he means the fact that you went with that horrible tag on any platform is a eedflag
---
Well, if you want to keep your raiders, you will spread the items around. Because in new, fresh guild, how do you really know whos your "top healer". Guy that did most healing in first boss. So fuck that guy that actually dispelled the raid ?
---
Tank prio is bit different as it TPS opens up more headroom to EVERY dps and more gear in general makes healing him easier. So it helps \~everyone anyways.
---
Another big contributor, I think, was the conclusion of the Lich King/Arthas story. Post-Wrath, the writing has felt pretty disjointed as they came up with new characters and story lines, which have been--in my opinion, of course--not as compelling.
---
You mean Karazhan?
---
Dont fib, we both know 200hrs is speed running that shiz
---
That does not make it ok? I didn’t say it was unwanted, but this does not make it right!
---
Once you're in Thunderbluff, it's great for a bank alt. Bank, mailbox, vendor, and auctioneer are all 5 seconds apart, and it's uncrowded.
---
I‘ll quote you ok that - thanks!
---
Remind us again which over powered bosses have the fear mechanism :p
---
Sadly it seems like no one’s going to play it this way. Everyone I’ve come across seems to be in a race to 60.
---
STV / Azshara
---
The east coast of Tanaris has both.
---
old enough to bleed old enough to breed
---
Lol I know what he means. I’m just goofing around. It’s all good.
---
There is a whole quiest chain requiring you to kill col kurzen which is reference to the same film.
---
Moreover, later in BfA when you come to nazmir first time (alliance side, on the rowboat) it is reference as well.
---
Well about the "friends you don't have part" ...   
---
There's a pub near my old house that has a motto written under its name that always sounded very true to me.  
---
And I think it will be for Classic.  
---
"There are no strangers here. Only friends who have yet to meet."  
---
See you in game pal !
---
That‘s an intentional change because nobody chooses to roll on a „low pop“ server. They announced the change too.
---
All 3 servers will have the same amount of people online at the same time, because all of them will be extremely full.
---
Could you elaborate on that point? That is, missing the design pillars. I'm not being confrontational, I'm curious to hear what you think!
---
While I don't intend to rush, I do wanna level more effectively with my time. Reading quest  descriptions? Sure. But I'm probably not running across the continent to try a different zone unless I have to.
---
Na, ACE
---
Yes!  I want this too, made chat so much easier
---
Sounds good
---
I don't know tbh, sounds pretty ridiculous in that instance but i know people who reserved names but very likely won't play ever, it's "just incase it gets big and everyone moves over".
---
If that doesn't happen they just won't ever play IMO.
---
It's very good for 5man tanking. Balance seems to be the better spec for farming (see Youtube for Devilsaur farm, Maraudon farm, DM East farm).
---
Ya, mon.

I'm going to try to recreate this UI I made that I used until the first tier of Cataclysm. The hardest thing to find a replacement for is SunnArt.

Warlock is incredibly reliant on which demon you have out in solo Wovp.
---
Get ranked next by a rogue with a fellhunter?
---
Doesn’t matter that you have notebooks buttons, welcome to an uneven fight.
---
Contraversely, getting ganked by a mage with a voidwalker? Hell sheep you 3x until DR and your shield wears off and then eat you without a pet.
---
Having more buttons != more strategic.
---
Mages wren better overall
---
WC1 intro music!
---
Nope. Classic is here to stay, so I'm not in an hurry at all :-)
---
Not a fan of aoe looting. If you kill a massive amount of mobs, it's a part of the process to now have a bunch of corpses to loot. It makes each kill feel more impactful.
---
Load windows on usb stick (ssd) and play from your current laptop
---
Did someone say?
---
There was a 30k census for Alliance during stress test. So perhaps 65k caps perhaps 15 layers at 5k each.
---
This is an absolute guess but tbh I don‘t see it being off by a factor of two or so day 1
---
Could be 100k - 250k people trying to log in day 1 into one mega server alone, though (Shazzrah/Herod).
---
deviates are worth a good amount
---
Well, it is a flavor issue. If you enjoy melee but can't get into rogue or warrior it is the next best thing.
---
What about it killed wow for you? I never raided ICC.
---
Good luck! Have you played an mmorpg before?? Some of my buddies are playing for the first time as well, I fear they will get bored and quit. I've always found most fun while playing with friends, hope you find it fun enough to stick around till end game when things get really spicy!!!
---
Hey man. I have seen quite a few posts regarding this. Objectively I think you are true and wrong at the same time. Vanilla playerbase is indeed one of the best and friendliest community I have seen in any game I played. If you think, they are toxic, just try league of legends for a while, you will think of them differently. Truth is however, that in every game are nice and rude people. Sometimes nice people had a bad day and become rude people at that certain situation. What I think however is, that you need to be absolutely transparent, that you are newbie when running dungeons or doing quests. Since private server people been in touch with vanilla for a long time, it is somehow expected, that everyone knows mechanics 
---
 and content. With the upcoming release, many new people or retail people tried classic on private servers. If you had experienced any rudeness on lower levels (1-30), This rudeness most likely came from retail people actually. Anyone, who plays pserver is lvl 60 long ago.
---
Ya know, I used to really dislike the "virgin vs. chad" memes, but seeing what the r/classicwow community does with them, they are growing on me =)
---
Oceanic servers during the stress test had 15ms ping, for original wow, the ping never went below about 350ms. Oceanic is the only way to go.
---
My friend and I gave in to the hype and subbed early to save our names. I told myself I wouldn't do it but he saved my name for me and wanted the third spot so I subbed to take the name off his hands. We are so hyped.
---
4-5 /played is the record
---
I distinctly remember this being a thing
---
I think prolly 30-40% of the population will quit before they reach level 50.
---
I don't think none of the servers will be low or medium at launch
---
Shamans can relate...
---
Water walking/breathing is not that cool (and uses looted reags).
---
Not really - but you just need to be channeling it as they die (which they should be anyway from DoTs and your team pooping on them)
---
God, when I resubscribed and realized they'd enabled aoe looting, I was so happy. Looting was such a literal (carpal tunnel) pain, and the time it took was tedious and even antisocial in fast-moving groups.
---
Fellow Mankrik player!
---
I'm really not trying to be rude, but that is 'literally' retarded. Thank your friends for skewing the statistics and making this more difficult than it has to be. Nobody cares about their names except themselves.
---
I guess I will rush? Idk I dont have a ton of time to play but when I play I intend to spend it getting to 60. I will enjoy the leveling process and the adventure but I'm really looking forward to Vanilla end game
---
Until you die or fly...
---
Yea, but on the EU RP realms it's an average of 63/37 ally ratio, so I really hope they don't do it.
---
I don't have the opportunity to rush. I've got a full time job, family, school and other family friend things we do on a weekly basis. I rushed back when I had no life in middle and high school. Time to enjoy it all. Would definitely like to be 60 within a week but 2 sounds more realistic.
---
They're too busy playing it and having the times of their lives to bother talking about it
---
Then it should be noted that spawn points are \*\*not at all correct\*\*. The data pfQuest uses is directly from a mangos pserver DB. Apart from the general area I wouldn't trust the data, or you may not even find the quest NPC, or miss multiple spawns or objects that it doesn't show.
---
What? Where the fuck do you like that coffee is 7.50?
---
It'll give them a much better idea than going in blind. A lot of people will have resubbed, and they know there's a good chance that almost everyone who logged in at name reservation launch time will also be logging in at launch.
---
Coming from a classic mage with t2/shadowflame:

So for those who didn’t play mage in classic yet.. just do it if u already think about it.
---
You will be able to kill 2-4 wars alone if they are not playing properly or arent super high geared (and there will be plenty of those).
---
Basicly only n811 hunters or paladin warrior duos can stomp you.. on all others u can give them a hard time and kill them if they can’t kill you before sheep, which will allows you to get full mana/health most of the time.
---
Oh nice. Thx for link.
---
And here I am in Alaska with a 20+ ms difference between Pacific and Eastern. I think I'll stay on Whitemane.
---
This guy is correct, the other posts here are wrong. Weapon skill affects your hit chance.
---
The ally ratio of the rp and pve realms is dwarfed by the horde ratio on the pvp realms. So no need to worry
---
&gt; Does anyone else miss going and getting in line to get your game at midnight?? 
---
As fun as that my have been back then, I'm glad we have downloads and pre-installs now.
---
You will level up your enchanting bu disenchanting to max skill 50 or so, after that you will have to level it up by doing enchants and of course if you don’t do that you will have low enchanting skill and therefore you wont be able to disenchant higher greens for example lvl 15 plus.

Why did I get downvoted? :/ I'm from OCE and I'm going to play on NA.
---
Finally, at least there's one person on this sub that isn't a disgusting normie
---
BGs are cross realm, more than likely. They come out in P3.
---
Rank 1 is calculated per-server, per-faction.
---
It’s just one of those unique class things.  Most classes have something that some might consider annoying.  I don’t mind but I’m sure I’ll run out one day in a bg and have to hope to get some killing blows.
---
For me green tea helps eliminate cravings between meals and it's fairly healthy as well. Plus it'll be good to stay hydrated while playing for hours at a time.
---
Ask about layering. That's the question everyone wants to know. Off after phase 1 or can we not even see it at all.

There's something ironic about having to wait yet another 2 weeks to play a 15 year old game
---
another tiny thing, the fireball applies a DoT, which I found useful when I was fighting rogues, super tiny detail though
---
True that. Small portion of people here represent their opinion of rushing, and It can give you a bad image that EVERYONE will be rushing, but it won't be like that. I'm for the organic way of playing, being adventurous, meeting and befriending new people and etc.

There were several well populated vanilla servers before Nostalrius. By the end of Cataclysm, you could already find a full realm.
---
Without them, the development of vanilla emulators and databases (praise [MaNGOS Zero](https://github.com/mangoszero)) would have never been at a state sufficiently advanced to open Nostalrius (who, contrarly to popular belief, did not rewrite all of vanilla by themselves but mainly fixed bugs and improved network code, which is still great).
---
You can say that about every class/spec, since people can suck at anything.
---
Personally, if there's a 0/51/0 feral in classic, I want to meet them, because the feral tree does not have 51 talents.
---
“yOu ThInK yOu Do BuT yOu DoNt!”
---
No, somehow my life already seems consumed by it. At this point I feel like I'll finally get some relief once it's here for real.
---
Hmm, did Shadowmeld always drop your character out of combat? I recall it only reducing threat or an out of combat stealth for all elves..? 
---
Then again, it's been 15 years so I'm very foggy.
---
Considering gold isn't even close to rare in WoW it makes sense you'd use it to print currency on.  If you wanted real resource backed currency best make it out of arcanite.
---
I'm on keto, so I mostly just eat:

---
* eggs

* peanuts
---
* heavy cream
---
* avocados
---
* baked chicken
---
* spinach
---
No I wouldn't think so either.  OP didn't really include any details though, so I'm not sure if he was simply making an observation or was trying to make a point about there not being enough servers.
---
Yea, true that, with 1 ms you want 3 points.
---
he's a loon lol
---
Just a shame Mark Kern tried to stick his name on this, the guy is disgusting
---
Yeah, how fun... being on a realm named after some random fisherman in a swamp. Yeah right. Come join r/Atiesh, and be legendary!
---
The thing is, many people will take "hybrids can play the game now" as a free license to blame their terrible play/lack of attention on their class or spec.
---
The July stress test wasn't postponed indefinitely, it happened.
---
Same my dude, they look the best in all armor IMO.
---
Get into the game, play, make some friends (talk in chat, ask questions if you need).
---
Saaame lmao. Maybe cause I was 12. But nah I can’t wait lmao. It gives you so much more immersion especially when it comes to leveling and questing
---
[Ok thanks for the response Socrates.](http://37.media.tumblr.com/cef02cf5db036c5573eb2d2c37f9d1f4/tumblr_n4pa0hT4GH1sx6qfeo1_250.gif)
---
I think it can be either a lot easier or LOT worse. Just because of instance leveling, loads of people can actually totally/partially skip it. Or it can be way worse, because if those instance groups go there, they will move in groups of 5. And they can blast to 60 much faster than before.
---
And be waiting in STV @ L60 when the masses enter it.
---
To be honest rotations aren't complicated at all. Every damage dealer has a resource builder, a resource spender and a proc. Your rotations for all of them is to use whatever button is highlighted by proc, use resource builder if proc isn't active then use a resource spender. Sure, it is more complex than a gameplay of a single class in Vanilla, but it's not something mindblowing. Combine that with no mana management because only heals use mana and you get quite simple and not engaging gameplay.
---
Leveling and questing while high is incredible. I can’t wait to experience classic while off the gravity bongs
---
Seeing Fairbanks hit High, they might need a new West Coast (Or Central) PVP realm.
---
RP/RPPVP are still medium, and I think a few PvE realms are still medium so yeah, PvP would be more likely.
---
Rushing 60 man! Gotta get ahead to make that bank off the start! Mounts are expensive lol.
---
It wasn't good or bad imo. On the one hand, it gives pvp sets value over raid sets but on the other hand it meant I was in weenie hut jr if I only pve's and got behind that season.
---
That's what we imagine stv to be like in reality there's nothing but you, some NPC's and mobs. It's a quiet day like always in stv where you can seriously push your levels and grind the fuck out in one of the largest zon-

Heres how I view it: I could go to the movies. Or I could spend half the money I would of used going to the movies, on something that will last me the next 2+ years. $9 for something that will last 2+ years is bang for your buck.
---
Not space bar, but Shift+space. You could jump attack like normal
---
If you're playing casually, then play whatever you want. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWMu6\_0UNtA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWMu6_0UNtA)  
---
That video highlights the pros and cons of each class very well.
---
Hey, I am sorry to bother you again, but will you be able to test it? I heard the beta ends today, so I guess it's the last change to test it before release.
---
To be clear you stated don’t use deadly poison not that you shouldn’t use any poison. 
---
You should always have a crippling poison and then either mind numbing or wounding depending on the circumstances.
---
Yep done already
---
agreed for sure, we always had assigned groups to dispel, worked much better and mana friendly
---
Classic has been over for 13 years and you still don't have a job? Noob
---
I'd say at least 5-6 times as many servers. They can add more if needed, but it's a reasonable start.
---
Well since we invaded the English ones not to play with our toxic countrymen, sure, go right ahead.   
---
I may even make a char on those servers to see the shitfest unfold hahaha.
---
!!!
---
Pretty sure it'll take me until at least january/february to hit 60 then lol
---
You'll want to level your bank alt to level 5 anyways. That allows you to train enchanting, you can then DE items you transfer or buy. Ironforge for alliance orgimmar for horde.
---
Sad to see you got downvoted for this, when I think you've made a good point. Some of the people most interested in Classic wow are not currently subbed, so in a backwards way the people less interested in the long term got the first dibs on names.
---
Every totem have a quest but there are no epic quests at 60
---
You could see the poor non tanking sods trying to make their groups looking for people for an hour before giving up.
---
What worked best (even if it's kinda scummy on the tanks part) was the tank selling his reserved item spot under the table to the rogue. 
---
The rogue came along as DPS like normal but paid 75-100g to the tank IF the dal'rend sword he's after drops. The warrior tank reserves this item when recruiting people, but most would assume it's for the tank himself, however it's reserved for the rogue.
---
I bought a bottle once on my way home from Hungary. I would say it's Jägermeister on steroids.
---
Yep totally agree
---
Wow you're so unique you will truly be the only one to enjoy the game and have fun
---
Aug 26
---
I paid for it and didn't even get my names. Not even mad.
---
Blizzard is now putting up ads on Twitter and Instagram. Probably on Facebook and other social media too.
---
So as a newbie to wow i want to know if there will be any expansions at all or is that it?
---
&gt; finally get Moonkin form
---
Ah yes!
---
&gt; Moonfire, Wrath, Wrath, Wrath... oom
---
Ah crap...
---
I think it was primarily about the Arenas that were released with 2.0. They needed a way to adjust balance inside the 'competitive pvp scene' without affecting the pve space.  
---
Other contributing factors:     
---
stat creep    
---
pvp reward 'incentive'   
---
pve gear 'disincentive'     
---
slow down pvp action, move away from 'kill combos'    
---
prevent 5v1 arena rush meta    
---
etc, etc.
---
Lots of reasonable issues to tackle, but all together led to a bad place.
---
I remember Arena Weapons being very good in tbc. Rogue bis weapons for multiple phases were Arena weapons
---
&gt; just go Dwarf and do not even consider Human or Night elf priest.
---
or, you know, play whatever the hell character you want because it's a game and not a fuckin life or death scenario lol
---
Started day one vanilla and the game consumed my life. Was at 90% consumption by BC launch. About 70% during wrath. Then they destroyed the old world I loved and I finally quit in Cata. From 2004 to 2011 I had almost 480 days played. Now I'm old and responsible and I can't budget the time I'd need to be fully consumed, so without your experience on a private server I'm hoping to enjoy the game in a more casual way. But I don't know if that'll work or not. Here's to hoping we both find ways to enjoy this time around.
---
WOAH there!!  
---
I'd say we pick and choose...  
---
We take a careful approach and implement Northrend, we change up pandaria a bit and include it in a "southern seas" update with Tel'abim, undermine etc.  
---
We skip Draenor cause that was silly, we pick some pieces from legion and some from BFA but include some of the BFA stuff in the southern seas update.
---
I'd argue with the amount of islands and stuff in the southern seas there are more than enough content for an update or two...  
---
With that said, undermine should probably be a part of vanilla since that has been a topic for a long long time
---
Yup moved from Whitemane to Stalagg, got the names I wanted which I didn’t get on Whitemane too so that’s a plus! Every server is gonna have queues though at launch and for the first week, it’s inevitable.
---
is this who they based this model off?
---
hahaha \*blacklisting hunter \* hahaha
---
No, they really offered free server transfers in Vanilla, but it was always specific high pop servers to a choice of a usually small group of chosen low pop servers -or- they would try to save dying servers by offering players to server transfer to more active, but not high or full pop ones as well for free.
---
You think you do, but you don't!
---
I'd love some more RP addons. I saw the IAmAMerchant addon which is in development and looking amazing, but the more the better!   
---
Also still waiting for WIM (Warcraft Instant Messenger), and is Outfitter working already?
---
 !RemindMe 12 days
---
To each thier own. I think mythic plus is fantastic and adds an infinite amount of replayability, but i understand that its not for everyone.
---
And this is JUST a name reservation...
---
And they will answer, "if you are good enough".
---
Yes, it's ask anything, not answer anything, so probably we don't get hard numbers, but we still might get hard ;)
---
Rushing to 60 is the Retail mindset. I'm here to play Classic.
---
It's funny that you consider layering a continuous community
---
Blackmane? Darkmane? :D
---
Get your CS degree, but don't fall into the trap of SF/NYC. Lots of small/midsized cities have tech companies, and they pay much better (relative to cost of living) because they have to compete for talent with the big players.
---
I did this and now I'm making around what the doctors in my area make, but I got started half a decade earlier (no med school and no med school debt hole to crawl out of). Once you land your first job try to save up 2 months expenses asap. That's your rainy day fund. Then start paying down as much of your student loan debt as you can afford every month. Once your debt is paid just start putting the money you would've used as debt payments into the bank. A few years later and you'll have a down payment on a starter home/condo. All of this goes even faster if you have a significant other and no kids.
---
My wife and I got married right out of college and bought our first house 2 years later. We were very fortunate because I got an inheritance from an aunt and it basically wiped out our college debt. Before that "the plan" had us buying a house 5 years out, not 2.
---
And for the record, I would still rather have my aunt around instead. It was fortunate for our financial life, but she is sorely missed :(
---
I am going to take a little time. Gonna be playing Druid with skinning and Leatherworking. Gonna keep proffessions up while lvling and gonna farm enough gold for Mount at 40. Playing with my wife who will be playing Rogue and she is gonna be our gatherer with mining, she also needs Mount at 40. We have Kids and can play 2 - 4 hrs a Day 5-6 days a week. Probobly gonna be 6-8 days played to reach max. 2 - 3 months to reach 60 :)
---
I never said it was hard.
---
Shamans are amazing in end game dungeons totems for everyone! In the healing department shamans are good aswell tho it doesn't really matter what healer you bring any healer can heal any dungeon easily enough.
---
Nah they'll primarily just use layering.
---
There's always the potential to injure yourself when you include weights, but the potential with kettlebells are far lower than with other forms of free weights. Form does still matter, but not nearly as much as with something like a deadlift. Kettlebells are much lighter in general, and people often underestimate the strength of their spine. Most kettlebells you can get your hands on are 35 or 40 pounds at most, and the swing ROM is not close to the depth of a deadlift. I'd actually be impressed if you throw out your back swinging that. Just check a form video on YouTube and go slow for your first week or so.
---
You're not selling my private info again, government.
---
Oh the memories!
---
Right I figured as much, I just figured Herod would be so far in the queue hole that a bunch of people would end up waiting in queue for 30+mins and attempting to make characters on Stalagg anyways so might as well be ahead of the game right?
---
I haven't been able to figure [vanilla-questing.me](https://vanilla-questing.me) out yet. Like, I create a character (night elf in my example) And then the first page just tells me to do 1 quest in the 1-6 zone and then move out to the next zone, and I'm starting at level 5.36? Or can it only be run with custom routes and I need to load route file?
---
I cant really provide you with anything since it was long ass time ago and i dont even remember what forum it was, you have every right to not believe me, but there is no reason for me to lie either, maybe im mistaken in good faith ( had to google that im still not sure i used it right)
---
Yes.
---
Veryy accurate during raid nights. Alone.
---
I can guarantee that they WILL answer it, but in somewhat vague way that leaves then room to do whatever they want in the future.
---
So you want to level 3 x 60 alts on Classic? You do know this is not BFA where you can get to 120 in 12 hrs. 3x lvl 60 - man good luck with that &lt;3 :)   
---
I am going all in on my Undead Rogue. After vanilla I always played Orc on p-servers because of them being BiS race..however..I am following my heart now..I am going for undead rogue..just like in vanilla release :D

If it helps with wait times then I’m ok with it.If they’re still stupid long then It would be pointless.
---

maybe it changed over the patches. my MC experience never reflected that. or i just can't remember right.
---
Gladius is a really great sword that everyone should  buy that uses swords. Unfortunately im a orc and can't wield it that early lol.
---
Warriors can use bows right?
---
If we get a new PvP realm it has to be Mankrik's Wife
---
I’d have:
---
• included “you think you do but you don’t”
---
• Included BfA Release
---
• Toned down on the personal opinion, try and be more factual, I.e. “WoD only received one major content patch in its lifetime, the least of any expansion”.
---
• Merged points that happen at the same time like Launch and Phase 1
---
Well this is normal for all earnings calls. Investors don't just look at the numbers but also want to understand if the products which the companies produce are going to have value to the customers because if the product is good it has potential for more sales which will grow stock value.
---
Whiskey (with an 'e') is the correct spelling for Irish whiskey.  Whisky (without an 'e') is the spelling for all other types including Scotch.
---
The walk from the graveyard to the eastern and western frontline was simply too long.
---
Yeah I’d just prefer to have more server identity. Rather not play with random Americanos from Herod.
---
Actually there are so few servers maybe they will just cross realm the lot for 24/7 insta queues?

Added 1 in already

I can't decide between Orc or Tauren for my warrior. I'll be dps/OT. 
---
Orc gets weapon mastery but i prefer Tauren. I also have to only get axes.
---
Tauren lets me have more options for weapons, but I'll have to get edgemasters handguards for raids. Which will be a pain. Will have to compete against other classes for swords too.
---
Think I  might just say fuck it and go the Tauren I want but its hard.
---
Thanks for the response! I’m genuinely curious about trying out kettlebells. One thing I’m wondering is: If kettlebells max out at 35-40 pounds, how can they build muscle as well as things like deadlifts? I’m guessing because the force of the swing, but then wouldn’t that make it just as dangerous as a deadlift since the force equals out?
---
Yeah, the hero worship he gets on this sub because he said things people wanted to hear is unreal and deeply disappointing. Even if he wasn’t an overgrown zit of a human being, it anyone who respects him took all of ten minutes to research what he’s done since he left Blizzard (or, more accurately, tried and catastrophically failed to do) they’d know that having his support should mean less than nothing. Guy’s an idiot.

It was rhetorical

Yeah me too for the past weeks... Not even playing anything else. Just reading /r/classicwow, checking for new YouTube videos and watching livestreams of beta content.
---
First song brings me back to the Madden 2004 days on ps2..
---
If they are to add additional raids, they would need to start class balancing, as some classes scales better with gear than others thereby expanding the gap between, say hunters and warriors.
---
Start running BRD while your lvling to get xp whilenyou farm that pre bis. Two birds with one stone.

I'm rollin PvE this time around to start. Maybe it will be different from them but In my experience on Pservers "world pvp" was just getting griefed by 60s. I perservered and lvl capped but I only found it annoying. Get a group of 5 trying to do something and then you can't do it because some A-hole who just has more time on his character decides he want's to camp.

I'm still not sold on training dots outside of PvP. You don't use them in your raid or dungeon rotation. Wand + voidwalker might be alittle slower than dots + be + wand for leveling but that means you'll basically always be full health and full mana and have virtually no down time outside of looking for the next mob to kill. I know pservers were different but I didn't train any of my non-essential spells for raiding while leveling on the last pserver I rolled and it worked out fine and resulted in me saving up some coin.
---
not what i said at all. i'm just curious on how many players are going to rush to 60 and how many are gonna take their time. im going to be slow because i have things irl. im not unique lmao

There's 0 nodes in Teldrassil since it's a tree, there's plenty of herbs however.

Ive been playing on a blizzlike server in Vanilla since early vanilla..
---
Because blizz expects an 80% drop in players, not a 10% like that example, and cant blame them too much actually, its a lot better optics if you have to open servers and transfer people because you have lots of demand, rather than having to merge servers because some are dead.

I've never encountered anyone using voice modulation before to RP. You're free to try, though I suspect it'll also depend on the quality of the modulation itself - For example, if the quality doesn't work well over voice chat, then most people won't like it. At the end of the day you're free to try whatever you like, if you keep in mind that most people aren't roleplaying over voice comms.

Hope it helps - Good luck!

&gt;So you want to level 3 x 60 alts on Classic? You do know this is not BFA where you can get to 120 in 12 hrs. 3x lvl 60 - man good luck with that &lt;3 :)

I am aware. I lead a simple life.

Roll pve

Thats why I will play horde :) Noone cares if I am Undead or Troll priest... or Tauren/orc/troll shammy :) Only alliance racial matters.... Alliance: every melee going human - sword spec.... every priest going dwarf - fear ward.... every mage/lock going gnome - escape artist + more int... Horde is more balanced and you will avoid that drama.

Semi relevant story:    
---
I remember in TBC I mostly was PvP focused, but there was a trinket from heroic magister's terrance I really wanted on my Druid, so I had to go run that a whole bunch.  My PvP spec was somewhat unusual, I had healing gear (after the one third of healing gets added to damage change)  and swappable weapons, yet I went all the way down the balance tree.  It gave me the most total all around magical power, plus i had some of the best in combat mana regen on the entire server.    
---
      
---
Heroic magister's terrance didn't have any enrage timers, and it was difficult enough that PuGs wiped a lot.  The speed of a run was determined by how much you could avoid dying rather than how fast you could blast through it.    
---
The few times I was able to take a "DPS" slot with my PvP spec, we fucking breezed through it like easy mode.  On easy situations, I could just focus on being a moonkin whose damage was a bit on the lower side, which slowed the group down a little, but not too badly.  If things got a bit sketchy, I worked keeping up a full stack of lifebloom on the tank into the rotation (1 instant every 7 seconds).  If they got even sketchier, I increased the amount of my casting given over to healing.     
---
And for any dungeon where there were no enrage timers and wipes were any kind of worry, it was really fucking strong.    
---
Unfortunately, it was almost impossible to ever convey that in LFG chat, and as a primarily PvP player, I didn't have a big network of dungeon running friends.  So I had to keep respecing to straight resto and running it the conventional way (which my gear was strong enough to do)... which was always much more difficult and the group was always much more prone to wipes and failures.  And spent the whole time thinking "this would be going so much faster and easier if I wasn't tied to cookie cutter regular mode."    
---
Of course to be fair lots of or even most people doing off spec or otherwise whacky things are just objectively sub optimal, but just the freedom to explore other things is pretty enticing.
---
You say ‘can tank as arms’ yet nobody played past level 40
---
You’ve hit the nail on the head. I call the feeling of having no game to invest yourself in ‘gaming limbo’ and truly it is hell.

I have a anti grief rule for myself. Never kill the same player more than twice. Im not a monster!

I gaurentee you Fartmuncher is taken

---
Yay team fairbanks!  Noticed all of your tunes are on there.  See you in classic!  My guild is rolling fairbanks as well.
---
For realms that are full right now, I predict over 4 hour queues at launch.
---
I treated it like paying $8 for getting my name, playing the stress test and configuring all my addons. Think it was worth it.
---
You bring the girls, we'll supply the alcohol.
---
That would be fantastic, thank you!
---
My wording wasn't very clear. With "unique unit" I was trying to say any unit that you haven't killed before. Eventually you should be able to filter between normal units, elite units, and rare units but not right now.
---
They've used the same textures and just sharpened everything up... I dont want new models or textures. They've managed to keep the oldschool feel and look but also increased its fidelity. People that didnt play back in Vanilla dont seem to understand what I'm getting at and it's really frustrating.
---
Trying to convince yourself that you bring value to the game
---
I'm still out of the country until mid October sadly.  My brother was nice enough to reserve my toon name for me though.  I'll be playing different at 30 vs when I was 16 and 17.
---
not true. Anecdotal evidence aside, subscriber count peaked at late WotLK and started a downward trajectory from there. Cata was the beginning of the end of retail.
---
If you give people the option to complete content without making friends then they just won’t do it. Convenience kills community. I’ve said it for years and will still say it. One day games will learn this and start profiting off it once again.
---
Correct me if I am wrong... but totem quests are rather painful than enjoyable....
---
If it takes an ill-fitting barbie doll race for you to roll Horde, I'm glad you'll be staying on the Alliance.

Which has the better quality of life at 60? Farming gold, raid/dungeon dps &amp; pvp usefulness

Thanks

You also forgot the open alpha at blizzcon 2018.

It was also access to the stress test all weekend ;-)

I would wager, that most casuals (the vast majority of players) wont be reserving their names and will be joining later.
---
I’ve been out of the loop with classic. I didn’t even know it was coming out this year until a random guy brought it up last week. 
---
I didn’t have a computer to play on so I built one last weekend. I’m pumped!
---
I mained a resto druid through BC and Wrath, then got hit by the bitch that was Cataclysm dungeons. I remember trying out a Priest then slipping into a depression and swapping to Mage for a while lmao.
---
En usko yhtään että suurin osa menossa golemagg. Vaan discordissa ilmoittaneet ovat menossa, ja ne ovat varmasti vähemmistöosuus kaikista suomalaisista, sillä itsellä on useita kiltoja jo nyt tiedossa ketkä menossa Golemagg.
---
It's a slippery slope to make any changes, no matter how small they may seem.
---
Aoe looting is however not a small qol change. It would completely change the meta in terms of boosting dungeons, mage/priest/paladin aoe farming etc. It would barely benefit any other class which usually kills one mob at a time while substantially increasing the xp/hr and gph of aoe grinding and boosting.

Chances are Blizzard will add more servers to EU ENG in the coming weeks if you're really set on it.
---
This is peak performance
---
Countdown to Classic is going Horde on Herod
---
The way you model change in modern client gets detected with other malicious cheats so you will probably be banned pretty fast instead of the blind eye blizzard took with the old model changing. 
---
So tldr don't do it.
---
Did I fuck up by forcing my girlfriend to play a priest to be a pocket healer for my warrior? Can any other class heal my warrior? Pic related.
---
edit: video of her leaving our apartment
---
Mount? Mount is at level 40. That's over 30% of time needed to reach 60. If somebody who wants "just to try the game" even reaches level 40, he is hooked. He won't be leaving anytime soon.
---
Unlike FF14. where they literally turn off character creation daily depending on server status. Can take weeks for someone to get on a server with their friends.
---
True, but the rest already are.
---
Wondering if anyone who's played the beta can comment on if the taurens extra melee leeway is really a noticeable advantage. I strongly prefer undead for the aesthetic, but if taurens are just gonna be outranging me all day, I'll probably regret rolling undead.
---
Link doesn't work for me.
---
I'm 110% down for them adding MORE content to Classic, especially stuff like Azshara Crater.  I've specifically asked lots of people excited about Classic the same question, thinking how awesome it would be to have content past Naxx, but not early since it would upset the balance. And then, after that, maybe move on to TBC...
---
Isn't the world record for speed levelling to 60 like 4 days /played?
---
even after ww3
---
I’ll try to get this done for you

it breaks the immersion if you have to alt tab to spotify every time you cross the border

Your title is the opposite of what you’re asking btw
---
As a vanilla hunter main who had an alt of very class at or above 50 by TBC, I found this hilarious man. I laughed my way through the entire thing. Thank you for making this!
---
I mean all 3 realms are named after Molten Core bosses so it's not like people had a choice :D
---
I am having the most trouble deciding if I should play an Orc Arms warrior or Hunter. I love having the pet, traps, and the nature aspect of hunters but I also love being melee and kind of a badass unstoppable force of strength on a warrior. How do i decide/what should i choose?!
---
Never get Boomkin talent unless you are raiding. Watch most private server balance druid pvp videos and they are almost always half and half resto
---
R
---
I think I don't but I'm Bob.
---
I also hope I’m right. I can see both sides to the issue and who actually know how many other players will fill the servers. I think it’s safe to assume all servers will have a very healthy population but who knows. I could come back in three months and say the servers were full but now it’s a ghost town because the classic nostalgia wore off. One of the more interesting things about Classic is we don’t know if it will thrive for years to come or spike and plummet.  We already know what we’re getting in terms of the game itself so the only real question mark is will it last. I feel like I will play by for the long haul but who knows, maybe even the most committed people on launch will get over it in a couple months.

Orc or Tauren for Shaman?
---
The hardest thing would be to look into the mirror and know that your a waste of space for choosing the wrong spec that your parents are disappointed in you. /wrist quit at life HOLY OR GTFO.. 
---
But hey do what ever you enjoy and at least you can buff improved might.
---
Tauren came from Yaungol.
---
How dare you imply that the filthy horde scum forsaken are any relation to the beautiful race humans. 
---
The holy light will purge the once pristine lands of the unholy blight. I will bring down a righteous fury and holy judgement upon the heathens.
---
One horny human had to much drinks in the bar and woke up with a cow in his bed.
---
Yes pls. Classic+ is what would hype me the most no doubt. I think the team could pull it off well and make new content true to vanilla philosophies.
---
Blizzard doesn't want to merge servers, ever. That's why they invented the connected realms crap, even though it's technically the same thing they won't get the "WoW is dying, merging realms" headlines lol
---
FOR THE V4!
---
To be fair, Undead could understand/speak common for communicating with alliance players back in early vanilla
---
No no, Grobbulus is the black line on the far left.
---
Anyone remember the Horde Orc NPC that you first met, when your quest was to act as a NPC and he was passing by, taking a quest from you and going away, just to be found in the water and rescued from you and just to become "Heroes of the Horde" with him later on?  
---
The only reason I know this is that I actualy had to level my Undead Rogue and passed by that area and did the quest. Not "BOOM level 100" and "Yay, insta purple item! Let's fly over the world to find more."  
---
I love flying and flying mounts, but IMHO this should be something you REALLY EARN and not either get by leveling or paying for it. I mean leveling/paying should be a minimum requirement, but earning it should be the main task. Like how you had to "earn" the Pandarian Shenlong Dragons and the ability to mount them up.  
---
Ok, it wasn't that hard, but it was really annoying to collect those ultra rare, if I remember correctly only 4h spawning, dragon eggs.
---
No free legendaries? I hope so! I mean for a casual like me it was already hard, since I wouldn't play the game too long to collect them. Legendaries should be coupled with a lot of work and patiente, so that in the end you have something OP in your hands.
---
No free epics? Yes, please! Hearing that "being green equipped" is already very good for the beginning and even this should be not easy to archieve.. makes me really value every single item upgrade. "What!? A BLUE Item!? YAAAAAAAAAY!". And if I ever manage to get purple items, I can be like "Look at me bois. I have purple equip ;)" and lets be honest.. at some point we all want to be a little famous.
---
Horde &amp; Alliance not working together? Well, lore wise very good! I mean.. I like the fact that the horde wouldn't get hate anymore, but the real threat the Legion, but I also like the semi rivality of Horde &amp; Alliance. The sad point is that I am Horde in my heart, but I have to pick Alliance since the Paladin Buffs are just too good to give up. 
---
I guess some things will be missed.. I mean a lot of things were simply QoL adjustments and losing them means less quality, but in the other hand, the game becomes more "Do something to get something" instead of "Oh, you logged in? Here, a Legendary!"
---
Why? Do you think it's better that a name just remains unused by some name hoarder than someone actually getting to use it for their character?
---
I never die
---
it just changes the look of some areas very drastically, for the better or worse is debatable
---
Looking for Plagueis or Alatar or names with lock puns on theros I have bighat on Herod and whitemane
---
I don't know what I've just seen.
---
It's not even throwing shade. Very limited people liked Cata and I have never once seen anything positive about WoD other than all of the raids were 10/10.
---
**U N D E A D (Forsaken)**
---
Bound to the iron will of the tyrant Lich King, the vast undead
---
armies of the Scourge seek to eradicate all life on Azeroth. Led by
---
the banshee Sylvanas Windrunner, one group of undead broke
---
away from the Scourge and freed themselves of the Lich King’s
---
domination. These renegades call themselves the Forsaken. They
---
fight a constant battle not only to retain their freedom from the
---
Scourge, but also to exterminate those who would hunt them as
---
monsters.
---
With Sylvanas as their banshee queen, the Forsaken have built a
---
dark stronghold beneath the ruins of Lordaeron’s former capital
---
city. This hidden ‘Undercity’ forms a sprawling labyrinth that
---
stretches beneath the haunted woods of the Tirisfal Glades. From
---
this bastion, the Forsaken wage an unending battle against the
---
Scourge as well as the remaining humans who still seek to reclaim
---
their lands. For though the very land is cursed, the zealous humans
---
of the Scarlet Crusade cling to their scattered holdings, obsessed
---
with eradicating the undead and retaking their once-beautiful
---
homeland.
---
Convinced that the primitive races of the Horde can help them
---
achieve victory over their enemies, the Forsaken have entered an
---
alliance of convenience with the savage orcs and the proud tauren.
---
Harboring no true loyalty for their new allies, they will go to any
---
lengths to ensure their dark plans come to fruition.
---
As one of the Forsaken, you must eliminate any who pose a threat
---
to the new order – be they human, undead, or otherwise.
---
**UNDERCITY**
---
Far beneath the ruined capital city of Lordaeron, the royal crypts
---
have been turned into a bastion of evil and undeath. Arthas
---
originally intended the Undercity to be the Scourge’s seat of
---
power, but the budding city was abandoned when he was recalled
---
to aid the Lich King in distant Northrend. In Arthas' absence, the
---
Dark Lady, Sylvanas Windrunner, led the rebel Forsaken to the
---
Undercity and claimed it for her own. Since taking up residence,
---
the Forsaken have worked to complete the Undercity’s construction
---
by dredging out the twisted maze of catacombs, tombs, and
---
dungeons that Arthas began.
---
**NOTABLE FORSAKEN**
---
* **Sylvanas Windrunner** - Before the coming of the plague, Sylvanas
---
Windrunner was the brave Ranger-General of Silvermoon. During the Third War, Prince Arthas invaded the elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas. Sylvanas led her forces in a desperate struggle against the undead Scourge, but Arthas eventually defeated the high elves and transformed Sylvanas into one of his banshee slaves. Cursed to
---
mindless undeath, Sylvanas only regained her will when the Lich
---
King's powers waned. Eventually she outwitted the Scourge and broke away with her rebel faction, which she came to be known as the Forsaken. Now she rules over the Forsaken from the Undercity of Lordaeron. Her goal is to take vengeance upon Arthas one day and find lasting freedom for her cursed people.
---
* **Varimathras** - The dreadlord Varimathras was one of three demons appointed to rule over the Plaguelands on behalf of the Burning Legion. These dreadlords sought to overthrow the death knight Arthas and undo the power of the undead Scourge. Varimathras and his brethren coordinated their efforts with those of the banshee Sylvanas Windrunner in an attempt to overthrow Arthas and claim Lordaeron.
---
Though their plot worked as planned, Sylvanas turned on the dreadlords next.
---
In order to save his own life, Varimathras was forced to swear allegiance toSylvanas and her Forsaken warriors. Now he serves as her majordomo andworks ceaselessly to safeguard the Undercity from all threats.
---
* **Master Apothecary Faranell** - In life, Faranell was an alchemist of great renown and spent the better part of his days studying amongst the learned wizards of Dalaran. He enjoyed nothing more than experimenting with concoctions of
---
every sort, always looking to create a serum for this, an antidote for that. After he died from the plague and rose as one of the Forsaken, his limitless curiosity was twisted by depthless sadism. Now Faranell uses his skills in service to Queen Sylvanas by crafting alchemical monstrosities and designing newer, more devastating plagues and toxins.

But yeah, some food still missing. Lángos has too!
---
Yup, they got it. Even if they don't enter the world - they created the character.
---
Yeah sure, and I don't need to do anything to reset the settings?
---
Comfy post. Thanks for sharing the kind words. Best of luck to you in your adventures! Lok Tar
---
Taurens are believed to be as old as the NEs, which means they were created when the world was blessed by the Titans. Along with NEs, Tauren have the ability to enter the Emerald Dream, which furthers this assumption.
---
My whole guild is a bunch of guys who played back in vanilla, but now we’re obviously a lot older and with jobs and wives and shit... so it’s gonna be a ~6 month grind. No one is planning to do anything resembling racing, so don’t feel bad if you’re not pushing it to the limit!
---
That is exactly what I’m doing!
---
is that high lord wolnir's crown?
---
"Invite to flashmob layer!"
---
If you're not a hardcore player APES is not gonna be a problem for you. You might be ganked by a APES member from time to time, but you will also get ganked with multiple people from different guilds as well.   
---
The only "problem" is if you're a hardcore to the bone PvE/PVP player that wants to dominate the raids or the BG's, then APES can be a challenge towards that.
---
Yeah, I threw around spec and class so much I mixed them up.
---
I don't mind it too much since I'm rolling on Whitemane. It would've just been my alt but now maybe it'll be someone's main instead.
---
Most people you meet will be friendly and happy to help/answer your questions , don't be discouraged if you meet a few "bad apples"
---
Hunter beast master spec is the easiest lvling experience by a lot ,in classic wow.
---
Take your time to enjoy the game,don't rush it...the lore is just amazing.
---
It will get frustrating at some points but that only adds to the fun 
---
Make friends,be nice to others and this game will be one of the best games you have ever played.
---
and as Shiqznima said : " Don't feel obligated to get the first character you start leveling to 60. If you aren't having fun, reroll. "
---
World of Warcraft will change your life. Must have experience. May the light be with you.

Not all humans are part of the alliance. But yeah coming fro lorderan they most likely were

Water walking was great in SSC in tbc though.
---
Only fun mmorpg in 2019.
---
Classic, not retail.
---
I've been on here since there were less than 20k subscribers. I've noticed a huge change in the past few weeks. When the sub was still small, everyone was a total Classic/Vanilla geek, clearly only played that version of WoW, all the discussion was about Classic/Vanilla and got very technical and assumed base knowledge of that version of the game. We endlessly debated tiny details of the game and had a blast doing it. Based on the really great (read: community-aligned) decisions the Classic team at Blizz have made over the past year, I am guessing they were reading and maybe even participating in a lot of those conversations.
---
Over the past few weeks, a kind of sea change has taken place as we hit 100k subs and started rocketing up from there. I am seeing a big share of the comments coming from new subscribers who are clearly coming over from Retail, or from other games, or wherever.
---
This is not a bad thing - it's really cool to see. This game is going to be pretty mainstream even though it's 15 years old. I am really happy I got to watch this sub grow from a small, hard core of Classic lovers into what it's becoming now. The next month is going to be an absolute blast.
---
That's very [disturbing typo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalag)
---
Most weapons are strictly better on melee classes, but weapons with stats are what you want. If it is a proc weapon you dont want it since you will hopefully never proc it.
---
I know you're being sarcastic, but they along with troggs and constructs were born from the earth.
---
dont be afraid to ask for directions or if you need help with a quest. People will atleast point you in the right direction. If your on thalnos you can join my guild.
---
**Stalag**
---
In  Germany, stalag (; German: [ˈʃtalak]) was a term used for prisoner-of-war camps. Stalag is a contraction of "Stammlager", itself short for Kriegsgefangenen-Mannschaftsstammlager.

To add more to the other comment - there is a mining trainer and a blacksmithing trainer in the town in Darkshore and both trainers are missing from Darnassus, so don't expect training in anything related to mining there. The zone has mostly  copper (I say mostly because I am not sure if there is anything else than copper, need someone else to confirm).

---
But lewd that more better name. :D
---
I know it’s a joke but if my girlfriend plays I’d recommend a Druid
---
I'm gonna level quite fast yeah, but not with only that in mind. I will also help a friend getting his Whirlwind Axe at level 30, and do some fun stuff on the side. 3-4 weeks should be doable, I got 2 weeks free from work.
---
Heh.. anus
---
But it serves no purposes if it's unused. Isn't it better if someone actually can be happy with a good character name?
---
Not playing the game and using the time improving my real life would be optimal, but I want to play the game for fun and I'll play it how I like.
---
As a NE priest will I be able to raid, experience all of the games content and heal competently whilst liking the look of my character?
---
Absolutely. 
---
As a dwarf priest, will I be able to shadowmeld+mind control people in world pvp laughing my ass off and like the look of my character? 
---
NOPE.
---
Nobody in there right mind who is playing to enjoy the game should pick a character they don't want to play on the sole basis of a racial. Sure they'll be occasions when I wish I had fear Ward, but I'll get a lot more enjoyment playing what I want to.
---

Unless he's trying to be an engineer. Then his life is over already.
---
One sentence? Sell AOE and Runescape to us in one sentence. Lol
---
If you're used to those, you'll at least easily grasp WoW at its base. It's a great game and classic will hopefully bring the great community that first made the game so great.
---
As far as consumption, it all depends on what you put into it. Like AOE and RS, the more time you put into it the more you gain from it.
---
Good luck, hope you at least try it!
---
100% Winterspring, my memories from 55-60 back in 2006.
---
Remember when this wasn't standard?  Pepperidge Farm does! Where being faithful was normal.
---
Sold, Classic it is
---
imo undead should be able to be every other race - just "undead".
---
like undead tauren, undead gnome, undead dwarf. but that's just my fantasy.
---
Hunters melee weapons are just sticks with stats on them. Melee classes base their damage on the weapon. 
---
It’s like doing RFK and the rare bat boss drops that incredible bow, and a rogue takes it from you because he wants the +3 agility. Nope, nope, nope! It ain’t right!
---
Doesn't matter if it's better or worse though.
---
They shouldn't have to play to keep the character the created. 
---
If a loved one passes and they take time away from the game, they aren't allowed to keep their name?
---
Doesn't make sense.
---
What you think is the original classic experience.
---
Great work!
---
It’ll be dead.
---
Maybe not the oomkins...
---
This is a timeless method.
---
What is the point of this post?
---
once you get i think close to lvl 30 you can get a soul bag which makes it alot easier to retain your shards. Its not bad imo just kinda tedious but its the same in my eyes as buying ammo as a hunter
---
I still play D2 on a private server community these days.  Super fun for new seasons or just jumping in.
---
Yes, this is what I came back for. Not rushing my experience, gonna enjoy every moment.
---
Males definitely make plate armor look great.
---
You’re an idiot, go back to retail, they balanced classes there and it feels so good right
---
Yes
---
if you are expecting great graphics WOW classic won;t be a game for you, If you want to play WOW with good graphics and cool animations then retain WOW might help you. If you want to play a MMORPG then classic WOW is for you, if you want to play a lobby game and single player game then retail WOW is for you.
---
it's your choice, I left WOW at cataclysm expac and now I am coming back to play this game again, classic WOW (AKA vanilla WOW) the best RPG game ever made, as this game reminds of playing board games and games in general as it has a very solid rule sets made around the universe of WOW.
---
It's from an old wow themed webcomic, I'll see if I can find it for you.
---
Especially considering the templated characters get like 20 free health pots on creation.
---
Way higher than 10k, but no one knows the actual numbers. There were 15k+ queues just to get in and reserve a character on the initial PvP realms, so you can imagine the total player count and characters
---
Report and move on

There is this "only 12 days" post and I am like "ONLY!? Dude ONLYYYYYYY!?".

I am refreshing this page with more than the speed of light, which means that time for me goes slower relative to the normal person. 12 seconds are like a year for me, so again.. ONLY?!
---
The old and new models don't have the same skeleton rigs, so you can't have both without one of the two looking weird on any animation. Blizzard probably thought the new models weren't looking good because of that and they didn't want to change the old models that alot of people like just to add the new models.

I have never played wow, but am a huge warcraft fan. I wanted to play vanilla back in the day but never got the opportunity. Now here I am, subbed and ready. Bursting with excitement waiting for classic to be released. I cant wait to play this game, which I sadly missed 15 years ago!

Oh I know, but it would be neat. That's what I hope for in the next decade or so.

Glad to be a part of this lol. Joined yesterday.
---
What if it were created as an alt?  I do not intend to play my first alt within the first six weeks.
---
Totally agree.  All my boys and my guild are saying I should run human for my sword spec combat rogue, but when I was a child I had a NE and I'm getting to level 10 and running the treacherous path to Elwynn and by god I am going to enjoy the nostalgia.
---
100%. But unfortunately that doesn't exist currently and the internet is full of trolls and assholes. 😂😂😂
---
Nothing, just install the addon, there is no need to reset the settings since everything that is stored can be changed in-game via chat commands or under "Interface" settings.

Gank fodder good band name

I like number 3!
---
I actively play OSRS and I’m generally happy that most of the textures and gameplay mechanics are the same since 2007. I don’t play a lot of late game stuff but I’m content in that I can recognize the base game while still knowing there’s more content to explore out there.
---
Number 1 is good too. I started on BC so I’d love to see it reintroduced.
---

They shouldn't have to play it at all? A character that never enters the world has literally no purpose.
---
It's not about 15 dollars being a lot of money. I earn a good wage and 15 dollars isn't going to be missed, but on principle I'm not paying 15 dollars to reserve a fucking MMO name. I just don't care about it that much.
---
OCe servers, no question. Both are Medium pop now.
---
You mean miss the most fun in the game?
---
People won't roll the weak faction of the realm and they will get unbalanced a lot faster.
---
Haha
---
Hey irishfro,
---
Retail WoW is playable up to level 20 for free. You could download (if you have the space) WoW overnight while you sleep and choose any server on US, OCE, EU, etc and check how the ping is on retail WoW.
---
I imagine the ping would be very similar for Classic servers.
---
Best of luck!
---
What did I miss?!
---
Same for me I tried several times it just doesn't show up on the list

rough man, yeah i'm pretty spoiled here I have 200 tv channels and gigabit internet for about 35 dollars a month.
---
They are not Alliance but many of them could have been Alliance. Good lore.
---
A lot of what i’ve been told is Arms is much better to level as til 60, then once you can make the swap go fury 1h. This is due to many of the pserver tricks that made fury godlike during leveling don’t work in classic.
---
I never cared so much about my name in games. I gave it some I like but I already have an active subscription and would not turn it off just for this
---
Just another field day in the DMZ.   
---
Oh wait ...
---
Ghennas is safe? Thoughed APES are going Ghennas ??
---
Questie, Classicguide, Guideline,WoW-Pro Guides...and Zygor will be out on release day if you want to pay for pretty much the same as the others do.
---
I like to min max and play with others that min max. 
---
That being said you can meme spec and min max. 
---
If you dont want to play with people you dont have to. 
---
Play what you want to play and play with who you want to.
---
This is such a weirdly subjective timeline, and unnecessary besides.
---
super humman bless yall
---
Your RP could be "a regular kind of dude" play. All the pvp is worth a try plus random rp acts are just added value
---
not gunna lie hoping my irl buddys pick whitemane so i have an excuse to roll my horde alt there.
---
It's always the way.  Someone writes 'Hello World' in Python and they are a suddenly full-stack C++ developer.  Every thread throws up so much bullshit that simply doesn't apply to the real world.
---
It says its gone but anything along them lines will be fine mate
---
Just a reminder that not everyone who plays this game has a pulse
---
its cool u should try it
---
Even if i'm using mode 3 that doesnt exist anymore? Or did i misunderstand?
---
the resemblance is uncanny
---
I don't get it at all lol... go to the streamer server or don't. 
---
It really doesn't matter.
---
I wouldn't recommend trying wow on a ps now that classic is so close anyway, a one month subscription isn't much to pay for the best game ever made. And the first levels as well as starting zones aren't the best experience for some people, it might be a tad annoying having to do it again with the exact same class and race if you feel like you've already made up your mind on what to play.
---
Yeah I never played Dwarf so I decided dwarf priest for new lore and quests not knowing it’s such a highly recommended race/class combo. I think people should really play what they want and find a group of people that are cool with that.
---
Rogue
---
For your needs you should seek out Classic Aura Durations (tracks buffs and debuffs) and Classic Castbars. Two separate addons.
---
You know nothing
---
Rogue. Youre looking for a rogue.
---
Over night he said. With 500mbps the game will be at least playable in literally 2 seconds :D
---
  we know the names
---
There it is boys. *nods slowly* there it is.
---
Doing reasonably competetive damage in PvE scenario's.
---
&gt;satisfy personal greed?
---
Tell yourself what you want, you dumb sweaty neckbeard. It's not personal greed, but it's hilarious how smart you think you are yet you can't connect the dots with what I've said.
---
Please, for the love of god block me over an argument you started.
---
Same will always welcome hybrids in my groups! Brings so much diversity! It’s a game after all
---
It will be much less than 6 days played to level alts.. just use rested EXP to it's max and it's very easy to do alongside gearing up a main
---
&gt; addon system is a combo of the vanilla and retail
---
Funny how the #nochanges crowd was okay with doing away with classic mainstays like decursive...
---
I'm talking like Tyler1 and those guys who BM like fucking crazy and just scream and act like children. Asmongold, being a toxic dbag all the time. As I said, it has nothing to do with if they're "really like that". They do these things to people who aren't asking for it(as in someone playing a roll of a shitty person on a tv show etc where they're all actors and know what's going down is completely different), which makes them shitty people no matter what.
---
I wasn't really talking about Soda. Afaik he doesn't really do that type of shit although admittedly I don't watch him ever so ymmv. Just in general, if you're acting like a toxic shithead, regardless of if you're calling it "a character", you're still being a toxic shithead. Simple as that.
---
If someone is playing casually, the best bet is to play on a populated server that isn't as full as the others (Shazz, etc).
---
OP could have limited time, which would mean that on a normal day during peak hours if he wants to play - queue times could be a huge bummer.
---
Horde scum
---
It is the highest damage/mana spell. Dps as a geared holy priest would be at least 2x the best wand.
---
People on this sub care waaaaay too much about names.
---
As long as the opposite faction isn't planning on full tryhard griefing very early on, just for the lulz, I am ok with it.
---
Fat kid gets picked last for a reason. Same with a rogue who wants Thunderfury.
---
Let this man eat cake.
---
I know someone who knew nothing and he became a king. Im on a good way
---
You can ping the Blizzard servers in your command prompt, check out https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/7871
---
Not a brag on anything. But my yesterday's post was on r/all and I saw a shit ton of people from outside of wo community who didn't know about classic coming out or even what it is. I had to answer so many comments i feel like blizz should pay me for the free advertising.
---
There will be crossrealm bg's as well, so that wont matter either
---
Hey mate! Im looking for an addon that auto accept quest, but also that will auto share quest. Does questie have that? If no it is possible to do? Thanks!
---
Because we prefer to play the game, rather than play a minigame within the game.
---
I have no issue with RP, but every server I've seen it on has devolved in to some weird anime sexuality shit in Goldshire.
---
On top of that, I'm sure it's fun for people, but acting like others are scared of it for not enjoying it is really condescending. Especially, acting like they're both childish and scared is extra condescending.
---
I really wonder if they definitely go down to one world even if there still like 50k players on the major servers after a few months. Sounds like a huge shitshow to me.
---
I have a sub i just didnt cared about the name or the server... I guess i should hurry before everything is full?
---
Yeah you have a point, but I kinda skimmed his post so I could give him a quick answer :P
---
As a simple addon. You get rank 14, if you are the #1 ranked person of your faction for 12 weeks in a row. 
---
Though, your numbers look wrong. Bracket six is 0.137%? That's 1.3 people per 1000. And BR 2 is 0.002%? That's 1 player per 50k, so even on a stacked layered server this pretty much means 1 person. That can't be right.
---
When I think about the 10 days to get 60, the time it takes to complete dungeons, then raids....
---
He also fucked his aunt so..
---
needs to reset 1every 18hours though and run a seperate day night cycle. so the same hour block doesnt get locked to pve/pvp every day
---
Holy shit bois, we did it.
---
Dog whistle? Uhm no, i'm pretty clear on what my point is, that's not what dog whistle means.
---
And yea I don't fully believe them. That's because Blizzard doesn't always keep their promises. So what's the harm in asking them again to guarantee that layering will be gone by phase 2?
---
Doesnt mean they level up in 1 week, stack up consumables and world buffs and go for week 2 clear.
---
Based on what numbers. They are not reported sp you cant sayvthat statement with certainty
---
How can you resist the temptation?
---
tailoring's money is in bags, less and less people need robes over time, but more people reach 60 and start doing alts which need bags...
---
alch is in supplying pots/buffs for raiders
---
i would probably go tailor/herb if the main goal is gold. Herbalism doesn't need a pick and you only pick once rather than the 3 times to mine out, and once you know the spawns for the rare high level stuff you can make easy money.
---
It still exists, I guess you just misunderstood something. When I said that AddIgnore is deprecated, I meant that I have to replace it with C_FriendList.AddIgnore, not remove the mode completely.
---
Wow lol welcome.
---
I agree with you that people should pick what they want to play.
---
That seems pretty damn substantial
---
Yeah but being the best racial in the game doesn't mean anything when you can still successfully raid without it. Playing a race you actually enjoy more is the better choice.
---
yeah I'm not subbing until the night before. I want Blizzard to know without I doubt that I'm coming back solely for Classic.  
---
a few of my friends might be playing Classic too but they haven't subscribed yet either. there will be a massive surge of players when classic drops  that I promise Blizzard won't be prepared for
---
Cat druid is for fite
---
hehe, nope the guy at one point skipped his class quests which had a very linear sructure back then. Happened to various classes. Many shamans for example reached lvl 60 without a water? totem in their Spellbook.
---
People will be making a discord event instead of a wow event.
---
What would you ask of death?
---
They won't be the majority (or any other nations for that matter), so I wouldn't worry about that
---
Who cares? We will all die in the end but epics are soulbound.
---
Yes, went from nolifing 12 hours a day for like 10 years to a dad with newborn and wife and fulltime job. I played open beta last week and already played too much than intended. Thats why i wont be playing this game because im afraid i cant control myself and will play too much. I will play short games where i can hop in and out anytime i want like overwatch. Nothing can beat wow though but honestly i think with classic the grind is too much it will eventually get stale after a month or so, because i played for a couple thousand hours in vanilla already and nothing is new.
---
**The Rogue**
---
The rogue is one of the most lethal character classes in the game,
---
able to deal out immense damage in a short period of time.
---
The most effective rogues sneak through the shadows without
---
detection, and then strike enemies from behind with a flurry of
---
assassination attacks. Yet, for all their fast-hitting power, rogues
---
are not very durable, relying on quickness and stealth for protection
---
instead of armor and high health.
---
**Allowable Races:** Orc, Troll, Undead, Dwarf, Gnome, Human,
---
Night Elf
---
**Primary Attributes:** Agility, Strength, Stamina
---
**Common Weapon Skills:** Daggers, Thrown, Unarmed
---
**Advanced Weapon Skills:** Bows, Crossbows, Fist Weapons,
---
Guns, One-Handed Maces, One-Handed Swords
---
**Armor Proficiencies:** Cloth, Leather
---
**Class Abilities**
---
The rogue has an array of abilities. It can sneak past enemies
---
undetected, deliver massive damage through special attacks,
---
finishing moves and use poisons. The rogue can also learn
---
lockpicking to open doors and chests, and learn the pick pockets
---
ability to steal coins and items.
---
Many of the rogue's combat abilities require energy to use.
---
Rogues begin combat with their energy bars filled, but lose
---
energy as they use abilities. The bar refreshes quickly over time,
---
though. Managing the energy bar is thus one of the rogue's
---
primary responsibilities during combat.
---
In addition to dealing damage and achieving special effects,
---
I think everyone agrees with that. But it's also kinda blizzards own doing as they dont say a word even when people are freaking out.
---
Like if Blizzard came into one of the "rage" threads and said "hey guys, this isn't how layering is supposed to work, and also we promise this will be gone in a month" 99% of the rage would be gone. But apparently a biillion dollar company lacks the means to communicate properly with their customers, so this is what happens.
---
It's theoretical but impractical
---
Where my grobbulus friendos at
---
I played with addons since early on in vanilla, the automated stuff never worked as well as actually playing so I only used that stuff for farming. I will not miss it at all though. The macros can still be used pretty much the same as the old days with 1 button to cast a chain of spells etc. That was always there and  a lot of people frowned on that as well.
---
Are you gonna keep this updated when Vanilla comes back and after? By the dates I can see that the topic is fairly new and would hate to see if it would go outdated some time in the future. Guides like the ones from [Kargoz](https://forum.classicwow.live/user/kargoz) for instance lost on their viabilty completeky without such checkups. 
---
Out of my favourite sources like [wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-raids) or [mmo](https://mmoauctions.com/news/wow-classic-raids-guide-about-phases-of-raiding), I just would love to see the same happening here :)
---
My best to you as well!
---
im in knowing of how to get rag one because i did mc in vanila before and no one give me shit material at all to even make epic rag. so never was able to play rag paly. realy just want thunderbolt sword pretty much for my rouge but u can just fuck me instead because i feel like my guild doesnt give fuck about me and just give the sword to another better rouge or they probaly rather give sword to some random hunter than me becaue i feel like my guild just fuck me do u know?
---
Druid or Mage?
---
I’m having so much fun playing druid in retail at the moment, mainly “catweaving”. (Going resto with some cat DPS)  
---
This is the only experience I have playing druid. Will I enjoy it as much if I roll one in classic?
---
Mage seems like a safe bet, good in PvP and PvE but abit boring?   
---
It feels a like Druid has more of challenge.
---
You guys live in a bubble
---
Just FYI for anyone else reading this, while Leatrix Plus looks pretty cool, it in no way does any upgrade ranking like Pawn.
---
Full doesn't really mean full though. You can very likely join any "Full" server. Blizz has said that "full" really means "go to another server to spread out population please" and not "server is at maximum capacity"
---
Hand of rag is good for rets because the good weapons go to the warriors and hunters. 
---
A rogue getting thubderfury is a rare and dismal thing. It means that the 6-8 warriors for tanking horseman already have one
---
wheres the peace button?
---
My classic raid healing experience as a priest in vanilla WoW was having a 4x4 cm empty space in the middle of my screen, and the rest was flooded with raid health bars, abilities, raid messages, decursive, threat meters and similar stuff.
---
Why give that up? :D
---
Wow. Thanks for quick replies...I’ll look into rogue. Also, which race is most useful to be a rogue for PvP?  I saw races have certain passives/abilities?
---
Its not that hard, most bg fights are group fights. Everytime you see your group gonna win the fight, just drain soul dieing targets, you will get a soul shard each time enemy dies. You dont need go ham with nuke spells if your group outnumbers enemies 2:1.
---
as a warrior you should always be in DW in every execute phase for faster rage generation.
---
nice thing about 2h fury is you wont get any threat problems because you are not topping dmg meters. some like this, others love to be under the tank in the threat meter because if the tank dies its your job to equip a shield and hit the shieldwall button to save the raid.
---
for pvp get zinrokh.
---
I dont think we were the majority on EU-Bloodscalp either. Maybe I'm wrong. We will see. We can be very toxic...
---
No one really uses it because its expensive as f to use. You need the flask and all sp consumables for it to be better than IP. And its still not huge dps boost.
---
I made screenshot, legal contract.
---
IIRC several years ago the creators of relationship_advice admitted that they created it as a troll sub.
---
Forgot the moment when brack said "you think you do, but you don't"
---
Very good question! Make sure to ask it
---
Yeah same. I just got back from a five year break a couple months ago.
---
I must admit I’m really struggling to get back into it but Classic just lit the fire big time. I can see myself dropping retail once I finally hit 120 and get geared for the 15th anniversary raid. Once I get that mount I’m done with retail until next expac.
---
Understandable, but I'm talking about characters that have never been played.
---
So I should be safe from all drama tanking as a Tauren Shaman.
---
That’s why I’m rolling warlock. All the tanks will love me.
---
Ah good point, I remember times like that before.
---
I will just go for it
---
Oh yeah allow a withdrawal, wouldn't go as far as having to mount up at stables, though that would be very RP, I was thinking it's just a little more RP than carrying 4 kodos, a bunch of skeletons etc in your pack, or even putting them in a bank slot, and better than the mount tab (although mount tab better than just backpacking them)
---
thanks for reply. basicaly though ur saying to fuck me right? seriously i tihnk is so bullshit because i know rouges are strongest using sword spec.
---
He hurt your fifis? show us on this gender neutral doll where they gang raped you
---
Those who play PvE are not as “aggressive”. I will be playing on remulos.
---
True
---
Why should I not play mage? It's the best class all around and high loot competition means raiding even MC will stay fun for a long time.
---
Its easier to farm soul shards for raiding in AB than on open world.
---
....or better? - invader zim
---
Oh yes, the literal joke of a person that is vegan gains and his worthless life goals. The perfect embodiment of druids. Good job OP
---
Resilience was a good way to balance itemization and not forcing PvE players to play PvP too much.
---
Allthough later on in the expansions all dps roles in high end PvP teams had to get off-set dps items for extra set bonuses and high dps increases. Playing in world top 5v5 teams at the time I myself enjoyed that kind of itemization very much. I played ele sham and marks Hunter.
---
Hopefully 50+
---
I'm gonna rush. Plan to be in my mid 50's by Saturday
---
Haha I guess you have to do something with your sub time after character reservations
---
I forgot about the selfie thing

---
lol this post is petulant as fuck 'retail was so bad guys'
---
Oh lord, two scorpid stings on a shaman who's healing.
---
I know the faction balance is a big issue but I still don't like the idea of cross server battlegrounds. I met most of my long time wow buddies in battlegrounds.
---
Incentives to balance factions would be better if you ask me. Free faction change, xp boost to underrepresented faction, free server transfer where it makes sense. Stuff like that.
---
I now this most likely wouldn't fix RP servers but it'd keep the server community intact and I think that's more important.
---
The best is not being able to learn till level 10...
---
You mean the actual WoW retail launch in Nov 2004 of not being able to play for a week? They credited us some sub time.
---
Or the actual BC release where you zoned into Hellfire and then couldn't get past the loading screen for 2-3 days.
---
I honestly don't know how you can be a priest and not be a night elf on a PvP server.
---
"omg you are never going to get raid invites as a night elf priest!"
---
well omg you are never going to mind control people into lava while naked outside of black rock depths if you don't have shadowmeld.
---
well, per account probably. I don't think my 3 registered names on the server means I count as 3.
---
Wait, these sell? I have them on like 3 characters
---
I'm going to play on a rp pvp server so there isn't even a point in reserving a name
---
Sounds perfect. Ty ;)
---
Good luck boi!
---
Classic Codex does, questie doesn't currently. I'm not sure if it will be added, if there's enough demand sure. There's also EZQuest and leatrix and a few other auto accept addons. I wanted to stay away from automatic actions
---
This is why I don't really understand the people talking about rushing to 60 the first week.
---
Have their minds been twisted by the Retail Old Gods?
---
Situational! Orc is better in terms of damage and hardiness is nice. However, against Spriest and Locks Undead is really great, also the cannibalize spell is great while questing!   
---
So, for min max = Orc  
---
For looking cool, and sneaky like = Undead
---
According to everything I’ve read Orc is best for PvE because of the Blood Fury racial. Hardiness is also not to be underestimated.
---
In Classic (Vanilla) WoW, poisons don't scale with gear. Some people don't use them at all in raids.
---
Horde rogues have windfury totem and if you can afford it, Shadow Oil. Shadow Oil scales with debuffs and spell power on the target. You pretty much only use Shadow Oil with a Supreme Power flask because there is not a melee flask in Classic. 
---
All of the above is pretty expensive and not sustainable or even needed really. Poisions are probably what most will use for a a while.
---
2019 phase 2
---
2020 phase 3
---
No one said that?
---
If you think people used to be faithful to partners back in the day, oh boy, don't take any DNA tests.  Infidelity everywhere.
---
To my knowledge they would both be equally useless.
---
Okay but will hardiness become usefull in raids?
---
I think it's easier to merge layers rather than servers... Imagine you are having server with 20k players across 4 layers, that's 5k players per layer and 2.5k per faction (ideally). Since you'll be in the same layer and won't be switching (unless you want to) you'll be essentially playing with same people. As the population will decrease over time, blizz will lower the layer count to keep the world alive. I think that's their plan of the layers removal, which in my opinion is also their biggest risk as I think they are really expecting the population of servers to go down dramatically. If they are to remove layers completely... Servers with 5 layers will have to have 5 times less players... With this there is also a risk of one server still being full - hence layering still on, and another server might be half empty= layering off.
---
The real deal I see here is the problem with economy and overall professions market situation. Don't expect vanilla experience here... You no longer be that one enchanter who is currently online but there will be many... The sense of responsibility for your actions might also be different since there are multiple layers and a huge player base...
---
My advice is to wait until release before making any conclusions. Let's hope blizzard has this all under control.
---
Orc is literally overpowered in pvp and orc is objectively better for pve. Not sure what the hang up is.
---
Thrash Blade + Mirahs Song = 422 DPS
---
Krol + Mirahs Song = 434 DPS
---
Guess someone was right when saying Krol &gt; thresh blade. my apologies
---
**Paprikás !!!!**
---
It's not relevant if all you're interested in is raiding pve. In terms of PvP it comes down to orc stun resist vs will of the forsaken, if you're running rogue I'd go undead
---
I always thought the population was based on online players
---
Won‘t happen to this visual extend. Blizzard fucked up the corpse generation which only shows your latest set of bones.
---
Usually you would see something like this in STVietnam around Nesingwarys camp
---
For raids it's the undead racial, for pvp both are quite good. Hardiness is my favourite cuz that 25% stun resits gets ally rogues sooo titled haha :D
---
Remember the feeling of getting 6 slots when you're level 5-10? Your first green drop?
---
Damn my hype is already skyrocketed in the past few days. I need to chill, it's still more than 10 days..
---
been looking for mankrik's wife for too long now.
---
H: Orc or Undead
---
A: Gnome or Dwarf
---
I know a good bunch of people who are coming back for Classic and none of them are currently subbed.
---
Yeah I was still working with a 60hz 24 inch full hd screen from way back so I kind of thought I deserved it after so many years! This will improve the gaming experience even more!
---
It was irrational how much this bothered me.
---
It depends in how hardcore you want to be. I'm going to be more semi-casual, and I'm wanting more relaxed experience overall, so I'm rolling Thalnos over Herod. I have a bad feeling that Herod is gonna turn awfully toxic. I hope I'm wrong, however.
---
I was wondering how people would deal with that. 
---
Putting the modifier keys on the mouse sounds like it would handle the issue well.

"Someone gold this, I don't have $4."
---
Was a real challenge to level considering you had kill teams roaming the area lol, I didn't mind so much I had a Shadow Priest but leveled east of Lake Nazferiti north of Crystalvein mine and traveled along the mountain ridge so they would hear my spells but I would be behind a wall most of the time and unless it was a hunter I could submerge in the river. Basically the tricks I learned to gank people with my hunter kept my from suffering humiliating deaths in STV, I think I took more beatings in Hillsbrad Foothills.
---
Classic isn't about rushing 60 and raid logging. Some players might not want that, and that's fine -- we don't really want them.
---
First days every server has fully.  
---
The PvP servers has most alived a long term. 
---
Somebody says think is a true-vanilla feels go to play PvP servers. But be careful. The old MMOs PvP system has very dangerous for beginner.   
---
\- You have choose one factions, and dont playing the another factions species. So choose whisely you and your friends  
---
\- A lot of high level scumbag travelling for beginner places and hunting the low level characters. Its making a massacre. If a community has good, some allied palyer has hunted this scumbags.   
---
\- Later than starting the Honor System. Honor System still more motivacional leveling up your characters honor. Exclusive armors, weapons, rare items etc.   
---
If you have make fun and later do you try the another factions: choose PvE servers. (RP servers still good, but really seriously roleplaying members)
---
there will be independent parties giving us a rough calculation of realm balance after launch though it may take them to phase 2 to get a better picture depending on how layering effects that data sample. But i imagine even at 60/40 things will be relatively fair. There a big difference between total pop imbalance/active players/players actively out in the world pvping. We have cross realm Bg's when they release so imbalance on a single server isn't like to have a major impact there.
---
Well, it bascially looks like you divided all numbers by 100, because you added % to a raw number
---
0.002 is 0.2%, which would mean 1 person per 500 players, which seems about right for me.
---
If we extend that to BR6, we'd have 1.37%, which is pretty much exactly half the percentage you then mention in the text area. So, no idea whether 1.37% or 2.74% is the correct value here.
---
I spent 30+ hours planning with half being horde specific stuff, since we had made the final decision to go horde.... and my friend group switches to alliance... sigh
---
Where is your source for player numbers? Sounds like bullshit tbh.
---
You wouldn't like Factorio or Satisfactory.
---
There's some dungeon/blues that are decent, you need to know what to look for in itemization for PVP with the small budget blues will have.  Things like, arcanite reaper (58 blue, 3.8 speed with AP and big stam), HoJ from BRD, various plate blues - try avoiding going glass cannon with leather crit gear, and avoid plate with no stamina.  When the honor system launches, and later BGs, it will be a lot easier to gear up a warrior without relying on BIS raid loots.  honor gear + BG rep gear is pretty decent to get going, and ZG/Aq20 there are decent pieces as well.
---
Slyv wasn’t even human, I guess at the time it might have been a bit too much to develop several loderan races into forsaken character skins but it would have been a nice touch. Human, High Elves and Dwarves at least - the main ones from WCIII
---
Ask if Spanish EU servers will be made.
---
Ion would be better of selling expensive vacuum cleaners to eldery people. Why waste such a talent in game making company.
---
that belongs on my mage
---
Uses perfect grammar and punctuation in the relationship advice subreddit ---&gt; comes to ClassicWoW to shitpost :D gotta love it
---
The fact you dont know the names of the weapons tells me you don deserve them and will 100% never get either
---
Oh really? Man thats sad... i was looking forward to this visual sight again :(
---
I truly think the game shat the bed at the ToC patch. Ulduar was the last good thing they did and it was amazing.
---
I feel you.  Nothing better than getting grey shoulders in you teen levels as well.  Cant wait for launch, low key have had the logon screen on my off monitor with audio for ambience whilst I've been working.  So hyped!
---
I've been wanting to re-play Diablo 2 for quite a while now but I'm on the fence about it incase blizzard decide to do a Diablo 2 remake aswell.
---
Winter for Phase 2
---
Spring for Phase 3
---
3 servers overall max and thats pushing it
---
I'm assuming you mean the enemy's cast bar?  You originally had to watch the animations to determine when another player/creature was casting.  I think it adds a sliver of difficulty to a simpler game.
---
People dont like that anymore - they want the "classic but not so classic its not a big deal just QoL" experience
---
you are the man! Thank you kind druid
---
Yeah, I can only play after work and at the weekends. I put APES into the Pic cuz this kind of comments was pretty common around here.
---
Westfall is left burning by the time you finish all the quests, and never gets resolved. You even lose the inn and mailbox permanently.
---
Gilneas ends very abruptly and the worgen are shipped off to Darkshore, unlike the goblins who have a full second zone in Azshara. You actually have to play Horde and do Silverpine Forest to see the worgen story continue.
---
You, as a person, are talentless and worthless.
---
For phase 2 do you think it'll be like November/December time?
---
Does codex also have an extended/customizable quest list so I do not have to grab another addon to do this?
---
I've done this with bbq sauce.   It was worth it.
---
no chance
---
oceanic servers for me- pop will be fine, its ok
---
That's a vague statement. I don't know what you're referring to. Only three more added from now? From the original 5?
---
If anyone confirms this works, i will update the instructions and make a new post thats slightly more detailed

I'm going there mostly for the "UPDATES" I like seeing the drama unfold.

With how conservative Blizzard has been in adding servers, I think the odds of them dying are very low.

My old guild I formed was revolving around one rule 
---
You pay for the game, you play as you will.  
---
We only limited  on healers / tank / dps 
---
What type of dps was your choice.  I would gladly roll with 4 ret paladins if that’s what we got.  But we made clear that we was not aiming for progression.  But for having fun and challenging content.  You can easily beat both ZG and MC with that mentality.  
---
And we only had to have one rule.  
---
You come to runs prepared on time 10min late and we replace you. (Repaired, bandage, mana/heal pots, ammo, regents).  
---
We only had to tell one person during several years it was not ok.  (Coming to raid as a hunter without arrows........ with half broken gear).

I cant choose between elemental shaman or balance druid for raiding, I like both classes and specs. But now the only question I have left for myself is wich of these is the most usefull to a raid group.  
---
Shamans got their totems, spell interrupts and heals and Druids have Gift of the Wild, Thorns, Innervate, Battle ress and also heals (I might be still missing something...). So please let me know why either of these would be better or be equally usefull.
---
&gt;Screech has a much higher damage per focus than Claw
---
I think it's the opposite:
---
(54+76) / 2 = 65 avg. dmg. for Claw 9
---
(33+61) / 2 = 47 avg. dmg. for Screech 5
---
65/25 = 2.6 damage per focus for Claw 9
---
47/20 = 2.35 damage per focus for Screech 5
---
Screech is great for multitarget because of the aoe aggro, for single target dmg claw is stil better, and on a cat with the 10% dmg bonus is even better (still, for single target at least).

It was a bug. Unless Blizzard hold a special event in which they purposefully "unfix" that bug temporarily you're not gonna have this happen.
---
If he doesn't get them within 15 minutes we can legally kick the crap out of him
---
I would recommend mage, now I just gotta get a girlfriend...
---
Pls no. :l
---
Still flashier than classic, which so many beloeve is the only kind of difficulty. 'omg the game is so mich better nowadays because rotations and boss mechanics are so much more complicated than Frostbolt spamming'.
---
Why is she so quiet? It’s like she’s the show and Ion’s the commercial.
---
Make everything fast not easy lol addons are not bits
---
Quest accepted.
---
Yeah, totally the same here, nobody I know subscribed two weeks earlier to do that. But that's a nice move from Blizz to get a rough idea of the success Classic will have at 'launch'.
---
I am sorry but are You guys for real? I mean i like to play games ALOT and get into them but it all seems a bit excessive? I dont want to insult anyone or anything but it just seems like a bit much :P
---
Hi, I'm here for my free month of Classic
---
My go-to is minced meat beef/steak (not sure what you call it in english tbh).
---
500g of mince meat(any kind)
---
1 normal sized onion(minced/grated)
---
1 egg
---
1 bouillon cube (melted in water)
---
Spices of your choices. Pretty much anything works, paprika powder, taco spice, herbs you like.
---
Salt and pepper
---
Mix it all together, add som breadcrumbs if you want and fry them on medium high heat, 1-2 minuters on each side is enough. Let them rest for abit before eating though, does wonders for all kinds of meat!
---
Take whats left in the pan and put it through a fine mesh strainer. Add cream (3dl is enough for 500g of meat) bouillon cube/broth/stock the spices you used for the meat and add some thickener (wheat flour or maizena) optional to chop up some onions in big chunks and fry them up abit before adding cream.
---
Serve with potatoes, french fries or what ever you like. Rice and pasta works aswell. 
---
Its tasty both hot and cold, perfect to snack on when you just want something to chew on and makes for a tasty meal that can be prepaired days in advance. 
---
Sorry for any spelling mistakes, my phone auto-corrects ALOT.
---
medium
---
Here's an easy problem I just found, seems like something you should have accounted for:
---
https://i.imgur.com/aBPpqpM.png
---
Both ignore messages (myself and laurellen) are from only one message in chat each.
---
You ignore someone what seems to be once for every word they put in chat. That's just an assumption.
---
You're overthinking this. Any of those servers will be fine and it is very unlikely that any one of them will end up 'barren'. 
---
The whole regional coalition stuff isn't a big deal either. If you end up with a bunch of english speaking Scandinavians on your server, you'll be perfectly fine. They're usually good players.
---
Guilds do have an influence on server community and all that but you can never know if there won't be an even worse guild forming on the other server.
---
Don't panic. Pick a server and have fun.
---
I always wanted to see Azshara Crater. Classic seems like the perfect time to release it.

Here is a poll (760 votes) that shows where Shazzrah players are from. Maybe that helps:

---
You can press M to Open a map
---
I must admit I'm gonna miss those character models quite a bit.
---
You could also used TeamSpeak. I was using it with my friends back in vanilla
---
probably be high by the end of the week
---
;3
---
Gemall is right. Because Classic is such a time sink, the most important thing is to play the one you like most because you can't re-roll or race change without a considerable effort.  
---
That being said - I think Orc is superior for both PVP and PVE. War Stomp is situational at best, but Tauren could be better if you want to Meme spec shammy tank.
---
I swear thats not all of them, I can't find Bloodscalp on that list
---
Thank you, the only addons I'll need.
---
"Shit, I got called out - I mean, I was only pretending!"
---
This timeline is still reMikeable.
---
&gt;For me personally, I realized that I hate what wow had become. BFA has been so mediocre and I feel no attachment to my characters anymore. Hell, I dont even recognize some of them with the new character models. It was time to retire them. As much as it hurts.
---
I feel the exact same.. it was really weird when it hit me that I no longer recognized or cared for some of these characters that used to mean so much to me. Corny as it sounds it really felt like meeting that old best friend from school that you barely recognize these days lol
---
And here I was, even though Classic wouldn’t have them show this way, wanting my female trolls to be have hunching options. :&lt;
---
It really comes down to how stupid orcs look in stealth.
---
I'll be on Herod! Initially I wanted Whitemane but I'm big on PVP and hear that's where the action is gonna be :3
---
That's weird, it should happen only once, I will take a look thanks.
---
I'm in germany as well and I have 400 Mbps for 40€. Depends on where exactly you are.
---
this is beautiful
---
Thanks so much!
---
Whether if it's APES or someone else, there are always hardcore players. There's no point trying to avoid hardcore guilds.
---
Retail Druid is nothing like vanilla. Vanilla mage was quite fantastic due to spell ranks and the power of cc and aoe: Play what you want but the Druid you’re not playing now is not how it will be for classic.
---
Yeah, Night Elf is where it's at. You haven't lived until you've spent hours in shadowmeld at the Felwood post flight path, repeatedly throwing Horde down the cliff, to dash their bodies against the rocks below in Darkshore.
---
Well, it's definitely a question that ought be raised. I have questioned me playing WoW Classic, and even after the brief time I played on the stress test I learned that this game definitely is something I can see myself dedicating hours upon hours into.
---
That said, I often have hours upon hours to dump. Aside from a 40 hour work week, I typically have a good chunk of free time. If I can spend 5 hours working on a character in WoW versus spending 5 hours watching WatchMojo videos about things I really don't care about but watch anyway, I would rather play WoW.
---
It's all about moderation. Know your limits, remember that there is life outside of Azeroth, and you'll be fine.
---
Yea ofc, realistically we have around 1 week left till launch. Keep in mind most players are gonna quit before they even hit 60. Most servers especially faerlina and herod will probably lose 25% to 50% of their population.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
I want wanted to know if his info was made up, it was in fact fabricated. Not rude at all lol. It turns out he lied.
---
ty! &lt;3
---
So you do it, then. I do non-chibi work as well, but people like to get these for avatars and whatnot. Not sure why you felt the need to be an asshole rather than keeping on scrolling but whatever makes you feel better, guy.
---
ever since cross realm battlegrounds (which classic will have, the game has historically highly encouraged rolling higher population and higher faction population. Servers everywhere, if they had a faction imbalance, it would grow and grow. - It wasn't until war mode's call to arms bonuses, like against overwhelming odds, that there was actual incentive to play the lower population.
---
Distance wise, US West Coast should provide you with better ping. Also, there are oceanic servers. Best do, what cloudberry said, create chars on retail oceanic and USW and see what works better for you.
---
Oh I completely forgot about Nightfall!
---
People that think playing without addons is some kind of achievement also the lore is 15 years old ..
---
Yeah, and you can increase wand speed through agility
---
Should've done the actual moonkin dance.
---
This video is the definition of how not to play classic. I completely understand enemy cast bars and QoL addons but a literal "go here and kill this exact mob" map addon defeats the entire purpose of the **WORLD**. Do you want to play classic or retail? I really hope blizzard disables any kind of map addon or boss mod that dulls the game. /rant
---
Yeah the submissions are part of the trolling. They come up with crazy scenarios that get people all upset and then watch the fireworks. Don't ask me why there are people who enjoy shit like this, I've never been able to fathom the mind of a troll.
---
I think my brain may need some bleach after that :C
---
Do not judge me for knowing it. Asmongold has a beta ZF video. It's called attempts the stairs event or something like that. It doesnt include all bosses tho iirc.
---
Holy shit you’re dense.
---
Not if you've got a dumpster ton of fury warriors all wanting the same swords that rogues want.
---
Hey Totemized,
---
I searched on Youtube for you. 
---
Here is a complete run of ZF on Classic beta including grave opening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D9WTEIB-VU
---
Enjoy
---
A good mage that knows to clear totems and time their counterspell against a shaman will win. Enhancement shamans will have a tough time choosing between earth or frost shock on the mage as you need one to interrupt or the other to chase.
---
Elementals might have an easier time. But really it comes down to how good the mage is really. Druids have a better match off vs mages.
---
Shit this brought me back. I remember once I was playing starcraft while talking on the home phone with a friend of mine and got called out of the room by my mom. I came back and kept playing starcraft and did 2 matches before remembering I was on the phone with my friend. He was still sitting there waiting on me. He was playing a different game but I still felt terrible. Good times.
---
But where is Mankrik’s wife?
---
Really nice!
---
Happy to help. Unsure when the beta ends, they havent given a time AFAIK.
---
I personally use 123456tasdfgzxcv as well as ctrl and shift modifiers for all of these keys, as well as using mouse 4 and mouse 5 with mouse wheel up and down.
---
I also put all of my buffs onto my F keys seems to work pretty well for me.
---
That's some sick damage, even though I had affliction in mind when I wrote lacks burst damage.
---
I'm slowly moving my mind to warlock considering everyone's replies actually. Thank you :)
---
As a tank you will have an easy time to get 5-man/UBRS groups real easy.
---
Guildspot as a tank (maintank) might be difficult.
---
Sure it does, ofc. Do you actually up/download at this rate or is it the advertised maximum? According to those numbers I should have a download rate of 250 aswell.
---
shazzrah is basicly twitch chat, memes and shitposting.
---
Golemagg seems nice but is full will have queue times on launch,
---
gehennas is medium right now and also seems nice. Butt will prob have also queue times.
---
You mean start
---
What are the best classes for boosting lower level friends through dungeons? Up to sm/ Uldaman.
---
Im currently thinking Mage or Hunter.
---
There is a humor tag on the OP :\^)
---
Thats what the sub will become though. 
---
Why would i spend time on this sub reddit if i could also just play the game. I bet most people are only here to scritch their wow classic itch and when classic releases there is no reason for most of the people that actually bring some kind of worthwhile discussion to show up anymore. 
---
They will probably use their realm specific sub/discord/forum.
---
EU eng:
---
2 full 2 high 3 med
---
both german servers are full
---
Take it back then.  Your not entitled.  Just a douche
---
Warlock no doubt
---
Ally have a bigger demand 
---
It can do all with smRuin spec
---
It has much group utility
---
It can solo dungeons easier
---
I think theres been a struggle at blizzard following what happened to diablo 3 and world of warcraft. Blizzard tried appealing to a wider audience by stripping their games of what made them unique and challenging. Classic is probably going to have a ripple effect on future wow expansions and titles like Diablo 4.
---
oh god this place is turning into main wow
---
Well sure they are going to do that. But what if there still a FUCKTON of ppl left on this server that are not taking the option to migrate to another server? Will they still say w/e lets remove layering and let the 30k ppl all play one shard?
---
I haven't played WoW for about 6 years, I just started to slowly quest through the areas as undead priest (I'm only lvl 8, im not rushing) but this is exactly what i'm afraid of.. I will land in a new zone and barely get to know it before leveling up enough to be sent to next one. :( Maybe I should just stubbornly do quests until I get tired of a zone, even if my level is already high enough for a while to move on. Retail already felt disconnected and disjointed years ago, it must be even worse now..
---
Thats perfect, they will release another server or two in a few days and all the retail people are on their own server.
---

---
What Quest Helper did, and the only thing I want out of these addons, is helping me find the quest objective. I'm going to be in a somewhat unofficial race with my friends. That is they play their usual pace, but somehow they always outlevel me, sometimes by a factor of 2. I read quest text and NPC speech bubbles, I click on every NPC and check what's behind this or that building. I'll take a detour to the left to explore and check what's in the Kharanos tavern's cellar, but what I can't stand is losing half an hour trying to find Marla's grave so I can bury her husband's skull there (PSA: it's in the little graveyard to the RIGHT of the chapel, not the big graveyard you spawn in).
---
 This is really awesome! Check the artist and painting at:

---
The problem also was back then the servers still had a lot lower max population compared to what servers can handle today. 
---
If we were able to go back in time with today's hardware and lower the amount of servers but make each one able to have more people, you would be less likely to run into those problems.
---
For example, todays servers are probably atleast 5x (data from the beta suggests its a lot more than this) bigger than the servers back then. If you take 5 servers and put them into 1, you should reduce the chances of running into that problem by 80%.
---
I played on an RP server in vanilla and we got queued in with pvp servers all the same. It wasnt an issue back then.
---
"Five minutes is all I need, UGH, oh come back baby, I got Blessing of Protection!"
---
what retarded streamer went on Shazzrah 🤦‍♂️
---
I tested out an addon tonight also, new Coordinates addon from Tomcat.  He was in the same beta guild.  Quality addon by the way, perfectly what I want from coordinates.
---
I never thought dps could carry a group until I played druid.
---
"What class to play?"
---
"Alliance or Horde?"
---
"How do I install Classic?"
---
"OMG IM SO HYPED OMG OMG OMG IM 12 AND I CANNOT EVEN"
---
Looks like the people who can't detect a meme will be avoiding Stalagg too.
---
Works for me /shrug
---
Enjoy being a healer.
---
Shazzrah and Golemagg are currently registered as ‘Full’. Gehenas was released after the others so it’s not yet Full but it probably will be come launch.
---
In other words, don’t think it matters all that much as unless more servers are released or Blizz have something up their sleeve there are going to be significant queues on launch day and the following days, maybe even weeks.
---
Ret is a healing spec.
---
WC3R will release at a time when the classic hype will be winding down, it might bring in some new blood when the game needs it the most. The launch will be amazing and full of people regardless.
---
Very interesting, but I think you need to include the quite popular pricate servers that existed prior to Nostalrius, even if it was the catalyst for Classic.
---
I am so ready for classic launch! I started WoW in mid-late BC and am so excited to experience classic
---
I would at level 5 spam general chat for the lesser magic wand. Same as 13 for greater. Will improve levelling speed dramatically. Perhaps even run to org at 1s and grab skinning for the extra gold.
---
Trust me, people will transfer. It's either that or they face a long ass queue. 
---
Why do you think players/guilds accepted the free transfers in 2005? Because they wanted to avoid queues.
---
Unless its a private server
---
Nobody moderates that so it turns into 8chan
---
&gt; The most recent pserver only did well at launch because it had insane dynamic respawns where mobs were literally respawning ~3 seconds after they died, and you could just stand in 1 spot and keep killing the same mob spawn over and over and over.
---
I take it you didn't play the stress test? Because that is exactly how Blizzard servers were. I killed the same scorpion 100+ times in a row, it would respawn after 3 seconds on the same spot. That behaviour will be there, but then by the time you move out into level 5-10, its greatly reduced, and after 10 it's gone (barrens).
---
I hear that when you say Asmongold in the Mirror 3 times. It replies " do you want fries with that" and the next dat you wake up bald as a cue ball
---
More players don't ruin the ah just because there are more materials on the ah... the amount of players balance that out.
---
As far as layering being removed... only concern is for high population not causing 8 hour queues when the do remove it.
---
do we have a similar image for EU servers?
---
To answer your questions - Low influence/low chance 
---
These people are probably 1% of the population of each of these servers. It’s not worth worrying about because there are so many bullshit threads and things will change continually in the coming weeks. 
---
All the servers will be impacted in some way by large guilds. This isn’t classic. It’s much easier to get organised and the skill level is much higher.
---
Realizing you spend 15dollar/12euro per month to be worthless in a world where you actually have the choice not to be.
---
Anyone knows what is the server pop. cap? Even if you roll ob low or medium should be a couple thousand players on there i like that better then 20k people on the same server. Good luck loging in and getting anything done for the first month. Im even considering starting late to avoid the rush.
---
Classes were still being balanced during Classic. I don't see why that balancing cannot continue after phase 5.
---
Just small things that makes the truly terrible specs more viable.
---
Nice.
---
hoomies gay orks strong
---
If it's like the last time they said friday: monday 18:00.
---
probably hunter to be honest. they can solo deadmines by level 32ish
---
I answered to similar comment yesterday: it's obvious that if 'wow' became 10x more popular in late 2004, it's 95% because of vanilla. There wasn't a craze about the word 'wow' back then and the fact that  trend show large ressemblance to subscription count is no coincidence.
---
But then just look at "world of warcraft" if you don't believe it: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=classic%20wow,wow%20bfa,battle%20for%20azeroth,world%20of%20warcraft
---
Lol druid are he best tanks lamo
---
Truthful as in i wrote „supposed numbers“ implicating i have no source otherwise i would have said confirmed or smth like that? Anyway im assuming you are a troll by now.
---
Thought so first but after reading a bit it makes sense to start the timeline there.
---
Its exactly there where everything started to go down. Classic, TBC and WOTLK were all great but after that imo everything got worse.
---
Better off having an Warrior spam Hamstring with NF.
---
Am I a idiot or was this a good decision? 
---
I fell in love with a girl, we slept a view times together.. But after all the greatness here and there was something stuck in my brain all the time when i saw her: damn in a view months there is the classic release and i wont have time for her. 
---
After that i had to break up this relation with her that im full rdy for classic launch. 
---
So classic kinda got me even its not out yet.
---
Easy fix. 3s animation of a tauren doing stretches then 100% speed from the offset
---
i hop Blizz adds another pvp server to EU
---
Same here.
---
adding onto this mage is super solid because you will be frost/arcane for pretty much the first 2 tiers then fire/arcane for the final tier.
---
What are layers?  Is it like channels that asian MMOs have?
---
there are no big enough streamers in EU to care about
---
!remindme 13 days
---
Step 1: Don’t be poor.
---
Unrealistic bag levels detected.
---
The point is to get a notification. Saving isn't going to remind you that you wanted to add this 2 weeks later. Those who resort to insults the fastest are usually the one's lacking in intelligence.
---
Pretty funny that BFA didn’t even get a mention
---
Wait, so we have 183k members right now, and assuming all are of english language we have 24 servers in total. This means we have a server population of 7.625 people per server on average if we **only** count reddit users.
---
A healthy server withouth sharding should have around 2.5 to 3k people on it, so around 60 - 70 % of the players would have to drop the game to have the normal server population, and this is still only counting reddit users. And I really believe that the reddit community only makes a small fraction of the people actually playing the game. 
---
I dont see how these servers will manage to not be absolutely overpopulated once layering is gone...
---
The levels scale so you aren't forced to go anywhere. You can complete whatever zone you'd like to quest in.
---
Most likely this period is test for how many servers they should start with.
---
Thanks for the laugh :D
---
Definitely looking forward to meeting new people!! Really sucks to not be able to have people to talk to about WoW.
---
Wrong on both accounts.
---
So lets say there are 15 layers, u join layer 15 on Monday, on tuesday there are only 13 layers, so u join layer 13.. not the same ppl. the third day there are 14 layers, u join layer 14, again, new peaple...
---
Not really. I would have to have a life to be scared about that.
---
Mostly raids, but a little pvp too
---
The concept was interesting, but IMO no it was a terrible direction to go in and it ruined the fundamental connection between PvE and PvP in the game.  
---
Though by the end of TBC, PvP was garbage anyway so idk.
---
Yes you can because when they first put them in you could opt to have them turned on or not.  If you turned them on, everyone looked like they were on the new model, if you turned them off then everyone looked like they were on the old model. 
---
I don't remember there being any particular issue in animations when looking at someone who had them turned on when you yourself had them turned off.
---
&gt; I honestly think I invented micro transactions
---
Haha, what?
---
Fine I’m rolling troll 😂
---
Subjective
---
I don't think so, I used it during the stress test and didn't see anything accept markers where to pick up quests or to complete objectives
---
Since you didn't say they were made up I just wanted to confirm that. You weren't supposed to take offense to a simple question!
---
Dude go druid you can main tank! Check out skarntank he main tanks naxx as bear! :D
---
Idk, Herod had its own queue just for name creation while other servers didn't.
---
If you roll on Herod I think it's fair to expect a queue to play for the first few weeks.
---
True, I'm just saying that it'll be less bad than people know from private servers mainly because on private servers you always wanted to gank as many people as possible to get rank 3 so you got an extra 10g off your mount by level 40.  This incentive, at least, wont exist on classic at launch.
---
why wouod anyome its a fucking scam
---
i got scammed out of 1 month sub to try and get i to the beta
---
once burnt twice shy
---
ill sub the day before but smart people would be subbing the day after launch when the starting areas are playable
---
This is definitely a thing but I’m not quite sure how it works because it’s not specific to the entire account. Example being I just resubbed for classic and checked my retail account. I basically haven’t played since pandaria. My shaman, druid, priest, and level 35 monk have kept their names. My hunter and paladin has their names released. The shaman was max level for panda, the Druid was level 83 and hasn’t been touched since cata, the priest is level 65 and hasn’t been touched really since wotlk. The hunter and paladin are level 80 and haven’t been touched since wotlk. I’m unsure why some names where released and others weren’t. 
---
Maybe the name gets released if someone try’s to use it?
---
I’d go Gehenas. Its gonna be full as well anyway but not overcrowded like the other 2
---
Im one of those who waits til release then sub. Not worth to waste sub time to reserve a name imho, feels silly. To each their own.
---
Yeah if they prolong classic and release content they never got to, I'd be all for introducing dual-spec and flying. And this is coming from a druid who routinely paid a fortune to bounce between feral and resto because I loved both. But it wasn't in classic so that was part of the struggle. It added to the game in some ways, you kind of had to be committed to your role. Not everyone could do everything like they can now, and that was part of the allure. No perfect answers probably.
---
I tried that for fun in early BC and at lower levels it was still possible even then. If you want to tank for me as a shaman, I'll team up with you. If only to see for myself how well it works. 
---
Who cares if we take a little longer, this isn't M+, we're not on a timer. Fuck timers in dungeons, BTW.
---
Look at this vaguely wow related thing that my wife made me.  If it looks like shit that's because I'm a pedophile and she's a child.
---
Hey where is his wife?
---
Hahah, happy you liked it ! :)
---
To be fair, the forsaken undead consists primarly of citizens of lordaeron who were killed by the scourge in wc3. 
---
When sylvanas started raising new soldiers for the forsaken it stopped making sense. By then we should technically have any race as an option.
---
Idk so much about Rouges in that scenario, but I know Frost mages a gimped. 
---
More than a few times polymorph+running away saved my life while farming in Arcane+Frost specc.
---
Strongest 1v1 class when you start getting epic pieces. Cool thing about SL gear, it doesnt even matter if PvE tier items or PvP epics, both are awesome for him.
---
Yeah so make it so u can pick if u want them or not.
---
Personally for example I much prefer the old Taurens.  New taurens are shitty imo.  But I really like the new dwarves.  If the option existed I'd pick and choose which races I wanted on the new models.  If that option didn't exist then I'd just switch to new models when playing a dwarf and back off again when playing a tauren.
---
My point mainly is that it doesn't affect purists if they want to have them turned off, it's purely a clientside change for people who like them.
---
no
---
Your guess is as good as mine, but thats what I would assume. If someone tries to create a character with a name you have (and you have an account that meets the requirements), it just gives them the name and replaces yours with some placeholder.
---
No. You come of as a douche.  I think it. Op thinks it. The 2 other posters so far think it.  
---
You could have simply asked and where the info was from and corrected the missinfo. Instead you insulted and belittled op without cause.  
---
The definition of toxic.
---
Excellent production mate!
---
Should mention that time J Allen Brack told the community that we think we want classic but we dont.
---
Yeah that'd be cool :)
---
Again if they did it but allowed it to be turned off back to the old stuff for purists I don't really see an issue personally. 
---
But I think cuz it's a lot of work we probably wont see it.
---
that was my plan all along.... I mean... Sorry about that..hah..  
---
I'm happy you liked it!
---
yes rank 9 DPM is the same for untalented skills, but then again, can you really take the full DOT DPM into account? but that margain is really small and doesn't make much of a difference. i looked through the fire talents and the only real talent is "Fire Power" with 10% Firedmg that reliably affects DPM. all other talents rely on crit, which you have almost none of.
---
frost talents such as "Frost Channeling" and "Piercing Ice" boost your frostbolt DPM from 1.64 to 2.04 with both talents, which you both pick. and then there's shatter which you somewhat reliably get later on. at least more reliable than critting with you fire spells \^\^
---
and you are probably right on the shatter/master of elements build being most efficient, but i feel like it wont be the fastest, or practical with respeccing and so on.
---
To be fair if you made a warrior or a paladin as your first character you would have nothing to compare it to and so wouldn’t know the difference. I levelled every class to 60 back in vanilla and to be honest there’s not a lot in it, got it down to a fine art and could level any character to 60 in about 3 days /played. There is a ton of nonsense online at the moment, don’t listen to it, make your warrior or paladin and the effort will be worth it in the end.
---
Back in 2005 the servers we're hard capped to I think 2500-3000 players ( something around that range ) wich is why I highly doubt any server had an active playerbase that was as high as it will be now. 
---
I also doubt that when they decide to remove layering entirely they will go back to that hard cap they had in 2005 since the modern infrastructure of the servers can hand that with ease.
---
I mean they let you switch between old models on and off for quite a while when they first came out....  So clearly it's not quite as incompatible as you think.
---
Thats the definition of hardcore.
---
It is going to be a ride, I am also going to play an EU PvP but I don't have a sub yet so server news are also important to me.
---
Isnt the solution the same just to offer server transfers off dead ones?
---
Same dude
---
This subreddit in a nutshell
---
No it just means there's 1 launch day for rich people and another one for the riff raff.
---
Instant poison VI has 20% to do 112-149 dmg (26,1 damage per hit). Elementals resist poisons thought. 
---
Shadow oil cast a Shadowbolt III on a 15% proc. Shadowbolt III is 48-57 dmg. This means 7,875 dph. 
---
If you use non-flask comsumables You can boost dph to almost  17,52 dph. With flask 36,80 dph. 
---
Thanks for reading
---
Its marked full, but you can still make characters to them, np. The thing you will see is long ass queues tho.
---
"WHY RAPTORS STEAL SILVER?!?"
---
Yes, i'm sure these community aspects were a lot stronger back then. But me and my friends personally had such experiences in the beta! I think the style of classic brings that out in people, so I hope you run into such people!
---
Welcome casuals.
---
JK. Really, welcome guys.
---
An important point is that "Humans" are not all under one political structure, one of several races that technically are like that.
---
For the Alliance: almost all NE answer to Darnassus, almost all Gnomes answer to the remnants of the Gnomeregan government, the Dwarves are in three major clans (with the playable clan being Bronzebeard Clan, the other two being Dark Iron and Wildhammer, which are NPC groups), the Humans are divided into a number of major Human nations (with the playable nation being the Kingdom of Stormwind and the others being Gilneas, Stromgarde in Arathi Highlands, Alterac, Kul Tiras, and Lordaeron).
---
For the Horde most Orcish clans have joined Thrall's Horde (but not all, for example the Dragonmaw clan and Blackrock clan), one Troll tribe has joined (Darkspear is the playable tribe, and there are *many* non-playable ones), one Tauren tribe has joined (Bloodhoof is playable, other such as the Grimtotem are not), and the remnants of one Human nation has joined (the Forsaken, comprised mainly of unead Lordaeron Humans).
---
The Humans of Lordaeron were mostly killed and raised as undead. Not all have: the Scarlet Crusade, for example, is comprised of still-living Lordaeron Humans.
---
They're not even the first Human nation to cooperate with the Horde either. The Kingdom of Alterac tried to switch sides earlier in the lore and was destroyed by the other Human nations for it, with the survivors forming into the Syndicate.
---
The Kingdom of Lordaeron *was* part of the original Alliance to battle the Orcish invasion of Azeroth, but then fell apart as the Scourge conquered it and converted the populace. 
---
In Warcraft 3 they weren't part of the Horde, and the Night Elves weren't part of the Alliance. Blizzard made some justifications to push the four factions into two for the sake of the MMO.
---
any screen about all of EU servers?
---
Happy you enjoyed it!
---
Yeah it's actually quite annoying here in the UK too.. 11pm on a monday.  But also that monday is a public holiday....  So launch day is literally a public holiday but the time it launches is so late you don't get to enjoy that free day off playing wow :P
---
You no take candle!
---
None of them, honestly. I'm a melee man for life.
---
But if I had to pick, then probably frost mage.
---
Well, i think that was done before the scandinavian coalition went to Gehennas.
---
I miss the old old Av...
---
Sure, of course there will still be ganking there.  I just think it'll be less than on private servers due to the lack of those 2 incentives.
---
&gt;especially threat meter
---
This can not be stressed enough - it is not retail, tanks can loose aggro (quite easily - especially at start, wait for those sunders!).
---
Also, keep any kind of threat ability OFF from your pets (hunters?)
---
A clear sense of progression speaks to the human nature. Classic has loads of that. 
---
Our minds tells us that this is beneficial and sends out dopamine to motivate you to pursue it.
---
It was amazing, people were just upset, you actually think things through, not just smash some buttons lol.
---
ROFL
---
Didn't they shoehorn layering in to avoid ques? If we still get ques with it then it's a lose-lose and was absolutely pointless to include...
---
Gz
---
&gt;You could have simply asked and where the info was from and corrected the missinfo. Instead you insulted and belittled op without cause.
---
I did the first part perfectly fine. The second part is in your head lol. Never insulted or belittled him. Grow up with these lies lol.
---
If the barrens chat isn't full of Chuck Norris jokes it is not an authentic classic experience.
---
But...but, stream man bad :(
---
Welcome! This is gonna be a dope time of our lives.
---
Chadkin
---
I've got so much work on at the moment that I'm terrified. Balancing a wow addiction with a wife and 75hrs work a week is probably going to literally kill me.
---
You'd be the worst mage ever if you go around smacking the fuck out of pigs with your staff like a barbarian.
---
Just use a wand. More damage and it's ranged.

---
&gt;Level first aid regardless of your class.
---
I would add to this (and the point made above it) that you must learn fishing and cooking as well.
---
I'm not sure about that. Back in 2007 my wife and I were going to explore the Horde part of the game and made a Warrior (me) and Druid (her) combo. She dropped WoW at L25ish.
---
Back in vanilla I was a gnome lock with engineering. I convinced my best friend to play. He chose gnome lock with engineering. I got hyped for classic and got him hyped. I said I was gonna go Tauren Druid with herb/alch. A few days later he says he’s got this great idea to go Tauren Druid with herb/alch. I’m going shaman now. So you’re not the only one to think of avoiding this crap.
---
I'd be all for new content myself but I was watching Kevin Jordan's (Original vanilla dev) stream the other day. He raised a great point that he didn't think anyone working on the WoW classic team currently were game designers. Sure they have very talaneted devs and developers but the Blizzards WoW game designers are responsible for BFA and are currently working on that and later expansions. 
---
I really wouldn't want those guys designing content for WoW classic.
---
I feel like Warlock is going to be Vanillas Rogue. So many people going to play Warlock.
---
I guess so!
---
I don't know the exact numbers I think in simplest terms EverQuest uses once a zone hit I think it's 50 people a second zone will spawn allowing player to pick over to that zone. In WoW they are just automatically doing it again not sure on the exact numbers but once a zone is considered over populated people will start loading into a copy of the zone. 
---
Considering WoW I believe is only 3 zones the 2 continents dungeons and PvP. Not 100% sure if they will just layer the entire world or specific individual zones.
---
But I do agree somewhat with OP I would much rather have all servers with a que more than overloading on servers where a couple are full and the rest medium population. IMHO it will promote toxicity in the lower populated servers knowing they will get a server merge and only having to create a character with the same name on the other servers gets a free name change.
---
Fuck what other people say. It's your life and only yours. If the bachelor lifestyle fits you, more power to you. Never do something just because it fits society.
---
That's why I'm taking 2 weeks off starting on launch day, so I can nolife the fuck out of it at the start, get my fill of it and get most of the grind done before returning to the normal work routine again.
---
That poor bastard mage. Oh my lord.
---
you really live up to your name dont you
---
I still think it's awesome that [the incident was used in actual epidemiological studies](https://allthatsinteresting.com/corrupted-blood).

Hey if they ever do the launch event for bc (If they progress/make new servers) we may see that again, those raids caused some serious corpses.

WoW is literally the best game ever made :P. I wish I've never payed wow so I can play wow for the 1st time again.

Totally worth playing now. Just chose a  class that you strongly relate to and enjoy the leveling experience.

Eh, you use attack speed for interrupts, any damage is just a bonus.

Play or watch the Undead campaign in Frozen Throne.
---
That explains why the Forsaken aren't part of the Alliance, but as for why they join the Horde...  One explanation is as good as the next.
---
Love it
---
yup, that guy is dead wrong, there's been many, many blizzlike classic servers before nost
---
Can anyone point me in the direction of a Classic Raid Healing guide? Preferably one that is (although it doesn’t have to be as I can find the info seperately) based on Shaman healing? Will be rolling Shaman main for Classic for the first time after maining rogue through pretty much all my other wow experience, and have never healed in raids before, although I have done 5 mans on a paladin up through wotlk as a healer. I’ve played a little bit of classic on pservers but have never done the raids before as I didn’t start retail until the end of tbc and I never made it to 60 on pssrvers. Thanks in advance guys!
---
WotLK introduced dungeon finder and tier 9 was lackluster.

Because people post fanart? Why is this a problem?

Mouse scroll down is reserved for Trinket, the fastest Trinket keybind :D

No that's not true at all. The general public are pretty misinformed. Consensus around something that is false is still false. Like me belittling him. It doesn't matter how many upvotes you get, it's still a lie. The only person who was attacked was me and I dont mind. People have anger issues and if taking it out on me makes them feel better they can. I have thick skin :)

I've already downloaded the e-paper, here's a (partial) screenshot of the map:

Grob is west coast right? Op only has east coast servers
---
This video makes me very happy.
---
I'm in that right now. Not because of the Classic wait but because I just finished the Witcher 3 and have nothing to go to next so I'm filling the void with Smite and a tiny bit of Fortnite. They're just not doing it for me.
---
Throw me in for thinking it too.
---
I don't understand why you would want somebody else's name, just use something original instead that fits yourself.
---
Lets get this baby to the top!
---
Sure, I don't disagree (although the afk lua kill bot was kinda amusing), I'm more griping about the double standards of the #nochanges crowd.
---
They are basically fine with any changes that make the game "harder" to cater to their preconceived notion that vanilla was super hard.
---
Probably not the right place for it though...
---
In your opinion, which class has the most fun, engaging, situation dependent DPS rotation? Both PvE and PvP.
---
Which class has the most boring?
---
Nicely done
---
A grade retard for sure.
---
That's great, but the main fear people have is that these massive PvP servers will have populations that are far too large, and they wont be able to remove layering. You can say "free transfers" but that doesn't really mean anything unless you force people to transfer.
---
So is Blizzard saying they're gonna remove layering at a specific date no matter what, and just have people on these servers sit in massive queues until they get annoyed and transfer? If so, then it'd be nice if they just came out and said that. As far as I know they haven't talked about this problem specifically, and it's all just people going "that's what they'll do" with no evidence.
---
Convincing people you don't watch esfands stream

This is awesome :D

Sorry, I just meant linking subreddits, but maybe the same thing applies.

Thanks for the reply though

Male Orcs look fucking terrible as rogues. Makes no sense that they can even be rogues. Every time I see one walking around it stealth it makes me sick. Their racial are OP af tho :/
---
# FOOL, GROBBULUS IS EVERYWHERE
---
Shazzrah seems like the best choice imo!
---
It's because people have literally nothing better to do right now while waiting for launch.
---
What was it like leveling as ele? I want to level as an ele/resto shaman.
---
None of the people I played with liked the zone revamps. I'm not one to whine much though so I didn't, after Cata I just started leveling exclusively through LFG.
---
Ahh ok, thanks, I appreciate the insight.
---
"Relative realm population will be visible in-game to help in choosing a realm so you will see Low, Medium, or High in the realm selection screen. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during name reservation and character creation, we will post warnings about the potential for queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms."
---
Blizzard also posted...
---
As of now, a large number of WoW Classic characters have been created on the following realms. Players with characters on this realm are likely to experience severe queues at release.
---
Faerlina - PvP
---
Herod - PvP
---
Whitemane - PvP
---
Does that factor in  shadow weaving and improved shadow bolt debuffs?

---
I think you shouldn’t package those things together. Aoe looting is a huge qol feature that I think would impact the game a whole lot more than dismounting automatically. There already is an addon atleast for the 1.12.1 client that does the dismounting for you but there is no way to create an addon that autoloots everything in your vicinity.
---
For example, there is a challenging quest to complete Stratholme within 45 minutes and that's a push too far for most pug groups.

That's still month of gameplay for the average joe that has a job and just wanna chill with some firends twice a week. I'm fine with that.
---
I didnt know there was an EU ED. NA ED is the best server Ive ever been on
---
You might notice that sometimes the exp you get from quests isnt enough alone and have to farm some mobs before moving to the next zone.
---
Getting decent gear.
---
With good gear you're a nightmare for melees in pvp
---
Thanks for the reply. 4 of us have hunter in our top 2. Already have 3 of the group loco in warrior, rogue and hunter. my mate and I(the 2 undecided) want shaman and hunter . So if one of us don't change we will have either 2 hunters or shaman.
---
How boring is warlock in dungeons and raids? I know they are fun in PvP and leveling
---
yup, he's got so much wrong
---
This is harder to accomplish than the whirlwind quest dude. You can solo it at 33/34 with a couple of  nature ress pots and retaliation if you can manage to dodge his casts as well.
---
Understood and it does. I will edit my original reply. Sorry for any confusion.
---
I liked the meme. Always upvoting spongebob :D yea its kinda sad.
---
that's it
---
Correct.  They are two very different beasts at this point.
---
&gt; Shaman is pretty difficult to fuck up! 
---
Shaman Tank LF Stratholme, clean 2 hour+ run!
---
As other posts I had seen, pick the race u will love to see everyday, their movement, jump animation, walk, attack ... In terms on functionallity, orc will be better for sure in passives, but it ks your char, must be confortable for u.
---
I will roll a hunter, most pve than pvo and I know trolls are better than orc, but my very first pj in wow was a hunter orc, so it will be so :)
---
Keep going for it buddy - it's looking good!
---
We didn't roll on Fairbanks because it doesn't sound like a PvP server, only other west coast pvp server is Whitemane.

Six keybinds right there without reaching for keys. I then have camera zoom on [ctrl]+[alt]+[mwheel-up/dn]
---
Combine with stuff many people already mentioned, like properly binding to QERTFGXCV while moving those existing binds to different stuff and doing shift combos. Together with my Naga, I have every single action bar button bound to a key.
---
*grammar :D
---
00:00 if I can enter the game :)
---
 Gorgeous and the video was good too.
---
&gt; Nobody really cites the zone revamps as the real issue with Cata, and a lot of people liked the new quest style.
---
I disliked the over-streamlined revamp of old world questing, but it was a comparatively minor issue.
---
The really big thing that I think would have merited mention even in this very terse summary is that Cataclysm is where the game began taking choices out of the hands of players: 
---
- That was when "spec" became a game construct, handing you a prebaked package of abilities that you were supposed to use in one specific way. 
---
- Talent points were drastically reduced, and suddenly you were required to invest in one tree all the way to the bottom, and before you could put even a single point in second tree. 
---
- "Mastery" was introduced, the braindead autopilot stat that just automatically changed to whatever Blizzard believed that your spec should want.
---
And then that trend continued in further expansions:
---
- MoP slashed talent points down to six, most of which made little difference.
---
- Respecs became instant, free, and anywhere. So the few choices you had didn't actually matter, because you could unmake them at the drop of a hat.
---
- WoD was the first big round of ability pruning, removing even more variation and choice in gameplay.
---
- Legion pretended to re-add something like a talent tree in artifact weapons, except it turns out that you could just grind enough points to get everything, so again no actual choices required.
---
All of _that_ is how the game lost me. 70% of what I'm looking forward to from Classic is a thick spellbook and real talents.
---
I will wake up early and start around 8am :)
---
I expect the servers to be a shitshow until atleast 4am
---
If you are that desperate for socialisation there is this game called 'Real Life'. You should try it out.
---
If you're like a normal person who doesn't have 3 hours a night shouting on Trade Chat for a tank, then an addon like this makes the game more accessible.
---
Just as i said, you should have had think things through, and try to understand the new concept, then everything would have been fine. 
---
But after WoTLK people had a hard time thinking lol.
---
I have been playing since the release. 
---
I have been raiding hardcore, MC, BWL, AQ and so on. 
---
Have done most stuff in the game, but my favorite part that I’m looking forward to be doing again is questing through Elwynn Forest. 
---
Love that place.
---
Same till i cant stay awake anymore then 6 hours sleep and then again till i cant anymore.
---
Bought my first VR headset this week (Valve Index). I tried that out yesterday because I saw it in the recommendations in SteamVR. That was really awesome. 
---
I think I'll play Skyrim VR until Classic launch
---
Yes but i liked the zones and the story of it at least.

Okay :) I would just give WoW classic its own Button not just a drop down menu
---
Darkshore!
---
At 11pm uk time on the 26th 😁 on a pve server so hopefully queues wont be too bad compared to pvp servers.
---
00:00
---
Took 1 week vacation. Will power through the first 2-3 days and try getting ahead of the pack. Thats what I will atleast try to do. If it works I dont know.
---
It's kinda hard to prove that they are going to do what they say they do. But it makes sense why they are making an entire layer of each server. That way there is still a good bit of people but not TOO many.
---
OOF thats sometimes comedy gold, sometimes happy ending, sometimes even bigger mess.
---
You mean Lights Hope.
---
Damn. It.
---
They use different TOC numbers so no Addons updated for BfA won't show up in classic and vice versa.
---
In saying that however if an Addon author updates their addon for classic they generally will not change the variable scheme they use.  
---
Meaning you should be be able to set things up on Live and copy the saved variables files over to Classic (renaming them if the author has renamed their addons)
---
We are at medium now.
---
I will have an alt character on us though to hang out with some over seas homies. Nothing serious might twink xD
---
How do you want to know on which day this happened?
---
How dense do you actually have to be
---
Doubtful about it, EU got like 3 PvP servers and a shit-ton people on them. They really messed this up!
---
People won’t migrate after they have made friends and such!
---
Ret DPS is actually vaguely acceptable during the first raid tier.
---
Layering is crap and the stresstest only confirmed it to me.
---
people disappearing before my very eyes.
---
normal to you retail players, yeah. gamebreaking shitmechanic for me.
---
and even if they shut it down by phase two, you will suddenly see hundreds (thousands??) of new lvl 60 players on your server, some in the best available raidgear.
---
unknown faces, unkown names. people you dont know and dont care about. people you never quested with, dungeoned with, battled with, never seen before.
---
it will be at this very point the most important feature of classic will break: the community.
---
basically retail.
---
Fair.  I consider the launch icon that, but to each their own :)
---
My 8 man squad are all extremely hyped for classic, but we are not paying to get a name LOL... I expect over a million players.
---
In the last stream of Payo they went ZF and Maraudon in the beta.
---
Probably it won't work at 00:00... I'll try, but if it doesn't work, I will wake up early (happily for once) and hopefully it'll be fixed :D
---
That depends I think.  I was still fairly new and found it kinda annoying at the time as it impacted my leveling.  For my Guildies that had already cleared all content this was the best thing in months.  Some tried to halt the spread, and others tried to spread it.  Both teams had a shit ton of fun for a few days doing something completely new and engagaing.  Organic gameplay at its finest.
---
I feel you man. I used to have this great big ugly TV set up next to my PC in the golden age of wow. I was just so happy and content to watch movies/sport center while gaming. 
---
I’ve staggered my TV to be set up slightly behind my PC. Get my chance to recapture those feels again.
---
Already did as well. Stalagg doesn't look like its gonna have any of the super big streamers on it ie: soda and asmon. but should still be a pretty populated server.
---
Well that hurts
---
Just beware apes are on that server so if ur horde you may have a hard time later on
---
Season 3 weapons were mostly better than the black temple weapons outside of maybe like illidan and the twin glaives.
---
Yes. Male Orcs look crap imo and female orcs stealth pretty nice.
---
You seem to have placed an extra "third" in that sentence.
---
3 am. Try to get some sleep before playing and hopefully skip any early server issues.
---
My friends wants to play alliance, which I've never done before - so I was thinking of playing a paladin, but I also kinda want to play druid.. 
---
What is the most annoying part of both classes? And which buffs will my friends enjoy they most? :)
---
Its pretty safe to do now, servers are still up for name reserving.
---
Why would the best be the rarest?
---
I'll be there for every ZG run my guild does mostly because I am going all-in to get the Tiger, but indeed, none of the loot is BiS in any sense for me. 
---
I love both 20 man raids to bits though. AQ20 is my favorite setting in all of WoW, along with AQ40. And I enjoy the Troll lore too!
---
It would seem people are, in fact, upsetti spaghetti. Every time you’re in a group with a priest and you get feared, think of me my loves.
---
Thanks a lot, it does feel good to get some positive feedback once in a while (the first month it has been incredibly negative 😔)
---
&gt;For most classes, you'll find zero items of interest in ZG if you are mc/bwl geared beyond the shoulder enchants.
---
Class trinkets, jindo mace + neck for healers. Peacekeeper gauntlets (paladin BIS, better than naxx gear), 8-10x hit trinkets for warriors, naxx preparation. Depending on weapon drops, there are 1h dps weapons that ppl could still need. Caster stuff, materials for crafts for BIS dps items. Dps caster cloak from hakkar.
---
And ofc thousand bijous for buff drink materials for later. 
---
I wouldnt call that zero intrest.
---
People seem to forget, there is nothing wrong about having 7-8k people logged at the same time on one layer. Believe it or not, the game will be completely playable. They dont need to go down to 3500 pop to keep one layer only
---
Well, you’re exaggerating. Even in full PvP gear Druids have around 4k-4k2 HP, not 5k. A 3k5 hp Druid can totally die in a global (Frostbolt+Cone of Cold+Fire Blast) by a mage. Also not all Druids have NS, and if you don’t have NS you have little chances to heal yourself against a mage outside of rejuvenate and lucky LoS situation. Indoors you cannot use travel form, meaning you have to go Cat/Bear to get away from Mage’s freezes, and that’s extremely mana intensive. 
---
Druid vs Mage is an easy fight only outdoors, with the Druid being a balance resto hybrid, case in which the Mae can’t do anything, really. But if that’s not the case it’s not as easy a fight as most people seem to think.
---
Clearly not. Skarm really know his shit. Tips is a cool guy and Skarm gets sidetracked a lot. But knowledge-wise Skarm is hard to match.
---
got the permanent link now from the admin:    https:// discord. gg/ 2nC6wGD
---
I'm gonna time my sleep so I wake up before the game launches and go on a binge leveling spree.
---
Thanks man! Just what I wanted.
---
HoJ is the least of your problems lol
---
You serious? That's overkill for classic at Max settings.
---
Leveling and gearing your alt to get invited to raids
---
Well ... there's the Reddit Crowd I guess. And Community Discords  \^\^. Ain't the same as playing / talking about it with a pal in person but well. That's the next best. Gotta make do hahaha \^\^
---
Me and my 2 friends are having a LAN party, gettting on as soon as the realms open..... we hope..
---
They said there is gonna be layering for the first few weeks but that's of the ENTIRE server. So you'll be playing with the same people the whole time even when changing zones. They have better technology now, so it should be fine, but who knows. They hope to completely get rid of layering after a few weeks.
---
So what time does the servers actually open at?
---
I imagine the reasoning is that they feel they would lose some sub money if WC3 came out first.  While I'm sure some people wouldn't sub if that were the case, it's most likely the amount of sub money lost would be miniscule.
---
Cata was well recieved at first tbh, 4.2 ruined Cata though as that was  when nerfs happend and made everyone mad.
---
Had Cata pre 4.2 been what retail was today, retail would still have 10+ million players.
---
why?
---
8am. I take my sleep and enjoy the first day. I took 1 day off from work.
---
Friday the 30th as I'm away for work that week 😔
---
I'm all for playing as efficiently as I can, but I won't tryhard and no-life to the degree of some people. 
---
In other words, I won't be stopping to smell the roses but I also won't stress about not keeping up with everyone at the top.
---
You forget that a healthy server should have 2.5 - 3k users online at the same time, not users in total. I do not know the usual ratio of online people to toons in total, but there's probably a lot more room than you assume, especially a couple days or weeks after launch. Not saying that we don't need more servers though, just that it isn't as dire
---
Well the last time they gave us sub numbers was cata so I’d hedge my bets on them not doing that.
---
It ain't THAT bad. You just play and right before the mob dies you just pop Drain Soul. Works on players as well.   
---
Ain't that much of chore.
---
Tape 7 of them to your forehead and spin and tank all the lady vashes at once.
---
Keep telling yourself that. 
---
You can't do the relevant content on your own, so you're dependent on others accepting your build.
---
What were Vanilla server population caps?
---
I’d go Hunter mate. It’s easy to pick up and do good things with. 
---
Warlock is similar, but there is a bit more of a juggling act and they have so many spells (most in game I think).
---
I think it's a good idea to pick a clothie.
---
I actually didn't make it to 60 as a lock before TBC came out so I can't comment on what the gameplay is like at 60. But I never found the class boring, you have lots of different choices with spells and demons and some good utility with summoning stone. Free mount too.
---
I can't say I think transmog is a bad addition to the game.
---
I'm getting the sense that people are falsely conflating the addition of transmog to the death of server communities. That experience of seeing someone on the bridge in Ironforge and inspecting them is gone because everytime you log in and out you switch to a completely different shard with players from 10 other servers. It isn't because they are transmogged, it is because there isn't that persistence of knowing Dragonfucker of &lt;Blackwing Badasses&gt; isn't afking near the auction house like he always does.
---
Transmog just lets people not look like fruit baskets all the time unless they choose to. With or without transmog, old tier sets stopped being a sign of prestige the moment the next expansion released and they became trivial to get.
---
well it's stupid not to add content, game will be dead within the year.
---
They are saving the cool names in case they have to get people to transfer.
---
Orc looks and feels good, resisting a stun makes you feel God like. However, not resisting a stun makes my blood boil.
---
Now tauren might be big and chonky, but warstomp has saved my ass numerous times. Just to squeeze in an extra LB or LHW, or potentially interrupt a spell cast because Earth Shock is on CD. And it can stun up to 5 enemies in 8 yards. Our melee range is 7 compared to 5.
---
I mean, as we have only one RPPVP server, I dont see why you wouldn't just go to the one we have.
---
What are apes?
---
Yo, just subscribed. My email is [opbetterdeliver@blizzard.net](mailto:opbetterdeliver@blizzard.net), send me that free month code boi
---
“shut it down by phase 2”
---
He said they’ll be gradually removing it in a couple weeks.
---
What are the oceanic servers like? If they're getting close to being full, I might have to reserve a character on the PvP server (I wasn't intending to reserve)
---
alright
---
Until you get claw, yea I agree.
---
If I can get in at launch I will play until I drop. If I can’t I’ll wait an hour and if it’s still a shit show I’ll go to bed and set my alarm for like 5/6am.
---
Just pay a poor man in Russia for a boost !
---
I think you all underrate the amount of people that will play launch on day 1 and never lvl past 30 or comeback ever again.
---
Nah, you're right :\
---
Yeah, I get it. Much has changed. Hopefully, everyone (or at least most) who played vanilla will still have some of that magic vanilla spirit. This was some what lacking when I took a short stint on the private servers this year.. I hope the veterans haven't changed too much.  
---
Gl &amp; hf
---
I will start in the morning because I'm an adult. Even though I do have 3 weeks vacations.
---
A bit less editorialising wouldn't go astray. Example, Blizzard didn't "throw in the towel" with Pandaria; they simply released an expansion in line with their historical 2 year per major expac timeframe.
---
Ill go and (Nelf hunter so very easy) grab an owl for leveling pet as hunter :)
---
This is amazingly well done. Have my upvote
---
BWL was released in [Patch 1.6.0 - 12 July 2005](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.6.0)
---
T2 art update was in [Patch 1.9.0 - 3 January 2006](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0)
---
They've released their plans for the first two years. Use Google. Do some research on a topic before acting ng like your opinion makes sense.
---
On the topic of hunters, Joana will be playing in Classic. 
---
If you're interested in "speedruns" and leveling quickly he should be streaming at https://www.twitch.tv/Joana
---
I'm not affiliated with him but I think that people who are returning might find that watching him could provide some insight on how to make leveling easier as a hunter when Classic launches
---
The central thing is to agree with the party before starting the dungeon/raid what the loot "rules" are. 
---
Advertise the things you are looking for and how you will react to BoE:s (i.e. everyone needs). That way there will be no surprises unless someone is just a ninja and breaks the agreement.
---
Hunter. I've never been a fan of casters and they did a good job of making the hunter feel more physical. They've completely ruined that in retail and I can't wait to go back.
---
why the fuck would any self-respecting australian or kiwi willingly subject themselves to playing with dumbass americans?
---
don't be a region traitor, play on oceanic realms.
---
good job! :D im sure it will happen! i will make sure of it! (but not for horde scum ofc.) 
---
happy classicing
---
Love it! When they high-fived eachother while face planted into the ground I actually laughed

Your party leader will be able to set loot distribution to specific rulesets, including:
---
* Master Loot: The party leader determines who gets the loot.
---
* Round Robin:  Each party member loots in turn.
---
* Group Loot: Party members can roll on powerful items.
---
* Need Before Greed: **Only party members who can use the item can roll on it.**
---
* Free-for-All: Anyone can loot anything.
---
Shit... your shit is really shit dude.
---
I usually have 3 bars binded (from 1 to ` with shift and crtl. modifiers and macros with other modifiers (In retail you can have modifiers like stance:stealth/shadow dance or stuff like in combat)) and one bar without binds for utility stuff (Mounts, poisons, flasks, etc)
---
I have a G600 and use it pretty much for all spells, faster and easier than actually using the keyboard for me, have raided ~top 700 world with this setup last raid tier in retail, so it should be more than enough for classic :D
---
Zandalar will be the best PvP server.
---
Why would you play on NA if you're from Germany?
---
It's like Classic is 15 years old or something
---
Wait what. So you basically play a Hunter..?
---
Please teach me how to make infographics like that?

---
Will go Horde on Classic but man...I do love the general athmosphere and music in Duskwood. Such a great area
---
I've noticed that you can now get it to be on the list of suggestions just by typing "cl"
---
Classic is MMORPG, retail is RPG.
---
If you don't care about min maxing you will find like minded people same for min maxers I don't understand how is any of this a problem
---
 “We have updated the algorithm for the realm population tags so they more accurately reflect the expected population for that realm. The realms that are listed as “Full” are where we expect to see extended queues. If you’re concerned about long queue times affecting your play experience, you may want to consider creating characters on a lower population realm before the game releases on August 26 at 3:00 p.m. PDT.”
---
Thank you Drafur, very cool!
---
With 50k names create on a server, there are only so many names left.
---
I rather go with 39 than take a balance but hey I'm just glad so many diff kinds of players want to play classic!
---
This is no mine. It's a tomb.
---
Looks like you are the right candidate for retail
---
yes there are zones that you can only get to by flaying but it's easy to work around it. make a bridge to tempest keep. add teleporters in BEM and NS. make netherwing island a peninsula. and tbc is tiny, very easy to get around by flight masters.
---
it took until WotLK that flying was properly implemented into the zones. Icecrown and Storm Peaks required flying and integrated it very well as an essential feature.
---
flying was THE feature I was looking forward to going into TBC. but if you want future expansions to be in the spirit of classic you simply remove flying. maybe add a normal rezz to druid and it's the best game wow could ever be.
---
because you're sad
---
Wait you can invite people with /i ?
---
is that why classic servers exist till today without new content?
---
Not a question, but please buy/cook a stack of pet food before you start a dungeon, turn taunt off and stock up on ammo. I want people to have a more favorable opinion of hunters this time around and these three minor things will go a long way towards it.
---
Actually i fell sorry for all the good games releasing after gamescom and hope classic will not consume all my playtime.
---
&gt; That being said you can meme spec and min max. 
---
That is the issue. Most minmaxers (or pure wannabe elitists) will only see your meme spec status and reject you, the optimization of such spec is not as flashy and in some cases (ret pally, dependent on how classic manages item/proc scaling with sp) quite unclear. 
---
So in the end you might minmax but you barely have the chance of mixing with minmaxers.
---
Yeah I think we all hope that Classic will embody the same spirit and feeling. I think for the most part it will.
---
Surround yourself with players who have a like-minded attitude towards the game and you'll have a good time.
---
You just have to understand that not all "veterans" are the same anymore. For example, with myself, I played vanilla on US servers when I was younger and was relatively casual until WOTLK. I moved to EU around late MOP and eventually by Legion / BFA was play at a much different level of "hardcore" than ever before. Many of us who are still playing and have been since Vanilla have adapted to the modern WoW.
---
Don't let anyone dictate how you play and just try to get as much of a dose of nostalgia as you can :) 
---
gl!
---
I'm gonna stay for an hour or two just to witness the HUGE mess of this tremendous release. Will try to get a few levels then go to sleep and after waking up continuing the levelling like a real rested Chad
---
This is an amazing addon, but I think I will play for a few weeks/months without it before I install it. It's something everyone should have, but I just wanna savor those first Vanilla impressions and keep them pure
---
I said about this Weds in the WSIPW thread, but didn't get a lot of traction, so hoping someone here can help me out! 
---
I've been looking to play either Hunter or Druid in Classic as my main, but a major factor in that decision is the state of the class on release. I know there have been lots of reported bugs on the hunter, for pets and all sorts of things, but what is the state of the class going into the last week before release?
---
Are alot of the bugs fixed now, is the class in a playable state ?
---
Thanks in advance for any info!
---
Saving
---
Feral tanks are more than viable feral DPS is ok but takes so much effort farming 143242342343 weapons that I think people might just go resto xD
---
I’ll try to get some sleep in the afternoon and then play 24 hours straight from launch.
---
Old Wow 1.12 is 6.88Gb 
---
A little bit of that will be screenshots and addons  (but not much, i haven't done much screenshotting on private server)
---
I am surprised it's even smaller than old vanilla.  Or maybe they haven't made the other phases yet?
---
Do we know if bindings are going to be dropping in p1?
---
Spooooooky!
---
Well im gonna set up my sleep schedule by next thursday that so that I will wake up on monday around 10 p.m. After that im gonna steamroll through the leveling zones for atleast 72 hours.
---
The guide gets super detailed from 50 on and I noticed that this format was not so easy to follow for 50-60. I will probably add 50-60 before release in a maybe a little different layout.
---
Yea same, although many of the addons didnt work :(
---
Wtf, a noob who uses no actionbars suddenly has two travelers backpacks and somehiw two onyxia bads even though thise are unique
---
WoW died with Arthas.
---
Playing retail in 10 days? Wtf is that spell.
---
As a vanilla veteran I'm not so worried about layering. It'll work if it is indeed remove gradually with the first few weeks of launch and never used again on a mature server.
---
ITT: People who really liked cata lol.
---
https://youtu.be/bK-59wsmSrI
---
Thanks man! I heard you can also just delete the whole thing and that the game automatically creates a new one when you open it the next time?
---
&gt; I don’t know how many of the german people only resubbed for this
---
The german WoW community in general is pretty big, so it's fair to assume a lot of players from retail just created some chars.
---
Yeah, I am going to use Questie and Zygor. Zygor as a general guide and Questie will be used for completing as many quests as possible.
---
Ty mate!
---
&gt; So its incorrect by everyone here to say X nation isnt moving.
---
Meanwhile, doing it yourself. lol. I've seen mamy Finns and Swedes staying on Shazzrah.
---
Interactive version: https://nubbl.com/wow/thunderfury
---
If my math is anywhere close to correct, a lot of people who expected to get Thunderfury that are gonna have a hard time.
---
yea
---
but at least it's worth witnessing :)
---
*laughs in normal*
---
&gt; transfer their character (for a fee) to a TBC Realm
---
Absolutely not. You didn't have to pay a fee when TBC came out to play your main from Vanilla in BC content. The process to transfer is automated anyway, there isn't even a need beyond greed to do this.
---
Look like the sub got 5-10k new member each day.
---
M+ is nothing short of amazing
---
Some of the listed addons are redundant with some of the unit frame addons.  For instance, Perl Classic shows enemy cast bars and HP in both number and % form and I'm fairly sure it has buff/debuff timers as well.  Basically you get 4 addons in one.
---
Stuff my face with it
---
In many, many, many runs I saw the eye and no bindungs
---
Agree beforehand that everyone needs so that there will be no surprises with ninjas.
---
Or agree on something totally different...
---
That's amazing!! I do hope that the modern community is still as immersed in the game as the old timers, so that epic stuff like this can keep happening :)
---
Every few months new raids or pvp content come out, just like in 2005-2006
---
BWL, AQ etc
---
Damn, grow some balls. 
---
To be the best you need to play with the best or against them.
---
No Im not.. Im talking within the context of the coalition. Not the nations complete playerbases.
---
No...that opens up the possibility for them to add all the other stuff that caused me to leave.
---
I remember that first peek into STV as Alliance, there as a Horde NPC (forget the name, it was a female Tauren) walking up and down the Path. And every time i saw that RED mob, i ran and either hid or went around until somebody noticed and whispered (still gratful he did not use say or /1 instead)  me it was an NPC that would not aggro ......
---
they are both medium atm. no reason not to play on once servers imo. theres 5.5k people in the oce discord already
---
Heavens's Door!
---
Nice! Congrats that is awesome News.
---
Yeah ofc Family comes first. But classic is going to last and you will find time to Play. You may not be a Tank but you will be a dad :P
---
Trust me - that is 100 times more worth it than tanking ;)
---
Good luck with your Family and also good luck backstabbing all those filthy allys :D
---
maybe they take some stuff from retail? to save space and not to replicate stuff, i dont know what but it is an option, isnt it? (some textures and stuff)
---
Oh yeah dude stv, ss/tm, blackrock pvp will be a huge part of it all
---
Language, friends.
---
I'm from the US, just living in Germany. All my friends playing are NA.
---
No they are not it's a waste of gold
---
Huh... did not know that. Is that the way it actually works?
---
Of course, that will only stop some forms of abuse and will make the looting quite inflexible.
---
New raids and activities to do beyond raiding would be great. Maybe they could even release new raids with better itemization in mind so that meme specs aren't so memey. 
---
I wouldn't even be opposed to SMALL class changes such as giving Paladins a taunt and making enhancement tanks not go oom so fast.
---
Gehennas Will be the best choice, imo.
---
Serverbalance doesn't matter for warmode, you're in a warmode zone, not a Zul'Jin warmode zone.
---
Faction balance only matters in terms of guilds/raids/M+ in retail.
---
Do you think itll be a problem on a high pop server? I am sure they will have their fun, but considering how many ppl will be online, do you think that taking over zones or terrorizing people will stay unnoticed?
---
Only white item to buy in the game is that weapon for level 6 palas in goldshire
---
60 in a week? That's quite a feat on vanilla..
---
On the stress test I was playing a warlock and I was so fucking hyped when I got my first green random drop. Sure they were mail gloves with +spirit, so not usable but fuck yeah it was great.
---
I think many future hunters are not aware of the auto shot delay.
---
Here is a video showing the delay. Credit to Sixx, admin from the hunter Discord
---
https://youtu.be/p5ruYuIHpX0
---
Fairbanks is a lame name for a server and in game Fairbanks is a weak ass not-even-a-boss little bitch. Whitemane wins by default.
---
Planning to wake up around 9-10pm, launches at 11pm for me.
---
when the trees start saying zug zug

Hi, /u/Helpmekindsir1

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cr495l/will_i_be_able_to_use_retail_titles_mounts_in/). 
---
Ah yes, the head &amp; leg enchants are great for msot classes. I just always forget, as they are crap for my spec.
---
 It was either 3 or 3,5k
---
Currently about 4.4 GB (at least for me).
---
&gt;And then classic gets announced, f my life.
---
I could think of worse things...! :)
---
fun in retrospect to what people enjoy, my instatiable hunger for gay sex may not be so fun to others. a shifting trend is simply that, a shifting trend. No matter what title you put on it, it is changing towards that direction.
---
[WeaponSwingTimer](https://willitclassic.com/view/nLg8DTvUEfrX6KyyyAcx). There's also [YaHT - Yet another Hunter Timer](https://willitclassic.com/view/6CleY1wpKSPUo4Q6mQgt).
---
To you and yours as well!
---
What does Full mean? people are still able to join, right?
---
To be honest, as a new Hunter in classic, I did not understand that video. Does it imply that one addon is better than the other, or just that the delay will impact the different shot timers differently?
---
and the black skin you have over your Minimap?
---
Someone has remade the original WC1 and 2 campaigns with the WC3 engine. I’m halfway through the human WC1 campaign, catapults are utterly brutal.
---
Ill start playing on the 28th, early in the morning.
---
its because wow did not use a randomized itemization like they do now (also like every game does now).
---
Nowadays, the devs just input the list of stats and generate all combination of items for each power level (or ilvl or gear score or whatever u wna call it) and design a few models to assign to them.
---
back then, devs would look at each quest and took the context of that quest (what area, what level would the player be when doing it, what would they need now, what did previous quest reward them, etc) and add the items specifically to compliment what the player might need now.
---
That makes items unique while in modern games the same item has 10k different iterations with different stats and different numbers for each stats for the same item. this is one of the reasons that lead to itemization beocme simply about 1 number your gear score, which personally i find ruins any loot based game (whether a looter shooter like destiny, division, action rpgs like diablo, PoE, single player rpgs or mmorpg)
---
dumb to show faction balance but it should show timezone and ping/latency
---
I mean I'm literally on the normal twitch client and it doesn't download any bfa addons, in fact I can't even see bfa updates or any addons that aren't available for classic. even if it did auto update to bfa you can go into the versions tab and pick a classic version.
---
Apart from moving the community to Outland, the gameplay was not changed drastically.
---
It's like dear Abby on cocaine, steroids and a bi polar rabid dog, all rolled into one big shit sandwich
---
wow i just remembered VG cats...
---
How different is Vanilla Hunter compared to TBC Hunter? I had a blast playing Hunter in TBC pservers, but don't know if it will be the same.  
---
Some things that come to mind are:
---
* Traps - can't use them in combat \*sadface\*;
---
* Deadzone. This boggles my mind, tbh, as to what is the creative reason behind it;
---
* Mend pet is a channel (don't know if this was just the early stages of Vanilla or all the way throughout);
---
* Arrows/bullets cost a lot;
---
* A bag slot is taken up for a quiver;
---
* Damage falls off with later stages of the game (not that I will be raiding Naxx, but still a worth to take in mind).
---
If someone that has played both Vanilla and TBC as Hunter, can you give me an insight on how was it and what QoL changes for Hunter you were most thankful for as the game went on.
---
You got a 4Gbit/s connection? Oh it doesn't exist for regular people? Then you're not downloading 3 gigs in 10 seconds mate.
---
Also, it was 4.2 gigs.
---
*screams in murican*
---
Im planning to do this on my toon on the RP server to fully immerse myself inte the character. On main progress charcter i will be going for as quick leveling as possible
---
Shouting about how theyve got a huge sky high sub count after classic would just be announcing how terrible BFA has been for them.
---
Okay. Not a big difference. I'm more worrying about framerate. I hope i'll get 144.
---
I'm pretty sure that was a lie.
---
The only semi-warranted concern one might consider is that the brits choose a server and decides to do a... servexit... hehe :D
---
A lot of sure as hell hope so...
---
Also forgot to be partial. This is super biased lol
---
&lt;3 We love you too!
---
By casting bubble and HSing away?
---
1 dwarf 
---
2 troll 
---
3 orc
---
4 human 
---
5 tauren 
---
6 night elf 
---
7 undead 
---
8 gnome
---
I know that Lupos will not be as strong on 1.12 but what about Brokentooth?
---
That sounds like the biggest waste of money, time and resources I've ever heard lol like 90% of people just click accept without reading a single word... Some people even have addons that auto-accept quests as you walk past the NPC...
---
How different are hunters to retail? My kid has collected lots of different pets and enjoys feeding them (so much that her bags are full of random animal chunks to feed her menagerie) but they just autolevel with her and are always loyal...
---
Raid on Undercity as an ally is so exciting,  (probably even more when it's the first time you get there).
---
yeah the guild might move to Stalagg which would be nice cause i got my main name plus one sweet alt name there but I don't want to miss out if Herod is the best thing since sliced Jaina.
---
 We definitely don't want it. We thought we did, but we didn't.
---
The worst thing is that you are probably right.
---
I'd say that leaving current hitbox problems out of the equation Tauren and Orc are both really good for elemental pvp.
---
Lets pray they dont
---
It will be different this time around, of course. All decent guilds will clear Naxx, it'll just take a lot longer for some than others.
---
Watch their vids lol they took on 150 horde with 40 people and kicked their arse lol personally I'm rolling shazzrah. That's my opinion
---
Current objective: Survive
---
Feel like you're sleeping on SFZXCV fam
---
What specs do you have?
---
I plan to place a subscription the day I intend to log in. Which is the day I will create my name. I have no plans to reserve a name.
---
Facemelter, since shadow melts faces in pvp.
---
Same here, I pondered the possibility of starting playing at midnight but too many people, queueing issues, and it'll mess up my sleep cycle. We decided to start fresh at 6am too with my brother.
---
Middle of the week, it shouldn't be too bad.
---
You can go LBRS with 10 man
---
&gt;With the right raid comp casuals can 100% clear Naxx.
---
Big difference in clearing naxx and killing bosses in Naxx. Do total casuals start gathering hit trinkets for their warriors at ZG launch ? Are those same warriors in the guild when they are in naxx. Preparing frost resistance gear, consumables (for everyone in raid) that can cost 1000-2000g for a guild that isnt naxx veterans.
---
Im sure there are loads of videos, information etc about pole vault, but fuck no would that help me at all. NAXX is a big instance, a casual guild would still like to gear up in previous raids, do they REALLY have time to progress in naxx. Or do they even want to ?
---
HC guilds are by FAR easier for people, you can take just few resistance potions, because you know you dont fuck up on bosses. Wiping in naxx on certain bosses is EXPENSIVE. I dont see casuals having the time or the gold to do it.
---
But maybe if enough time is given and lot of HC guilds break up, you get more experienced ppl in.
---
Cringy.
---
4 days 20 hours
---
you have the tailor items for mages/locks, a pair of gauntlets for paladins, a useful trinket for some classes, a caster cloak and a healer necklace. Jin'do mace is alright, but worse than lok'amir. I wouldn't call that big interest. The hit trinket is purely needed for one single fight.
---
You'll do ZG anyway for the enchants and those handful items will be picked up along the way, but are never the reason you go there in the first place. A high end raider runs ZG for the rep, the enchants and the mounts, not the few drops, that are worthwhile.
---
It's kinda close, actually. Probably one of the zones that I like the most atmosphere wise, especially since the world feels much more dangerous in Vanilla.
---
I wonder if Duskwood would benefit from removing the glow effects everyone is talking about recently.
---
Melee leeway was there in classic back in the day, but it was there to counter act the terrible internet speed/connections, People had 300-400ms commonly, now people are at  30-60ms, why is Blizzard still keeping leeway? A tauren warrior can hit someone from 12 yards away in Classic, and other melee classes/races can hit from about the same distance... huge disadvantage for Hunters.
---
Just a new experience bud
---
Just /i works as well
---
&gt; You're just doing unnecessary hybrid bashing.
---
Every single class I've main'ed or played extensively has been a hybrid.
---
Care to elaborate on why you'd rather go with 39 over the alternative of having a balance druid? I can't see a situation where having the balance druid over having no one would be a detriment to your raid.
---
For some reason this brings to mind the town in Secret of Monkey Island (MI1). Anyone else?
---
relevant enemy yeah, those fire elementals are all over that shard he wants you to get. and yes at naxx the lady that wants all your shit is the enemy.
---
Heh was always Teldrassil to IF for me, dodging one-shot crocs all the way through the Wetlands.
---
Was such an epic part of the leveling experience!
---
please tell me what "AMA" stands for
---
That's incorrect :)
---
Please look into this
---
I hear a lot of PVP guilds/groups and battlegroup premades are going to Herod, which means STV and Hillsbrad should be amazing (and AV bg)
---
I highly doubt bindings drop until BWL is out.
---
We don't know if they will progress onto TBC after. Blizzard said at some point they will consider it I think based on how successful classic is (so hopefully).
---
You should be able to bring 10 people to most dungeons, however this wasn't working correctly during the Stress Test.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cout1f/update_dungeon_cap_bug_isnt_as_simple_as_first/
---
Well I didn't. And I agree, auto dismounting would be a nice change. I specifically mentioned aoe looting, not any of the other stuff. Still is a slippery slope though.
---
Honestly yeah ZG is a great raid. Hakkar jindo and panther boss especially are sooo fun
---
Unfortunately, hunters being one of the hardest classes to play in terms of just getting by, is a nightmare.
---
Also, pet taunt on manual is OP - A good hunter using pet taunt when the healer or a ranged DPS overaggro's automatically becomes a tanks best friend.
---
Are you high?
---
I’ll have what he’s having
---
Lorti UI
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
Hahaha fair statement. Feel free to pick what ever server you want. It's all about having a good time
---
Oh im aware. And for me in particular, the wonder is gone, but I was trash back then. I was 11, stacking strength on my hunter and int on my feral druid. I maxed out at lvl52 befoee TBC. Its all new to me.
---
&gt;UPDATE: I told him our daughter's real father was my mother and he said "Great, I was worried fuckign her was incest"
---
I hope you’re prepared to get kicked and blacklisted from 90% of parties.
---
To answer this question we first have to have a definition of the word 'casual' what is a casual player?    My co worker had trouble to finish BRD.. that was casual.  But I am casual compared to most of my pserver buddies, and I have cleared aq40 and naxx  
---
Up to BWL is casual friendly. 
---
AQ40 is getting a bit more time consuming, but doable. 
---
Naxx will mean you have to step up in a way that it's weird to call yourself casual anymore.
---
19pm after work 😀
---
Do you know if it will work with Dominos or Bartender?
---
Its the last time we can ask them for unarmored mounts!!
---
That would lead to a million bots from all over the world reserving all the popular names for resale on third party sites, and the rest of us  all having names like Dgjsja and Rfrfrfr.
---
If you start meddling with gear and balance, or try to add any form of powercreep(above naxx gear) you meddle with one of the Vanilla's foundations. You do that, you are on the path towards BFA. You are person number 1000000 who has their "small change" in mind. You have 2 choices. Either ignore everyone's else ideas or acknowledge them and open the door to something that will not resemble vanilla in 1-2 years.
---
Good luck with convincing the pro-changers that only your change is the good change. What can i say.... 2 years later there isn't a single thread where a change is proposed and it didn't turn into insult cesspool. But yours will be accepted.
---
Or you can try understanding why it should be a Museum game with occasional fresh server launches.
---
What do you have to gain by trivializing other peoples concerns?
---
Also, if I come across as worked up to you, there is some miscommunication going on. I'm just disappointed and a little sad.

I'm in Ibiza till the 28th....unfortunately
---
If they kept wall jumping and i assume they did since i saw streamer or two going to hyjal, it should be possible. In very specific spot in great forge you could climb (wall jump) to spot and duel there. I used it to get to old ironforge zone for some exploring back in a day.

MIDNIGHT GANG WHERE U AT
---
Is it more important to have consecration or mitigation for dungeons?
---
Lol a year old 8700K @ 5.2ghz /1080 TI. Will be interesting how much I can max out the wow settings at launch running 3440x1440P. Whats even worse is recommended settings in gfx panel ingame is level 7 gfx settings.
---
All the time I played WoW I used Q,E,R ... U along with shift + the same. But since I'm playing shaman I'm probably going to add Ctrl + 1-7 and Ctrl + Q-U if I feel like I need it
---
My favourite area to quest in vanilla.
---
Too many.
---
The pet growl ability is not a taunt, it only adds X amount of threat to the target (think more like sunder armor) and it does not force a target change in PvP.
---
All horde on Stalagg are just alliance that switched sides
---
What’s the ilvl req for the anniversary raid? I’m not in a guild so I wonder if I’ll be able to find a pug for it, depending on the difficulty. I really want that mount
---
Where the fuck do you “talk about your exp per hour”? All I see is 21 minutes of music while you do RFC followed by 60 seconds of useless shit
---
Oooh might reach out
---
I played both and I felt that the dps rotation was more fun in vanilla than tbc because of the 1 button macro rotation you use in tbc with steady shot and kill command. The by far biggest change is the one you mentioned with channeling mend pet.
---
I also played tanks in vanilla and tbc and for group composition I valued hunters higher in tbc than in vanilla because of how strong Misdirect is. 
---
I’d say if you already know how it works in tbc just go for it. One of the most reliable classes for farming gold at 60 in P1 by solofarming maraudon.
---
absolutely they will not.
---
 They stopped releasing sub number to help control investment volatility and several other good reasons. Also Blizz has made it clear they expect massive player drop off. Even if they advise an expect 80% drop off and reeally it was only 70 or 60% It would send shockwaves through their investors who dont understand the game industry.
---
SELFIE camera patch.
---
I have download auto quest accept and aim for world first 60 rogue, be ready for the name "Mingy" in EU to be world first!

---
I don't think they're underestimating at all. They're being cautious in these two weeks up to launch, using name reservations to gauge the numbers and adding servers at a slow pace. Because it's far better to have too few servers (which will be mitigated by layering) than too many servers (which results in dead servers once players drop out).
---
1) Taurens - Big and awesome, love their culture as well.
---
2) Orcs - Badass, fits all of their classes, good lore!
---
3) Dwarfs - Beards, come on.. beards!
---
4) Humans - Especially Warriors, Paladins and Mages. Every gear looks great on them and cool animations.
---
5) Night Elf’s - Looks good, great as Druids and Hunters especially, chill guys.
---
6)Trolls - Could prob win over Night Elf’s here, but Night Elf’s win due to their starting zone. Otherwise Troll be cool mon.
---
7) Gnomes - Like them as casters or rogues. Shouldn’t be warriors lol.
---
8) Undead - Ok they are very cool, awesome animations. But personally wouldn’t want to play a rotten corpse. But I still like to see them lol
---
At low levels mitigation isn't as big of a deal but if you have a mage or someone who can't focus your target it can make it quite hard to keep aggro without a taunt.
---
See you at BRM friend... your a rogue so maybe not as you will be hiding
---
This to me is a very important part about running dungeons, in classic these things take time, a lot of it. Usually its not even worth the time investment for the xp.  
---
So loot is mostly the reason people go into dungeons and while situations change its important to announce your intentions to others in that group.  
---
This isnt some heirloom 5min dungeon run with a LFG system, instances are serious time investments that should be respected.
---
booked the week off so i can binge wow. i am aiming for mid-40s
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Taunt is useless if you already have aggro. Since you gonna send your pet in to attack the mob, he will get aggro by default, so using growl as an opener when your pet is gonna get aggro anyway, is a waste.
---
If you're absolutely loaded you can make elemental shaman viable with bulk consumables. Doubt you'll ever get the money for your epic mount together though 😂
---
I have this memory of a whole bunch of low level characters “raiding” a low level dungeon, because raiding was “the best way to play the game.” We literally filled up a raid group and went into the dungeon.  I have no idea which dungeon it was but I do remember getting about 4xp per kill and wondering whether it really could have been the fastest way to level.  So at least if this memory is correct, there was no cap on how many you could bring.  Or at least the cap was 40.
---
Not exactly spell power, but priest mindcontrol synergizes well with high places and deep waters.
---
I will maybe play an hour at launch but as I have to work and enjoy my sleep I will probably play more on the 27th in the evening.
---
Danish and norwegian people have a pretty easy time speaking english :) så bare rolig ven, det bliver ikke så slemt som du tror.
---
Glad Sulfuron got high. I was worrying and thinking to join Golemagg or Shazzrah.
---
Yeah, that's what I figure. The mana issue is just too much for them where atleast a ret pally can autoattack
---
Too bad no one takes people under 60 for emperor or lava runs
---
Unfortunately, it doesn't work on stuns. It works on snares (Frost Nova, Entangling Roots) and movement slow (Hamstring, Wing Clip), and it does have 0.5 second cast time. It's still a really good PvP ability.  
---
For bleeds and poisons it's mainly the rogue &amp; warrior, but druid got a couple of bleeds as well in cat form, and hunter got serpent sting.  
---
The reason I prefer Stoneform over Escape Artist is that Bleeds &amp; Poisons prevent you from using Vanish, and Rogue &amp; Warrior are both really popular PvP classes.  
---
PvP trinkets seems to be added in phase 2 or 3, so a few months into the release (although not 100% sure here), but PvP trinkets in Classic are a little weird. What they do depends on your class. Some remove stuns, others remove fear, etc.
---
I am not exactly sure that would be enough for me to play a priest, but maybe Arcane Priest would!
---
I am soo jaded by that sub and subs like TIFU that now I see every post over their as a writing promt versus something that actually occurs
---
Remember to check the limited supply recipe vendors when waking up at 2:00, 3:00 and 4:30 every morning!
---
The moment when golemagg and shazzrah players see those 5 hour queues on launch, there will be massive migration to gehennas, making it full aswell almost immediately.
---
This is why I’m here haha. Thanks, will note it.
---
Is the cat a real druid ?
---
Not american, I don't know what Dear Abby is.  
---
I guess it's some kind of show where people do "interventions" in shit families ?  
---
We have a show here in France called "Pascal le Grand frère" which translates to "Pascal the older / big brother". Where a former delinquant raised in Foster care just go to homes with shit kids / shit families and try to fix them through sport and communication. And since he comes from a shittier background than 90% of them, he uses that as leverage to make his voice legitimate.  
---
I mean, it's still "trash TV" and you watch for the drama and laugh about how fucked up people are, he still does some good I guess.
---
I am happy if it will be like it was. 
---
No more no less.
---
Which would imply the server you can't join is full, because it says *full*.
---
What do we know about Blizzards classification for high/medium/low? Are the limits the same as during vanilla?
---
&gt; Why? Because you might have to change your name?
---
More because a bunch of more progressed people appear out of nowhere and are all like "whassup with you guys, how's your progression going, oh lol that's cute, hey if your best players want to defect we need extra benchwarmers hit us up".
---
K but how many
---
So what do you think about the 30% vs 20% nerf?
---
I'm not gonna write about the typo but I feel like from what I've read that the changes to the zones in cata have been actually well recived because now the old zones felt new and interesting (and you also could fly now, people loved this). Also the desire for vanilla already started with tbc
---
I assume so? Why wouldn't they
---
To Tank dungeons you will probably need Consecration. 
---
There is no Prot build before level 30, because nothing in the top of the Prot Tree helps you in solo content or in dungeons.  But once you hit 30 and you can get Reckoning and Seal of Light you have the option of respeccing from Holy or Ret.
---
Reckoning and Seal of Light lets you AoE grind mobs very efficiently.  Rushing Reckoning without Consecrate will make dungeon tanking harder, but not impossible if you explain to your group.
---
After reading through these replies I can't tell if you're trolling or not. Dude wasn't lying, he mentioned a number someone else posted.
---
"YoU dOnT hAvE a SoUrCe YoU mUsT bE a LiAr"
---
I feel you though man, fuck OP for asking innocent questions using tangentially related numbers someone else generated.
---
if you install it on the same disk as BFA it actually only takes 2.8GB.
---
Really important for deciding my class, is there going to be a version of PallyPower available or does the API not alow for it?
---
Not sure if I can be arsed coordinating pally buffs in raid without it!
---
I reported it during the Stress Test so hopefully it'll be fixed.
---
Well Av is a while off and we're getting the fast paced 1.12 version. But i hope the wpvp side of thing holds up!
---
Stay up all Sunday night until about midday Monday. Sleep for around 8 hours. That gives me 4 ours to prepare for 0 hour, then it begins....
---
Well, I don't, I'd like to believe most are true. Because who the fuck goes on the internet to lie for petty shit like "karma" or "attention".  
---
I guess there are fakes, but a lot of them read like some genuine shit. Maybe I'm naive tho.
---
What if people don't want to change server
---
Piggybacking a bit:
---
2) the first slot is 50s, the second is 5g 3) The mobs that will provide experience to your pet are based off of the pet's level, not yours, so if the level range would give experience to them they can gain levels from it
---
What do you mean with this meme exactly?
---
Let me know if you find anything out about this. I tried to make a thread about it but it was deleted so I have to comment on this week old thread and hope someone finds the message
---
Back in the day it happened.  Probably people will want to do it initially for the nostalgia but then I think it’ll probably drop off due to boredom and also to battlegrounds.
---
Probably with BWL like some of the MC items.
---
How would I find this information? Stv fishing was one thing I never tried
---
After I rush to 60 via Dungeon spamming, I will do that on my main + my alt :)
---
5 hr queue says hi.
---
For all we know the servers could go completely down then come back up in an hour or w/e
---
Did you know there are many servers, so maybe you meant first in your server?
---
Is that actually the reason leeway exists? Everything in the game has some kind of leeway. You can hit with projectile attacks even if the target moves a little bit out of the max range of your spell or whatever in between you casting and the projectile releasing, same with arrows and bows. 
---
I figured these things were there because it would just feel like shit and out-ranging shenanigans would become way too common as a complete accident without some kind of leeway.
---
Pretty much yeah. Youd still be taking performance hits by generating everything, but you wouldnt get minimap icons
---
Really?
---
Moonfire doesn't have that icon.
---
Barrens chat was twitch chat before twitch chat became a thing.    
---
I imagine it'll just be the same as twitch chat now.
---
Arent you even able to macro it so its mouseover aswell? Something like 
---
/i [@mouseover]
---
Or have i had Some sick dream about it.
---
It doesn't even have to be "optimal". There are no Heroic/Mythic raids or dungeons where min-maxing actually matters.
---
Player-knowledge and -skill make a much bigger impact than your spec. A shadow-priest who knows the dungeon and knows what to press will easily outperform a mage that's just face-rolling with half his attention on his phone or TV.
---
Lf people RFC40 (Ragefire chasm) !!!
---
For dungeons Consecration is more important than everything.
---
You don't need damage mitigation if you can't even keep the mobs on you.
---
Go holy until level 20 like this: [Talent Tree](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVz).
---
then to Prot [Talent Tree](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVzZVG0h).
---
I should also note that Ret is the best way to level. Im only giving you what you asked for.
---
Exactly, and we got Grim as well ;)
---
During PvP if a spell is cast at you, think frostbolt or aimed shot, will feign death drop target for the opponent and prevent the spell from being cast or does the spell still complete?
---
She doesn't know much about the game :p
---
i like how people automatically interpret growth as someone positive when this place has (mostly) been a hellhole ever since the beta was announced. it's only gonna get worse until this sub reaches r/wow levels. have fun ya'll
---
Never played classic besides this last stress test, many things i was missing were included here as addons, thanks!
---
im forever using "hammy downs" now.
---
Also remember to be reasonable with it. If someone has been hacking at a silver elite to 5% hp, hes not going to invite you so you can roll on the item because you happen to be there.  
---
Also sharing xp in classic is a big thing, its not easy to level and some classes are fine soloing and if they care about fast leveling, they prob should solo. So dont get all huffed up about not getting that invite.
---
Fingers crossed, it'll definitely be a nice flavor element as an option for dungeons if they can fix it.
---
Ooh sweet summer child
---
Im the same my rs3 account is 15 years old and i played rs for about 12 years of that with a few breaks. Ive now only played wow in 2018 bfa so classic will be a brand new adventure :)
---
Blackmane
---
In Phase 2 everyone is going to want to pvp without having any battlegrounds out, lvl 50-60 zones are going to be a bloodbath with 60s camping.
---
Ele shaman can autoattack too, just get a high dmg 2h staff and windfury the fuck up.
---
His PC is extremely overbuilt to run classic on.
---
1080ti on an i7 4790k here, and hey, it's still not enough to get a stable 1440p @ 165hz with maxed settings.
---
Let's pray they do because what I actually want is wotlk
---
* Spelling Mistakes
---
* The desire for classic servers existed since TBC
---
* Private servers where very big during Wotlk not only to play the game while avoiding paying the sub but also to play Vanilla or TBC when they where current. 
---
* Cata wasn't poorly recieved because of the revamp, the Cata questing was aclaimed as a huge step forward. Cata was poorly recieved as since tbc and beyond they have made the game more casual friendly, Cata made Dungeon Content difficult in contrast to the Wotlk, they also made there raids even harder while having equal gear for 10man teams than 25man, these combined rewarded more skilled players and help widened the gap between the playerbase.
---
* Average expansions last around two years, tbc was shorter than Cata, they didn't throw in the towel you mong. 
---
* You couldn't freely change spec in MoP, you still where limited to two specs and had to pay to spec change. 
---
* Legion wasn't as well recieved as MoP. AP, Titanforging and legendaries where all major issues that lasted the length of the expansion that everyone bitched about and many quit over, a great expansion but that's it. 
---
Waste of design talent on something that substance just wreaks with personal agenda and misleading the reader.
---
For sure man, I would appreciate that - there are some features that is beyond what I am used to working with, but that could be quite useful for this; so I might be in touch if I get stuck!
---
If cancels the case because they lose target.
---
so you werent a healer, you were a necromancer.
---
Gehennas seems to be the most toxic community so far. Me and my guild are staying on Shazz. Those guys who think they are some kind of dictators making east west south north alliances are really taking it too far. Seems the shazzrah people are more relaxed overall. Also I dont really wanna be a part of Serbia/Bosnia hatred (its a thing fyi). Nor do I care for too many swedes in one place (Im swe) It goes toxic really fast.
---
Might sound nerdy but this gave me the goosebumps. This is the main reason I want to play. These little things are what I miss. Thank you for sharing.
---
I guess, I mean depending on how struggle-bus your guild is you can Shaman tank.
---
Late 30’s early 40’s
---
I hate my friends for not going Alliance :(
---
Yeah respawn times are off and thats why i decided to not display that data ingame. For spawns, 99% of them were accurate while i was doing my many 1-15 runs so i think youre a bit exagerating on the inaccuracy of the data.
---
I havw heard of npcs being in slightly different spots on Classic compared to pservers
---
Then I guess I will get shit stomped on shazz haha
---
Check out https://www.vanillafriends.com/ if you haven't already. :-)
---
&gt; I won a lot of duels just with shield + wanding
---
You asked a question, got an answer and now want to argue. Okay. Things hit harder as you level and your shield won't block nearly as much. Couple that with the fact that great wands become much more scarce unless you're willing to shell out serious gold for a Jaina's Firestarter and you'll start to understand.
---
Doesn't invalidate what I said though.
---
&gt; The thing is, many people will take "hybrids can play the game now"  
---
Could be replaced by :
---
&gt; The thing is, many people will take "\[insert a class\] can play the game now" 
---
My point is, what you are saying at best only discourages people of playing hybrids. It does not make them aware that they should be more knowledgeable about their class in general.
---
Or you can all just need anyways and then pass it to the Druid. If 3 pass then 1 person needs the Druid has a 50% of losing out.
---
For Horde, what’s a better duo leveling partner for Hunter: Druid or Warrior?
---
60
---
Let's just say there's a reason blizz invented hunters and gave them wing clip.
---
In that i think you are in the wrong
---
It’s only easier because we mature. I loved the feeling of graduate school. I finished my MBA in December and I was a completely different student this time around. While the work wasn’t fun, it was a fun feeling.
---
When I get ganked and I end up winning or making the enemy flee with my class that is strong in early wPvP. By picking this class instead of another, I basically prevented a copse run.
---
theres like.. literally room for another monitor in this picture?
---
Dont you get 10 copper (and can afford immo) without selling dagger though?
---
Like, if you sell everything beside the dagger
---
Don't need to learn corruption until level 14. I'm not casting that shit at not instant speed.
---
Blizzard sorta tried to do something with spelldamage hunter, but it's pretty bad afaik. There's a [trinket](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19336) that makes your Arcane Shot get an AoE effect every 2 minutes, and the [upgraded t2 set](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=509) from AQ40 has spell damage on it as well.  
---
I think Serpent Sting also scaled with spell damage back then, but that might just be me remembering wrong. Either way, it's not really a good build.
---
omg I totally forgot about this series! Thank you so much
---
If you put the map selector to "manual" and then never press "show" on your minimap, you shoud only get quest pickups. You unfortunately wont get quest turnins because those quests will never be set to "active"
---
Its Mark Kern, not Mike.  TBH this timeline does not feel well-informed.

Nobody really knows how players will behave. I'd like to think that vanilla has mechanics that encourage communication but so does real life and I prefer to order from a website instead of interact with a cashier.
---
It was never all that bad though. I hope it doesn't evolve to what the private servers are like now. That might be one part of the nostalgia I wont get back

Intel I7-8600k @5.3GhZ, 32gb ram, Samsung 970 Evo Plus, RTX 2080 OC. 
---
Can I run it?
---
I hope so, but for that we'll need a little moderation.
---
Start at 00.00 if all goes well. Play till 22:00. 8hours sleep. 16hours a day. Home for 40 days =)
---
I agree with too many swedes in the same place can get real toxic. (Im also swe)
---
Shazzrah is just a bunch of unsecure kids posting stupid meme's or other bullshit.
---
The queue time will be INSANE on launch day.
---
Oof sorry, should said asmon fans.
---
First off the game is not even out yet bud so perhaps try to be a tad more positive! Now as to what direction the game will take down the line will greatly depend on its success-if its a flop then obviously Blizz will just leave it as is. If its a huge success and people are demanding more content then it could go down two different paths.
---
First one would be releasing the expansions one by one just like they did with the classic version; Either turn Classic into TBC or just release extra TBC servers as a separate client and allow you to copy your character across.
---
Second option could be something more creative-seeing how people could prefer the older style of game, rather than the streamlined version of retail, they could release an alternate expansion. It could take part in the Outlands but the plot is completely different and so are the mechanics and character progression. If you remember the gear in Outlands was insanely good; I remember a particular blue chest piece from a lvl58 quest that was equivalent to my T2 Dragonstalker chest piece. They could simply tone down the gear progression, change the overall world a bit and go from there.
---
The possibilities are endless but the bottomline is that it all depends on how successful Classic will be-Blizz is in it for the money, just like any other business, so if they think it viable I am sure they will come up with something when the time is right.
---
I plan to sleep until 2 or 3 PM the monday, just to be able to be up until 6 or 7 AM.
---
Yeah I think those leaving us now will change their mind come server launch.  Blizzards official server queue warnings are no joke, if they are making those they think it’s going to be bad.
---
Maybe I'll check out the first 2 hours, but probably will just go to work and start afterwards. Maybe i'll leave early, we'll see :D
---
i love you all
---
Yeah, I guess you might be right, I probably misinterpreted the 2.5 - 3k users. 
---
I would guess there more servers would be added along the way, when blizzard has enough data about player counts and drop outs. I somehow actually trust that blizzard will do a decent job :D
---
Stalagg Squad
---
Blizzard is counting on layering and even they used the word "severe" queues. We might be here for a big surprise
---
That’s completely false that’s not how information storage works. Good try though
---
Thank you for proving my case in point.
---
Get high on monday to sleep all day and then run a all nighter.
---
I think more people understand AB, WSG, and AV than do Seething Shore as you mentioned in your post. So, the hope is, more people understand the main objective and can communicate effectively.
---
That being said, you'll still have to spam "fight on / spin flags" for AB, "go for EFC" in WSG, and "don't cap GY" in AV. Hate to say it, but the average player isn't that great :P
---
But I live in Mozambique and it takes me 43 years to earn $15!
---
Depends on your definition of attractive. They're certainly not 'y'know' attractive to me (all the more power to 'em if they are to some), but they're aesthetically pleasing and kind looking.
---
dang im a scrub with 1700x and gtx1080 lol
---
&gt;	but to not intend to play. They do not like classic, but they do not want people using their names
---
Shame their names are used on every other server then huh
---
You won't survive because the fight will start when you're at 50% health and fighting a mob.
---
In all honesty the only swap I would do in terms of phases is having the T0.5/Dungeon set 2 available on phase 2. I do understand that it was released with AQ originally but other that for collection purposes will anyone actually bother getting it this time?
---
Thanks so much mate!
---
That was in WoD.
---
So we all know the DPS of hunter in raid is not fantastic.
---
But what about pvp where all tricks can be used?
---
&gt;Realistically: what influence would such a guild have on a realm in regards to controlling an economy, the PVP system and zones?  
---
Afaik APES only appeared so dominant on private servers due to botting and cross faction collusion, both if which blizzard will not tolerate.
---
This is an mmorpg launch. I don't *Really* expect to be able to play the first few days.
---
With more mana couldn't that allow them to use more arcane shots? Even just being creative with the set bonuses could work like "your pet gains an additional 25/50/100% of you attack power". This is all just off the top of my head, point being though that having sets for each spec could do a lot of the work.
---
Probably lots of players currently playing retail as well.
---
Know what helps me enjoy wow? Not being feared :3
---
They are going to activate the log in servers for streamers first.  Then once all streamers are logged in and have gotten through the first quest or two will let everyone else in.
---
There is zero chance. No matter how good or bad.
---
Yeah I just checked.
---
arguing != discussing about what makes priests fall behind after lvl 20. But thanks anyways.
---
Druid.
---
Two decent players will stroll through every elite quest pretty much.
---
Yeah I feel the same, I've not actual beta experience myself so can't judge, I can only gauge by the (sometimes hyperbolic) reactions on this subreddit and others.... I guess we'll find out!

Do you not realise people have reserved names on all servers? Its really hard to tell their true pop
---
Well he says layers will be gone. So they'll be gone. And if they're gone and there are too many people left over? Guess what?! QUEUES!
---
Do you draw comissions?
---
Idk, the male gnome laugh might do more damage. Worse sound in the game imo.
---
Yeah i think this is the standard/how most people will approach it.
---
I would also add that if a good BoE drops tell everyone to NEED on it, prevents ninja situations where last person rolls need,
---
If someone wants to equip it you can just trade it to them if you want.
---
We shall prevail with or without you!
---
Dafuq did I just watch.
---
I'm subbed, send gold instead.
---
oh you will soon my friend
---
They committed to removing layers by phase 2, regardless of population drop.
---
Priests are a tad bit weak around that level, casting anything more than SWP and PWS will drain your mana far too fast. Best chance of winning is wand and SWP and hope you can outlast your opponent with the occasional PWS.
---
Not at all, the reservation limit would still just be 3 names.
---
Good. Then you just have to deal with queues once layers are gone.
---
Mor'ladoom more like it
---
First mistake going spriest. Actually spec doesnt matter at all for priest, what you need to do. That they wont. Is stack agil an spirit and wand people to death.
---
I was with serenity now when we did this. I was too young to be allowed to talk a lot of the time in vent so I learned how to play skatman over voice. Which is why they chose that song. Gm hunter amiendo boiz. Later in life I tell this story and people tell me I'm a pos and I say I was 12.. I feel kinda bad now for doing this but I also dont remember it
---
I remember hearing about this at the time but not sure it was ever verified
---
If they turn off layering at the same time as offering free transfers, then you'll have tens of thousands of people that are not able to log in to their server with waiting hours.
---
So people will definitely move, so the new servers won't die if they create the right amount.
---
Planning to play as a dwarf hunter and was wondering if leveling with guns or bows was optimal. May purchase bow training around mid to late teen levels when switching zones if I'm good financially. However, if I'm not will I be putting myself at a disadvantage? Not looking to speed run but just stay ahead of the pack if possible.
---
Fairbanks is looking like a good choice so far. Glad I picked it but who knows what it’ll be like on release. Who knows what any server will be like on release. My guess every server will be full lol.
---
Wtf it could be dispelled? Thats fucked!
---
You would be able to max out the settings on a 960 for 4k with all new shader options enabled too. 
---
I was playing with all post-processing maxed on a 970 &amp; 6cores @3.6GHz CPU at 144 fps and didnt even touch 70Celcius on my card during a dungeon.
---
We're not even gonna pvp. We're gonna raid a lot, just want that feeling of getting raped in STV while leveling
---
I think you need a new spot for your mouse xD seems your cat is holding it hostage haha
---
And btw you were Actually wrong thee servers can fill up and max out.
---
Ret is very capable of dungeon tanking early as well. 
---
 Improved Retribution Aura does the same damage as Consecrate until level 40.  Obviously it doesn't work as well against caster mobs or slow attackers (like most bosses,) but you can make up for that with the cheaper and faster Judgements.
---
Probably. But at least Priests have better chances to survive than a Warrior and Hunter. Fear &gt; heal to full life &gt; shield
---
Stalaaagg, OOOwwOOO
---
The fact it doesn't work is super annoying since they kept going on about how they want an "authentic classic experience" and for good or bad PallyPower is something pretty much synonymous with paladins back then
---
Looking to trade or sell Stalagg names for Herod names!
---
Air, Low, Gem, Pot, Sob, Own
---
Wanting in particular(Herod): Foe, Reverse
---
discord: Foe #0526
---
Amazing album man
---
Did the same. Read every questtext and part of lore while leveling my warri to 60 on a private server.
---
Did it as a preparation and not having to do it again during the coming leveling process. (Goin to do all quests anyways).
---
Thankfully nobody listened to Mark Kern. If he had been actively involved in Classic, we wouldn't have it. What we'd have would be several pitches for WoW Classic TV Shows which never air, a bus that can't be legally put on the road, and a half baked WoW Classic e-sports league that is immediately cancelled.
---
Starting to get semi worried about getting in to my guild's realm since I don't want to sub just for a name...
---
Names are important, bro.
---
If that's what you want, play a druid.  They are miles better at avoiding ganks and can get the drop in others much easier.
---
Based on how the name reservation servers happened, i think the button will just turn push-able.
---
Lucifron and Everlook are the german servers
---
When I go Horde, Duskwood is a zone I miss the most. Of course, horde players can go there but the immersion is not the same as for alliance player. This time I'm going Alliance and can't wait to quest there!
---
A fellow AMD intellectual!
---
PSA : for raid healers that want to top the charts.
---
Spam heal your hunter pets.
---
No there isn't the wall is just out of the picture. Plus mounting above the other one is aesthrtically more pleasing.
---
&gt; If you start meddling with gear and balance, or try to add any form of powercreep(above naxx gear) you meddle with one of the Vanilla's foundations
---
So basically you aren't for patch 1.14 or anything like that. The only thing I'm asking for is to give a taunt or add more specialized gear. That's not changing the nature of vanilla, it's just using the tools vanilla has to allow more options and game play choice.
---
&gt; But yours will be accepted.
---
I think most people would be for gear with more varied stats and a taunt for paladins. It's really not game changing, you can stop being hyperbolic. I'm not advocating for transmog or LFR and I'm not talking about changing a thing before Naxx. This is all, what would they do if they made more patches talk.
---
They are on this pic already.
---
I will indeed. Creeping around, waiting for your friends to disappear to backstab you when nobody is watching. Shadow is my friend and your enemy. You will be living in Fear.
---
Even with 200% res scale?

Ding, Ding, Ding! That's correct, sharding is part of anything and you win a gold star in my book of good boys! 
---
In fact, AMA's is *exactly* the place to ask the developers hard questions. Compared to the softballs they've been throwing themselves in the developer interviews.
---
You confirmed that you weren't discussing in good faith by completely avoiding my question in your response, which is why I chose to ignored your response in mine.
---
Not with a novideo card
---
Yep, but until then we'll have shorter queue times thanks to layering - I'm guessing if the popularity of the game massively surpasses Blizzard's expectations we'll have problems in phase 2 which can only be fixed by adding new servers and offering free transfers. The person I was replying to was saying layering won't affect concurrent player limits, which it really will.
---
I love surprises
---
Not sure if it’s easier to farm a normal one but isn’t  the prestige of the epic warlock mount is worth the price, time and effort?
---
I think the warlock mount is still the better option because it should be roughly half the cost of a normal epic mount.
---
The launch will be the wild wild west and farming up gold could be difficult for a while so saving gold can be important. Also, you don't have to carry the mount in your bag so you gain 1 bag slot :)
---
WotLK was when WoW had peak subscriber count though.
---
Ill take the mana battery
---
Ew imagine being team blue. I mean I personally have a Ryzen 7 which is... still over kill
---
Just keep an eye on this post. A beta is nearly finished for testing and as soon as I've registered some accounts for some addon websites and uploaded the addon there, I will also publish the links to those websites here
---
Drooooooo!!!!
---
More than Classic will ever have, that's for sure. Time to be realistic tbh.
---
I mean it is the same response in r/sex regardless of the topic. It is an easy response.
---
There is literally a giant countdown for classic launch at the bottom of every wow-related page for me
---
And what's the point of mentioning Cata-WoD? Besides fueling the "hahaha retail sucks, Vanilla forever" circlejerk?
---
Most loudmouth Swedes are playing gehennas tho
---
Isnt the lock mount also locked behide a phase?
---
Oh ok, that’s a much better video displaying the problem. Each delayed auto shot on the OP video was faced opposite way of the target for a brief moment.
---
10 year old PC and graphics card from 2010 and runs perfectly fine at 1080p and settings level 4
---
The wep skill is pretty mediocre. Just run with the best ranged weapon you can get your hands on. That being said, check out the guns craftable with engineering. There's a new one every few levels or so, finding an engineer to make one for you to keep your wep damaged maxed out will have a big effect on your leveling speed.
---
I probably will implement something for advertising professions, but in a later version.
---
You know you're suggesting the impossible
---
yeah until 1.9 I believe
---
Please make it playable, just add an option, I just want to use this beautiful model, others can see my "normal" one, but this is too great too pass.
---
@BlizzardClassicTeam - PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN
---
To be honest I have no idea mate. I’m going to gear myself as far as possible in the event there are requirements.
---
As far as a guild goes, I also have none. I’m hoping that the anniversary raid will be pug-friendly, perhaps even with an LFR.
---
If the raid consists of original tactics, I doubt it will be put-friendly at all. OG Lady Vashj or Kael in a pug? Nope nope nope.
---
Fingers crossed we will know more soon my friend.
---
&gt;Thank your friends for skewing the statistics and making this more difficult than it has to be
---
Who gives a damn about "skewing the statistics" in this case? It was one of the anticipated risks of tying the Classic subscription to a main subscription – "tourists", who will just play for a couple hours or won't play at all. 
---
&gt;Nobody cares about their names except themselves.
---
Speak for yourself. It's one thing if you have a name like xxLegolasxx, but it's entirely another when you have a unique nickname that you use everywhere and friends already know you under that name. Given Classic's sense of community and so on, getting to use your name makes sense – especially since people are going to run into you over and over again.
---
&gt;I'm really not trying to be rude
---
Aaaaand you failed.
---
&gt; You can say that about every class/spec, since people can suck at anything.
---
We are not given certainty in this crazy world. We just have to go with what is probable.
---
If you want a DPS spot as an enhance shaman and you're a tauren and your spec is whacked and your name is xXurmomsballzXx then *maybe* you're a really skilled player and will be a huge asset.
---
But *probably* I would be better off inviting the troll mage with a cookie cutter spec.
---
Brah. Just finished mine in December. Put that time into reading the articles, studying, and doing more stats problems then a you’re supposed to. I’m happy I went back to school. It was a completely different experience than undergrad over 10 years ago.
---
It looking much cooler and bit more cheaper than ordinary 100% mounts.
---
How to fuck that place.

Step one: grind to level 12.  
---
Step two: raid that place and kill every single motherfucker inside.
---
10/10 stupid ass comment
---
I am not waiting for TBC. Flying mounts made the world too small and Azeroth just turned into silent leveling zone.
---
I don't mind if Blizzard adds some content from TBC but they need to design it better way.
---
there will be graveyard guilds bro. i've played frostmourne and barth since their inceptions and used to work 10-6 5 nights a week and was able to raid
---
So quick it's imperceptible
---
So amazing and so on point!
---
Option 3 would be interesting, but I don't see that happening with Classic and regular Retail/BfA being under the same subscription. They would either split, or even more likely, increase the monthly fee of a couple of dollars/euros/whatever, similar to what Netflix is doing year after year.
---
If you get carried. for a casual group with 0 planning for builds, no gear (you need stuff like resistance gear, hit gear) and consumables to do it. The dungeon is full of DPS and HEAL checks, casual (guilds) wont have the gear to do it. If you do, you most likely aint casual anymore (as in letting everyone play what ever spec they want and so on).
---
You can clear some wings for sure, but patchwerk, loatheb, 4 HM come to mind as "hard bosses". If you dont have shadow protection potions for everyone (and bandage and healthstone) you just wont survive the fight.
---
No, i only calculated based on the buffs a rogue can get! 
---
I havent previouly delved into resist on Bosses, so my sorce might not be right. Alledgedly, Bosses have 145 Base res with discrepencies for nature (70) and holy. This would mean that after curse of Shadow the res on Shadow and nature is the same. With a 10% dmg increase on Shadow dmg. And periodically you would get the 20% dmg bonus from imp. ShadowBolt, this becomes more reliable the better geared the warlocks have. And if you have a shadowpriest in your raid i guess you get up too 100%? Increased Shadow dmg, but since Shadow priests are scarse and not widely appreciated I wouldnt count on it. 
---
Given 28-30% increased Shadow dmg we get ~22,5 dph without Flask and ~47,5 dph with. 
---
 I believe that, at least on p-servers, poisons are effected by spell crit aswell which, if its the case, would make a point for poisons. If this is not the case, then we get a 18% higher crit chance with all world buffs. This would increase Flask dph to 65. And without to ~30,5 dph. If you always do dmg during imp. SB debuff. If you hit during imp. SB debuff 50% of The time you get ~28,75 dph.
---
If you hit none, you get 26,2 dph. Roughly 0,1 dph more then instant poison. 
---
If, poisons isnt effected by spell power (which i think they are on p-servers), isnt effected by spell crit on worldbuffs(or other external sources of crit, which doesnt effect SB) and you have world buffs. then you get 0,1 to 4,4 dph more from Shadow oil without a Flask. And 28,05 to 38,9 dph.
---
If all of this is True then it is slighly better to use Shadow oil even without a Flask. And if the group has a s.priest the its definetly better. Thank you for making me do some more maths!
---
Personally I don't want new expansions but I wouldn't mind new 60 content.
---
Maybe TBC.
---
&gt;A lot of people preferred Cata over Pandaland.
---
A lot of people also preferred MoP over Cata as it really only had a rough start, plenty of people have great memories of 5.1-5.4 if we don't think too hard of the content drought between 5.4-6.0
---
Idk how skilled he is mechanically but he is extremely knowledgeable
---
With your mindset classic wouldn't have happened
---
Ruh-roh
---
Good 1v1 and kiting. Be aware of dead zone, have a fast attcking pet to annoy casters and keep on kiting.
---
Will this info still be relivant with most people saving names on 3 characters buy most people will only be really playing the one?
---
Guild runs though.
---
Well TIL thanks
---
Yes. Cant get it until phase 2
---
Give me tbc over classic any day.
---
Totally am egirl haha gonna need on everything I hope that's okay?
---
Probably last stage is in Dire Maul.
---
Su bae take my energy
---
I’ll be taking off almost the month of December and a couple/few weeks of January when my daughter is born. Should be some prime (interrupted) wow time. 
---
I just wish they would have released it in June so I had summer time to play before back to teaching.
---
On pservers they didn't have right armor and damage values on mobs, also some mobs were missing abilities so I think it's gonna take more because of that. Idk if it's gonna slow it down to 7-8d, but I would assume it will slow down leveling anyways since leveling guides and farm spots won't necessarily be the same than on private servers.
---
Help me out here. It's free to reserve names in your scenario, right? So there's nothing stopping anyone making a free trial account and reserving three names, right? So what's stopping them running a script to make a thousand free trial accounts and reserve three thousand names?
---
It is highly unlikely Blizzard would release that information. If they did, it still would not be accurate as many people create characters of random classes just to reserve names.
---
You should take a look at the surveys from this subreddit to gauge an idea. Ultimately, you should play what you will enjoy and what you think you'll be good at.
---
You've fallen in to the trap of the Gambler's Fallacy.  If it's a 3% drop chance today then it's also a 3% drop chance in 6 months time.  I have no idea where you get 54.7% from.
---
what ? don't be silly... you mean minmaxers on Reddit are talking out their arse?  impossible!
---
Have you heard the song “The power of the Alliance”? No? Of course you haven’t, because it doesn’t exist.
---
Is that Arathi Basin Phase thumbnail Twin Peaks??
---
Yeah they probably do if it’s convenient, I imagine you need to balance xp rewards for a quest compared to the time it takes to get to the quest giver and how much xp you would get for just grinding. 
---
Admittedly I plan on questing because just grinding mobs for 60 levels sounds horrible. So I’m not 100% my answer is correct.
---
If the game isn't accessible there won't be enough subscribers playing the game which means so servers for people who want to spend all day on it.
---
I get where you're coming from. When I was a teenager I militantly agreed with you. But now I've got responsibilities I would love to relive my childhood with what limited time I've got.
---
Just play what you want. You’ll be needed somewhere no matter what.
---
They also have "beta ends" in the wrong month.
---
I'm not gonna use those addons, but why in the world do you care how other people play their video games? What if they just want to raid or pvp? Plenty of people don't care about leveling.
---
Thanks for sharing that.  Sounds like a fucked up show
---
As for dear Abby, it was a national advice column in newspapers for decades. People would write letters to her "dear Abby" and ask for relationship advice. It wasn't meant to be a silly thing or a joke. It was supposed to be legitimate. If your any age over 35 or so, you know what it is here in the USA. I still think something similar exists, but they changed the name of it. I'm no expert on it, I just remember my mom always reading it as a kid.
---
Aux was similar to tsm3 om private servers, dont know if IT Will Work on classic?
---
Yep. Solid video but clear miss on the 10s / level requirements making the whole trip pointless.
---
Idk I’ll probably be browsing the sub during off time and at work, which I imagine many others will.
---
I started playing during Firelands and hit lvl 85 right as Dragon Soul was released :(
---
Private servers != vanilla
---
yes because it still shows which classes are not chosen at all. if i knew on my server there are only 4% druidsas of right now i might consider rolling one for example
---
I feel it's basically guaranteed that this sub will drop in users a couple weeks after launch.
---
I wanna know too
---
There's a censys addon for beta. Assume it will apply
---
Amazing to see so many people having the same conundrum as me, lol.  Personally I chose to go with druid as main so I can have a geared healer through pve so I can pvp with my friends (main partner is warrior). As for the hunter I made myself content to level as an alt and play mainly pvp. 
---
Also gearing a hunter with 8/8 T1 might actually last you through the whole game due to nice stats and the 15% multishot bonus so it's easier to gear than a healer alt. Not to mention for a druid the 3xR12 set is more crucial to have (run speed) while with hunter you van be content with T1 pve set.
---
&gt;  So what's stopping them running a script to make a thousand free trial accounts and reserve three thousand names?
---
An authenticator
---
I wanted to add a feature where you say something when a player comes closer. But this probably won't be doable. afaik you can get the player distance only for party or raid members. And one would need to know that a player is even there. Then I thought about making it possi le to say something every few minutes, but yeah, this might spam the chat :/
---
They can't. Just because a Server is listed as "full" it doesnt mean you can't create characters on there. Did you read into  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker\_(software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) ?
---
Get a job noob
---
It's a command you type, I can't search it rn but in one of frostradamus latest videos called preparing for classic or something he goes over this command and also one for hiding the griphons next to the actionbar.
---
Your username is DragonAdept and you're stereotyping people with bad names? Come on man.
---
Thanks should be fixed now.
---
Keep an eye on this post. Will add more information and links by editing the post
---
To all haters there are more native spanish speakers than english, but guess ignorant ppl only care about feelings and not about numbers
---
layering is anti ethical to everything that classic stands for and must be removed
---
Tauren shaman all day every day.
---
Oceanic wtf. 
---
When I started playing wow i didn't know shit. Before flagged realms launched. I joined a new realm for a chance at a level playing field. I got lucky and there was 1 australian guild there. 
---
It was a terrible experience. Recruiting was hard. We had to take whatever late night americans we could get. Mostly dumbass stoners. 
---
Like really, wtf does it matter if the na realm is more populated, but none of those people play in your primetime? 
---
No respectiable oceanic guild is going to go on  a NA server.
---
Nope, 31. Used to buy pre-built rigs / laptops til I decided to finally try building one myself.
---
That's fine they don't care that you don't sub. As long as you're not in here comparing about greedy blizzard making you pay 15 to get a name....
---
Need roll along with everyone else to avoid drama
---
He is Gurgthok from Elitist Jerks.... he is about as OG as it gets.
---
On pserver our guild beat mc with 30 people because our guild didn't have enough raiders, so I doubt having even 10 "shitty" spec players in your raid hurts that much(atleast before AQ and NAXX). Much larger issue was players that didn't show up enough, I much rather take a feral druid that shows up to 90% of the raids than a rogue that shows up only 50% of the time.
---
Shadow priests aren’t god xD
---
So in STV, you’re just going to get slapped. Shaman will simply purge you and by that time they have windfury and are just starting to get mean.
---
Rogues will wait until you are fighting then will stun you at an appropriate time and you’re just going to die.
---
Hunters will wait then they will time and aimed shot and guess what? It hurts. Bad enough if it crits and they lucked up and had a blue rifle like Silencer, you’re going to be gone.
---
Imagine taking relationship advice from reddit lul
---
Ohh, just examples, maybe more maybe less. But even 2 layers is bad for the game.
---
I plan to run the classic graphics preset. Had around 500 FPS on stress test and it was glorious smooth perfection.
---
I'm sure Blizzard considers this on their calculations.
---
I shouldn't have post before m'y shower...
---
Well, you can go questing or farming. Don't need to watch paint dry :P
---
It's either spell damage hunter or Arcane Mage so far :)
---
Ok first off all you are saying I need to educate myself as u cite wiki. Second of all there is no such thing as unlimited server space, even if can make a character you can’t login till there’s enough room.
---
so screw over the population by releasing 2 pvp servers (now 3) and then blame them for not giving up all the friends they made and transferring when they sit in a 3 hours queue ?
---
well thats the thing, both are their final variant, but completely different items, items won't get updated, but in this odd case are they swapped out at some point if so when if even at all?
---
Why are you defending a company to charge you for half a months sub on a game you can't even play for 2 weeks? You're literally arguing for the company to fuck you for something that should and used to be free. If you like getting fucked good for you, but don't preach for obviously greedy business practices that are in every way consumer unfriendly.
---
"Useless" may be overkill considering you need to get both of them, and the drop rate is low.

Slipped my mind until ya'll just mentioned that about Dire Maul.... so the devs didn't put the epic mount quest in at all until they release DM?  Was the Pally Mount Quest in the game during original?
---
Legion a whopping success?? The only statement on the success of Legion from Blizzard was "slightly better than Warlords of Draenor".
---
That's not the Gambler's Fallacy. 54.7% is the chance of it dropping at least once in a 6 month window if you are running it every week, but each individual lockout still has a 3% chance. What you're saying is like saying if you flip a coin 10 times your chances of getting at least one heads is only 50% when in reality its much much higher.
---
Can we just all agree not to viper sting my mage?
---
Simple math: 1 - chance for not dropping to the power of tries = probability it will drop at least once for you. Every individual week has a 3% chance but your statistic probability increases
---

6. human female

I am currently developing for retail as I don't have an active account and no access to the classic beta. Need to port it to Classic when its released, so it will work for both
---
Partly because of nostalgia but mostly because it's a great game, even in 2019 ! Probably the best game i ever played tbh. Give it a go, even if it's just one month !
---
The graphics are a bit dated but to be honest, you get past that quite easily and the devs made a great job at making it look much better than back in 2004, with improved lighting/render distance/foilage and so on.
---
Good. You're in the minority. If enough people felt like you they'd bitch and we wouldn't have layering. But here we are. Deal with it and quit your bitchin
---
There are no number to crunsh. So everything is purely speculative at this point.  
---
What you should be focusing your energy on is asking for realm stats post name reservation launch.
---
keep in mind, similar to a big patch release, a lot of people will be re-subbing at the start of each phase.
---
Did you know that if a horde character waits in front of the lakeshire in for 3 minutes, a vendor will pop out and give you a piglet pet?

And that's fine if you don't care about your name, I think theyare referring to the people actually complaining because they couldn't or wouldn't reserve a name because it cost them 8 bucks and now are complaining about blizzard greed
---
The economy will suffer greatly on such mega servers.
---
Sadly Blizzard don’t give a shit!
---
Very strong. Aimed Shot is terrifying especially to undergeared people. Hunters will be super strong on release since nobody will have gear.
---
[4:Lookingforgroup]: Everybody go to Hillsbrad, the biggest war ever seen!!!1!

And then you go to see it empty, and then a friend ask you to invite him because he wants to lvl peacefull

I'd rather play human for bonus spirit for Priest, but Dwarfs in Priest gear look way too good. I'm rolling dwarf for the aesthetic, Fear Ward is just a happy bonus.
---
Fear Ward isn't mandatory anyway, else Horde could never clear content. It's a great bonus is all.

I'll be stuck at a cottage incidentally when classic releases so I won't be able to participate in making the servers crash with repeated login attempts.
---
My IRL preparation is to not give the game more *importance* than I should.
---
We all hyped and all. But c'mon we just about to play a game, not travel to mars.
---
My days would be very similar to now. But instead of wasting time on youtube and refreshing this sub, i'll just be killing mobs in game.
---
Honestly i think a lot of people liked both of these. Cata had amazing pvp, mop also had great pvp,pve, cool new class. The whole vanilla,tbc,wotlk were perfect and everything after(-legion, and with that personally i don't agree because pvp was terrible) was shit is quite annoying.

Glad to hear all went well for you. Lisa will fuel our adventures in Azeroth! What server/faction you playing on?

low effort imo

I know people shit on humans for being bland picks in a fantasy RPG.. but goddamn if their starting area isn’t heaven. And all armour matches your character model properly? Sign me up.

---
It's obvious that he means there'll be a 54.7% chance that you'll see one drop within six months of weekly runs.
---
No idea if the number is correct, but it has nothing to do with gambler's fallacy.
---
MALD
---
I am cureently developing on retail. And I think after porting it to classic it will still work with retail if the addon expansion version is adjusted properly
---
Dwarf Rogue for that sick treasure find my man! Going to roll skinning and tailoring too so that i can always have the treasure find on :D
---
TBC's linear route of quests &gt; dungeon &gt; heroics &gt; raids felt near perfect and satisfying I hope they do progress to TBC. The smaller raids made encounters more challenging than just bring 40 players and zerg and raiding Karazhan is one of the most enjoyable moments in WoW's history.
---
People's memories are skewed by the fact that back in the day, most people didn't gear optimally and thus were prancing around wearing the full gear sets. This time around players will be more knowledgeable about bis item sets, so we'll see more warriors running around in a mish-mash of leather, mail and plate instead of valor which was popular in vanilla, there'll be a lot more paladins in dresses than back in the day, and warlocks will be running around in the Bloodvine set which looks like a random lvl 20 drop instead of using their awesome-looking t1 and t2 sets.
---
It got even worse in TBC with the infamous clown sets most people would be wearing for a long time.
---
IMO the problem is not transmog, it's 
---
1. the ruined server communities which makes you indifferent to who you see in Orgrimmar, and 
---
2. it's that raid gear is available in 4 difficulties with only minor visual differences, which makes mythic gear on retail not as special as raid gear was in vanilla. On occasion when they do make a badass set in retail that stands out (like [this shaman set from Legion](https://www.wowhead.com/transmog-set=2634/fierce-gladiators-ringmail-armor-elite-recolor) or [this warrior set from WoD](https://www.wowhead.com/transmog-set=1897/blackhand-s-battlegear-mythic-recolor), it still stands out visually.
---
As i said im just guessing, based on what i think no one would want to play.
---
Also it’s a reference to WoW devs, which only the hardcorest of people will have understood.
---
I get what you’re saying, and you do have a point but this question has not been explicitly answered by blizz.  Their statement on item progression has been inferred to have answered this, and while you are technically right, I expect that the level 58 version won’t be there.  If it is though I’ll be stopping at 59 to pvp with my primary alt and quite possibly end up just twinking there through the pvp rank grind.
---
there will likely be more servers added launch day and through out phase 1. will that solve the issue probably not hopefull us pessimists will be pleasently proven wrong. The real game changer will be if Blizz announces free unlimited realm transfers for a grace period after layering.That might help that way if you immediatly transfer and a week later its clear your new serv A is dead or imbalanced af you cna transfer back to queue time galor server or to new server B that seems stable.
---
That would make sense if we're talking about runescape, but retail and classic are too mechanically different to think that.
---
I've seen a lot of people commenting with this sentiment and frankly it is a very self-absorbed mindset to have.
---
You get enjoyment from exploring the world, reading the lore, and taking your time? Great! You do you. If someone else prefers to play the game efficiently, min/max for competitive edge, etc. then there is no reason they shouldn't play the game the way they want to so long as it's not breaking the ToS. 
---
How about we all stop telling others how to play the game the 'right' way and just let people do what they want?
---
The "small vocal subset" is over 1/2 a million players, in numerous mediums of communication besides this subreddit, and we are the reason you are even playing Classic at all.
---
There are differences between Classic and 1.12 vanilla, and if an automated group forming addon existed, I'll be glad that this is no longer possible. Things like LFD/LFR are a big reason why there is little sense of community in modern WoW. There's no incentive to form teams and communicate when you can just sit in a capital city pushing a button, without actually talking to anyone.
---
Yes this I true paladins need gear to really shine
---
Think about what you could get for $15.  Most likely it is a pretty good entertainment value for your money.
---
No shame in laptops, makes it more interesting =)
---
They’ll be more servers added before launch, I would almost guarantee it. 
---
Blizzard is actually playing this right. Rather than rolling out 25 server right away and having a bunch of low pop ones which would lead to having to condense down (which would be a nightmare), roll out a small handful and as they start to fill slowly release more. 
---
If Stalagg jumps to full by the end of the weekend, I’d guess we’ll see one or two more new servers released on Monday.
---
You: "Can I Enter please?" 
---
Blizzard from 0:00 to 06:00: "Nope"
---
For who you want to know the guy is Kaaris a french rapper
---
ud warrior is good for tanking.
---
This probably won't happen but I hope they keep the tbc dungeons and the raids but rework them into azeroth instead of outland. Maybe reskin them but keep them functionally the same or something.
---
Hey!
---
I found a few bugs during the stress test, but I dont have access to the bug report forum - any chance you could pass this onto it?
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-list-of-bugs/68117
---
Or give some of them a quick check to see if they were fixed?
---
I don’t even care if you only invite dwarves, I’m only downvoting because of “upsetti spaghetti”.
---
On medium settings you could pull off more than 30 fps.
---
You got me hard.
---
Triage healing is still the only healing style that has interested me, but they moved away from it after Cata and I don't like it anymore.
---
Same here 32GB of ram, dual 1080 founders with a 4.3 8core
---
Full doesnt mean no chars allowed i think
---
Any stats on class chosen before hard launch will be useless.  
---
Since its been confirmed that you can create a new char with the same name immediately upon deleting the previous, most people didnt spend time on customizing and chosing their race/class during name reservation. They'll do it days before launch, if not later.
---
Thanks for your reply buddy!
---
In my case it will be a gut different. Im running my own business and work a lot out of home office. So I’ll be able to play 1-2hrs on the early day and some after wife and child gone to bed. That’s the plan, let’s see if it works out. 
---
All the best and good luck for you and your family too! The dad rogues will hit hard I guess haha!
---
No classic is out in 2 weeks before the payments even come in.
---
Only if you want them to add lootboxes and weapon skins and pay 5 diamonds to unlock the dungeon
---
Dwarf with clothes is kinda wrong, to be fair. They are made to carry around tons of equipment and be sturdy as the rocks they come from.
---
Even a dwarf priest should be have plate.
---
Not where I live. It’s dangerous enough in daylight.
---
Start at midnight when it launches. Play until I gotta go to class in the morning. I'll sleep in the evening before launch.
---
Isnt it also so that you can sell spawns to other locks if you complete it fully yourself? So you can earn quite a bit of gold by completing it!
---
Me and my wife´s boyfriend will play from 27th afternoon CEST.
---
What are the numbers on ret vs other “viable” DPS specs assuming equivalent gear and player skill? I know ret is at the bottom of the charts but how far exactly below the next worst spec is it in terms of real raid performance?
---
RemindMe! One month
---
Will the real SoupaSoka please stand up
---
I put them on crackers with a little squirt of mustard.
---
I wish you a good luck to you too.
---
I hope you'll be lucky and RNG will give you a baby sleeper. Our baby can sleep 7 - 8 hours a night without waking up. 
---
Dad rogues is a decent idea for a guild tbh :]
---
Only blizzard knows what the maximum number of characters per server will be if there even will be one. If you're asking if there will be queues then the safe bet is yes, assume all servers will have queues on launch day.
---
this is the best thing ive ever seen
---
Really my only prep was buying a bluetooth mouse for my android phone, so that i can play in the lonely early hours at my workplace, streamed remote with said mouse and a bluetooth keyboard. No time off, no sprint, will be more a 1,5-2 month span to 60 for me
---
Private server community has proven that it doesn't need expansions to be kept alive
---
Big selection bias, the average player is probably not a redditor
---
No seems fine to me
---
&gt;just how bad these specs
---
Feral does competitive (800-1k in bwl gear) dps, it just requires 3hours a week of gnomeregan farming.
---
Boomkin lags behind a bit, but not due to mana issues. Bosses die fast enough and there are more than enough mana consumables (runes, pots, ndb, oils). As long as your caster group is decent, they'll carry their weight.
---
Maybe it was to be expected... I was still relieved to see it since I considered upgrading for Classic which would've turned out to be unneccesary since I don't play anything besides Classic
---
WoW subscribers plateaued a short while into WotLK, if you wanna use an expansion as the peak of WoW I'd use TBC. 
---
When the new expansion smell and Ulduar had subsided WotLK is at best a stagnation, and in my opinion absolutely a failure. The climax of the WC3 story didn't even raise the sub count, that's insanity to me. :(
---
Not at all.
---
I mean, there was atleast something you could do.. kill more people. So there was some form of participation
---
And why haven't you created any char on any server yet?
---
&gt;Fax
---
I was wondering about that. I was thinking I'd spam rank 1 to freeze them and then go for the big crits. Also, his back peddling kinda bothered me.
---
that's not really a vaild argument. Every game will at some point drop players, you can't grow playerbase for ever.
---
Go to fairbanks
---
You think horses are cooler than tigers?
---
You will do every single quest that provides rep then turn in runecloth till you reach exalted.
---
You have a source for that? I've tried looking and I dont think theve given numbers for anything.
---
What on earth are you talking about? Ofc the majority doesnt want layering? Thats why they said time and time again layering is only staying " a few weeks" (probably more than that) and that it is a necessary evil.
---
Oh yeah you don't need any upgrades.
---
$15 in 2004 adjusted to todays inflation rates, should be $19.94. In the last 15 years WoW's sub cost has essentially dropped by $4.94 thats almost 25%.
---
Which class the highest skill ceiling in PvP? Mage, rogue, hunter, shaman or warrior? I want a class that is difficult to master but rewarding to play at a high skill level.
---
... Why would feral farm for weapons? There were only, like, 3 Feral Attack Power weapons in vanilla, and as far as I remember two of them were from AQ (one from AQ40, one from AQ20). Maybe DM and Naxx each had one, but I don't remember exactly. Before that, the only relevant stat on a weapon for a feral was agility/strength.
---
It wasn't until 3.0 that weapons converted their DPS to FAP for druids.
---
This isn't a big deal while you're leveling, but it means that once you hit 60, you stop scaling. You won't see any DPS increase from better weapons, except the minimal increase in AP due to agility or strength.
---
Questie has had like 8 updates since beta. Dev was in alpha beta fish he's a good dude
---
I'm pretty sure in the last year official lore is no that Sylvanas knew, so... bleh
---
We might be stupid warmongers. And our cities ugly as a sin. And most of our races are... funny looking but we have a badass band and a fucking song about how fucking awesome we are so...
---
This keeps being said everywhere, but layering kept on will destroy the game as soon as World Bosses are out. So it's a really dumb idea.
---
If Blizzard wants to kill all their work with one easy move, yes they will keep it on. They HAVE to turn it off in order to keep the game alive and thus make money from it.
---
Is that even possible?
---
If nothing else you need to do all of the Stormwind quests you can find (at the their appropriate level). 
---
The best way to get exalted is to do the runecloth donation but that is introduced with AQ so...
---
This is funny because I have always played healers and I got my then boyfriend to play so I could have a pocket tank. ;)
---
And I hope YOU‘ll be Lucky and get a Krul Blade!
---
Yeah I was surprised that when I went to turn it on, everything worked, no issues, PBO enabled. CPU in idle is between 30-40°C and with load between 50-60°C. Which appears to be optimal compared to most people with a 3rd gen currently.

I'm sure some random person on reddit has more knowledge to base his decisions on than Blizzard. In fact, I'm sure of it.
---
These two polls from the r/StalaggClassic subreddit show around 52% horde
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/StalaggClassic/comments/cqui9n/new_population_census_that_includes_stalagg/
---
https://www.strawpoll.me/18482060
---
The first one doesn't have specific stats for Stalagg on the results page but looking through the spreadsheet that someone linked in the comments and counting them you can get to around 52%
---
Both discords show more people on alliance though, through the choosing-your-role feature. One shows around 51% alliance with 562 votes, the other shows around 53% alliance with 933 votes.
---
So, hard to say overall since these aren't perfectly reliable and represenative because of to the low amount of stats, but at the very least there doesn't seem to be clear evidence of a big imbalance one way or another.
---
Yep exactly why I'm Herod.
---
Oh bullshit, who upvotes this salty crap lol
---
I experienced it and it was fun. Just because you didn't enjoy something, doesn't mean 100% of population agrees.
---
Thanks for the laugh, that dismount part was brilliant. Cheers!
---
I did not know this...fucky
---
Yeah but you can't order your gear from a website, you have to find a group and all go to the dungeon together.
---
&gt; I was afraid of just reading a document and not enjoying the game. 
---
This is why I'm going in blind, no reason to speedrun the fun out of it
---
This is about warlock epic mount that releases phase 2 same time as honor system so why rush to out right buy it for something that also doesnt release until the same phase?
---
Personally I would like to see more horizontal progression added to the Classic, like making "meme-specs" more viable, adding new / removed / unused zones (Emerald Dream, Dragon Isles) and items (Cleansing the Ashbringer), classes and races (High Elves &amp; Goblins) etc. that would maintain the \*spirit\* of vanilla.
---
Imagine adding class mounts (I think retail has it,it's pretty neat idea ;) but for rest of the classes, why only Palas and Warlocks has cool epic mount. But make quest line for that as long and as demanding as theirs.
---
Heck, a demon hunter was featured in Vanilla promotional art, and for other class, death knights players were suppose to sacrifice existing character in order to make them Death Knights.

VALOR BITCH
---
Whatever the best ranged weapon you can get your hands on is what you should use. Theres actually not that many great blues as you level for Hunter. The only ones that really spring to mind are Venomstrike and Galganns Fireblaster. Usually youll be using whatever random green you can find
---
So the issue with ret is its inconsistency. It hits stupid hard, but the proc rate isn’t reliable. Another issue is, most guilds would rather gear their actual dps classes for progression rather than gear a ret paladin.
---
In my experience most ret paladins didn’t start doing mc and bwl runs until it was on “farm”
---
It seems to close after inputting the classic folder and running it again asks for it again.
---
He's finally being useful in 8.2, but dang it's taken a long time.
---
There is a big difference between a normal pvp hardcore guild and a guild that is actively trying to make the other faction quit by any means possible.
---
Will take some sleep, probably 8 hours after release will start playing with my buds @ lan party :)
---
Looking forward to Classic Season 4

Still running an old i7 3770k, 16GB RAM and a GTX 970. Longest I've ever had the same PC, it still gets the job done.
---
7,5 year old PC here and indeed runs good on an older machine though mine was pretty beastly when I bought it. 
---
 GTX 560 Ti 1 gig RAM GPU, i7 CPU, 16 gig RAM, SSD HD. Ran with settings 5  and max draw distance for objects, had FPS all the time at 60( default setting had it capped at 60, used that since my screen is 60 Hz anyways). Could probably run a little better settings as well but don't care about graphics much so was happy with that, figured I would have some leeway in case I joined a zone with a million players.
---
 Could add I tried setting 10 and got 30 FPS but was a zone I was alone in. Still thought it was pretty good performance for my specs.
---
Go hammy with it lol
---
If there’s a point you’re trying to make I don’t see it. I anchor my raid frames to center left of my character at all times because it gives me the health and mana bars and all debuffs of my party at all times which is invaluable. Especially in Classic when knowing your teams mana situation is extremely important.
---
Trying to heal your group like its Overwatch is objectively bad.
---
Have a dude I knew q4 years ago in my core group. Still feels weird but awesome
---
How about you get your normal Tiger at 40, and then work on getting an Epic horse at 60 ?
---
Why worry about mount type that early.
---
If you’re after warrior pvp without tons of healers, check out laintime. Some Asian dude, seriously wrecked in world pvp.

Look at my post history.
---
wtf does population even mean? Number of characters? Or number of people connected and staying in the character select screen because they can't enter world yet?
---
If it's number of characters then it's pretty meaningless - most of retail players went in to reserve names even if they won't play seriously, especially not on release.
---
Yeah but let's be honest, "LFM WC" and "I'll go" don't really count as the most social constructs.
---
On top of that it does not show fake castings/spell knock back on the enemies casts. So if they start casting a sheep and stop and not start another spell it will still show it casting on the bar.
---
I love it too. It makes my peepee tingling a bit

&gt; L O fucking L, a skilled feral druid can kill any class in the game.
---
That goes for all classes lol...
---
It might be phase 1 because the game is running 1.12 from launch. Just like MC might drop the gear that was later added to it in phase 1.
---
Warlock or mage pally is nasty
---
Sounds strange, do you have a data folder? If there is can you paste the contents of the managed.json file?
---
Compared to the thousands of dollars youd have to spend in a free to play game to get all of the content.. I think 15 bucks is pretty freaking good.
---
Right. I never cleared Naxx because when TBC was announced, my guild lost it's drive to finish. We got 80% through and most stopped.
---
This time, while I'm sure Blizz will have something lined up after Classic (if it stays popular), there will most likely be more time before that announcement happens. Well, hopefully more time.
---
I figured you did not want to stay lvl 40 for half a year.
---
I see it protected your viginity valiantly those few years.
---
You sure those macros works in classic ? They did change quite a bit of the stuff that can make decisions for you. Like IF ... THEN type of stuff.
---
Is this PvP or PvE server?
---
If PvP, do the alliance a favor and go Dwarf Pally.
---
For leveling, Paladins synergize better with classes that don't rely on mana, or ones that don't go OOM. Just keep on going without drinking. Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, etc.
---
My stick figure dick is 6 inches most girls dont like it that wide
---
Hell yeah. Maybe im the cynical one now haha

is this counting unique accounts or characters?

I guess you missed the huge posts that said "you don't have to RP on RP-PVP realms."
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cq9vuh/rp_server_misconceptions/
---
It kinda makes me upset to see. Yes, I know, people have played on RP-PVP servers before and have not RP'd at all. But there is a subset of gamers that RP-PVP is for. Using it as overflow because there weren't enough PvP realms isn't the right thing to do if you have no intention of actually RP'ing.
---
People can do what they want, but if you're not going to RP then why are so many advocating to play on a server specifically designated as being for RP. They have one server, we have 6.

---
Tipsout violates the world with his toxic verbal diarrhea.
---
It was fun back in the days when "class raids" of Stratholme, for example, was a common occurence. (ie, one character of each class)
---
I'll wipe a Swifty raid of any number with 10 people.
---
No, but also being honest, that's about 100% more than retail has in terms of getting groups together.
---
There is no definition of hardcore.
---
I think you need some perception on how things work you filthy horde.  There is nothing you can do I hope you do underestimate holy paladins you will be in for a rude shock. You can’t stun lock us and our armour makes you hit like a Druid. 
---
Regardless I look forward to the challenge just know my friends never disappear.
---
I kinda hate questie even though the dev was in my beta guild and chill af
---
I rolled on Shazzrah, because someone flipped a coin here.
---
Nah. Before classic was announced I always said i was happy to pay a little bit of my soul for the vanilla experience again. 
---
At least this way we don't get no shitty micro-transactions.
---
Basically everything is synergistic with pally tbh, the buffs are so good.
---
If you want a fair fight roll on a PvE server and /duel people. 
---
World PvP on PvP servers is inherently unfair. Level difference. Consumable difference. Number difference. Somebody having a mob attacking them difference. It's not a controlled, fair PvP environment where the "better" player wins.
---
Normies gonna norm.
---
I'll see it before I believe it. 
---
In my experience Feral tanking is nice in dungeons but in raids it's just never good.
---
Dying in stv on beta as alliance og my stars
---
Yes, but that's because anything is more than nothing.
---
 Its Mark Kern, not Mike Kern. Also there was a replacement private server after the Elys shut down which copied across all the character data and used the same data for the world as Nost/Elys. Name was "L i g h t ' s   H o p e "(spaces due to automoderator) and are going to be running up until the launch of classic WoW where they will shut down the server.
---
Other than that, nice job! Pretty cool to see it all cleanly laid out on one timeline.
---
Seems like creating a data folder made it work!
---
Karazhan and Ulduar. The best two raids I've ever been in. Can't even pinpoint what it is about Karazhan specifically, I just absolutely loved the place.
---

All I need is ten good men and some climbing spikes
---
Agreed with this. Flying destroyed world immersion. TBC did have some good content but breaking up the world and people was very detrimental to the game and all future content. If they did do expansions on classic, they would have to avoid such mechanics.
---
There were definitely expansion packs.
---
&gt;After less than 2 years blizzard throws in the towel with on Cataclysm and releases Mists of Pandaria
---
Wtf you mean the expac ended? Just like every expansion ends? Is BC a failure because it ended?

If he goes rogue you can have him spec and optimize for a backstab spam. You will delete mobs fairly fast and you have a homie that can delete someone who attempts to gank you guys.
---
It SHOULD make in itself, without more info it almost sounds like it doesn't have the necessary priviliges to create folders and what not
---
Its just things like fast loot auto grey sell making your map smaller etc
---
Playing on stable servers violates the spirit of vanilla. It's not vanilla, it's classic, it's going to be different.
---
What’s the capacity for the servers?
---
The raids can be done as 35 man upto like naxx and even naxx if your good enough so let those damn ret paladins and balance druids in
---
Furor is not as required as you might think for leveling. 
---
At least not right away.
---
Even in vanilla human priests are better than dwarves for all fights where fearwards arent needed (most bosses actually), since priests benefit greatly from willpower.
---
You can always fear and run, and by the time you get far enough away your bubble you'll be off the debuff CD and can cast bubble again, stopping the snares or stuns
---
Wow that’s cool wonder where this came from
---
Not possible at 40. Possible at 60.
---
 Best approach would be to switch to get to Elwynn as quickly as possible so you don't get rep penalty for low level quests. Then you do Elwynn-&gt;Westfall-&gt;Redridge-Duskwood, after that all SW quests you can find. 
---
 At 60 you will have to turn in runecloth even though you have done so many SW quests. How much runecloth is hard to say. I would prepare for having to turn in 200 stacks which is 200x50 so 10k rep extra. Might be possible to turn in less but better to be have low expectations to not get disappointing. The stacks you should just buy in the AH instead of trying to farm them all yourself. 
---
One stack runecloth cost like 2g if I remember private server economy. So all in all 400g more expensive mount and a much more restricted leveling experience where you are tied to a leveling quest route and have to juggle not overleveling to get rep penalties.
---
Druids will absolutely be the lowest played thing on your server. You don't need Blizzard to tell you that, just like you already know there will be more warriors than anything.
---
I mean hey now, we don't know their from a civilized country. Could be Muricans'. You've never seen a more wretched hive of goblins and guns.
---
If you wanna have fun you will like most things
---
We can't even get the mods we used in classic. Classic mods ruined the game more than current mods are going to. Remember when heal bot would auto select spell, rank and target all you had to do was click in one spot on screen whole raid or decursive would create a list for you to just click on to dispel the raid. 
---
Classic had addons that were more disruptive then most of the addons around. The only addon I am worried about is the LFG addon as this can really effect the community feeling of wow. We had questing addons back in Vanilla just not at the launch of it.
---
I have a gaming mouse but only 1-6 are really useable. I use shift or ctrl to treble my options after that it’s getting clicked on.
---
Of cource they're viable. You can do great dps
---
The thing is that it requires way more effort, planning and grinding
---
**Things to Do (every day if you can - leading to release)**

Yep, can we please ask Blizzard this question on the AMA and hope they dont dodge it
---
I also do not want to rely on Aspect of the Cheetah or a shitty 60% mount for months at level 60
---
!RemindMe 13 days

Fuuuuuuck. Someone ask specifically about rhokdelar and hinterlands quests please I’ll be at work.

are you fkn out of your mind....serious question??????

 it reminds me of die hard where he walks up and down in harlem with a banner against afro americans....
---
Game’s not even out yet and already you want to change it. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!?
---
But seriously... MAYBE at the conclusion of Phase 6, these sorts of ideas could be considered.
---
Addons have been a part of WoW forever. Back in vanilla there even was an addon called Guild Event Manager which was basically a calendar where you could organize raids (with or without guild).
---
Ahh shit you’re right.
---
Youll need turnins bud
---
I TAKE CANDLE!!!
---
That sounds amazing! I'm sure you guys are gonna have a blast :P
---
Don't be upset when they are better than you though :D Those young peeps are just ridiculous on the Computer!

Have you already decided what you want to Play? :)
---
Tipsout aside, I won't be using any addons like that.
---
Nope:
---
* LFG
---
* Quest helper
---
* Twitch/Discord integration
---
* Raid-trivializing (DBM, Decursive, healbot etc), if possible
---
It's also 2 3% chances each week right? This confused me as well but I might just be dumb.

---
Is there a version of clean icons for classic?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449
---
Yup. So if you're planning on playing Ret you're best bet is to assume you'll find a guild willing to carry you.
---
I work full time and study from home part time. My semester ends on the 22nd, just before launch! What great timing. My next semester starts on the 26th just befor- wait a second :-/
---
Good.
---
Runecloth for rep is phase 3. Not applicable.
---
I'm not your father but I'm disowning you.
---
I would even pay 20€.
---
Not the same devs anymore, no changes
---
Gotta admit I never understood the desire to play games in ones native language.
---
PvP, of course... PvE sounds blasphemous.
---
And I can’t do dwarf, the running animation kills me inside. If I could fight dwarfs in game, I would.
---
Thanks for the insight!
---
yeah, as a German this name has very bad connotation
---
Not just the world bosses, people can farm resources (mining, herbing) by jumping around different layers, it will create unfair advantages.
---
Atiesh.
---
I'm looking a good reference of not to miss quest rewards while leveling.  I tried all the usual suspects and they tend to only focus on weapons before lvl 60.
---
The only two I really remember since I got them in the stress test are the defias chain that ends with killing vancleef that gives an awesome chest piece.  And some decent gloves in redridge for killing dragon welps.
---
My father's dead so I'm incapable of disappointing him :D
---
Holy shit guys, we've only just got classic which people (including me) have been begging for, for ages. Lets wait and see how popular this is first and see if it's been worth Blizzard's time before we start looking towards TBC and WotLK.
---
In the Beta, I only reached 6,469/21,000 revered with Stormwind by level 40 (even as a human), despite completing nearly every single Stormwind quest as well as most Alliance quests that gave spillover Stormwind rep. You’d have to supplement with Runecloth turn-ins at level 50 to finally achieve exalted.
---
You can read through my entire quest completionist route here:
---
https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm
---
&gt;I will land in a new zone and barely get to know it before leveling up enough to be sent to next one
---
The world scales to you now. You can do any non-starter Azeroth zone all the way to 60. You can do any bc or wrath zone all the way to 80. You can do any cata/mop zone all the way to 90. Then it's wod &gt; legion &gt; bfa zones.
---
I think Mage would work quite nicely. mage won't have to worry about being hit and focus on being a total glass cannon, you can both buff each other nicely, have heals when you need them and the Mage can provide water.
---
I think they complement each other really enough if only for the buffs. Pally can also just auto-attack while Mage drink.
---
I think Priest is better paired with Warlock or Warrior. My first experience leveling with a friend was Priest and Lock and we leveled insanely quick. Just spamming Dots, Life tap and Heal
---
What the fuck? I’m the opposite I wish I could roll night elf mage
---
Don't forget to farm that reputation with your Wife/GF, so you can no life a little bit after launch.
---
It would feel like sadness for the gui.
---
But you would have to update the configs
---
I still so vividly remember getting Emberstone Staff, my first blue ever. I spent an hour linking it to anyone that would give me the time of day

Wholesome af
---
Whenever I see people say, "I'm going to play what I want," it's usually followed up with, "I'm a casual and I'm not going to min-max."
---
Some of these specs you literally need to min-max to be anywhere on the dps tables. It's classic and raids aren't that hard, but when you're doing 1/3rd of the dps of everyone else you need to reevaluate your choices.
---
I'm someone that's planning to take niche specs into my raids. I really don't mind taking a small hit in clear times to see some people shine in these niche specs. However, they'll only be allowed into the guild and have a raid spot if they can tell me what issues their class has and how they've adapted to overcome that. You don't have to be a try hard to Google "feral druid classic wow dps" and read the first couple links.
---
Questie has been working well, and I've personally paired it with MonkeyQuest so I get the map of quests and the flexiblity of a different quest frame.
---
Pff that was just Faction balance being terrible for us.
---
I tried the Menethil --&gt; Dun Morogh drowning shortcut in the stress test, but it's been fixed. The area in question is now Wetlands territory.
---
Prepare to corpserun through crocodiles and blackrock orcs if you want your night elf in other starting areas.

Go play surviv.io while you wait in queue, buddy!

Any advice on how to train my 2yo to farm herbs? /s

Maybe if you’re playing very minimally. For the amount of entertainment you get with a wow sub I’ve always considered it a huge bargain.

I do! Drop me a line on my email? [felix.avenier@gmail.com](mailto:felix.avenier@gmail.com)  
---
I do full illustrations as well, or chibis. I can send plenty of examples if you let me know the details in email &lt;3
---
i actually think showing realm time faction ratio would help reduce faction imbalance because people would instantly go for the faction that drops to 49 or 48% before it goes even less.
---
Early on it should be okay, BUT once there's enough 60s people will be making alts and there are some very salty people out there whose sole purpose is to WPVP in STV
---
As a tip for aspiring hunters I'd personally recommend leaving your pet on passive and binding the following:
---
Pet attack: mouse wheel scroll forward
---
Pet return: mouse wheel scroll backwards
---
Pet stay: mouse scroll wheel click
---
Using these, especially while leveling, really helps to make pet movement synonymous with your own and always felt smooth and easy for me.
---
Yup, my entire guild, including myself, left at Cata.
---
Fairbanks masterrace
---
That's funny but so true I guess!
---
It's all a numbers game. You can go prot or ret but the number of guilds that will take you grows smaller and small while if you're holy it's a matter of them having a spot open. Also, classic is based on 1.12 so you get your improved buffs for 15 mins instead of 5 so you don't have to only buff.
---
Not to sound like a douche, but if $15 a month is too much for you than clearly you have bigger issues to worry about than playing a video game.

Swifty is still relevant?
---
He's probably talking about intimidation, not growl.
---
good advice would be "earn money"
---
bruh just don't go out to lunch for 1 or 2 days, and there's your subscription.
---
Only slightly worse here. 3700x, 32gb RAM, 2080 Super
---
I remember pouring over the manual before the head start and really being excited to be a totem swinging Tauren (like in Warcraft 3!) sprinting around.
---
And could do none of that.  😭😭😭
---
i5-7400, 16gb RAM, 1060 6gb
---
What about casting furbolg rod? Looks like healing from priest/pala and as one of these classes you can intercept mages Counterspell with it
---
Same here. See you in STV!! ⚔️
---
There is no definition of hardcore. It's different for every person. Look it up in the dictionary and there's nothing in there about consumables and world buffs.
---
Without need/greed It would be at least 5 times harder to get any given BOP item because you cannot be given priority when it drops and you cannot trade for it.
---
As for BOE items people can arrange to give the items out based on priorities and you can also make trade. 
---
Therefore, the game would function totally fine without need/greed if everything was BOE.
---
Thus need/greed was probably intended for BOP items.
---
What’s your reasoning?
---
Damn, stop complaining.  
---
Blizzard took over 2 years to redesign classic wow and still isn't even asking for money just for the normal sub which can also be used for BFA.
---
Normally a new game MMO you have to pay for the game and then pay for the subscription.
---
Yeah but I can't help but feel they really dragged their heels over classic. "You don't want it" kind of arrogance but when (hopefully) classic is successful they'll have no choice but to bash out TBC servers.
---
I wouldn't worry buddy.
---
I kinda agree but man, who really cares lol
---
The cd is 30 seconds untalented... If you don't get dazed, you'll be fine...  Or you could play a druid and always get away without risk.
---
Section B. article ii: You may use the Platform for your personal and non-commercial entertainment purposes only, unless specifically allowed under the terms of this Agreement.
---
Streamers directly violate the TOS for their personal profit.  That they pay their $12 a month sub is completely irrelevant.
---
For dungeons any setup were you are tank+healer so easy to find the other 3 spots. If focus is questing anything works but warlock seems like it would be extremely strong and fun.
---
Start then early! haha
---
This has quickly become a "Who has the biggest dick" contest
---
BREAK YOURSELF UPON MY BODY!
---
Pluss it doesnt matter in the long run.
---
And if youre playing classic youll be in it for the long run.
---
Same build here, still runs everything really well. And with me only playing Classic in the future, there is really no need for upgrading.
---
Barrens chat isn't toxic, you just need 400 iq to understand the hidden deep philosophies.
---
Wtf
---
Nobody I know is paying to reserve names. How the fuck are we even going to be able to play ffs
---
this
---
I can't tell you how excited I am to level in Southshore and Alterac Mountains again.
---
You get a free month of classic whenever you subscribe to retail!
---
How do you remove layering after phase 1 with 12 full layers tho..
---
Seems about enough.
---
yeah, I'm really scared for launchday lucifron
---
Dont forget good old ASHKANDI
---
I played from day 1 of retail vanilla through mid part of Cata and believe TBC to be the best version of WoW (Vanilla a very close second).  Looking forward to vanilla, but definitely hoping for TBC in a couple of years.  We’ll see where it goes.
---
'Sup man
---
Probably habit from having to answer the same questions 500 times a day.
---
Me and my friends will make them disappear. 
---
I am sure it will be you who is shocked if you expect wearing plate armour as a holy paladin. 
---
Every paladin Ill meet will represent Thrasky in my eyes and I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the rogue, when I take vengeance on them.
---
You are given two choices
---
A) Stay on your server, stick with layering and perpetual P1 
---
B) Transfer with your guild to a server where layering is completely disabled for all future  
---
Which one would you take? Because if you're amongst the 10% that would take option A then the problem still solves itself since the amount of people that would rather stick with layering isn't gonna be enough to make layering an issue.
---
Nope, cheap entertainment.
---
With tonnes of hoops though having to farm Gnomeregan for that on-use mace, which means you need to not only farm one, but several per raid night.
---
Same here, and there's almost 350 people signed up for the guild before they game has even launched (Shazzrah).
---
Not really. Pally power was an addon that allowed paladins to setup who was doing what buff and would allow you to setup yours. So you could give wisdom to casts/might melee/hunters and another paladin could do kings and so forth. In raids when you have 4-5 paladins giving different buffs it makes it very easy to setup. It also allowed you to setup individual buffs so you could give warriors salvation and set tanks to might and just click it 3 times to buff all warriors with greater salv then rebuff might on the two tanks.
---
It probably could be made again but I haven't looked into the classic lua restrictions at all. I probably will when I find some addon I wish existed that I can't find for classic.
---
I'd say &gt;80% of my Pserver Guild did not.
---
I appreciate your effort. Maybe i will use it when i level up my 2nd or 3rd character. For now though, its all about getting off of that stressfull fast pace run the current wow has become.
---
What the fuck its been 2 yeard alrdy?
---
My nephew was 2 when I grabbed an alcoholic beverage he was reaching for. He had a tantrum because I wouldn’t let him have what he thought was fruit juice. He’s 4 now and still remembers me as the guy who won’t let him have juice.
---
Well, wow is a bond which holds a lifetime i guess
---
Secretly for the spirit
---
Wut.
---
Fortunately it's easy to forget 5.4-6.0 when you consider 6.2-7.0!
---
How is your 3700x performing?
---
Honestly, get bows for leveling just so you don't have to listen to the gun sounds. Though crafted bullets with higher dose will be easier to get.
---
I have just done this and deployed it to a QA server.
---
Not hard. If you abstract your code away from infrastructure from the start its not hard. All that needed to be done was update database drivers as I was not going to turn back the database version
---
People think software is something that cant be rebuilt years later.
---
Thanks, thanks, thanks. Another one with Sulfuron Hammer?
---
Last I checked you have to manually download for classic as the app only shows retail WoW addons. But the app can update mods that are already installed.
---
It's for sure number of accounts with a character on that realm. You can only be logged into 1 character at a time what would be the point in counting all 8 of your characters.
---
Dont forget:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB93u7KJkU8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB93u7KJkU8)
---
&gt; My go-to is minced meat beef/steak (not sure what you call it in english tbh).
---
Mince.
---
The ol round the back Hwhack
---
dont like it, dont use it. who cares?
---
im gonna use as many as i can to get the upper advantage over people
---
Except now we get queues AND layering. Awesome!
---
Which is the best pet in game?
---
I always just skip it esp on fresh. so many zones to grind and quest stv isn't needed.
---
Do we know what the faction balance is like on the servers? 
---
I'm most likely going PvE Alliance, so I don't want to roll on Mirage Raceway if it's mostly a horde server.
---
so you found this sub, but couldn't do a quick google search?
---
[no](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow)
---
/1 some alliance are grouping up to feed me hks, whisper for invite.
---
Not sure what all the hate for BRD is, that is literally my favorite dungeon in all of wow. Large layout, danger everywhere, plenty of quest, random stuff all over.
---
I'm alliance but I had a good laugh out of this, well played.
---
Well, I am playing a shaman
---
Can you not just google this? I don’t get it.
---
It’s 15$ a month. So there is a sub...
---
I was leading up to it, but you wouldn't humor me. 
---
If you think that people asking you questions which you are unable to answer proves your point i don't really know how to help you.
---
Haha YOU NEED A HEALER?? My Hunter just learned runecloth bandages
---
You need to pay monthly to play Classic. The subscription fee allows you to play retail WoW or Classic WoW. 
---
Since you referenced euros, its 12,99€ per month.
---
It’s going to cost the same as it always has.  “There’s no way” you’re not going to pay monthly.  Sorry to burst your bubble but things cost money to run.
---
You're not getting me. It doesnt matter on which Server you roll. Lets say Blizzards EU Node has a Capacity of 500k People playing at the same time, it doesnt matter if there are 400k on Shazz and 20k on all other Servers or if its equally spread throught, every Character is on the same Server.
---
I can just ask u guys haha
---
Is it still possible to create a char on a full server? Because my friend has not reserved anything yet and we want to play together
---
Faith in humanity restored.
---
I’ve never spent a dime on loot boxes. That said I don’t begrudge anyone who does.  The beauty of a free market economy is you have the autonomous choice of where you spend your money.  Some pay thousands to go to the tropics for a week on vacation every year, others spend 10s of thousands on sports cars, and others still spend money on games like WoW.  The point is they’re spending the money they worked for on a product they feel is worth their hard earned money.  The only people who complain about that practice are the people who are under or entirely unemployed.  If $180 a year for a subscription is too much for you personally the bigger issue in your life is your employment status.
---
&gt;"omg you are never going to get raid invites as a night elf priest!"
---
This seems to be a common misconception, pretty much no one is going to deny a raid spot to a nelf/human priest, as long as he is somewhat decent. 
---
But that applies for dwarves too. As long as the guild has one dwarf priest, it's fine.
---
I don't mind if somoene isn't a meta spec, I'm just trying to let people know that they might not get invited to raids if they choose that. Some guilds don't care, others do.
---
I'm super excited tbh. Should make my wpvp experience better.
---
Stv....as a noob warrior... good times.
---
Thanks for all the great vids Mel
---
Same here and we're 300ppl minimum. Going Gehennas. 
---
All servers will be filled to the brim at launch since a majority of the playerbase arent people who sub and/or create characters to save a name pre-launch.
---
&gt;I'm probably going to play on EU if the ping isn't too bad to work on some foreign language skills
---
Are you rolling on one of the specific non-English servers or just gonna hang out with the non-English communities on an English EU server?
---
I have a huge need to learn German for my job, but I'm changing my mind daily between "I will roll on DE and then I can justify playing a lot more and my language skills will skyrocket, it's gonna be great" and "I've been waiting for this since Cata and rolling on DE now will just kill my fun, everyone will hate me for writing like a semi-communicative troglodyte"
---
I believe there was a pandaren or two in the game aswell
---
we should not have come here
---
Because not everyone wants to pay money just to reserve a name?
---
Personally, I love everything about the horde. I'll be playing classic as alliance this time around, but if it were up to me I would have still gone horde. The Alliance is still fun, but from a lore/story standpoint it's not exactly black and white but alliance are still sort of the bad guy in my books.
---
If Barrens chat isn't incredibly stupid and toxic, then there is no point at all in having chat in the Barrens. I remember having incredible conversations in that area while leveling in between the Chuck Norris jokes (which I unironically love) and whatever else would pop up lol. I can't wait!!
---
That and people unaware of the name reservations in general
---
Why cant they?
---
You could rebind the camera to the same binds with a modifier such as ctrl + mousewheel scroll for camera.
---
Protest with your wallet, that's what I say. 
---
I can afford it, it's the principle.
---
I did the short cut in the most recent stress test (early Friday AM) and made it successfully.
---
What sells me on Horde is an event that happened at the end of Legion. I was playing Ally and Horde at the time and the same week a raid came in to kill the faction leaders. The alliance players shrugged it off and said "Just let them kill him and leave" while on the Horde side the chat was full of support for defending Org. 
---
I guess what I'm saying is that Horde players are passionate while Alliance players are ruthless. Neither of these are right or wrong but I enjoy the passion.
---
it's a number that you shouldn't worry about.
---
You're either an orc with free high resistance or you're not.
---
Do you think Blizzard has done better analysis of their potential long term player base, or do you think keyboard warriors on reddit have more accurate predictions? 
---
Classic could be dead in 6 months or thriving, hard to tell at this point but blizzard has made it clear they would much rather open new servers as needed, than close servers down several months after launch.
---
If you “think” it’s too expensive just don’t play so we won’t have your jobless whiny ass playing with us 🤷‍♂️
---
You are very welcome!
---
Are you me? Downclocked to 4,6, because the heat was too much now in the summer.
---
Netflix kind of is a random movie box in its own way.
---
I played on the stress test as a hunter back when everyone was complaining about hunter bugs and I personally didn’t notice any of them. Not because they weren’t there, but because I was personally unaware that they were bugs. So, I think it highly depends on the player.
---
With better graphic it would be great, too bad now female troll are just blue human
---
/r/TheyDidTheMathButNotReally
---
Yes, but they said they want to remove that. So that can add an extra 2k/server maybe, unless they want to fork at phase 2 (and if they try to fork in classic, people will bring out the guillotines). They aren't planning on keeping extra high pop servers on the long term.
---
You're an absolute legend my dude, keep up the awesome content!
---
Principal of what? You’ve always needed a sub to play, so it’ll never change. Also, the fact that one sub now pays for both vanilla and retail is pretty enticing for some people, considering they’re two different games.
---
Undead &gt;&gt; Orc &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every other race.
---
Same for me \^\^
---
It was funny until the realization that all of the vendors, bankers, flight master and auction masters were gone set in. If something is funny at first doesn't mean it stays funny.
---
It was a wild west moment and something I think a lot of people rightfully look back on fondly, but it was a pretty big inconvenience.
---
Ahhh, the good 'ol incel's bridge
---
Not as much for me, I'm in a place now where I quit eating unhealthy, stopped drinking sodas, started working out, dropped my depression medication, I'm free and healthy now, if I can drop other addictions, if I get too addicted I think I can drop this one too.
---
Man, you guys are gonna make me blush. Thanks so much!
---
Not sure about books. But play atleast warcraft3 campaigns if you haven’t
---
Adding a discrete, dotted straight line to your map player arrow so you can more easily see where you will arrive with a straight forward auto run
---
I did miss that, yes. That post saddens me.
---
I'm not planning on going RP but I hope those that do and don't RP get corpse camped back to normal servers.
---
I think they're considering it as part of their major population drop-off. A lot of people here think they're underestimating the staying power of the game, and I think in some regards they are, but it's definitely not for everyone!
---
I didn't think laser chickens were in classic
---
It works on beta currently and worked on every stress test.  You did it wrong.
---
Maybe I worded it wrong, but that's what I meant. It's still a massive server of people, but to help not have 10,000 people in Goldshire, they introduced layering. Essentially, instancing of the zone so that your experience isn't ruined by having too many people in that area.
---
What do you mean with the most toxic community? Have you been on the server discord. Its not the same shitshow that for example shazzrahs discord have.
---
Hah oh didnt get much gaming Done this summer but i use watercool so it stays really low.
---
Going from DM to Men worked in stress test
---
Great guides, very clear voice, recommended.
---
You know it will happen...don't you?
---
And there is nothing we can do about it! muahahahahaha!
---
We will see, no one really knows what layering will be like on launch.
---
Thanks for the info, edited. I just looked in Google.
---
It's great, the light weight + torque makes for some crazy fun in 2nd and 3rd gear. Definitely try one if you get the opportunity! 
---
I have the Night Fluo scheme, there's a pic of it on my reddit actually.
---
So adding stuff from expansions is different than expansion? And here you go again, just like everyone else.... you ask for better balanced gear and classes. You are not special, do you grasp what im trying to say? Instead of arguing with me, go around seriously. There are countless threads that ask for their favorite class to be brought up the charts. Answer me this, please, try to be different from all the other sheeps. What if everyone asks for their class to be buffed and blizzard to add better grear? What then, do they ignore them or open the floodgates?
---
Where does this gear come from? New dungeons, raids, powercreep? You want ToC/IC 2? T'was a good time, 4 dungeons made 80% of the game pointless.
---
Oh and if you ask me, i dont want anything but classic, not even TBC or anything that can split the community.
---
Teach them to fish
---
Casual reminder the “required specs” page still lists specs from like 2002 which I find hilarious.
---
Thank you! I played through Warcraft 3 a while ago so it’s been a minute. Might have to run the campaign again before launch.
---
1. Night Elves.
---
2. Taurens (only downside is they are Horde).
---
3. Gnomes. Love everything about them too. 
---
4. Undead.
---
5. Human.
---
6. Orcs
---
7. Dwarfs
---
8. Trolls
---
Not surprising. The game sells itself. /grats to the subreddit
---
I got killed in vanilla in there.
---
Warrior is hoping you have a pocket healer. Shaman is hoping you don’t get focused down. Hunter is hoping it’s not a class that can abuse your dead zone. Rogue is hoping for someone without the right trinkets equipped to break your stuns and kite you.
---
If you’re a god tier mage you can abuse resets to no end in 1v1, I feel like a top tier mage is unparalleled in pvp
---
You’ll be using hurricane instead!
---
i9-9900k, 32GB 3200Mhz CL16, RTX2070 super OC, M.2 SSD 🙄

Oh my goodness this sounds delicious!! Wish I had some of this to eat right now! Thanks so much for sharing. :D
---
I haven't read any lore books, but here is the lore section of the original game manual that came in the box with the CDs: 
---
**I. History**
---
A brief overview of the Third War...and the founding
---
of the New Age.
---
Though the history of Azeroth is rife
---
with tales of war and unending struggle, the
---
invasion of the demonic Burning Legion stands
---
as the most destructive conflict ever known.
---
The Legion meticulously planned its return
---
to the mortal world over the course of
---
many long centuries.
---
Four years ago, their grand design came to
---
fruition at last
---
**The Scourge of Lordaeron**
---
A generation past, the lords of the Burning Legion attempted to
---
destroy the kingdoms of Azeroth by loosing the orcish Horde
---
upon the world. Ultimately their plans were undone when the
---
corrupt Horde buckled in upon itself due to incessant infighting.
---
Undaunted, the demons surmised that a new and more unified
---
force was necessary to sew chaos and disorder across the
---
mortal world.
---
To this end, the demon Kil’jaeden created the Scourge – a vast
---
army of undead warriors, united under the singular will of the
---
dread Lich King. With the Lich King as his puppet, Kil’jaeden was
---
able to rally the Scourge and prepare it to annihilate human
---
civilization for all time. The Lich King and his mortal servant,
---
Kel’Thuzad, planned to spread a terrible plague across the human
---
lands, thereby swelling the ranks of the Scourge with newly risen
---
undead warriors. Once their preparations were made, Kel’Thuzad
---
and his Cult of the Damned struck the first blow against civilization
---
by releasing the plague upon northern Lordaeron.
---
Uther the Lightbringer, one of humanity’s most famous heroes,
---
investigated the infected regions in the hope of finding a way
---
to halt the plague's progress. Despite his efforts, the plague
---
continued to spread and threatened to tear the Alliance apart. As
---
the ranks of the undead swept across Lordaeron, the king’s only
---
son, Prince Arthas, took up the fight against the Scourge. Arthas
---
succeeded in killing Kel’Thuzad, but even so, the Lich King's forces
---
grew with every soldier that fell in battle. Frustrated and stymied
---
by the seemingly unstoppable enemy, Arthas took increasingly
---
extreme steps to hold back their advance. Finally Uther warned
---
Arthas that he was losing his hold on humanity.
---
Arthas’ fear and resolve proved to be his ultimate undoing. He tracked the
---
plague’s source to the arctic land of Northrend, intending to end its threat
---
forever. Instead, he fell into the Lich King’s trap when he took up the cursed
---
runeblade Frostmourne in the belief that he could use it to save his people.
---
The sword did indeed grant him unfathomable power; however, it also stole
---
his soul. His spirit lost and his sanity shattered, Arthas was transformed into
---
the greatest of the Lich King’s death knights. He willingly led the Scourge
---
against his own kingdom, slew Uther in battle, and murdered his own father,
---
King Terenas. Caught off guard by Arthas' unthinkable crimes, Lordaeron
---
was crushed under the Lich King's iron heel.
---
**Sunwell – The Fall of Quel’Thalas**
---
Though he had defeated all of the people he now saw as his enemies, Arthaswas haunted by the ghost of Kel’Thuzad. The ghost told Arthas to bring Kel’Thuzad’s remains to the mystical Sunwell, which was hidden within the high elves’ kingdom of Quel’Thalas.
---
Accordingly, Arthas and his Scourge invaded Quel’Thalas and laid siege to the high elves’ crumbling defenses. Sylvanas Windrunner, the Ranger-General of Silvermoon, put up a valiant fight, but Arthas eventually wiped out the high elf army and won through to the Sunwell. In a cruel gesture of
---
his dominance, he even raised Sylvanas’ defeated body as a banshee, cursed
---
to mindless undeath in the service of Quel'Thalas' conqueror.
---
In due course, Arthas submerged Kel’Thuzad’s remains within the holy
---
waters of the Sunwell. Although the potent waters of Eternity were fouled by
---
this act, Kel’Thuzad was reborn as a sorcerous lich. Resurrected as a far more
---
powerful being, Kel’Thuzad explained the next phase of the Lich King’s plan.
---
By the time Arthas and his army of the dead turned southward, not one
---
living elf remained in Quel’Thalas. The glorious homeland of the high elves,
---
which had stood for more than nine thousand years, was no more.
---
**Archimonde’s Return
---
and the Flight to Kalimdor**
---
Once Kel’Thuzad was whole again, Arthas led the Scourge south
---
towards Dalaran. There the lich would obtain the powerful
---
spellbook of Medivh and use it to summon the demonlord
---
Archimonde back into the world. From that point on, Archimonde
---
himself would lead the Legion’s final invasion. Not even the
---
wizards of the Kirin Tor could stop Arthas' forces from stealing
---
Medivh’s book, and soon Kel’Thuzad had all he needed to
---
perform the summoning. After ten thousand years, the mighty
---
demon Archimonde and his host emerged once again upon the
---
world of Azeroth. Yet Dalaran was not their final destination.
---
Under orders from Kil’jaeden himself, Archimonde and his
---
demons followed the undead Scourge to Kalimdor, bent on
---
destroying Nordrassil, the World Tree.
---
In the midst of this chaos, a mysterious prophet appeared to lend
---
the mortal races guidance. This prophet proved to be none other
---
than Medivh, the last Guardian, miraculously returned from the
---
Beyond to redeem himself for past sins. Medivh told the Horde
---
and the Alliance of the dangers they faced and urged them to
---
band together. Jaded by generations of hate, the orcs and humans
---
would have none of it. Medivh was forced to deal with each race
---
separately, using prophecy and trickery to guide them across the
---
sea to the legendary land of Kalimdor. The orcs and humans soon
---
encountered the long-hidden civilization of the night elves.
---
Led by their young warchief, Thrall, the orcs suffered a series of setbacks on
---
their journey across Kalimdor’s Barrens. Though they befriended Cairne
---
Bloodhoof and his mighty tauren warriors, many orcs began to succumb to
---
the demonic bloodlust that had plagued them for years. Even Thrall’s greatest
---
lieutenant, Grom Hellscream, betrayed the Horde by giving himself over to
---
his baser instincts. As Hellscream and his loyal Warsong warriors stalked
---
through the forests of Ashenvale, they clashed with the night elf Sentinels.
---
Certain that the orcs had returned to their warlike ways, the demigod
---
Cenarius came forth to drive Hellscream and his orcs back. Even so,
---
Hellscream and his orcs, overcome with supernatural hate and rage,
---
managed to kill Cenarius and corrupt the ancient forestlands. Hellscream
---
later redeemed his honor, however, by helping Thrall defeat Mannoroth, the
---
demonlord who first cursed the orcs with his bloodline of hate and rage. With
---
Mannoroth’s death, the orcs’ blood-curse was finally brought to an end.
---
While Medivh worked to convince the orcs and humans of the need for an
---
alliance, the night elves fought the Legion in their own secretive ways.
---
Tyrande Whisperwind, the immortal High Priestess of the night elf Sentinels,
---
battled desperately to keep the demons and undead from overrunning the
---
forests of Ashenvale. Tyrande realized that she needed help, so she set out
---
to awaken the night elf druids from their thousand-year slumber. Calling
---
upon her love, Malfurion Stormrage, Tyrande succeeded in galvanizing her
---
defenses and driving the Legion back. With Malfurion’s help, nature herself
---
rose up to vanquish the Legion and its Scourge allies.
---
While searching for more of the hibernating druids, Malfurion found the barrow
---
prison in which he had chained his brother, Illidan. Convinced that Illidan
---
would aid them against the Legion, Tyrande set him free. Though Illidan did
---
aid them for a time, he eventually fled to pursue his own interests.
---
The night elves braced themselves and fought the Burning Legion with grim
---
determination. The Legion had never ceased in its desire for the Well of
---
Eternity, long the source of strength for the World Tree and itself the heart
---
of the night elf kingdom. If their planned assault on the Tree was successful,
---
the demons would literally tear the world apart.
---
:) thank you
---
while yes my rolling need has the same outcome as ninja's, all for the gold!... however, my intent isn't to opportunistically steal peoples gold. I just wish everyone else would roll need.  Everyone needs gold and the other player is welcome to offer gold to buy the item. (probably at a discount) 
---
like I said... this is only in pugs. The majority of runs will be with friends/guildies, where I'd gladly pass on loot.
---
When? I noticed it in the latest stress test. Was there a new patch on beta today or something?
---
C'mon man, just 5 hours a day on your week off and 1 hour a night when you go back to work.
---
Because it will disrupt the game design. It will mess with the in-game economy and leveling process.
---
Its mostly from a Nordic perspective. The nords who stay on shazz are more cool easy going. Been talking to many guilds from nor and swe. All chillout folk. From my experience.
---
Just roll an undead rogue and have him live near the graveyard and roleplay that you're a zombie just like all the others and kill all alliance.
---
I mean, what would you consider Cata and WoD?
---
Cata was such a bad xpac that they scrapped it towards the end and pushed out the next xpac. WoD was such a bad xpac that they scrapped it and pushed out the next xpac.
---
Nah, I'm all for the alliance. Ironforge &gt; Any other city in the game (Undercity is OK).  
---
But I was forced to switch because my RL friends are rolling horde and I wanted to play with them. :(   
---
I mean, I played both factions quite extensively, with horde being the most played in my days of serious raiding. Female Blood Elves are my jam. This time around I roll as female orc because I'm a min/max moron. :((((
---
I enjoyed leveling my nostalrius paladin like this. (2/2 guardian's favor over 4% armor though)
---
There’s always gonna be a place for people who play suboptimal stuff, though 40 people is a lot of people. Fights aren’t going to be that close in terms of damage this time around. Outside of the speedclear groups, this mindset absolutely needs to be abolished. Even then, I can’t imagine dps is going to be so tight this time around.
---
To a woman. 
---
And “you got to see the counselor” to the guy.
---
Darkshire legitimately terrified me when I started playing WoW(launch of BC), being too scared to walk on the path and run into patches, but the woods were also filled with monsters so there was no easy choice.
---
I know it's heresy but I loved the dungeon and raid, too. It was a nice change from the big raids and the story was neat.
---
If you are planning to level fast then it won't matter anyways since you can't get the warlock mount before phase 2. that being said it's still cheaper to get the warlock mount.
---
It is quite expensive. You can often get it for less if you buy for a few months at a time. I spend around 10 bucks a month on it.

Hi, /u/Apxa

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cr5exz/remember_when_nostalrius_streams_on_twitch_was/). 
---
The Horde side looks like Gwar just took the stage.
---
To sum it all up he says:
---
1. Layering will be in game because they are very addicted to mega server tech at this point.
---
2. They recognize this ruins the classic experience and is not classic at all. They will use it regardless.
---
3. They plan to remove it when the populations die down by the end of phase 1. However, he doesn't mention if they will keep layering if populations explodes.
---
He is a lawyer he is leaving himself a lawyers escape to keep layering if he decides they need it. This is why everyone is hating on layering. It is obvious what will happen here.
---
All jokes aside, they are. They're M+/Mythic focused raiders, or hardcore RPers who have spent years developing their characters. Classic isn't gonna suck 'em in. They like their selection of mounts and transmog too much.
---
Holy crap, this is huge. Thank you kind stranger. Will read on my lunch break!
---
I'm gonna kill everyone I see including other druids.  I have some specific tools for killing resto druids as a druid cuz it's a fucking challenge.
---
Thank you so much for that response , I'm sorry about your aunt , I'm sure she's smiling from wherever she is happy she could help in some way. Life has been pretty nerve racking and all. I have this constant self doubt that I'm gonna make it. I'm not the best in math, I'm just trying to keep it moving.
---
Makes no sense? Your Warcraft lore is lacking. There is an entire clan of orc “rogues”, the shattered hand, lead by Bladefist.
---
Is it fair to deny a person who is just as focused on progressing and brings all the consumables every raid loot or a raid post, just because the spec they want to play causes bosses to live a few seconds longer?
---
A ret pala or a moonkin or whatever still contributes to the raid the dps you lose from bringing a few of them won't cause any wipes. You are better off with a dedicated "meme spec" player than an average or below average meta spec player at all fronts. Better dps, better preparation, better player skill.
---
Thanks, lovely person! One upvote is perfect! o/
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/
---
If they show up and cleanse/swing nightfall and the boss goes down then I don't care about loot distribution. That is something that is discussed individually by different guilds to suit their own progression model. 
---
Give unto me your viable but not optimal. For the meme spec was OOM and I gave of them my mage bread.
---
All of my friends did, everyone whos selling names did. A LOT of people did.
---
We have to invent technology that doesnt exist yet.
---
\-AOC
---
Didn't they talk about limiting that kind of action in macros/addons to limit the possibility of creating GroupFiner in classic?
---
I switched to horde on my last toon before I quit, in tbc. I think the alliance has better quest lines, but I fell in love with Kalimdor so i wont sit here and say alliance zones are better. Duskwood is amazing, though. The communities are not the same, Horde guys were helpful, groups were more mature, in wpvp the horde actually come help you. The alliance always felt like "the priest mom and warrior dad playing with 8yo timmy on druid" faction. But I love both sides for different reasons.
---
Thanks. I just what to get a general idea of my ping.
---
While it's true that the horde (originally just the orcs from draenor) invaded Azeroth, they did so under 2 influences. 1: Their homeworld was literally falling apart, and 2: They were under the influence of Gul'dan and the demon blood. And while they did some horrible stuff during the great wars, not everyone felt this way, in comes thrall and his merry band of boys. Even while under the influence of demon blood, their sole goal was survival. Saving the Tauren people from genocide by Centaur, being the only people to initially believe medivh about the coming of the burning legion (everyone including jaina wrote him off), and ultimately defeating Mannoroth. The horde may not have been native to Azeroth, but they've done the most to save it. While the alliance are generally racist shouting at them about the color of their skin among other things.
---
"better dps", laughing my ass off, loot distribution should be easy, you stuff your main tank prior to the others, then you take your most reliable and loyal player with the biggest dps and you stuff him too, should always aim for 2 criteria while organizing loots, reliability and effectiveness, if you got a great warrior that can pull amazing dps but you have doubts he wouldn't mind looking for an other guild, then give him a bit of stuff, if you got a loyal ret Pala that always come in time and will never look away from your guild but can't do decent dps, give him a bit of stuff too he deserve it, but if you got someone who can do both, ho Boi, shove all the loot you can up his ass this is the horse you'd better bet on
---
As long as a server isn't shown as "locked" you can create a character. Also keep in mind that we are in a phase of hype and excitement. The first few days will surely be a bottleneck experiance (queues etc.) but this shouldn't prevent you and your friend to create a character and play.
---
I'm so glad it's being noticed by others! This was driving me crazy during the last stress test. I kind of assumed it was my fault due to lack of experience or something.
---
Just wait 1 day after launch and see where they are, easy af. I will do that, though I don't care where they are or who they are, 40 ppl guild, haha, who gives a fuck in the end, only on reddit I guess.
---
This video is already a part of a short Classic VS BfA Series, over on my youtube channel, with 2 other videos. But I am planning to make more for sure :)

1. Gnomes

2. Night Elves

3. Undead
---
4. Troll
---
5. Tauren
---
6. Dwarf &amp; Orc
---
7. / 8.  Human - why the F you play a Human in a FANTASY GAME?
---
Im planning to level as an Orc Lock, but it only goes 8 steps ahead and then it ends. Is there something wrong on my end or are you guys implementing more steps once its actually live?
---
What do you mean? If I want to go into a subreddit dedicated to one thing but talk about a completely different thing I should be able to do so. Freedom of speech man, and they can't get mad either because it's freedom of speech.

Orc Lock FOR THE HORDE!  
---
Orc Lock because Orc Lock, but also Lock because the ability summon people was OP in Vanilla
---
Well are you rolling Ali or horde? I played both the whole time too; my friends and myself decided for horde
---
It's all jokes and memes but I'm legit not going to invite random hunters to my groups. The sad thing is that in alot of cases they actually do need to roll on most stuff. Doesn't matter if it's cloth with int, good dps melee weapon if it has some crit or hit chance, leather, mail, it's all game for our huntard friends.
---
No it doesn't. This was stated multiple times. You have a main layer and it will remain your main layer until removed or you join a new guild as you and your guild mates will always share the same layer.
---
Which means that unless you have lots of people on friend list who are with guild on different layers you will never see people from other layers until it is removed. And then poof you barely know anyonr because 20k people just got dumped in on the same realm after all their layers were removed.
---
Blizzard has always been good at sugercoating shit and selling it. They are like the apple of video games.
---
You say server pride. But you are playing on 1/10th of the server with the other 9/10 completly invisible to you till layering is removed. 
---
Even worse if blizzard's nightmare actually come true and people stay around and classic retain most its population. Because then what?
---
You can also easily reach top 5 dps at Nefarian as a ret even in a "hardcore" guild with geared (&amp; potted) people, since the addwaves are all undead mobs. Just spamming consecration + holy wrath + stratholme holy water (a lot of us farmed those for nef) into those addwaves pushed me to rank 4/5 in dps at nef, without that I would have ended up at around 8-9.
---
Consecration is also the main reason why rets can often be the top dps in 5-10mans if they can manage their mana or want to bother with pots. Because most of the times you fight 2-3+ mobs in 5 mans and no other class is capable of doing consistent aoe dmg without interrupting their single target rotation. If your consecration ticks for \~50dmg, then thats already 150 additional dps against 3 mobs.
---
It's the same game world, they are aiming to provide the same experience. That implies a comparable server population.
---
Yes you can cram a lot of people on a server, like pservers did (10k+ easily). They aren't going to do that.
---
Sure, tips is way better unless what you’re interested in is learning how to play the game better.
---
REEEEEEEE
---
Yes. Wall mounted monitor.
---
Melderon, you’re one of the best shaman theorycrafters and guide-maker whose opinion I value. Can’t wait to watch this one and take notes. 
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Parts of BRD are soloable by rogues. Presumably druids too.
---
From what I remember it was always high to low, never from dead to other servers. They tried to get people to join the dead ones, not leave them.
---
Sounds awesome! I wish I had all of my old guild back, sadly a lot of them grew old
---
Likely yes, because I’m terrible at PvP. But I’ll happily corpse walk again and again and again because Red is Dead, and I stick by my team. 
---
Also, I’m a typical white knight fantasy nerd. 
---
Human warrior with approved fantasy name like “Ivanhoe.”
---
Ah so competition at any level is pointless unless you're at the top. Got it. Sorry special Olympics gold winners, your achievements are trash. You definitely don't understand what's going on here.
---
Don't comment and drive kids.
---
Don't worry too much though. Just like all other releases player count drops significantly after 1-2 weeks. Yes Classic is probably great and all, but Players still will drop. Thinking of The Division (which was a disappointment for everyone looking for endgame) lost 96% of players in 3 months. Classic will probably be far below that, but due to Blizzard being very careful at the moment I wouldn't expect long queues after 2 weeks anymore.
---
Oh thank goodness. I needed something to pull me back from playing hunter.
---
Kaaris !
---
This forgets to mention the many pronlems of BFA. The randomized gear, the long azarite farming treadmill, professions are useless, daily quests take a step back from legion, ect, ect.
---
Fair enough, thanks for the reasonable answer!
---
This always confused me.
---
Wouldn't 1/5 in Improved Corruption have the most value, you'd have to wait 100ms until you can cast something else? Also isn't having 4/5 Suppression great in world pvp, since most ganks come from players higher level than you?
---
Or am I missing something? With 1/5, you start casting, 1500ms gcd starts, you cast for 1600ms, if you go 2/5, you have to wait 300ms before casting anything?
---
My first and main char is a druid and I strictly adhered to this rule. But I'm not leveling a druid this time, so....
---
All of them are not that good compared to top players today but back then holy moly those guys were bonkers. I’m still watching vurtne 60-66 once a month
---
AITA for locking my family in the basement because they wouldn’t shut up while I play WoW?
---
This reminds me of those teenage life / sex / relationship advice posters.

I was spouting the same thing not too long ago. Some kind soul was willing to provide a youtube link and set me straight. /sit reckoning does not work in Classic as it did on private servers. /sit -&gt; /stand reckoning does work in Classic as it did in Vanilla.
---
But your numbers are made up so you have no idea if there will be any layers.
---
It's not even about the hardware, or if the server can handle the stress of more players.. The issue is overpopulation. The economy will be different, mobs more heavily contested etc.
---
Horde without belf no thanks.
---
Now that's humor.
---
I'm here for my guild, the others are at work so they sent me to collect our free months. You can just give them to me, I'll forward them. Our roster is around 50 people, but we can just add up to 60 to make it easier.
---
Yeah I took them form the most up to date videos and forums I could find. I guess some aren't going to work. Do you have any ideas for replacing the old syntex to make them work? I am sure quite a few people would be interested in getting ones confirmed to work for classic.
---
Yes. You can solo up to like lvl 50-55 dungeons.
---
Laintime was extremely good at the time, had a lot of intelligent tricks up his sleeve.  
---
Drakedog started out okay, but became very comfortable with his mechanics and thanks to warlocks being a powerhouse later on, really shot up in lethality.  
---
Can't really place who the rogue is alas..  
---
Vurtne pretty much pioneered the mage gameplay that people would emulate for years to come, and he was extremely clever with his engineering usage.  
---
Skillwise from the three I know of, I'd probably place them as Vurtne &gt; Laintime &gt; Drakedog.  
---
If you compare them to current pserver players, I think Vurtne and Laintime would still be able to hang if you somehow ported them to present day.
---
I've said it a few times, there are a good number of people who will also be waiting for a post launch F R E S H. Either rerolling from one of these servers or just waiting 2 weeks-2 months before starting to play. So Blizzard waiting till after launch to open a new realm or two makes sense considering those people as well.
---
This got my nostalgic for the books that came with games. I read the fuck out of the Warcraft II manual when I was in grade school.
---
You could also level to 60 auto attacking with a worn dagger.  Play however you like.  If you want to be remotely efficient, this probably isn't it.
---
Full doesn't mean you can't create characters. Only if a server is set on "locked" you aren't able to.
---
In before a bunch of warlocks summoning a Doomguard in the middle of your healers.
---
Why 4 boxes and not 5?
---
I’ve never heard of one, but that’s not a bad idea!
---
Man, you guys know how to make a Shaman smile. Truly, thank you for the kind words
---
Number of characters on a server has no relation to server population. What matters is the number of accounts with a character on the server. Whether you have 1 or 10, the population impact is the same.
---
Bro, you can make water. I think you could spare a couple buffs!
---
Really? But there are so many abilities. 
---
I said shaman.
---
I love paladins but my entire group of friends always goes Horde so I’ve reluctantly done the same for 15 years. Besides some alts on other servers here and there.
---
You can make this one interactive too. All you need is a magnifying glass.
---
Sticks and stones won't break my bones.
---
But mean words will break my heart :&lt;
---
why the hell to you want to play a Gnome in a fantasy game? The Humans are Humans of Azeroth and you could argue it is a deeper way to immerse yourself and be surrounded by the fantasy as oppose to being the fantasy?
---
Yeah, don't do that to yourself ;)
---
From the testing i've seen people do on the paladin discord, the spelladin build can do up to 1.6 with full tier 2(phase 3) bis, full consumes and full word buffs.
---
They are viable, but they require double the time and money investment to get to that point.
---
 a timeline with built in opinion. I thought they were supposed to be unbiased for the sake of history
---
You can always create a character on a full server. Full doesn't equal locked.
---
Yet it's a far better estimate than anything else.
---
Why does reddit get so defensive over poll results?
---
You could try SmartBuff in the interim? I bind it to the mousewheel for buffing myself/party members out of combat but you can configure it in other ways too.
---
It's not that Ret DPS is bad, it's just that it's terrible.
---
9900k @5.1   2080ti @2.0 core
---
get about 300fps @ 1440p (165hz monitor, would prob be best to use g-sync for this game), everything maxed out, some areas 300-500 depending on what's on the screen/how your camera is facing
---
At 300 Skill, vs a 315 Defence target, you have an 8% miss chance and the first +1% hit from gear is ignored. You would need +9% hit from gear to have 0% miss chance.
---
At 305 Skill, vs a 315 Defence target, you have a 6% miss chance. You would need +6% hit from gear to have 0% miss chance.
---
More detail:
---
If the mob has \*more\* defence than your (skill + 10), your base miss chance is 5% + (0.2% x difference). Additionally, the first point of +hit from gear will not count.
---
If the mob has less or the same defence than your (skill + 10), your base miss chance is 5% + (0.1% x difference).
---
So for Bosses, that weapon skill is a built-in +2% hit and all your hit gear counts.
---
For world mobs lower than (your current weapon skill / 5) + 3, like when you're levelling, it's a 0.5% hit bonus.
---
We get it, your specs are overkill for the game, you can stop with the hardware config comments now. /thread
---
Agree.
---
But I still accepts few weeks of layering as a usefull comprimise.
---
LF: Jahmon on EU Mirage Raceway will trade or pay
---
So why not just merge?
---
Druids have so many moves to keep track of. I wouldn’t recommend it to beginners.
---
Hahahahaha
---
This deserves gold
---
Not to mention Ankh saves SO much time in a wipe.
---
What does a ret or balance bring to the raid that makes them privileged to essentially get carried by all the other raid members who have to work harder to make up for the meme specs lack of damage? 
---
I don't know how hard vanilla raids are but if the bosses can be downed by every dps doing equal damage to the meme specs damage then it's fine by me to bring those in.
---
No but layers per server is also a thing to factor. They easily have the resources to spin as many layers when necessary. This is a complete non issue. 
---
I honestly don't get this subreddit hardon for way too many servers to go live before it even launches so that the experience is really the same. Only with more servers we risk dead servers in a few months...
---
True it would match the global cool down but it still requires you to stand still to cast it. This way it allows you to apply it on the run, which you will be doing a lot of leveling.
---
But that will fuck up thr BoE greeding?
---
Leveling : Warlock
---
Blessing of wisdom him and his imp. He gives you fire shield with his imp. You play reflect damage tank and healer. He spams AoE and lifetaps.
---
Endgame: Warrior
---
No explanation needed it's a fucking warrior.
---
That's not the icon for hurricane.
---
Well, that’s up to them and it’s kind of the point. The only ones this is really targeted at I think is the people trying to speak for everyone else. Nothing wrong with a guild that wants optimal stuff, just like there’s nothing wrong with a guild that doesn’t.
---
Blood fury is the orc dps cd. Orc has higher dps potential as a result.

If you're looking for more videos, OP, [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX34tk-noBVC4WVC9qQGyMw) always had my favorite lore videos. Don't know if he has playlists set up by expansions, so you might have to pick and choose.
---
Hunter is one of the classes with the least gear-scaleing, so they're a great pick for the time-limited as always.
---
I'd still be sure to run MC at you're earliest convenience as having Tranq shot off the first boss is a requirement to get into other raid-PUGs down the line. Once phase 2 is out I'd also recommend raiding MC for the Epic bow quest, as it's a good upgrade and relatively easy to get if you know your stuff.
---
Neat.
---
Yeah, that's why corporations that once were monopolous fail.
---
I believe them when they say that multiple instances of a world is incompatible with their phase 2 content. I believe them when they say that come phase 2, layering needs to be gone and will be gone.
---
The elephant in the room and the question not really answered in detail is what you bring up: *What if player numbers don't go down as expected?* Blizzard hasn't given a definitive answer to this so far.
---
*However*, in the same interview, they also say that if they know the answer to something they usually communicate it. (They bring this up as a contrast between classic where they most often do know the answer and BfA where oftentimes, they don't). 
---
*What if* they don't know how they will handle such a scenario, should it arise? What if they've so far said "Let's hope we never have to cross that bridge, let's see how the numbers evolve before discussing solutions for a problem that doesn't even exist yet and that we think will never arise, anyway."
---
There are several proposed options discussed here and elsewhere again and again: enticing players to switch servers, forcing server splits, delaying phase 2 and, yes, extending layering into phase 2. They likely don't know themselves. They have promised publicly again and again not to extend layers into phase 2 so currently, I see no reason to assume that of all the options they have, they will go with the least popular one.
---
And there's literally *tons* of options. They can make layers more and more "sticky", tying you ever more to a layer that holds your guild and as much of your friend-list as possible. They could then split servers along the lines of those sticky layers. They could offer free playtime to players willing to go to a different server.
---
Let's shit on them when they are fucking up. Let's not shit on them for not having or communicating a detailed and perfect solution for a hypothetical problem that we don't know will even arise.
---
It’s 12,99 a month if you’re smart. Which is a fucking bargain! If you can stomach grinding a token in retail every month, it’s free.
---
Hilarious. :)
---
pff blizzard will release 1 new server the same day as release and say look its your fault for choosing full &amp; high pop servers. look there is a low pop one u had a choice.
---
My point is that "I've seen some bad ones" is not a valid talking point when it comes to theorycraft.
---
At 80% downvote rate I draw the conclusion that either pretty much everyone disagrees with me or people here have a strange obsession with the colour blue.
---
I'm hiding the post, but I'll be back with an I told you so next week. Numbers don't lie.
---
BTW I wasn't saying that it will be a huge technical issue for Blizz. Just that they are a bit out of touch.
---
xD
---
I honestly doubt there will be migration. Queues are going to happen no matter what you do, just deal with it. Server tech is a lot better now days than it was before, I don't think queues are going to be as big of an issue than people are making them out to be.
---
some mighty neckbeard ego emanating from this thought
---
What English even is?
---
Obviously most people will quit their jobs for classic and therefore don’t have enough money for 5 subs
---
Edit: /s
---
You are here?

I got the one from Geddon early on as I was main tank in my guild, just needed to half from garr. I collected the 100 arc bars and the other bits all sat in the guild bank ready for me when I needed them. Months went by, I ran MC every week, we cleared BWL, most of AQ40 and were working our way through Naxx. Every week I ran MC with my main when the restoration of the guild were dragging friends along and taking alts, I must have done this for 3 years, we had MC full clear in an  hour in the end. But still not half from Garr. In BC we never went back to MC. It wasnt till Catta when I was clearing it solo for some extra gold that I saw it drop. I still had the first half in the bank and finally gathered all the matts again to comple the quest for my Thunder Fury. But now I can go back, and I bloody well hope this time I can get both bits. I cant once again only see one half in 150 runs.
---
I was online in SWTOR yesterday, and whole Chat talked about Classic :D
---
I don't see why it matters tbh, nobody would even know if you're running them.
---
&gt;There was literally no other way to do it. Only 1% or less of the population was geared up in Naxx gear, so if the TBC content was only accessible to people in Naxx gear it would have been completely commercially non-viable.
---
They released two years worth of patches without making prior content meaningless, why would you say it would be impossible to do that a little bigger for an expansion?
---
They also could have released catch up mechanics (like they did several times in Vanilla's cycle that were less severe than what they did to lvl 61 itemization) instead of raising the level cap at all.
---
You just managed to find a way somehow
---
This thread must be a huge ego boost for OP
---
Depends what people play the game for, I guess.
---
A lot of the things people like and play retail for either aren't in or are badly done in vanilla. Tons of people hate leveling, so they probably won't stick around just to experience a more tedious version of it. 
---
Some people play the game because they love playing certain specs. A guy who loves and only wants to play boomkin won't want to stick around if he's going to be forced to play something else or be left out of content.
---
11pm on the 26th, is when I'll start queuing, when I start playing on the other hand is out of my control :D as soon as I can!
---
My second language :P Fixed it!

This means literally nothing lol

Awesome! Thank you

we'll see

I’m not reading all that but if you’re horde and on Herod you can layer hop this gigantic night elf hunter dong. Doubleoelf gonna be laying pipe in Azeroth.

You have to put stacks of wands into your quiver or else you can't use your priest throw ability.

boomkin was more wrath prior to that they were oomkin

According to this Blue Post, this was fixed. I have not seen anyone deny or confirm it on the recent re-opened closed beta. I did not have beta access.

I'm from EU and never really had ping above 100 (not even before WoW was released)

Vurtne is mediocre now.
---
I wouldn't say free they're Amazon cards so you can buy anything with them.  Also doesn't change you're buying half as much time with 1 sub.
---
Yeah meant 5 box, going to run warlock hunter mage priest pally it warlock, and might drop hunter for double mage
---
Replied.
---
There’s as much World PvP as you can stomach.
---
See that's where the problem lie :D
---
Different countries have different economies, while the price is still $15 for everyone, so I can sort-of get his point as that's the reason why I haven't played retail until I got a job myself (no way my parents would spend that much on a game).  
---
For example, in the US where the average is $27.16/hour, it seems like $15 for a one month subscription is basically nothing, in Eastern Europe where the average is $3.60/hour, it seems like a lot bigger of an investment, given that $15 could also buy 3 decent meals.  
---
Or, speaking percentages  
---
In the US, $15 is 0.36% of your monthly income  
---
In eastern EU, $15 is 2.6% of your monthly income ( 7 times higher of an investment )  
---
These calculations are made entirely with the first google result, so take them with more than a grain of salt. Point is, it can get pretty expensive if you live in poorer countries.
---
Do you have a source for that or something? I’ve only ever seen the tweet by ion which basically says the opposite
---
I remember them being called both when it was added back in the day.
---
Shhhhhhh. I wasn't gonna use them for anything else. Iss free. &lt;/3
---
Haha has to do it ;P
---
Me like piggies. Zug zug.
---
Neat. Thanks.
---
That seems a lot easier than I would have assumed.  
---
It's basically:  
---
1) Get lucky on bindings drop  
---
2) Buy everything else off the AH  
---
Yeah, the bindings are a low % drop and the other mats will probably cost a pretty penny. But considering how much people go on and on about how nobody should expect to get this weapon ever, I was expecting a much more involved process.
---
respectfully, people can continue playing a game they're not actually having fun with because they're addicted, don't want to feel like they wasted money, or have sunk cost fallacy and hope that the game becomes enjoyable for them at some time in the future. retail is fun for some people, and a lot of people still play it, but human behavior is more complicated than what you're saying.
---
"if you got a great warrior that can pull amazing dps but you have doubts he wouldn't mind looking for an other guild, then give him a bit of stuff"
---
That's where hardcore and non-hardcore disagree in my opinion.
---
If I doubt he wouldn't mind looking for another guild, to the point he would leave if we don't give him somehow more loot than average, then I'll gladly let him go. And he's certainly not an IG friend anyway.
---
I think most of you just forgot what it's like to have friends in this game. Other things matter than numbers and amount of hours you invest. Some people just like playing with certain other people, because of their relationship, or because of their humour, or other behavior things.
---
Most people won't give a damn how loot is distributed, as long as everyone gets the same amount in average. You can think what you want, but only hardcore guilds will give gear according to dps meters. And hardcore guilds account for little server population.
---
As for "loyalty", if we're talking about raid attendance, everyone that is present on time on raid nights will be equal in that regard. Nothing to add.
---
I'm beyond ready! And the best part, I spoke with my boss to confirm my time off for launch, and he laughed and said he was taking that week off too. So I asked him if there was a reason he was taking that time off? He said there is, and it sounds like you are doing it for the same reason! He then said what server? Same as mine, what faction, the opposing one, and I was like well i guess i'll be murdering you...

The first rumblings of vanilla servers started as early as 2010/2011. I remember playing on The Rebirth. It was a single developer and pretty buggy, but it was one of the first true vanilla servers.
---
It seems funny to me that the developers had kodos models in game, knew of their size and strength, knew they were rideable in W3, and knew that the Tauren domesticated them as pack animals.
---
Kodos to tauren were like horses to humans, yet the developers almost decided to make the Tauren walk, as if there wasn't a perfect mount available, already scripted into the lore.
---
do we know if spelladin is gonna work on classic? I heard some rumblings that it may have been pulling numbers that were only possible due to pserver numbers on coefficients, proc rates, etc., and the actual numbers on classic may mean it is worse than expected.
---
I'm not sure of the minute details but a user here said that he wanted to make a Troll shaman named Thex. People ran away with it saying they were gonna take the name and so on.
---
Well when the name reservation opened another user got the name on the server Thex wanted to play on and traded it the name to him. 
---
It's a humans being bros type of situation.
---
let the haters hate, i've been a warlock since vanilla and i enjoy Demo soul link leveling. i love the utility of Master Demonologist. Succubus for damage, elemental fight coming up? Felhunter, tank cant hold aggro? Imp for threat reduction. fight with a lot of damage? sac the VW for constant health regen.  
---
With soul link your supper tanky, half the time if im not dealing with elites or multiple mobs i just have a succubus out, between MD and SL thats +13% damage to ALL damage, fire and shadow. and to the pet too. 
---
Eventually due to scaling your better off moving out of MD but until you hit those gear levels i love it.
---
Atiesh next?
---
Thats fucking sick

Good reading comprehension for a guy criticism a (correct) name.

I wish that would happen to be at deadwind pass. I saw the entrance by the hermit and i was going to explore before I saw that high level spider.
---
You are changing the gameplay from a social construct using characters to an in game system made by blizz. Sounds like gameplay change to me

In Moonglade I won’t kill another.  Outside?  You’re just another wheel to break.

sorry but I dont understand how I trigger a quarter of a gcd

I think I might be getting confused with another game I was playing during the stress test lol.
---
My normal schedule is 00.00 - 03.00. So I will be up
---
&gt; Unless there are enough people loging in to cap out the max amount of layers blizz can handle, but I doubt that will happen.
---
There are already "full" servers and I would assume that should all unique accounts with a char on that server log in to that server, layering will be able to handle them all. Otherwise, they'd likely have set the threshold for "full" lower until all fit into the possible layers.
---
Drain build was made for pvp servers, since you didn't need voidwalker you could use succ or felstalkers, to cc/dispel
---
Ahh, I thought you meant other way around 😉 Yeah, I mean as a non native English speaker myself,  I could never play with other norwegians / swedes only.
---
You never know? Some people love being choked so your name might be relevant.
---
Why are there multiple quotes of a tbc boss in this thread
---
And this is still two weeks out from the release. There are tons of people like me who aren't going to sub until the actual release. They've already added two extra servers because demand was higher than they thought it would be, I wouldn't be surprised to see another couple pop up over the coming weeks.
---
I just hope it isn't as bad as the shit show that was the D3 launch.
---
Might I suggest the "Save" functionality of reddit?
---
EU:
---
 WTS  **Abc**, **Otto** &amp; **Apache** on **Gehennas**.

Also looking for a name at **Golemagg** (Prefer same names but offers can be made).
---
I guess we're just on different lines of thinking on this one.
---
I really don't remember, that was such a long time ago. But pretty fond memories nonetheless
---
Uh
---
That's true. What I said is also true though. "Most" discussion should be directed here, not all.
---
That being said, OP was complaining that things were being downvoted and I'd have to assume its from a relevancy standpoint. As for things being removed, I have no idea what the post was. Overall, most of the WoW subreddits eventually devolve into posts appealing for the masses anyway.

Fine. Many people may deem it worth it, the point of my comment was that many people may not deem it worth it for reasons other than they are "brokeasses".
---
I don't know if new modes affect hitboxes and can be exploited, that's wha OP needs to know.
---
Every class can solo dungeons up to around razorfen downs.
---
Hybrids and hunters can get up to maraudon, though prot pala and hunter are by far the best for such endevours.
---
rogues can also some stuff, but much relies and pack size, larger groups are impossible for them.
---
Hunters and prot palas can also do parts of Dire Maul solo.

[Nostalrius started in 2010](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=76&amp;t=43263). 2015 is when they opened their second server.
---
Starfall isn't even channelling, hurricane is. Kinda big difference. What is your problem?
---
I remember in cata? People got banned for Modelchange
---
So do orc warlocks get 45% stun resist?
---
Rets are far more viable than people think, a lot of the stigma stems from Nostalrius where they were bugged to about 80% normal DPS. That and the fact that few rets knew how to play the class or itemise themselves properly it's unsuprising that rets have a ton of hate.
---
Played properly, rets can and will outDPS poor players from many other DPS classes. A good ret will absolutely deserve a raid spot in most guilds.
---
[Hopefully they'll get their chance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yWXeywPj3U)
---
Most druids level as feral, this going very well with Hunter. You both can tank if needed (bearform, bear pet), you both get auras that benefit eachother (trueshot and leather of the pack), throw in the mix the druid got great buffs for both you (mark of the wild) and your tanking pet (thorns)
---
Obviously a warrior can do more dmg than a druid but a hunter excels at range and a druids got a root ability so really, what else do you need? :)
---
Has it tapered off on pservers throughout the years tho? Isn’t the point of all this that it hasn’t?
---
Fair enough ^^
---
SM cath was regularly ran by 60s to farm, seems to be the most efficient. ST is a maze and probably less so, also harder mobs even for 60s.
---
Giving everything to two people is not loot "distribution". Why would the third best dps (or anyone else) stick around long enough to get anything?
---
I hope so, your videos are dope! Especially those indepth shaman guides
---
Fellow Fairbanks roller!
---
Leveling warrior has to be by far the most overstated difficulty and the biggest first world problem on this sub. People act like every fuckin pull is a dark souls boss. 
---
It's a minor pain in the ass to level, and at the end of it you're basically a hero class. Small price to pay.
---
I'm sure most players of every class will not make 60.
---
It just adds threat.
---
[deleted]
---
Yes. Rank 10 pvp gear will balance you out and make fights less painful, but those in full raid gear will still have a significant advantage. The thing that makes hunters strong in PVP is huge crits and being able to take a lot of damage, out gearing (or more realistically, matching gear level) your opponents is important to both of these.
---
You could definitely argue that a great hunter in r10 will beat average players in T2, but it won't be fair and hunters with time constraints probably wont be more than average players themselves. 
---
Most players will not get r13, it is better than T2 pvp wise, but for anyone who cant play 12 hours a day for 3 months straight, r13 gear is out of the picture. 
---
As the server gets older and pvp trick items become more common (engineering, special trinkets), you really need to get some solid tricks to really stand out in wpvp/duels too. All of this takes a lot of time commitment.
---
Probably.  I used to duel people wearing just the twilight cultist set which has no relevant stats.  Imo I was by far the best pvper on hakkar during that time but hakkar was a shitshow.  I would have xferred off immediately but some group of gladiator friends xferred to the server shortly before the first season and we played together a bit.
---
Beating warriors as a frostmage isn't much of a challenge though.  I hit 70 on my mage on hakkar just before wrath came out and there was this full s4 warlock that thought he was hot shit, he had 14k hp and I had 6k I killed his pet csed his feldom iceblocked his deathcoil and won the duel with like 150hp and 0 mana lol.  He told me I got lucky.  I never dueled him again until I had gear and he never won a fight against me.  Poor guy

Phase 2 will be an odd time to play on a PvE server, even with a balanced population.
---
I'm guessing people interested in ranking/PvP will gather in a few zones for big fights, since you can't just go around ganking lvl 50s on a PvE server.
---
A PvP server would probably be more fun to level on for the first 2 phases, assuming you start right away, but I like being able to quest in peace with alts.

Once the BGs are released it won't matter too much, I think,

Do druids have starfall in classic or was it all Hurricane spam?
---
Ahh cool. I mostly wanted to try absolute maximum to see how the PC handles it but ive heard what you Said before.
---
Which it does! Although it seems like most serves have more Horde, so it’s honestly similar to other server ratios.
---
It was a fun little raid, especially for people like me whose hours didn't let me get into MC or AQ or anything. 
---
I was the only tank in the raids.. iirc there were two healers, one primarily on me, one for the rest of the raid, although that second one had plenty of chances to dps a bit as well. It was a long time ago though, I could be remembering wrong.

I've also heard there is a trinket that allow the Hunter two multi-shot with no cooldown and that make then really strong? 🤔

A lot of people equate rs3 with he EoC update that happened in 2012, but nice try anyway 👍

those above are not things that change the gameplay. gameplay is still the same and this is totally fine

also layering will go away after first 100k of kids will quit in a month or two. that is totally fine too

Right now we are chomping at the bit to get back into Azeroth. I suspect the server memes will stop once we can play again. 
---
The difference between us and r/wow is passion. Most of them just autopilot through the game because that’s what the game is designed to do, I don’t suspect this sub will devolve into that
---
Growth was significantly hindered after the launch of Wrath.
---
That is actually a very good point. I may try and post an additional drain tank spreadsheet just to give people more options. Thanks for the input.
---
I need friends to play with :(
---
Cya in Azeroth bud
---
Or just have two different realms?:P
---
Just replace the rogue with a better rogue.
---
Vurtne 60-66 is so good
---
I did read your other comment. It doesn't change the fact that you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference without being able to see what your ping is.
---
Don't raid, enjoy world pvp.
---
Ret is a better NF user than an OT or Melee Hunter based on what we know and can top effective healing on some fights using 8/8 T1 and JoL.
---
The first big private classic server was in 2015 and lasted 18 months before shutting down.
---
The second big server launched in 2016 and fell apart 18 months later.
---
There hasn't been a private server around long enough to tell.
---
Well in that case: dont let your education suffer from classic. Good luck!
---
That barely runs windows 7
---
How would you go to frat parties if you went to Univerity of Phoenix?
---
1 or 2 tanks depending on gear. Having a fury just warr just putting on a shield to pick up a few adds is no problem. Usually 2 healers is fine if they aren't retarded or asleep.
---
For dps you will always be melee heavy due to the amount of pre raid bis items dropping there.
---
I used tmorph for 3 xpacs snd never heard anything from blizz. Also fly hacked in bgs and took flags out of the map a couple times. Honestly doubt blizz gives a fuck.
---
That rep racial is nice too if your going for exalted with timbermaw or frostsaber.
---
20ms is negligible man, *especially* with Spell Batching. You gotta realize original WoW was designed when **normal** pings were 240ms+.
---
Going from 50 to 80 is absolutely nothing.
---
I think that every class will be fine. The competency of raiders in this day and age is light years beyond what it was back in vanilla. Consequently, in everything but the most hard core guilds people will be able to play whatever they want and still down bosses! 
---
As long as you gear correctly I don’t think you will have any issues
---
Dont people just like building computers nowadays? Whats the equivalent of buying a lambo or building a gt from chassis up? I mean they could be posting like apple pro pics with the price tag on
---
Basically yes.  If you respect 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 then wait a month and it'll be 15.  I honestly don't ever remember the 5gold drop.  Usually I was respecting a bunch to change raid specs
---
EoC was just an update for RS2, because that's what they called it.  RS3 was a brand new game, because that's what they called it.

Classic is a patch, because that's what they called it.

2 tanks and 2 healers are needed until later in the game. Once you have some t2+ healers and tanks they can handle it with just 1-1-8 as long as the dps are competent.

30 minutes of wow a night is better than no WoW. If it brought you that much joy back in the day maybe that’s worth exploring again?

Oh nice my server has gone from medium to high D:
---
Even back in 2005? Imagine all the seconds I could have saved
---
Cool
---
Can't say we'll miss you.
---
Counter to this: Have existing players be able to send an invite to their friend to join said server.
---
While at the same time provide free character transfers from the larger faction.
---
Honestly there should be so many tools they can use to dynamically adjust faction balance these ways. Hell you can probably let loose lots of machine learning AI to watch over realms and see tendencies towards overpopulation and take action early.
---
Some is better than none see you the 27th
---
Personally I hate the current hunter on retail. I've mained hunter for the entirety of WoW and I loved the class up until cataclysm. The vanilla hunter is not a pet collector, it's more of a pet trainer. You have to go out of your way to make your pet as good as possible by taming different beasts and learning their abilities, then teaching them to your "main" pet. The play style is way different as well, in combat you need to make sure to always stay out of range of your enemy or get squished (no Disengage here). Slow them, drain their mana, trap them until you can go ham and finish them off. You also have to make sure to manage your stock of ammo, pet food and such.
---
Fun fact about the korean point-and-click movement: a lot of koreans smoked and as such played one-handed. 
---
From one of the interviews with John Staats.
---
Yep pretty much, but the thing I like about classic is that rarely things are perfect so there is quite a bit wiggle room for good players with shitty specs. Especially when you compare it to the current game where the raid size is half of what it is in classic, 40 ppl with perfect gear and perfect gameplay is never gonna happen outside of the few top guilds.
---
It didn't experience 1000 players in one zone because they had a reasonable number of servers for 2004. This is an unreasonably small amount of servers for 2019... unless... you are planning mega servers that are heavily layered. 
---
Case closed.
---
Lol could you imagine. Patch 1.14 - gnome druids added to the game. 
---
Just nothing else. Hahahah
---
i bet there's hunters around that worship Bilbo and his way of life "why shouldn't i keep it?"
---
You're acting like someone has claimed that these polls are 100% representative of the launch numbers.
---
Of course there's a selection bias. Of course there are "fake" votes.
---
It's still the best information available to us by far, more so than any guess or estimate claiming the opposite (based on an unfounded claim that redditors are wildly different from the rest of the playerbase) - so getting hyperdefensive over the results is silly.
---
&gt; Just to play devil advocate, is it fair to your other guild mates and friends to have specs that don't really contribute
---
There are going to be plenty of people raiding in Classic who "don't really contribute" regardless of class or spec. Unless you are going to enforce things like DPS minimums during raids, singling out specific specs as not contributing enough isn't really that important.
---
Unless you're caring for another human being in one way or another, you can make time, man.
---
See you in Azeroth.
---
Most UBRS groups are 10 man. If you're geared/experienced enough you can do it with 5. But it's certainly not the most common way to do it. There are a lot of combinations that work. Usually one tank, one offtank, two healers and DPS.

On wow launch we drove around San Deigo all night buying all the wow copies we could I think we managed to get about 17 and then we shut down early and went back to the barracks and fired up our telephone modems and didnt see daylight for about 24 months! 
---
Lok' tar! Should be a lot less alliance on classic now that the 12 year olds have grown up! See you nerds in stv!
---
Lol k.

&gt; "I have never seen good ones" is not the same as "I have seen some bad ones"
---
They have exactly the same value in this discussion. Your anecdotal experience with a handful of players has 0 value. There are literal mountains of statistical analysis and math on this subject. 
---
&gt; I doubt your "theorycraft" is correct. That's why I say I'll believe it when I see it.
---
I don't really care what you doubt. I'd tell you to go read the actual numbers behind it but I know you won't. Just keep raging into the wind about things you "know" to be true.
---
2,5k-3k players online basicially means 10k players in general so it seems alright :)
---
I think this is pretty cool. Can you update and let us know how it went?
---
If layering is going to cause queues, then how is layering possibly better than queues? It's just queues with extra bullshit.
---
&gt; What was it like leveling as ele?
---
A lot of fun. Mana was never an issue for me across these short fights. I always used totems, big fan of Searing (like having a mini Warlock imp that doesn't go OoM). The mana and healing spring weren't worth dropping unless you planned to be staying there for more than a single mob. Some people don't bother but in my opinion if you're not using your totems or don't like micro, you're playing the wrong class.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; Specifically what were your gear choices?
---
Couldn't tell you that exactly, way too long ago now and sadly I lost all my pre-BC screenshots years ago. I know I stacked INT of course and stuck to wearing leather/mail (after Lv40). I mostly ran 1H + shield for the tankiness, because even as Ele you could still slap a bitch up close if you needed to, with Lightning Shield, Shocks, elemental weapon buffs and your aoe fire totems all making things painful. I was Tauren so I had War Stomp if things got dicey as well. On that note- back in Classic, Orc's Blood Fury is strictly a melee attack buff, so 3/4 of their racials are useless as Ele. Trolls have Berserking, mildly better passive HP regen and deal 5% more damage to beasts.
---
&gt; I want to level as an ele/resto shaman.
---
And you totally can. An early Resto talent extends the range of your friendly totems to 30yds (up from 20), which is a must-have for groups. The major decision you have to make is whether you want Elemental Mastery (31pt Ele) or Nature's Swiftness (21pt Resto)-
---
- EM gives you a free *damage* spell w/ guaranteed crit every 3mins
---
- NS gives you an instant spell every 3mins
---
EM is better for raw output, particularly when coupled with a trinket of some kind, but NS is more flexible. Both are good, personally I went with EM. One other benefit of EM is that you have the option of taking 7pts out of Resto and put them in Enh, losing 1% hit and 5% crit but gaining 5% mana/better shield blocking and taking the Ghost Wolf cast down to 1sec (from 3sec). You don't have that option if you go NS because you'd lose way too much taking those 7pts out of Ele. Technically though you can make Ghost Wolf instant with NS if you *really* need to get moving...
---
We don't see the count of gamers here. It doesn't display a real picture of the future online, sorry.
---
Only funny gif I found on discord. It’s moonfires! I know it’s diff spell icon tho
---
10 days really, I think it'll take me a lol longer than that, plus I tend to get side tracked quite a bit lol
---
Witcher class confirmed
---
Hell yea brother. I was really questioning if I wanted to use questi or not but leaning towards not since I’ve never had the vanilla experience before.
---
my system: ryzen 5 3600, 16gb RAM 3200mhz, GTX 1070ti, 256GB NVME(fast AF boy)
---
brother want also to play classic so i build him a pc of part i have laying around (i5 2400, 8Gb RAM, GTX 660, 120GB SSD)  surprised how good it runs on retail 100+FPS on 7
---
That's what I said
---
Submit to the Grob
---
It's like discovering an awesome tv series, knowing nothing about it, and getting to start on season one with all the seasons ready to go.
---
Yes, exactly this. I won't have the time to raid or do anything hardcore - but I'll have time to level, explore, have fun with my professions. My most realistic "hardcore" goal is to do BRD again.
---
Any OCE forums or discord?
---
Trying to find other players based in Bangkok/Thailand
---
With classic WoW textures generally being very low detail, 1080p is already a 'massive' resolution when the game came out. Even in modern WoW there aren't intricate enough textures to be able to really benefit from higher resolution scale.
---
Everyone worse than you is a shitty noob and everyone better than you is a sweaty tryhard. People will bend reality to protect their egos.
---
I understand the people that feel it's no big deal; I get it, it's only $15 and it's totally worth it to make sure you get your name on so limited of servers.
---
I hope you can understand that the people that refuse this though. Just like paying for a lvl boost or a name/race change, reserving your name for a cost *feels* like a micro-transaction to some players.  It's not the cost that bothers these players; it's a principle of Classic game play in relation to micro-transactions, which they are vehemently against.
---
It’s unique. *pushes up glasses*
---
Games on its last legs and classic wow is coming over to kick the rest out
---
It costs retail players literally nothing but like 2 minutes to create a character. We have no idea how popular classic will be.
---
Now if Blizzard were to announce how many new subscriptions they got this month, like my wife and mine's, then we would have some info.
---
Cuz every player is equal and those "meme spec" players are your friends so treat them with some respect even if they're not playing by the meta.
---
Main point of playing this game: to have fun and make friends.
---
So what if you clear the raid slower than if everyone rolled warrior or whatever? As long as everyone enjoys themselves. 
---
If you care so much about downing a boss quickly, go apply for a guild that invests more time into the game for speed kills. Dont go berrating casual players who want to enjoy the game for not playing warrior/rogue/mage. Every class is viable, some are just more viable.
---
That's a nice goal!

While it can look fun, it's still a meme spec. You'll never come close to the burst potential of aimed shot multi shot combo and finding gear that doesn't make u a potato chip is also hard.
---
...or you're expecting a large number of players at launch that is sinking over the course of weeks, in which case lots of servers would be a terrible idea, but few with gradually reduced layering is a very good idea. Have you actually watched the interview? He makes that exact point and also promises the complete collapse of layering once world bosses are put. Nothing lawyerish about that.
---
A paladin will be relegated to healing in most if not all decent guilds you cant tank endgame sadly =/ you can go ret but its pretty big handicap compared to other melee dps and most decent guilds won't want to bring ret
---
Try to not think about classic, it will go faster :D
---
so how does it work ? How we get the "low , medium , high" server when we can not play yet?
---
I'd agree if it was $100 or something, but $7.50?  That's half a beer at a ballpark
---
I did that. Not only to save my name but to particapte on Stress test on the sunday before so I can set up my addons and whole interface already so I don't have to bother on release day and can just quest away :)
---
So just because you can't dedicate your whole life to it means you can't enjoy it?
---
I guess spending hours watching tv shoes, sports, movies isn't the same as playing WoW a few nights a week.
---
Account numbers are equally pointless - there can be 1000 accounts with characters and only 1 account playing on a particular day. Besides, how do you even count that? If I have a character on 10 realms, do I count towards server population on all of them? If not, then which one?
---
Which brings me to the actual point that counting players only make sense when you are counting the number of players **currently** playing on a server. Which should be zero at this point. So the population numbers in the screenshot clearly do not indicate **current** player count and therefore it's unclear what they actually are and if they are meaningful at all.
---
“You smell like a Moonkin’s back end!”
---
But they can’t play unless it’s on easy mode.
---
I played Ret through vanilla and my guild was fine to bring me, we weren't trying to be world first or highly competitive. Naxx is when Ret really "shines". Ret does bring a ton of utility and if you're itemized properly/prepared you can be a pretty good healer while putting okay better damage than a typical healer.
---
Yeah roger I’ll book mark you and get you a link on release day. I don’t have beta so can’t confirm anything right now but I will have it.
---
I was 23 when I started on day one in classic and I was also playing hardcore, I was outta school and was self sufficiently independent financially by working from home, I remember ditching friends and dates, even first dates to attend raids or such. 
---
15 years later, married, 2 kids, I do consulting and work anywhere from 30-50 hours a week, often on the road etc but fuck that I'm playing, I'm going casual, rolling a shadow priest and melting faces in world PVP.
---
And even raids, MC should be trivial and shouldn't take as long to clear, I could definitely commit 2 hours a week for MC at some point once I'm 60.
---
I will definitely not care for the PVP grinds and legionaries, I can have fun without being decked in oranges.
---
No idea. We know, it will be worse than on pservers, but spelladin is really not feasible at all without lvl 60 gear and consumables. So, beta can't give us any real answers, just theorycrafting.

No class will struggle to find raid spots. The struggle for most guilds will be to find 40 people who consistently show up for raids.
---
I've decided to start in the morning instead. I thought about playing it at midnight, but I'd much rather enjoy the scenery during daytime!
---
it does help, this is very interesting information, thanks :)
---
Unique accounts with characters on the server
---
This is the good wholesome stuff i want to be hearing about Classic. Have fun dude :)
---
For me there's friction between:
---
* The nature of raiding is a team activity. We optimize for the team.
---
* We’re not min-maxers; play what you want to play.
---
As you mention in your answer, your philosophy is basically: as long as we progress steadily, then people can play sub-optimal spec but as soon as we hit a wall, then we expect people to take their responsibility because team is more important.
---
It's the right philosophy in my opinion but it must be said that it's not really a "play what you want" guild but more of a "play what you want but be smart and don't be thick headed, selfish and delusional in the long run" guild and it must clear to anyone.
---
Hmmm it depends on how much gold you have
---
For sure, the server will congregate around prearranged warzones rather thank becoming a gankfest, which I much prefer.
---
I'd still play even if I knew I'd never raid.  I love the lvl 60 dungeons.  Don't give up!
---
True enough. The only reason I would think at this point the ratio is pretty high would simply be due to the lack of advertising.
---
I think that deadline will get extended or they will open more servers and offer free transfers if populations are stable at massive numbers. 
---
This idea that because they said they would only be here for the first phase and if they are extended then it qualifies as a “lie” is childish. They are trying to do what they can to keep the experience optimal and they didn’t develop this content to use it once. They might use it every time a new Phase comes out and the population spikes. I wouldn’t be surprised at all.
---
They will probably think about it if they see classic have alot of player still in phase 2.
---
Just roll back time.
---
Undead are my favorite starting zone for horde by far. UC is amazing, and silverpine is a total blast.
---
Are non-playable races allowed?
---
1. Dwarves because of the relation to Tolkien's dwarves. They share some parallels including greed and hubris, and via association a connection to the myth of Icarus.  
---
2. Centaurs. Let's get right to it, they're obviously a reference to the Mongolian empire and horde, which happen to be my favorite topic of history.
---
3. Troggs and Murlocks, who are adaptations of Jules Verne's Troglodytes and Morlocks. I listed both because they reference the same universe.  
---
4. Gnolls. They're clearly abstractions of bandits and highwaymen which in itself is nothing out of the ordinary, the reason why I like them is that they work well as a literary device. Most people immediately get what gnolls are all about and accept it. One of the most underrated races in the warcraft universe in my opinion.
---
5. Worgen. Werewolves are one of only a few horror creatures that actually terrify and fascinate me. So naturally they're one of my favorites.
---
Why do people think this?  Of course transfers will still work.
---
Imagine this, you're a guild playing on one of these megaservers, but you never see loads of people because of layering so it doesn't really feel like it.  Now you have a 20k queue every evening because layering has been turned off and you have the option to transfer for free to 2-3 other lower pop servers.  Of course a large number of people are going to do this, yes entire guilds will leave and quite quickly.
---
The only risk here is that a lot more people leave from a certain faction and you end up with an unbalanced server left over which would be a great shame.  This is actually what happened to my server back in WotLK.  We had queues of 6-7k per night since the expansion hit and then one day 90% of the alliance left to the free transfer server.  No more queues, but also no more alliance.  Great shame because it was a very even ~55:45 faction balance server before that.
---
I think it looks really good!
---
Also you have your tank and healer for leveling dungeons so finding dps should be easy
---
Lol, you are just sad. Karma must be very handy IRL for you to get salty like that lmfao! Go buy a house/car with your karma and then you tell us how it went :D
---
I believe the word you were looking for is antithetical
---
It's been in source control since 1997. Obviously not the whole game, but they were using git or something similar.
---
That's funny because both Photoshop and Premiere run better on much cheaper Intel CPU's ( like the 9600k), while simultaneously providing much better framerates for WoW.
---
[Here's](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-3700x/10.html) a couple of benchmarks if you don't believe me. AMD is much better for certain multi-threaded applications, like Handbrake, but definitely not for video/photo editing and gaming. At the end of the day you can do whatever you want with your money, just don't talk trash about something you know nothing about.
---
Loved this but it’s MARK Kern m8.
---
Most players are awful
---
I guess I'm sticking to arcane priest or Lock tank then :(
---
Ezpz
---
I have some old WoW buddies that are like this. I have no problem logging on for an hour or two, after the kids are in bed and before I need to get some sleep for work the next day. They get addicted, can't log off, lose sleep, get upset because they can't make raid times due to work/family, etc. For me, I'll play what I can play and set appropriate overall goals (upgraded valor set, after what I'm sure will be an extended level to 60 time). Everyone is different.
---
Enjoy whatever it is you end up doing!
---
Exactly the same here, was all ready to roll on Shaz but I think switching to Gehen is the right call.
---
Chad's a dick lol. He even makes me look good
---
Okay about the acidic slime. What good would an arrow do against an emey like that? What good would any physical, non-explosive projectile do against an enemy made of goo
---
Whatever may have been true before won't be true this time around. Everyone is different and is rolling different factions. Classic will be a different game than vanilla and the culture will be different. We just gotta wait and see how
---
My above comment just got downvoted to zero, which I assume is someone being cheeky. I honestly haven't had that happen here yet. I've been assuming everyone is just hyped and happy.
---
It's LFR, so probably not too high.
---
The age of intel has ended. AMD is the king of CPUs now.
---
exactly.
---
People who wanna leave will leave, people who think the queue is worth will stay.  Overall the queue will probably drain away as people get more and more fed up with it and transfer.
---
Amazing video, brought back memories of all the friends I made throughout the old days of wow and to this day I still have those friends :)
---
No means no.
---
actually they have an expansion rolling in September I think :)
---
Oh yeah, maybe I should have said SO instead. Also, keep in mind that the SO reputation is more like honor in vanilla. It will eventually decay, so don't forget to farm a little bit of that SO rep every now and then! Good time to do that is when the servers are down, or when you get ahead of your guild and you have nothing to do.
---
Same, but keep the topic up, I want to see more guys dying on the way to IF :)
---
Don't hate me it's part of the experience
---
Unless someone has figured this out I'm not sure we even know right now which data center any of the Classic realms are homed in. Given the very limited number they could all be in Chicago. The "time zone" level never has meant much on its own since realms are scattered somewhat randomly among the DCs without any correlation between time zone and geographic location.
---
If you're actually concerned about ping you should decide based on physical location when (or if) it becomes known, otherwise you're just rolling the dice choosing based on the time zone label.
---
The difference is, the lambo is a nice car with good performance
---
Was waiting for there to be a couple frames of being out of mana and auto attacking, and than restarts
---
cheaper dosen't mean cheap it is still going to super expensiv just not bleed your entire guildbank dry expensiv.
---
2 minutes in heaven are better than 1 minute in heaven.
---
1 langos with a shot of unicum please!
---
I\`ve been in budapest last year and i still have my bottle of unicum that i bought there :D
---
Cheers from PL
---
After we had MC on farm I had asked to switch to Ret for the night to give it a shot,  Had full judgement set and herald of woe, full consumables, food,   I was always 4-8 on the damage meters.
---
And then the tank had to go eat dinner 5 minutes in.
---
If you are trying to argue to get me to suddenly decide layering is good for classic. Yes, save your breath. I've already read all the lazy justifications. I was there in 2004. It was wonderfully un-layered. You can't tell me layering will be better. I know you are wrong because I played heavily layered ESO on launch. It is just a poor technology that doesn't work well with MMOs.
---
You need to be a better salesperson and sell those subscriptions! Convinced my entire group to play and reserve names lol. Just removed every barrier for entry i.e., gives them all the important details and what not,
---
Wouldnt that be a helluva crossover tho! Ya know Geralt wouldn't pick a side. He's made friends with humans, elves, trolls, undead, all types.
---
Well i don't like tbc so if they go the classic tbc route i will just stop playing. Might play a little if they release a classic wotlk later but that's all.
---
Unfortunately, due to the lack in server choice, we are rolling Herod. However, there is a chance we will migrate if more servers open
---
On launch night? probably.  But if there's consistently peak time large queues (like 1h+) on a server, people will move to a lower pop one unless there's a really good reason not to.  A lot of people might have good reasons not to but no everyone will, hence queues will drain away.
---
And to think 2-3 weeks ago people were sure Blizzard wanted Classic to fail because they weren’t advertising. Now this sub is full of people posting advertisements that they see
---
IMO civilized means higher technology, not courteous or manners.
---
The purging of stratholm was the right choice, though. It's how Arthas enjoyed it and was so heartless about it that was the wrong part. Stratholm needed to be purged.
---
If I don't have much trouble getting in I'll start when it launches (11pm BST on the 26th). I was originally thinking to just get to 11 or so and then sleep with the intention of an early start the next day but I'm suspecting I'll be too buzzed to sleep anyway so it might just be an all nighter.
---
I'll be playing with a friend to 60 so I guess it depends on them too.
---
The fact that you don't know answers your question I think.   If any large obnoxious streamer culture existed here, you would probably know about it.
---
Fire emblem is so good. On my second play through now. Sadly don’t think I’ll be able to get to the third house before classic launches
---
In that case, why not strat live?  You get righteous orbs and a chance at BIS chest recipe.  
---
You could also do LBRS for the potential to get another BIS robe recipe and Greater Fire Protection Potion recipes.
---
Consecration doesn't tick every 1 second does it? Isn't it like every 3 seconds? That would be 50dps on 3 mobs. Or 75 dps if it's on 2 second ticks.
---
Well damn, you're right. Now my rogue will never be good.
---
No. And not enough big streamers for them to be a factor.
---
hogger has killed one of the most people because of those damn lvl 1 raids
---
Yeah, it's stupid, but I was just pointing that this may be a thing and that numbers may be a bit inflated
---
Not as effective as relogging to an actual class /s
---
&gt;WTF you want to just restart the course of wow? Damn, everyone his own opinion and feeling to it. But I REALLY REALLY hope this wil NEVER happen!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;There are 3 possible options which I am fine with:  
---
&gt;1. Progress up untill WoTLK.  
---
&gt;2. At the end of wow classic start new servers for TBC and after that WoTLK (I don't really see that happen tho)  
---
&gt;3. Go the OSRS way and add content to the old wow game after all the classic content has been done.
---
He plans to stay 1h fury. Does this change anything? Will windfury benefit us?
---
Go lw/skinning if you are rushing to 60 and can join with a devilsaur mafia.
---
Otherwise go skinning/mining to get your mount and prepare for engineering.
---
Engineering is critical for hunters since you need the explosives to maximize raid dps.
---
Just keep in mind that you can't complete the dungeon quests while in a raid group.
---
How retarded do you have to be to compare him to 2019 players, compare him to 2004 players
---
I'm closing on a house on the 30th. Luckily, I only have a mattress, computer desk, computer, and 60" tv.
---
I'm afraid I'll never make it to the store to buy a stand to put my TV on and it'll just hang out on the floor autoplaying through Netflix for background noise.
---
I also remember having a lot of baked potatoes. You can dress them with so many different combination of ingredients.
---
that's beautiful, thanks for sharing and watching
---
With pally tank, should be doable. Just LOS pull around the corner, put conc there and you are set. Im going to do 5man multiboxing too, but on horde so lets see how that thing goes. Going to start easier instances and get experience, then move up to better instances.
---
Dream being able to do strat/BRD.
---
According to him, they will just remove layer by layer and increase the population of each layer until there is only one layer. If in 2005 we had 3500 maximum concurrent players, in 2019 we will have like 12000.
---
They are OK with mega-servers.
---
MVP spotted!!
---
Thats something everyone at all times need. Its not gold that dropped but an item, you dont need on BoP just because it has a vendor gold value right?
---
&gt; we can use the data but keep it in mind that it might not be representative of the total amount of actual players. 
---
Yes, I agree.
---
No but someone in the guild said he would
---
Fix it if it didn’t work he does not have beta access either.
---
Why 53?  If someone has the fortitude to make it to 53 and not already quit by 40, they're a hell of a lot more likely to just finish it out.
---
Tons of people are going to quit likely before 30, and you're just going to see more and more drop every ~10 levels.  Once they're past 50 though, they've endured enough and they can*probably* deal with finishing off leveling before dungeons or not getting into raids makes them quit.
---
Satirize me!
---
I forgot about the troll dungeons. Those were fantastic.
---
Ah crap, i do need my glasses then :)
---
I would wait at least a couple of months. I don‘t think game companies would do this without a reason. Many gamers seem to prefer that shit..

It's not just the chat aspect (and sorry dude but if you think twitch chat is a shit show you obviously never experienced barrens chat), it's the need to group with people, interact with people for buffs etc. It was an epic quest in and of itself to just get people to dungeons.
---
I'm not expecting intellectual conversations or deep lore chats, I'm just expecting to play an mmorpg again not an empty single player game with the occasional group up with people that retail is
---
Gg, this this youl get it! What server will you play?
---
You're welcome
---
no starfall in classic
---
Best level 10 zone in the game if you ask me.
---
Its from ZG, and it resets multi shot, aimd shot, traps i think, ill try and find the link!
---
BM is pretty beastly in WPvP.  No-one likes the big red pet coming at em.  Remember when I was in Winterspring around level 54 and got jumped by a 60 mage - threw my pet on him, popped BW and he was dead in under 10 secs. Same with a higher level Pally in STV - tried to gank me, FD+trapped him, ran away, threw pet on him and BW, then kept running.  Pet just chewed him up and spat him out while he couldnt catch me.
---
Very cool. Subtle in all the right ways. No room in my home office for more wall art or I'd snag a set.

\&gt; It's going to seem more "dangerous" having the enemy really be the enemy. 
---
That's it, really. It's pretty great.
---
anything I can find like this for mage?
---
Its good to bring a druid for the last fights. You can hibernate draconians and pop into bear form to taunt the general. No need to drag an off tank for all dungeon
---
Same thing is happening on Faerlina, you should give it a try!
---
If i'm right i used to make a group like 2-2-6, oh man... can't wait!
---
I spent a ton of time with my dad playing vanilla and tbc. He was a PvE vet and I was PvP. My dad taught me a lot of qualities such as kindness through always helping lower levelled people in his guild on WoW. Approx 200 people came to Orgrimmar to pay respects because he passed away in 2009, both alliance and horde. I treasure that time with him. 
---
Just make sure it doesn't affect their education like it did me. Moderation is key for sure!
---
World PVP and constantly watching pvping for nodes, herbs etc
---
I think everyone is misestimating everything because how could anyone possibly know any of the numbers involved here. 
---
The only thing anyone can say is that there will be a solid number of people still playing after 3 months. How that translates into server pop, or compares to retail, or steals from retail, or ADDS to retail... is basically impossible to know.
---
Its all about being flagged for PvP in contested zones. It makes the experience in world a bit more dangerous and interesting. Some may say, its the core feature of WoW.
---
Do we have numbers? How many chars are needed for "full"?
---
Nah I wouldn't be looking at improving WoW performance specifically, I played plenty of other stuff where a CPU upgrade would come in far handier. Cyberpunk's out in April so I'm just gonna wait and see what deals I can get before then.
---
Nice repost
---
The claymore from stormwind at level 10 is also a decent buy
---
Extremely fun dungeon raid, especially with friends 😊😊
---
I do MC almost every week for transmog on retail and in all this time I've gotten two Bindings from Garr and one The Eye of Sulfuras from Ragnaros.
---
So yeah, it's pretty rare. Also, it's a pity I got them on my hunter.
---
It's the intended way to play the game...
---
retail bad 
---
steamer bad
---
cids bad
---
noobs bad
---
me good
---
I be fartmuncher, we all be fartmuncher
---
What an abomination
---
I agree, bring back mop locks

I find you mega cringe

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19953/renatakis-charm-of-beasts
---
Here it is!
---
Because "hahaha retail bad, vanilla good" certainly never gets boring /s
---
This gets posted at least once a week, but with the rate the sub is growing, there's likely a bunch that haven't seen it.
---
If you're playing on herod enjoy the hour long ques to login for months
---
This. You're always kept on your toes by imminent threats.
---
when i was 2yo my uncle would put be gathering grass in the game (a tail in the desert), apparently i liked the sound of the guy picking up some grass so i guess i was efficient especially cuz he wasant even paying for my food lol
---
This is exactly why I went PVE..... Farming sucks enough, now I have to deal with a wasted hour(possibly more) because someone was bored....  Nope....
---
It was a gift with the first Bradygames WoW guide book. Sent off for it and it is glorious. The pictures don't do the size of it any justice. Think its 4 foot by 2 foot. It didn't come with a frame though, I had that made specially for it.
---
What are you talking about specifically? That's a very vague comment.
---
Just wait until you start your first all out war in STV because you ganked someone 20 levels lower than you. World pvp is the best way to play the game
---
Grob Gang. 
---
Stalagg Squad.
---
The true vanilla experience will not be able to be achieved on the streamer server 
---
go Herod or stalagg or whitemane i think theyre called if you want that 
---
it seems to be the highest pop most hardcore pvp realms  and on those it will be true 
---
the streamer realms will have a lot of random obnoxious events that weren't in vanilla (i am going to have a character on faerlina but another not on there) things like how asmon dragged a dragon into SW and it killed people in one of the only safe places in the game or having your game lag because there are so many people in one spot following the streamer around. there are the event benefits but im sure other realms will also host some of their own events
---
Rogue PvP trinket doesn't break stuns anyways.  Fear, sheep charm, iirc.
---
"Whats up guys, Skarm here".
---
Is there a list of what server is going to be for...
---
i know some are streamer servers some are dad servers some are hardcore servers... 
---
is there a post that has all this listed out?
---
It’s called the world of WARcraft. The whole game is based around two factions at war with eachother. If it’s a PvE server there is no feeling of war going on. Just an rpg where you down bosses. May as well play Skyrim. PvP servers allow you to fight for things in the world. You have to watch your back cause you are in the middle of a war.
---
I macrod petattack in with my hunters mark usually. Still kept the control 1 and 3 set so I could send and return freely, but for leveling it's easy to add it on to an ability.
---
Hey, where is the video ? :D
---
&gt; Cataclysm raids returned to a higher level of difficulty, 
---
Funny thing is, in my opinion, they were very hard and very boring at the same time. It was like wiping in slow motion - if the raid took too much damage you *knew* you'd oom 5 minutes down the line because of the retarded mana management system. 
---
Difficult to put my finger on what exactly sucked about it, but I prefer twitch reactions and big plays over doing a mechanic correctly 100 times in a row.
---
I was hyped af when a white mail set of gloves dropped, and then another one dropped after and I gave it to some random who wasn't wearing any gloves.
---
Feelsgoodman
---
I hope you step on a lego, ruin retail with your multiboxing instead
---
So all these leveling guides that involve multiple respecs don't account for fresh start or leveling with a friend.  I would highly suggest finding a build that involves little down time.  Start at 1 and go to 60.  None of the builds make that crazy of a difference leveling especially with a friend
---
My favorite is Vash'Jir (I know, unpopular opinion), but Duskwood is somewhere up there as well
---
up
---
Remind him of the massive asswhooping his class will receive from Druids in all roles when TBC patch comes along.
---
It’s the extra dimension of watching your shoulder and protecting your friends that really makes the experience. Even figuring out how to avoid a dangerous ganker is exciting. So sure we won’t break any speed records but we’re going to have a good time getting to the end.
---
Yeah, you only have mail armor, and no talents or anything to make you immune to critical hits and crushing blows.
---
Tank specs also usually get bonus armor through talents, so you're *wayyy* behind in the defense department.
---
You seem smart
---
Awesome thank you for this! This looks very similar to StaySafe's warlock leveling guide.
---
Barb blade let's go!
---
You get faction locked on pvp classic realms
---
Tarren Mill v. Southshore pvp battles can get real big, real fast and run for days. Also, there’s old-style Alterac Valley, which can also run for days.
---
Be a wizard.  Everyone loves being harry potter.
---
Here is one. I can confirm that the freezing trap macro works. I recall there being a macro to combine all of the melee attacks to one button, but can't find one that works.  
---

---
In my guild we saw multiple of 1 binding drop, only 1 of the second binding drop, and only 1 eye drop (of which the warrior didn't know the cost of and never made).
---
It's simply more dangerous. You can be killed just about anytime/anywhere. You either enjoy it or not. PVP isn't for everyone. I couldnt imagine playing on a carebear server., but I've always played PVP. You simply have to decide, play with my friend and PVP or play without him and coast.
---
One had main tank take a quick bio break. He came back an hour later..... Said he was eating a hot pocket
---
Currently lvl 12 retail is fucking garbage. Did you know that Priests don't have a wand slot anymore?!
---
I understand you, but a lot of people seems to like pvping, ganking, being ganked and forming groups to clean horde/alliance in a zone. For sure it is a “waste of time” at phase 1 but it is real fun for some of us.
---
Roll an alt opposite faction on the German server maybe?
---
i hope it ends up working. would be a cool unique spec to work towards.
---
By the end of wrath, mid cata, I became a heavy altoholic. I had made one of every class and got them all to 90, but much had changed by then. Going back to classic soon, I know who my main will be, but I feel I'll start rolling alts before too long. What combos are difficult or darn near useless in this era so I can save them for last or as a challenge if I get bored?
---
Loot priority (in the sense of giving it to the specs, which can use the item most first) is important.
---
Loot council can also work fine with strangers. You have to be careful about being a fair council though. A working loot council is better than DKP, as it prevents endless DKP saving for big items and wasting upgrades nobody takes, because they want to save dkp for something else.
---
But a working loot council needs to be transparent and with rotating members to prevent corruption.
---
Verdant Keeper's Aim from Mara quest at about lvl 45 is a no-brainer.  Lasts you until 60 easy.
---
In the WoW Clone era when there was a lot of discussion around populations and profitability and alive or dead MMOs the number often used was 5-10% of the total playerbase was online as concurrent users.  I've never seen data for launch numbers as a proportion but for day to day numbers it seems to have always held true when official data is sometimes released.
---
I have plenty of names to choose from. When I started vanilla WoW I nabbed names I like. I have no concerns this time around.
---
Obviously you need to be getting *something* out of it for you to be addicted, but addiction is really not as clear-cut as you’re making it sound. Sometimes it can be “I’m not actively enjoying myself, but this is what I’ve done for so long that it makes me feel normal, and feeling normal feels better than the alternative”
---
I think it’s just the fact that they know a lot of people are going to leave retail for classic. 
---
For those that have heavily invested in retail - the value of that investment when perceived by others is about to drop significantly. This angers the retailer.
---
I mean....at the time I dont really the point bud lol. But hey if it makes you feel better.
---
I just love PVP Servers and I could never imagine playing on PVE (also have never played PVE)
---
I just feel like you are emotionally attached a bit more. Great Feeling when you kill some Rouge that tried to gank you. 
---
It sucks to be killed while questing and having to run across the whole map to get to your corpse. But knowing that exactly this hustle is awaiting you should you be ganked gives you this Feeling of excitement all the time.
---
You run into STV and it feels like you entered a war Zone :D
---
You run into ashenvale as a Horde and come across  8 People fighting each other and you can just jump in and help them. After that you will all reg - talk a bit - be on your ways. Sometimes some ally way higher than you Comes along and somehow you 5 People manage to kill him too :D
---
Best Feeling ever and actually some of my fondest memories come from WPVP :)
---
Uhhh.. how do you filter that down to good raiders? That seems way too much.
---
Thanks! There are a couple different logos like this I found online. Gave my friend a reference picture and this is what he did.
---
Yes. Nobody was claiming it's good or optimal, all that's being discussed is viability.
---
This seems overly long considering the bulk of it is just the talent order.  
---
Try using some of the images from this guide:   [https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warlock/leveling-1-60/](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warlock/leveling-1-60/) 
---
Looks like where most of the other class one sheet/wallpaper info is being taken from so I imagine someone could do the same with this class and get everything condensed a little more--sans the macros which, as others have mentioned, appear to be out of date anyways.
---
Hes Mr.T and hes a Night Elf Mohawk, foo!
---
Steve carrell as a ret Paladin
---
Don't tell them you are trans then.
---
If your voice is still a problem, it luckily is not required in WoW.
---
You overreached in dm's by insulting hypotheticals, he may use 4chan himself, which has nothing to do with transphobia.
---
That’s learned at level 40
---
no i meant from the world pvp events, you can just wait out the 5minute pvp off toggle and go about your day.
---
This it's awesome,  enjoy.  Neither of my kids (26/24) like WoW, husband refuses to start over,  so I'm on my own.  I have one friend from retail who's coming back at some point when his business slows down.
---
I’ve played exclusively alliance over the years. Will be switching to horde for classic. It will be fun to experience some new zones.
---
Moonkins most definitely existed in Classic.
---
The layering is only temporary... or so they claim.
---
You're not god, or my father, or my boss!
---
Your argument for Ion not being a good Game Director is because they introduced things you personally don't like. It's a gross overstatement.
---
Regardless of how you feel about the current state of retail, WoW is still the premier MMORPG on the market and healthy source of revenue for Blizzard.
---
Then whats your problem with an addon facilitating the same function in a more streamline and single area? 
---
Literally accomplishes the same function. It doesnt teleport you. It still requires the group to talk. You still have to function as you would if the group formed through lfg or trade. 
---
There are so many other addons that trivialized the game but you and your type of people hone in on this one because it makes social interaction easier? Makes zero sense.
---
Grobbulus bless you with his perfect goop.
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla, will be playing Horde now. Never experienced pre-Cata Horde content, and looking forward to it!
---
Same.
---
It adds tension, and i love it.
---
Also, don't roll need on a proc weapon, ever.  Weapons are stat sticks for hunters, and just because you can equip it doesn't mean you should.  Classes actually hitting things with their melee weapons get far more out of the procs than you do.
---
You are incorrect,
---
Wonder why you never see completely nude Draenei or giant rainbow gnomes? Because the changes you make that appear on your screen are not what everyone else sees.
---
Otherwise it would be exceedingly easy to create microscopic gnomes in BGs
---
650 V-Star classic myself
---
Two week early early name reservations used to be free?
---
I know druids on Pservers that would top healing anyone saying druid healing is not viable ( let alone solid) is trippin
---
Tom Holland as gnome mage is inspired!
---
Scarlet Johansson, dwarf hunter as a neurotic raid leader straight out of Onyxia wipe
---
&gt; without a doubt
---
I promise you they can query that data from some database, regardless of when you pay for the sub.
---
Yea I think blizzard might have underestimated the player retention rate of Classic WoW. If each layer is supposed to be a full server load worth of players and each server has many layers, I don’t know that they’ll be able to just drop the layers without having obscenely over populated servers.
---
I think they don’t understand how popular this is going to be. Hopefully I’m wrong and they did their math right, but this really doesn’t seem like enough servers across the board.
---
Play Dwarf. They're awesome.
---
And it's open to all retail players. Who I guarentee a huge number grabbed a name "just in case" they want to check it out and may never even log in.
---
Also, Terry works....FOR THE HORDE!
---
https://youtu.be/1ntfXLb5eFk
---
I really enjoy his content but isn’t it generally audiocasts?
---
I remember this as a thing i and many other druids followed, and i hope it will be again, though i give it little hope.
---
That’s awesome. My dad and I played WoW but I started years before him. Sadly, we also played on different servers because he didn’t want to PvP. Few years ago he passed away. Wish I had played with him just once.
---
Blizzard already confirmed this during Blizzcon 2018 they won't be looking to allow such an addon. 
---
I would really make sure you touch base with them first before putting in effort to create this. 
---
We use to have addons in retail that did this kind of stuff and it created a standard that everyone had to be on the addon to find groups, it prompted blizzard to shut it down and improve their own LFG system.
---
YOU KILL THINGS BRUH WTF U MEAN?
---
Uh, no, because that would display a lack of originality on my part. You're *supposed* to move on and pick something else if your initial choice is already taken.
---
I’ve never experienced dun morogh, stormwind, westfall... I’ve missed out on half the game lol
---
Yup. There's literally nothing else to say.
---
BOOMKIN IS DOABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Lets have some Mist of Pandaria servers as well. Oh heck throw in some WoD for the two people who liked that as well. 
---
In my experience most of the people who loved TBC and Wotlk didnt play vanilla or started vanilla too late. 
---
I can’t think of a single thing that made BC or Wotlk better than vanilla except dumb things that ultimately ruined the game. Like for example make content easier and more accessible, epics less rare and valuable, and 10-man raids wtf? A 10-man is a dungeon group and should never have been scaled into raids.
---
Now do Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian.
---
Thanks for the great reply. I think I’ll go prot first and get Holy Shield at 40. 
---
Now I just need to wait 10 days.
---
Every time Ion waves his hands, a new layer is created somewhere....
---
1. Open Excel
---
2. Find a cell
---
3. Type "=1-0.97^36"
---
4. Get 0.547035
---
5. Be unable to work out what that means
---
6. Come to reddit and call OP a moron
---
7.
---
8. Profit!
---
How can you even consider that? There's got to be some other way!
---
What other dungeon do you call the initials of the last boss? 
---
I've always known it as DM and i started in vanilla, never understood why people would call an entire dungeon the initials of the last boss on this and then the initials of the dungeon everywhere else
---
Fairbanks lads rise up
---
I mean, that isn't really true at all. Several encounters rely quite heavily on the presence of a specific number of certain classes. Beginning with the first boss of Molten Core and on.
---
If you die in two hits without a shield, how much do you think that 10% extra reduction would help?
---
Out of 9
---
I feel like waiting this long was probably the smart move, too.  You dont want to advertise *too* early and kill the hype.
---
Were less than two weeks away....this is a great time.
---
Hell, even most movies dont start advertising much until right before the movie comes out.
---
Being able to reserve names is nothing new. You could reserve names in Guild wars 2 if you pre-purchased the game. Being able to reserve names and play retail is included in the cost, so you are not paying 7,50 for only name reservation. 
---
Blizzard cost to do a simple name change or server transfer are way worse than this.
---
Why would you need 17 copies?
---
(: ...
---
Same goes for any game and any expansion. Instead of going down a shitty path they could add other stuff.
---
Because there's when it'll be available, leaf shouldn't be dropping P1.
---
weapon damage normalization has been implemented already so there are quest rewards and dungeon loot that rewards very close power to a reaper to the point a human warrior will have better options. and once PvP is out the iced barbed spear is just better. only orc warriors dedicated to PvP see the reaper as an option and even that is a hard sell simply due the iced barbed spear.
---
upgrade factor to the cost ratio isn't reasonbal for a private person and guilds aren't going to bank roll your reaper since they would rather get additional nightfalls.
---
even for orc warriors in phase 1 it is hard to tell them to get a reaper when for example the https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11931/dreadforge-retaliator is a dungeon reward that really close in power.
---
i really like his podcasts about classic, and they are underrated, i hope he got his justice for his good work!
---
LEZ GO
---
You know what I did? I rolled Zandalar cause this server drama and community is just making me tired. It killed off my hype and it made me tired and anxious instead of having fun.
---
The community there is more calm and relax, more mature you could say. Pvp is still there, rp ain't mandatory (specially with refuge people/guilds like me) and in general it seems like a healthy option, both as a server and for my mental health.
---
Give the big F to those guilds and their drama and move on to a better wow, a wow that's more like the original deal.
---
Also on the part about how much a guild can affect a server, you can search youtube videos on apes and similar guilds to see how bad/out of hand it can get.
---

And we have a sick mascot https://i.redd.it/e3zb8xhws0g31.png
---
&gt;thanks for nothing
---
They gave you the game, dude.  They've already opened two new servers, they'll probably open more.
---
&gt;damn fuckers...
---
This kind of attitude is what makes them hesitate to support us.
---
Jelly, sounds awesome.
---
What if I'm alliance and also staying on Herod?
---
I think it's because these people tend to try their best at "just a video game" at the expense of having mediocre attempts at a lot of other things.
---
That's not a hard cap, but that's the cap the game was designed with in mind. It's not a big problem if it goes slightly above. But that's the number you have to consider for the world to be healthy without doing any mega private server tweaking bullshit.
---

Not sure why it didn't occur to me sooner, but I logged in to my old YouTube account I haven't used in five years, and used control-F to search for 'moonkin'. Sure enough, despite 250+ liked videos, I recognized the thumbnail of this obscure gem.
---
Oh, another packed server 🤣
---
I'm excited to see the Chuck Norris jokes replaced with Keanu Reeves jokes.
---
This is my strategy. I'm looking for a new job and I hope to get a week off between positions.
---
&gt;I just don't want to make the journey to 60 on a druid and realize that I should have made a different healer.
---
Druid is fine for 5 man's. I feel they are actually better at tanking dungeons, than healing them tho. It's also easier to get groups that way. 
---
In raids they are acceptable. You won't be blowing up charts, but it's fine.
---
Unsurprisingly, the combination above did not work out too well when adjusting to adulthood, but I managed to squeak through the rest of life just fine.
---
So excited to go back.

It is also main-hand only...

Pretty sure druids are designated tank healers due to their mana efficient downranked healing touch
---
Hmmm, why did you want a really slow weapon?
---
Burning Crusade is widely considered one of the best parts of WoWs runtime even if you disagree calling it a shitty path objectively comes off as more ignorant than purist.
---
I think he is. We can assume they have a significantly higher player cap with the new technology available.
---
Also of private servers have shown us anything, it's that the fresh experience of a new server launching is incredibly alluring to many people. So I don't foresee launching new servers to be an issue.
---
Yeah the decay was added in 1.11 so we should get it too, presumably.
---
I have no desire to play vanilla. If it was wrath I'd have a much different answer, but right now there are other games I want to spend my money on, and will have fun with. 
---
I don't have the same memories of vanilla like I do wrath, as I was a wrath baby. I wholeheartedly want it to succeed and I want all my friends who are asking me if I'm going to play to have a great time, but it's just not the game for me.
---
Exactly!!! Pretty pumped. What realm did you choose?
---
This is all hear say but:
---
Actual Vanilla servers had about 3k concurrent players when they were "full". 
---
Nostalrius ran stable till about 7k concurrent players, and had big problems at like 12k.
---
Not amazing pure healers, great utility heals. You won’t have any issues getting a raid spot if that’s the concern.
---
&gt; Unlike before when everyone used the same abilities besides people who were new to the game and didn't know better. In the overall scheme of things, nothing changed.
---
This has never been true. There were wrong talents to take but there were still multiple viable ones.
---
how many chairs in SW??
---
try hard
---
That's gonna have to be one hell of a snack if it has to sustain you for 200 hours.
---
Everything I say is based on memory and I forget what version it was.  My first raids had several druid healers.  I was horde and I think druids were stronger than shamanas.  However alliance pally flash heals were way more desirable.
---
Druids are awesome back up emergency healers and utility MotW and revive are always needed.  If you want to play druid and heal I promise you'll find a raid spot.
---
As for 5 mans they are very viable all classes are.
---
No one worth grouping with will turn you down if they need dps, if you make a classic hunter mistake people might be more quick to jump on it though.
---
Yeah, once the game launches, I’m off this sub.
---
HEY GUYS MARVEL MOVIES GIVE ME UPKUKS
---
This is correct. I’ve formed and lead dozens of UBRS groups and 2 tank, 2 heal, 6 DPS is all you need and imo optimal.
---
Add another offheal only if your group is really struggling.
---
It's not Classic. BfA is not allowed.
---
Thank you! I was hoping I'd get some feedback on that. I always love trying what seems like unorthodox builds. Much excite!
---
Thank you for the correction/clarity.
---
J'avais un peu la même crainte parce que je voyais pas vraiment d'engouement des joueurs sur les fan sites français. En plus, quelques jours après la réservation des pseudos, je voyais les serveurs anglais et allemands en High pop et les serveurs français en Low.  
---
Content que Sulfuron soit passé en High donc.
---
lol i probably will
---
This is an interesting topic, one my football sub is going through. I personally love the football memes, but they weren't allowed until recently. I understand, and dislike, r/wow for the fluff like you but that's the opposite of how I feel for my football sub. If filters worked on new reddit and mobile, it'd really just solve all the problems. You get to see only what you want, and filter out the stuff you don't like.
---
Hence blizzard saying the servers are full and threating with queues. They know they need to limit the players per server so they try to scare them to other servers. It's obvious if you think about it.
---
He played on Twinstar a few years back
---
Yeah this is obvious. It doesn't count the 10 characters from a single account, because only one of those would play at any given time. Now, the interesting question would be: Are these thresholds the same numbers as they were in Vanilla? Back then, maybe a server with 6k players would be "full" since there was no sharding. Maybe it's the same number still, so these servers will quickly show that they are full when in reality they are much more capable of handling those numbers.
---

---
I'm gonna be playing classic with my 15 year old son. I'm so excited. I didn't get to play vanilla, I started in TBC, when my son was 3. He used to watch me and ask when he got to play. Mother, son gaming sessions rock.
---
This is so awesome!

So sad to hear so much wrong about my fellow spanish people.
---
True, but the impression they've given is that they don't want a private server population. 15k+ is too much and they know it :P

They will take other measures if they need to, such as opening new servers with free transfers or something.

if i miss the sleep all my gameplay will be suboptimal and i will be tired the whole time telling myself to stay awake! but if i sleep 6-8 hours and make sure all my days food is ready the night before i can play for 16 hours with good energy. (healthy foods and good caffein) 
---
god if i heard myself talk like this when i was playing vanilla i would never believe it! i used to pretend to go to bed at 10 then lay awake until 12 and play until 3-4 then sleep until i had to go to school! with no worries either! hahaha now my body would give up after the second day!
---
Plays female night elf
---
All people can get skillup.
---
A "skill please" was a common whisper when mining :P
---
harder with herbs - because then first person needs to actually not collect herb.
---
How did they determine this data?
---
Cannot wait to continue the Main Story... Will be nice besides playing Classic :D
---
Thanks for the advice , I managed to get a B in trig so I'm ol with that. I start calc in 2 weeks. I think it'll be ok i just need to get in for a tutor .
---
Yeah you are right.
---
I got to admit though (as a druid myself) that a well played Priest will outheal a well Player Druid on similar gear Levels.
---
That being said we have innervate to help out other healers if they Need and we have battle rez. 
---
We are far and beyond any Priest when it Comes to utility
---
&gt; Raid-trivializing (DBM, Decursive, healbot etc), if possible
---
You're going to have a really, really hard time finding a raid group that will let you come without DBM/BigWigs.  Not impossible, mind you, but not easy at all.  It is virtually a universal requirement in raiding and has been since actual Vanilla.
---
Spend 3 hours running around burning steppes and searing gorge mining Mithril and thorium so you can get 5 levels on blacksmithing.
---
Did you go to the new or old discord server?
---
Warrior leveling that bad?
---
as druid you will gear faster then anyone! you will not top heals but you will be required.
---
Just look for a guild and you're fine lol
---
This pretty much sums it up :)
---
Leveling is where the most of the content is - endgame has plenty, but if you don't try to enjoy leveling and speed through it (which is fine), then you lose the ability to judge the game as being "slow" "boring" or "lacking content'
---
Not saying you are OP - but leveling your character and sort of bonding with it - is what makes am mmorpg an mmorpg.
---
was waiting to see where the pirates were gonna roll..
---
People who reserve names 2 weeks before are absolute minority of total population. And all servers are allready full. I really dont what whats going on in Blizzards big brains problem solvers.
---
Why the obsession with fear ward anyway? Horde don't even have it.
---
The horde takes all members.  Even members in woolly coats!
---
Oh okay, you speak on behalf of them? Thanks for the response.
---
I sort by new so I haven’t seen it yet.
---
Ad hominem doesn't make your argument any better, mate. You misrepresented what Ion said and I corrected you, nothing less, nothing more. I'm not a Blizzard fan boy, which you we can easily check in my post history regarding BfA and its problems. It's not my fault that your points are weak.
---
that's not what i was talking about when i mention complexity and diversity. isn't that obvious?
---
The real question is.. how they get a 6th man into that dungeon ?
---
Wrong. PvE is called Normal.
---
Good for me. I sort by new!
---
We’ll see them server ques, I took a week off of work for this I want every minute to count :)
---
After it's completed.
---
Lmao, fuck that.
---
I have 3 thunderfury son my retail account(I did solo Mc a lot) the longest it took me 2years, the shortest was 3 months  and many of my characters have 1 binding in the bank on classs that can’t use it.
---
I was on Normal PvE for most my life since joining in 2007 and still managed to get ganked and enjoy world pvp was still a thing with people of all levels raiding westfall even if you were like level 20 to 30 you could demolish the level 15 guards and a level 10 to 20 noob that tried to fight you. Im rolling PvP this time because with practically no noobs these things won't happen on a Normal server I don't think
---
As a new wow player (literally zero experience), are there any benefits to joining a guild early? Or is it more of a move for those that know they’ll rush to end game?
---
I for sure was. The preceding Warcraft games were super popular, so WoW had some shine from that alone, coming into its release.
---
Ha, i plan to do that reverse! Will play on English server to de-learn the language.
---
It also doesn't have any effect in changing the culture. Reporting and suspensions works a lot better than /ignore.
---
I doubt its anywhere near the same as vanilla. Probably the "low/medium/high/full" is relative to the rest of the servers, but perhaps up to a certain cap, but that cap is 100% much higher than 6k, probably closer to 30k or something.
---
I think you mean “classic”
---
Who needs “good raiders” in a game that will at some point never get new content? Your time to complete the stuff I basically endless. 
---
The more engaged and “better” people will be faster at 60 so just go with them. All the slower people will clear the raids later.
---
Why is it right for people to report other languages used? Imagine if that were real life and you reported someone speaking Spanish in an English speaking country.
---
They’re not wrong. Reliving the era when I was eating salsa sandwiches and listening to Slayer on my shitty portable CD player. At least I won’t be doing my laundry in the pool this time!
---
If anyone is undecided on class, just pick your favorite Futurama episode from the nine here
---
They'll add more probably.
---
Yeah, I agree. I remember being able to stomp mostly everyone but if a good warlock came up on me I'd just viper stink and kite that bastard till they were forced to eat at their own health.
---
People were quitting WoW in December 2004; people will quit Classic in September 2019.  Back then it was about replacing losses with gains. Now, there will probably be a much bigger surge followed by a big drop off followed by stability.
---
I approve
---
IMO tattoos are the gateway to shitposts and I already see one on the front page
---
Yeah! I love the druid solidarity of classic. And the really random events :-)
---
My guess is one of two:
---
1. Retailers that don't understand what I'm saying and downvote because they think otherwise.
---
2. Vanilla hardcore players who think they own the world.
---
Bingo
---
Time to wait 2 hours to kill ten boars
---
bongos &gt;
---
Hah, anyway to turn off the chat? Or at least minimize it?
---
Lmfao exact same as me :)
---
Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter are some of the biggest advertising tools to reach a large number of people. It doesn’t sound like you know much about advertising
---
lol
---
Yeah a paladin *should* outheal a druid too, all I meant was that druids are by no means subpar healers and are very very useful in raids (Brez can easily save a wipe) 
---
He was just asking about druids and seemed to have that prejudiced idea that druids are ok at everything but not very good at anything, and tbh that's just not true they're v good healers and solid tanks (best dungeon and aoe tank)
---
Druid is a solid class
---
I am not understanding this.  Is there a bug that is causing a delay?  Or is it performing as intended?  You want to make sure the red bar is full before you move, correct?
---
Oh boy the upvotes and downvotes making this bounce around 300 is hilarious
---
I didn't play druid in vanilla so I didn't know of such a code, but I will be for classic and will gladly adhere to this for the most part. I am on a PvP server so we will see what happens haha.
---
This may be a silly question, I have no idea how transmog works so will ask it anyway - what's the relationship between rare transmogs and you getting gold? Can other people pay you to use items you found as the masters to be copied?
---
Some hunter got it on Ally side Daggerspine-Eu.
---
Don't listen. It does not matter. If you like Orc, be Orc, if you - for some reason unimaginable to me - you like Elves, be an Elf. The journey is the best thing about classic wow, not that you roll something that is best.
---
Most of the things you list as bad things are things I see as good things.
---
My last raise was $15,000 🤣🤣
---
I was thinking more like your personal health, having your house in order, etc.
---
thank you.
---
Pandas didn’t pick a side either.
---
How is streaming your gameplay in the spirit of Vanilla? Ridiculous gobshite.
---
It's more like a 1.5% chance to drop and we've never known if the loot tables were weighted or not. They currently are on retail, we dont know the specific numbers, but there are weighted loot tables. I understand the logic behind probability, but in WoW it's a false equivalency.
---
Grobmob for life.
---
A decent hunter makes the final boss much easier, most groups will want one.
---
&gt;golemagg/shazzrah both got full during the night/first day of reservations... these are the die/tryhard/addicts , they cant wait, subbed 2 weeks infront without anything to do with that sub, most have big plans
---
You are ignoring the other side of things - those diehard players are also the kind to keep thinking about what realm to play on now that a new have opened up. They won't just go "oh well, who cares, it's easier to just stay at Shazzrah".
---
As an example, most of the Swedish guilds are going Gehennas. You can't just assume none of the Shazz / Gole hardcore guilds will move to Gehennas.
---
It might have been true if there was a lot of realms, but 2 is already not a lot for so many hardcore players to be at, many already had a problem with being with the Spaniards or other communities but had little choice with only 2 realms. Adding another won't mean it will be solely casuals, it means all the hardcore guilds can spread out a bit more. If you've been reading forums you'd see that most people were quite unhappy with having to roll along x other community, so I think there are plenty of communities ready to move.
---
In the end, all of this is speculations, but I see no reason to just assume Gehennas will only be casuals and die out.
---
What movie is this from?

But... You think you invented it? You were the one who came up with idea? I'm not sure if you're trolling me right now or what

Yea, there's also the ability to use Feign Death, Traps and your pet to get mining nodes and herbs that are surrounded by mobs, which gives you edge when it comes to the scumbags who wait for you to aggro and then steal it from under you.
---
Having a pet Tank and kiting will also give you the ability to solo elites when are trying farm certain items, and open up some straight gold grinding locations, which include Dungeons.
---
My absolute, VERY first character in Vanilla WoW was a dwarf priest. I am honoring that ultimate first attempt, and is my reason for choosing it.

Maybe a weekly meme thread lol

Blood elves.
---
Adding a dangerous element to your every day routine will keep the game feeling alive for you. PVE servers are great for casuals though but they get monotonous.
---
Community on PVP servers are very active too. People are rushing too defend areas, guildies or friends. You'll see people rise to fame from pvp abilities and etc. It's just more intense all around.
---
I have a friend with the exact same mindset as you though and he ended up quitting WoW but he's the type that cares more about winning on demand and not really having to struggle for what he wants. But to me that's where a lot of the fun comes from, overcoming those odds and prevailing.
---
Absolutely, especially the remastered version.
---
What is the current status of Aux for Classic, is it working error-free? I don't have a lot of WoW history but based on my research, this is one popular add-on and looks incredibly useful. But there are many bug reports regarding Classic, so I'm reluctant to add it until it's confirmed to be working mostly stable.

Planning a Resto Druid one?
---
No no it's acceptance I love him and his sightless existence
---
He's like our DareDevil :)
---
Someone said that to me and I wasn't sure if they were trolling.
---
My first ever wow memory is of me running to Teldrassil as level 1 Night Elf on my brothers server he installed and messed around in on our family computer. We would also use commands to get random items and were amazed how cool some armor sets looked
---
You can’t FD with dots?
---
It was Garrosh from Siege of Orgrimmar raid. It was the last raid of MoP, so I guess it was 2013?
---
&gt;brag about their amazing home life when it's not relevant,
---
Apparently you didn't read any of it so ya interesting. Your post was so misinformed it made my day. Best laugh of the week 10/10
---
Where can i find these macros for the pet?
---
As someone who plans to play feral but never did in vanilla, why the gnomeregan farming? 
---
I’m very excited to play a class that is so versatile, specifically in PVP.  Healing, flag running, doing dps, tanking, basically helping wherever I can fill in seems really cool in PVP and PVE.
---
Yes a companies goal is to make profit but I dont think that was the thought behind their design of vanilla wow.
---
Their goal was to make an perfect game in that genre as I've think of Blizzard.
---
Leveling took a long time in MMORPG during that time and for a 1. character it's a journy.
---
Todays wow a cannot take serious as an RPG. I compare it more to Farmville where you log in daylie collect loot and do tasks.
---
In Vanilla you chose yourself what to do. Have one week no time. You did not miss out the m+ cache / free warfront loot etc.
---
On another han if you've the weekend free you might grind that gold for the mount or reputation. 
---
I cannot comply with this lootboxes, freemium gaming stuff which today is so popular and attracts more customer and is more lucrative for a company.
---
Increases attack speed
---
That's the plan.
---
At least wait for the game to come out before bitching about the sub.
---
There just isn't anything to talk about for the next 2 weeks.
---
Lol all very true
---
My kid's seven, any tips on how to make the most of it? Fishing/herbing child labour?
---
I'd say Trolls probably have the better animations Orc &gt; Troll &gt; Tauren for who looks better in the gear. But they all look pretty good. But Personally I'll be going troll for the +5 for bows and the damage increase they receive, But my favorite are Nelf Hunters which is what I mained back in Vanilla through LK
---
Oh I'll have fun
---
CAMPING YOUR ALLIANCE BODY
---
Jk lol... Maybe. 
---
DONT ROLL HEROD &gt;:)
---
Which is no different from today...you can do that if you want, you just don't necessarily need to if you're okay with random pugs.
---
Alamo &lt;3
---
I had a tauren in vanilla, he looked dope with xbow of smiting and DS
---
How's that different from any criticism regarding vanilla here?  Heck, before they chose to do it I was downvoted for suggesting they should increase the mail cap to 12 like on retail
---
Classic is also a marketing tool, since they make more money per player in retail thanks to selling expansions, level boosts, pets and mounts, as well as each month in average being paid more for thanks to tokens. So it makes sense they want it under the WoW icon, so they can feed classic players news about the maingame in hopes the classic players will check it out and give blizzard even more money.
---
You didnt really have a choice before Stalagg, Thalnos was Brazilian and Faerlina is streamers, I'd rather take my chances with ques.
---
does an A/C unit connected to outside provide 'fresh air'?
---
i live in a country where its about 40-45c during the day.
---
Yes! Lets remind everyone that in vanilla shadowmeld is NOT usable in combat. You have to be out of combat to use it. However, the cooldown is like 10 seconds or something like that (vs 2 minutes on retail). Vanish lite version of shadowmeld is definitely a lot more useful though.
---
You don't even need to make arrows!
---
Find your perfect brand of adult diapers and add roughly 10 hours played time in the first week!

Fuck all these multibox people.
---
OP dont lie to yourself and go back to retail.
---
Starbucks is a fancy and cool way to order a McFlurry or a milkshake . You feel more adult because of the mediocre amount of caffeine but it’s all sugar man. Apparently it’s cool to “not be able to function without your coffee”.
---
Yes, but keep in mind that the Warlock only needs to spam Shadowbolt while the Cat Druid rotation is very involved and easy to screw up (perfect powershifting is **HARD**).
---
Old ashenvale was pretty sweet. My all time favorite zone is the Jade Forest though. Mop was the first expac I actually did endgame content in while other people were. I've always been such a casual player that Id never hit lvl cap before then. I also quit right before wotlk came out cause I got super addicted to wow and failed grade 9 so I had to go to summer school and my parents refused to buy a subscription so I only started playing once I had a job and was out of high school.
---
Sry for the wall of text.
---
delete that comment i am not racist.  cartman can be shopping cart man or any other cart it doesnt have to be actual eric cartman from south park.
---
NO MEME SPECS IN MY GUILD, ESPECIALLY OOMKIN
---
Worst case: Occupies a slot in your actionbar.
---
Seriously tho, for long fights, the bonus holy dmg from the its' judge works.
---
It's passive seal value tho, unless you have some sort of chance on hit weapons and/or trinkets, I dont its use.
---
oh my stop putting out false information.  The attack speeds of pets are different.  If a pet has a higher attack speed, their damage will be lower to compensate.  This means a pet with 1.0 attack speed has the same standard sheet DPS as a pet with 1.8 attack speed.  Then there is also another factor on if the pet has more hp, armor, or damage.
---
It’s fun and exciting until you get to stranglethorn vale. They don’t call it stranglethorn hell and Vietnam for no reason. I wouldn’t change a thing about it. 
---
Do you not attack in hopes of them agreeing to your silent agreement ? Or do you want to attack first to get the jump? Maybe let them tag a mob first ? Is his rogue buddy coming back or were they just questing need each other ?
---
I assume most players range from either not born yet to 15. No way that's anyone's most depressing time of their life.
---
A server that everybody swarms to, but only one person is allowed on at a time.
---
Every time also druids in Outland would play a game called chicken in shatrath... We would fly up together and shift out and back to flight form lowest without dying wins.... Never said a word just did it.
---
I really want to run hunter although i played paladin in Classic. Upside for hunters is leveling fast and being able to farm stuff easily. But. Paladin are heal bots and everyone is always looking for healers i feel.. The struggle is real.
---
Yeah as a horde we did the same with wailing caverns. Managed to progress quite far but then the trash repawned and it was 7am so had to call it the night.
---
had more fun an unique experiences in 20hours on the stress test than ive had in retail since cata launched. Let that sink in what they have done with the community aspect of the game.
---
I dont really know runelite so i cant really say sorry.
---
So glad they’re quadboxing then!
---
I'd say the druid code probably exists because it's hard to kill a druid as another druid as they specialize in low damage/high survivability.  I wouldn't waste my time trying to kill a druid as one.
---
&gt; The subscribers now is like 1/4th of what they used to be, maybe less. If the game was good, subs would obviously be going up, not down.
---
&gt; Yeah, not saying much in a dead genre... 
---
So if the genre is dying, wouldn't that correlate to lower subs overall?  You can't have it both ways...
---
We also don't know active sub numbers because they aren't announced publicly anymore.  For reference however, Wrath sold 2.8 million units on release day.  BFA sold 3.4 million units on release day.  Take from that what you will.
---
My overall point is that over 15 years demographics of your customers change, and WoW has evolved in line with their core audience, for better or worse.  Insinuating that Ion is the reason for the game's demise is short sighted and places the blame solely on an individual when there are a plethora of factors that have gone into game the game's evolution.
---
My favorite was being invited to BRD and getting mind controlled into the lava. Took 2 corpse runs to get to a safe spot only to get tossed right back in before watching everyone leave after getting suck of waiting for me.
---
IKR
---
Debatable, I personally see nothing wrong with more races to pick from, but I personally hate how simple the current game is and how badly the story is written. I would have zero problems with having the races, but still having the gameplay of vanilla/BC/Wrath. Then again, I'm also in the same boat of saying that there is no reason not to give players a toggle for current graphics if they wanted it, since it would be client side and affect no one but themselves.
---
You could do it on private servers and they were harder than actual classic
---
I tried looking for this and cant find anything. I dont know who he is, and never heard of him before this post. Whats he done? Looks like he was part of the studio that made firefall?
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once....... True story... Would play again....
---
Social and grouping. Guilds are good at every stage of the game.
---
racist against boomkins!
---
Just make a couple of the same races and just dive in, you'll know after a week of playing if you like the game :)
---
Have fun!
---
/r/atetheonion
---
Did you even read what you linked? Base speed IS NOT ATTACK SPEED.
---
Thanks I hope so, rolling with my old guild leader so we should clear most content. Shazz Horde side.
---
What is there to be confused by? I'm saying I want to say it's not tamable and then admitting I could be wrong, because I have no hard evidence to prove my opinion. Then I said I don't remember anyone having this pet Back in Vanilla when I played the game during its actual release...
---
I think he's talking about BoE greens/blues that sell on the AH for high prices because of their unique transmog look.
---
&gt; PvP - 90% of servers lean Horde ~60%
---
This is the statistic I was lookin for. I'm going Alliance for classic because that's what I played in Vanilla. I wasn't sure if he heard something about Horde being like 90% of Herod or something
---
Excellent. Thank you.
---
I never said I like retail.
---
My guy. Do you know what The Onion is? lmao.
---
My advice is to not bother with broken tooth at launch and tame a starving mountain lion in hillsbrad between level 24 and 28 and level to 60 with it. You can still give broken tooth a try when you have a level but it may slow you down a lot. 
---
It has a 1.2 attack speed and same model as broken tooth. I can tell you the casters I dueled all thought I had broken tooth.
---
I legit almost had a stroke trying to read this. I upvoted you just because you made me laugh. Thanks.
---
Thanks, Perd.
---
It's a bit hard to pair Enchanting with something other than Tailoring right off the bat because Tailoring is the only profession you don't need a dedicated gathering profession to feed (just a little bit of skinning).
---
What you could do is do LW/Skinning, and just store greens on an alt, then when you have developed a good income or an alt that can skin for you, you can drop skinning and do LW/Enchanting, and use all your stored greens and shift to buying cheap leather to power level the enchanting.
---
Oh my god this hits home so hard.
---
'quick break' RUN to window, open window, BIIIIG BREATH in, close window, with mouth full of 'fresh air', run back to computer!
---
It really sounds like you just want something super casual. That's what BFA is for bud. Go to it.... or just somewhere else. I still think you should try Classic though... you may change your mind. It's all about the experience and socialization. 
---
All of the below sounds great. It's about the socializing, experience, and journey, and it's Formula(even mechanical formulas neglecting aesthetics and design) still holds up to this day. 
---
* much longer leveling
---
   * This gives levels actual VALUE as opposed to newer rpgs where you can easily net a single level in 3 minutes - If you can hit max level so quick, just remove levels as they're pointless.
---
* fewer flight points
---
   * There were only but a handful of areas that needed an extra FP for convenience. 
---
* fewer graveyards
---
   * Again only but a handful of areas that needed it for convenience. This also made people value LIFE and more concerned with dying.
---
* mounts at 40/60 instead of 20/40
---
   * Makes mounts incredibly valuable. Getting one wasn't just another day of wiping your ass.
---
* gold making is much harder and you really had to focus on it
---
   * It was definitely a little slow at first and made people play smart(obscure jobs or cornering AH) or play hard(super grind). Once you did that though, life was good.
---
* requirement to grind for consumables for endgame
---
   * It's only a requirement if you're required to. Not everyone is. A lot of guilds also have the option of chipping in with other ways.
---
* more gold sinks (repairs expensive, epic mounts hard to save for)
---
   * Repairs were really only bad for Plate wearers. Again it gives value to not dying and puts actual consequences in the game :P Epic Mounts had a specific value and were absolutely worth the coin. Plus they looked badass and getting a unique one really meant you went through a rough grind.
---
* running to dungeons
---
   * Good. Explore the damn WORLD of warcraft. There was always something that could happen along the way too; Anything from weird WTF moments to straight up Ambushes. Teleporting to an extent was an option as well between Mages and Warlocks. 
---
* people dropping during dungeons
---
   * Literally every game ever. Zero concerns.
---
* more frequent dying/corpse runs
---
   * Stop dying. Socialize and ask for help. Get good. Etc.
---
* ability trainers
---
   * I loved the flavor of them. Retired Classes teaching out fellow horde/alliance. It gave a little more life to the world.
---
* lengthy attunements
---
   * I didn't understand these, but I had fun doing them every single time. It always gave me a Lord of the Rings kind of feel. 
---
* weekly raid lockouts
---
   * Basic time-gating that every company uses for any precious loot related event. Nothing new there.
---
* leveling crafting professions taking *forever*
---
   * Only if you're bad at it or don't know how to read.

* probably tons more
---
   * Probably tons more of good things. You haven't listed anything bad yet and I'm confused. I'm surprised you didn't mention the 40man Raids... to  be fair, I wasn't a fan and I was at the same time. I think it'd have been better at the time to just be 25-30.
---
I will check at 00:00. If the queue is too long I will go to bed and play early in the morning.
---
Well, Bilzzard has a pretty solid history of hiring players. Ion Hazzikostas played in Elitist Jerks back in the day. Original top designers like Pardo and Kaplan came from top end guilds in other games. Then you have the plethora mid-rank hirings like Lore. And if you look at their other games it's the same thing, players getting hired into all kinds of positions.
---
There are only a couple addons that I would consider significant during leveling, and they also depend on the class you play.  For example you may need DoT timers to see when your CCs or DoTs are gonna wear off.  Or for a warrior you may want a swing timer addon.
---
As for macros, same thing goes.  They are just very simple bits of "code" that can perform some simple logic and cast your spells.  Easy example, a mage can bind arcane power and trinkets to the same macro hotkey and blow all his/her cooldowns in one button.
---
My opinion that may or may not be popular but it doesn't change my opinion: I liked the game when it was harder. I liked that it took me some time to level. 
---
I enjoyed the fact that this cool piece of blue gear I managed to get in a dungeon stuck with me for a bit. I also liked that it even mattered that a blue piece of gear dropped, where now the reaction is 'Well that's cool...but my 'loom is literally 3x better and will keep scaling with my level. I guess it is, sadly, vendor trash..' 
---
I actually liked the ability trainers. I hate the abilities just magically appearing as you level, and that there is little choice with most of them, no mix-and-match. This was a strength of pre-NGE SWG and it was a strength of WoW (pre-Cata? I forget when they switched from skill trees to the 'well you hit this level and are prot spec, here's the ability we've picked for you to gain at this level').
---
Maybe saying I LIKED running around without a mount, or with a slow mount, is a stretch. But I liked that the world was large and immersive. I HATE logging in with a fresh character and seeing the dorks with the motorcycle mount thingy straight away. And I definitely side with the 'no flying' people, no matter what happens post-Naxx (if anything).
---
I liked the crafting professions. Were they always great gear? Nah. But damn I loved making my own copper/bronze gear. Even though there are better items, I can't wait to craft my own 2h copper sword, outfit my character in all self-made copper/bronze, and stand there in awe of the god-awful colors that result. It's going to be great. That and my first return to Deadmines are the things I look forward to in the week of launch.
---
Anyway, I could go on.. All this is to say is, I liked these things. It will be as good as I remember, because these things were what I liked about the early-2000's MMORPG style. I dislike the way games are made now. My favorite game series, Total War, left me behind years ago. I get it, the new stuff produced sells, so they make games that will make money. But don't think that I don't miss those older styles of games. 
---
To each their own. If you don't like these things, there is Retail for you. I don't mean that in a mean way either. You have your game versions you can play. We're excited about this other version based on an older style.
---
!RemindMe 11 days
---
For Alorde
---
Proliferation. There are so many mounts, pets, and toys in the game now that each new one you get means less.
---
This just seems like you’re trying to shorten your queue time on Herod.
---
You can, but won't you get in combat after some dot on you ticks?
---
Again, all theory as I have no way of testing this nor done this recently, but I think:
---
FD-&gt;go out of combat -&gt; dot ticks -&gt; go back in combat,  shortening your window of laying a trap.
---
I'm sure there are some reliable hunter macros out there, even for Classic.
---
Unlikely, this is basically a profile for pfUI and as far as I know this addon will not be ported.
---
Your evidence is anecdotal. Everyone i know personally who will be playing are not subbed here except me. They don't use reddit.
---
I sold it for 15k when they needed it
---
That's crazy, the lucky bugger.
---
In my case I much prefer the "endgame" when leveling is complete, but leveling is fun too....
---
I am scared that if I run hunter other classes are going to have a higher dps than me. What do you think?
---
Hi, /u/DynamicStatic
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cr76wh/did_you_reserve_your_nick_poll/). 
---
Pretty sure we just used one tank + hunter here if I recall correctly.  It speeds the whole dungeon up quite a bit when you brought a skilled hunter.
---
This is a dungeon I am especially looking forwards to.
---
Jokes on them. My life is far more dressing now.
---
Uh, no. Blizzard made leveling incredibly fast, compared to EQ &amp; other MMOs at the time. Some were worried that people would just quit when they hit max level, but they figured that if they made the process fun, people would reroll instead (which many did).
---
Apparently, at least 63 others, do..
---
For some people griefing = "The world is alive"
---
Outside of the alive feeling - some people enjoy having a horde alliance rivalry, and you don't really feel that on PvE.
---
That's on private servers.
---
As far as I understand, ping defines, how quick will server reacts to your action, meanwhile spell batching makes sure, it will be delayed by 400ms
---
Honestly I call out people for being toxic to other players all the time, as long as you're not confrontational the other player usually realizes they are being a jerk and apologize. 
---
I play Rocket League and that can be some of the most toxic bullshit you ever experience. Like whiff on a single pass/shot and you'll get a 't8 is trash' in the chat. 90% of the time I start scoring and just typing 't8 is toxic baby' after every goal... 90% of the time it starts a dialogue with the other person being civil, the other half its just lame trolls who are easy to ignore.
---
Hey!!  That sounds like something a try-hard would say!  Get him!!!!
---
Thought it would be interesting to get an estimate of how many of the users here have reserved their names already. Mostly for the same of getting an idea of how fast the servers will fill up at launch when the rest of us gets in. I imagine reddit will have a higher percentage of reserved names than other users.
---
Why not both? No1 is stopping you from having 2 characters just pick whichever you'll have the most fun with first!
---
It depends on the population of the server and the Horde/Alliance ratio. While you may not come across much of the enemy faction in some contested zones(apart from dedicated gankers), other zones become almost unplayable due to constant pvp. Take Stonetalon Mountain for instance, in my experience this zone has always been a hordefest. 
---
In short, the lvling path you take on PvP-servers is different than PvE-servers. Some zones are to clogged up to farm experience effectively. You'll also be better of grouped up for protection in certain densely packed zones(STV).
---
What’s the 1
---
OP will play a hunter and demand all items
---
Scatter shot does not get you out of combat iirc, only stops your auto-shot but, again, I might be wrong.
---
I don't understand the meaning of "Why the big deal of shared DR"
---
Come now. If you were to meet anywhere, it would either be a neighborhood hub, dungeon entrance or dungeon itself. Not some random stone.   
---
Battlegrounds were portals, which is equivalent to dungeon entrance portal.
---
Try Grobbulus. Stricter naming conventions, same PvP.
---
Night elves... Their animations are great. Then Dwarves. If you've ever played a troll hunter you're going to realize how little time Blizz spent on their animations
---
its how I feel! When I go boom, I feel it in my feathers!
---
Everyone aren’t casuals, you know.
---
Treu
---
This is why we have mythic and mythic+ though...
---
Scaling dungeon difficulties is not a bad thing.  Make friends in RDF gearing up, take them to mythics with you.
---
You just equip it in your main hand which gives you a ranged 'auto attack'
---
Fun Fact most of us aren't as familar with classic as we think we are.
---
It's 15 years of patches, updates, expansions. So many things have changed, Add on top of that all the false information "learned" from private servers, and honestly know one knows anywhere near what they think they do about classic.
---
Are you sure? I did it in exactly 20 days, but that was only a few expansions ago. Maybe I'm forgetting what the grind really involved.
---
That's no reason to be scared. As hunter you're not a dps monster, you should be clear about that before you decide to roll one. You are a god at utility/kiting while still doing perfectly acceptable dps, with a very scalable skill ceiling in both PvP and PvE. You set the tone. Their gold farming is top tier as well.
---
I raided through all of classic and never saw one half dropping.
---
Gonna be maintank this time, hoping for Thunderfury for sure. But it don't think it will drop.
---
I feel like the hands down best pet is carrion birds for horde, or owl for hunters.  I do enjoy wolves because they get furious howl at later levels.  I think the birds are so good, because you can give them two focus dumps and they do not need growl on auto cast.  They have enough DPS to hold agro from you until the mob gets low enough.  At that point you can have your pet continue to attack, but the mob will leash over to you to finish it with raptor strike.  That gives you a lot of extra HP if the mob is running between you and your pet and not attacking either.
---
A little bit, honestly. My SO is already well aware that I’m taking a week off of work and will not be doing anything else until I am level 60 and have started getting my character set up. Hell, I’m probably going to be playing 5+ hours a day on weekdays, and god knows how long on weekends, for a month and a half at least. I’ll finally be able to relax and become less frantic once everything gets settled, but until then... yeah, a little scared.
---
I forget what the default macros are for send/retrieve pet. But once you get level 10 and get your pet, go to your key bindings and you should be able to find the button. Then you can just macro them to whatever you want. I usually do something easy like Shift+1 and Shift+2, but i saw down in this thread that some people use the mouse wheel which i thought was neat.
---
I remember trying to get my kid to quest for me(TBC) and she didn't like the game because she didn't like killing animals, she only player for 5 minutes and became despondent with guilt because she killed a tiger or something.
---
I would just in group and type in general until lowbies in the new layer sees you and have them invite me to their layer to follow you
---
No, once deleted it immediately becomes available
---
I guess I mean worse in slightly more overkill for wow classic
---
(:
---
Yes, you can create one immediately with said name, after he deletes it.
---
" Will you be up at midnight and last until you fall asleep? "
---
Yep, and since I do stay awake late every day, this sohlud be no problemo.
---
Lets make a new, official one! 
---
Aaaaand there’s three discords!
---
I’m well aware barrens chat was a shitshow, but twitch chat is a similar but worse beast. But it won’t just be relegated to Barrens, as it primarily was in Vanilla.
---
People actually group up far more often for various things in retail than you may realize. Just because you have bad luck trying to get assistance with a group quest or whatever doesn’t mean that it’s universal. The hyperbole used to denigrate Retail is often just that...  hyperbole.
---
Oh, they should just call it "It'sDMnotVC-US East"
---
Sure, but not with the same frequency, and is likely as much related to latency/batching as anything else.  I can confidently state, as someone who was really pessimistic about hunters previously, that hunter feels good to play on Beta right now, and its better than it was on the most recent stress test.
---
In retail MoP I renamed my shaman to chadkroeger. Was heavily invested in PvP. Noticed that my name resulted strongly in people focusing me more. That lasted a week I think changed my name again to something else( can't remember) started getting focused less rofl.
---
Crazy that Pyrewood Village is full - I've rolled horde there and seen no mention of it on Reddit.
---
Mine is only 4 inches but it smells like a foot.
---
If you're feeling down about it, then keep your chin up my brutha. I've been there, and things do get better -- it just takes time.
---
A parent can still do the “homework and chores first, WoW after”. Had a friends niece start to do better in school because Homework and chores needed to be done first.
---
Doing great so far!
---
i think i joined not to long ago and it was 130k , and now its 185k.. so ima say, Yes!
---
My plan is to level 5 paladins to 60 and farm strat bc undead for gold.
---
&gt; Make friends in RDF gearing up, 
---
My point is the game mechanics discourage this. RDF encourages you to blitz dungeons as fast as possible. At no point are you expected to slow down and talk to your teammates.
---
Mage, and Harry cannot send you to IF for funsies.....
---
Can you still join full servers?
---
Everything you just listed is everything I'm looking forward to. Classic will be better than we remember; Nost and the the other PS's certainly were.
---
Shit really? I had no idea, thanks!
---
it's not fixed then because that's exactly how it was in the stress test for many people, including me.
---
I did a BRD run with a guild i freshly joined. Turns out the tank was drinking heavily and by the time we got to the large nonelite room with the braziers before emperor he was too drunk to understand what was happening and we ended up wiping until the mobs started respawning.
---
I got my name on both!
---
Great, thanks! Im not gonna kill him then. :)
---
thank you!
---
Do you *enjoy* healing?  If not, it's a moot point that you can find easy groups.
---
I played a Paladin all the way up to Naxx in vanilla and I'd never do so again.  Even as an effective healer they just felt boring for everything else.
---
Can someone explain to me what these are and how they work? I'm guessing its like you have to complete the first to unlock the second, and the third to unlock fourth and so on. Is that it or is it more to it?
---
Now you added another criteria with def stance, as usual
---
Les fameux joueurs d'Archimonde haha
---
You right they changed this.
---
It was main hand only in the initial version of it’s release
---
What do you think gold / hour will be? Why UD over live?
---
imagine getting a world of warcraft tattoo AND its on your leg
---
WeirdChamp
---
For a Full clear you should go 2 2 6 atleast for the last boss until then with a good Tank you might aswell go 1 2 7
---
Yep it's kinda stupid, but I'm pretty sure we are getting the lvl60 version, aka the good version.
---
How tf did I miss that the beta is back. Is it open to everyone? Thanks for feedback anyway!
---
I still get nightmares.  We were hunting down a few panthers when out of nowhere my friend went ahead of me.  He said he saw one of the stealth ones up ahead.  Before I could act a rogue got him and ran off.  Chuchnourish was taken way too young.
---
Troll
---
Weighted based on raid size/class composition/other factors unknown to the players.
---
OP is assuming perfect powershifting yeah
---
Idk why people think BR will take up an entire server, on top of that most of them speak English enough to communicate in game. I might roll Thalnos depending on how bad Herods queue is
---
Going Alliance. Played alliance on retail classic back in the day and have played horde on several private servers since.
---
 Will miss the flavor of horde, the races, the cities etc. Looking forward to just experiencing the full game of Classic. Basically just see everything I missed playing horde( don't remember retail classic that much).
---
 Can add I will fear as well. :P Will fear being on the receiving end of horde gankers. Could be it's the same on both sides but my general impression have been that there is a higher degree of gankers on horde side. I expect lots of /spit falling on my little gnome head lol.
---
Spam BRD. Spam Strath. Spam BRS. Rinse. Repeat.
---
I get that Blizz is really trying to avoid having to split servers up after release and they are trying to gauge the attrition rate of players.. but I really think that Herod is going to be WAY too big, even after the initial rush. Based on 2+ hours of a 10,000+ queue on the launch day, there have to be well over 100K people who prepaid and rolled on Herod. 
---
Now, maybe the vast majority of those are retail players who reserved their names just because they could... but eventually, people are either going to be forced off herod due to phase 2 login queues or Blizz is going to have to split that server somehow.
---
Are Elemental or Enhancement shaman viable in PVE?
---
How is this relevant what so ever? You know the original characters of the first stages of development were all tracer models. No Junkrat.
---
Fun fact for sure but it is not really backing up anything related to the intended server setting lol.
---
Unless you're bold enough to imply the game was not originally planned to habe orcs as a playable race, then we have some spicy meatballs.
---
The Manual Crowd Pummeler has a 3charge on-use which significantly boosts attack speed.
---
Honestly I would listen to the Lord of the rings audio books
---
Spell reflect = tbc no?
---
Request duel while being on Zepelin. Jump out before takeoff... priceless
---
That's why I put Orcs first.
---
I haven't loaded any macros or addons yet either. The limited time I had during the stress test was spent getting a feel and a plan for what launch will be like. I won't worry about add-ons till much later. Farting around with them early on is a distraction imo. Maybe a bar addon is worth it, even that I won't worry about before level 20.
---
I will keep y’all posted. It was surprisingly harder than I thought. They’ve basically wiped the delivery address from all the local delivery options, so I ended up ordering a gift basket from a local place and I’m just having it go to the PO Box address.
---
I still have my original paper one but unfortunately no box. The manual was kept because my mom thought it was a book during a move years back.
---
Our guild had a Druid Code of sorts.......anytime someone died in raid, we would tbag them in bear form for a few seconds before continuing on.
---
I would imagine a sharpening stone to be the best (the one with 5% crit). They usually cost &lt;10g. Especially for horde rogues with WF
---
The layout of Stormwind and Ironforge, Orgrimmar is just a mess and the other cities are empty.
---
shutup stupid robot
---
Didnt they stop in wod?
---
Because it’s splits the LFG player pool into those that have the add on and those that don’t
---
Always gonna be workin for the weekend with me. Seeing Chris Farley.
---
I think they're probably second overall if you want something reliable like dungeon farming (Mara is the go to place).  Only Mages beat them, but Mages beat everyone unless Blizz nerfs DM
---
&gt; And interest for Vanilla happened when TBC released, not 4 years later.
---
Seriously, I don't know why people think the demand for Vanilla servers is anything new. People have wanted older versions of the game since there have been older versions. If Blizzard's decision to make Classic was based only on players demand we'd have had it ages ago. Which is why I'm convinced the unsung hero in all of this is Jagex, who proved that an old school version of an MMO can be commercially viable.
---
Looking forward to a significant part of a game that I’ve not played in 15 years makes me casual? Gtfo with your retail attitude.
---
I would imagine each layer acts independtly with its own spawns, that's why in videos we've seen of layering thing disappear.
---
No the OP of the infographic did that already, combined he rounded up to 3% drop rate.
---
Mostly IRL stuff I've to do
---
Isn't the issue with Eranikis his fear on the tank? You need some way for the tank to break fear or someone has to off tank him for 15 seconds or wtv..
---
Time to go full circle.
---
I am playing devil advocate. You are allowing someone to play worse by choice not worse by skill.
---
Jump cult. How can I join it!
---
Pretty much. Basically for displaying server &amp; faction in a pretty fashion.
---
Awesome :)
---
I am ally really but the horde sign is so much cooler :( lol
---
Nah man, my name was taken on Stalagg as well..
---
Thats where I found the spells for sure, and a good description of what it is. But I can't find any reference to any spell haste on gear yet.
---
spell reflectors are a thing in classic

Found the guy who is real insecure about playing PvE.
---
Nobody cares dude. Play PvE. Enjoy your game. Dont need to defend it like this.
---
[This](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Macro_API) would be a good start. A few basics though (can't rewrite the whole lot for ya, sorry :P)-
---
- **/petattack** makes your pet attack your target
---
- **/cast &lt;spell name here&gt;** casts the designated spell, pretty sure it uses max rank by default but you should be able to specify with &lt;spell name&gt;(Rank n)
---
- **/TargetLastTarget**, **/TargetLastEnemy**, etc replaced the forms that you've used
---
- **CastPetAction(2)** and the like have been replaced with direct commands, ie **/petfollow**, **/petpassive**. Cast pet abilities with **/cast**.
---
Just a few other notes on *how* you're using things too-
---
&gt; ~~/script CastPetAction(2)~~ /petfollow
---
&gt; This forces your pet to follow if follow is bound to pet action bar 2, while also casting drain soul to guarantee you get the killing blow.
---
What you're trying to do here is sound, but I'm 95% sure this method is unreliable. Unless I'm mistaken your pet will break off its attack yes, but if you/your pet gets hit again it's going to instantly re-engage. What you want is /petpassive, which will make your pet come back to you *and* stop it from re-engaging until you manually tell it to (I add /petdefensive to my /petattack macros to ensure my pet's behaviour is reset after using /petpassive). If you ever tell your pet to stay, use /petpassive AND /petfollow or it will just stand there like a berk rather than running back.
---
&gt; This will allow your pet to attack your target right as you start casting an offensive spell. **Put this macro on every damaging spell you will use.** Replace Spell Name with the corresponding spell.
---
#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
---
Bad Warlock, BAD! We don't do this, we control our pets manually. Combining things like this is lazy and gives you less flexibility in your actions. There will be plenty of situations where you want to cast something without your pet charging in, or you want your pet to attack before you do anything, or you want to attack a different target to your pet.
---
Let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to help :)
---
No, I'm actually looking to use it for a discord announcement. Something around 400x400 - 600x600
---
So use it with a two-hander instead of Righteousness? Or not?
---
Just like Korea...
---
r/TIHI
---
Ah then you never knew the joy of making mages destroy themselves for you
---
We'll have to agree to disagree about the merits and detractions of both classic and retail. At least we can agree that it's great we get the choice. For people like you, you can carry on playing and enjoying retail were vanilla will appeal to people like me. 
---
GL and HF out there in Azeroth buddy no matter which iteration you want to play.
---
Dude chill wtf. This guy just stated his opinion, are you 30 years old and this toxic?
---
You're right! :D The actual measurements are 94cm x 124cm so just a touch more than 4 foot by 3 foot.
---
Is WowMapper and ConsolePort for controller use going to work in Classic?
---
Also lots of people will be coming after seeing it get popular on twitch, or just from word of mouth.
---
Lmao all these points are why classic is great. If u don’t understand why having less flight points or having to run to dungeons is good then there’s nothing I can do for you little fella
---
Why does she even have a choker in the drawings?

---
Clearly.  Thing is I think I will enjoy his game — I did when I first played it.  I’m just saying people are forgetting the negatives, or at least glossing them over.
---
Another thing I didn’t mention — in response to at least some of these negatives, blizzard took the game in a certain direction, which I actually ended up not liking.  I think there could have been other things they did that would’ve improved the game besides just making the game into the unrewarding theme park that it is today.
---
I can do this for you, DM some images to me
---
I really hate that blizzard went with an immersion breaking interface instead of modifying summoning stones so you are forced to choose a role before queuing up. 
---
Even better would be a bulletin board that would allow players to reserve spots for a dungeon run in advance. There are many ways that blizz could've creatively made a better group finder but they took the lazy route by making players press a button to find an insta group. Such bullshit, it is like the developers don't even care about the in game experience.
---
If you know the probability of something happening, you can figure out the probability of it happening twice in a row by multiplying the probability with itself twice.
---
For example, it's a 97% chance of it **not** dropping. That means if you run it twice, the probability of it not happening twice is 0.97 \* 0.97 = 0.9409.
---
You can keep going with this. A year has about 52 weeks, so if you run it every week for 6 months, that's running it 52 / 2 = 26 times.
---
So, 0.97 \^ 26 = 0.45, or 45% chance of it **not** dropping when you run it 26 times.
---
To figure out the chance of it dropping then, you would subtract that from one: 1 - 0.45 = 0.55. So a 55% chance of it dropping when you run it 26 times.
---
What will be the difference in agility of 60 lvl Dwarf and NE hunter?
---
I think similarly and I know it’s kinda shitty but I don’t want someone copping everyone else’s gear whether it’s mine or not. Not all hunters are ninja looters but it only takes one to put a sour taste in your mouth and it happened to me in vanilla a couple of times.

So for SM that will be Brill for horde and what for alliance?  neighborhood hub.(at that level range)
---
Most dungs had elite trash making it hard or troublesome to reach dung alone. 
---
the stones are placed Before the dung trash up to portal (generally) 
---
so it did make sense to me, and still does
---
In BC my friend played a demo lock and would let his 3 year old farm honor in Bgs for him, she would run around aimlessly and the pets would do all the work.  He got a full set of PVP gear that way.
---
It’s almost as if I wish they canceled it so the entitled shits on this sub would get fucked.
---
Your first two words give you your answer. It’s subjective and based on taste. I happen to agree with you but there have been literally millions of people who rolled Normal and presumably had a wicked time.
---
Are you like a Microsoft trainer or something?  Such professional videos/presentations, watched all your Shaman ones!
---
Wrong again. Sigh...
---
There are ret paladin guides out there if you are interested in how all this stuff works together. I have no clue how ret works.
---
Do both at once and you'll go from 50 to 100% efficiency for more speed leveling time.
---
You know that dynamic respawn existed in Vanilla right?
---
You don't need to get it
---
/purr
---
I might build a stand so I can put my laptop in my treadmill and fish while I run
---
Btw - I’ve found far less people drop from dungeon groups on classic than on retail because you invest so much time to do the dungeon. So you can probs delete that point haha
---
Pretty easy assumption, bindings weren't in the original raid loot, they were added in patch 1.6. The same patch that introduced Blackwing Lair.
---
I got this.
---
1) Gather 40 people
---
2) Raid Moltencore and get lucky

...Doesn't make for an interesting post like this one though I reckon

"It's a hunter weapon too"
---
...should just go ***without saying***.
---
And when is he deleting the character?
---
That someone had to ask this speaks volumes about the current state of community in retail.
---
We are discussing the intended server type for The World of Warcraft in vanilla not your opinion or PvP and it's support in game.
---
People pay big money to collect all transmog. There's an addon called ALL THE THINGS that people use to 100% the game (this includes achievements, mounts, toys, transmogs...). Besides completionists, there are those who buy "slutmogs", like [the jade set](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/352310.jpg).
---
Honestly, I don't know why people pay for it. No one cares how you looks or what achievements you have nowadays. But hey, I got myself over 10 tokens doing so and I will be able to play Classic for over a year.
---
They’re estimating, just like us, but they do have better statistics. 
---
They don’t know if they’ll 500k or 5 million for the first month.
---
They were originally intended to be (and used as, technically[notreally]) a early form of the LFG tool. They matched you with other players looking to do that same dungeon.
---
 /cheer
---
Don’t tell all my secrets bro
---
An additional 10 people going dps to keep this scenario relevant?
---
You went to a lot of effort to just completely give up on presenting this reasonably.
---
That is entirely your choice, there is nothing forcing anyone to play like that, its just *gasp* what people *prefer*.  
---
As I said I've been able to add people from dungeons and talk to them during (or at least after) runs and done stuff in the future with them.
---
I feel like classic people are just grasping at straws for why classic is the second coming.
---
I played vanilla wow.  I can be the absolute first to tell you that the game was not in a good state compared to what standards today expect.  Play a hybrid?  Hope you like healing, because your tanking/dps are going to be incredibly subpar.  Like balanced pvp?  Haha, enjoy getting 1 shot by pom pyro mages or stun locked to death by rogues.
---
Have fun sitting in AV for 6 hours while accomplishing nothing.
---
People are letting nostalgia have entirely to much impact.
---
There will definitely be things people come up against that irritate them as you mentioned but the good obviously outweighs the bad. Your point re: the eventual direction of the game says oodles about what devs should keep in mind when listening to their player base.
---
If you can get the correct macro, yes. I'm not sure how it will work in the current day. But I know back in the day I just spammed a macro and could lay a trap instantly without even showing the FD animation.
---
wildstar? No mans sky? anything from bethesda after skyrim? I haven't played swotr but i've never seen anyone really complain about it, many evenm seem to like and enjoy it.
---
Used to be able to mind control cap while in eyes of the best and crash people to desktop and make that character unplayable till a GM resolved it for you.
---
Fact is this model was tameable in vanilla. How would you know if it’s Arikara or another sharing the same model but with slower attack speed?
---
You would know about most pets I’m sure but maybe not the one from a Horde-only quest that doesn’t look anything special when you don’t know what you’re looking for. If you played alliance you could have easily missed this one.
---
If the amount of people bitching versus the amount of people in support was what decided layering, we wouldn’t have layering. That’s not how it works though.
---
Idk if you need an audiobook specifically but if you have internet on your trip, I'd suggest the Nobbel lore videos. He has everything from general lore to specific lore on characters and events and he is pretty in depth
---
Summoning an infernal at a dungeon entrance as warlock
---
People overlook the fact that internet costs money too so it's not "just $15 a month" it's $15 on top of other monthly expenses and they add up quick. In my experience, that WoW subscription ended up saving me well over the $15 in a month by staying at home and not going out and spending.
---
Uh, no, stress test was nothing like pservers.
---
On pservers, literally every single spawn point of every single mob would respawn near-instantly. Stress test did not do anything close to that.
---
Server YourMom and the name is NotGonnaHappen.
---
At least, it is now.
---
"That's a 54.7% chance to drop after 6 months"  
---
That's not how %s work...
---
This + blessing of freedoms synergies best with war and rogue
---
What is a druid?
---
I distinctly remember reading that they did not know what else would be added, other than the original three options.  The point was the world, after all, and Warcraft was primarily a story franchise.  In Diablo II you don't need to play every character to get the whole story.
---
In Russia... wow plays you...
---
you do realise ''testing'' for blizzard is not what it once was. bfa had a beta. however they didnt listen to a single thing players submitted and posted about on the forums. it was purely to generate hype.
---
Yeah ignore the rude guy, I enjoyed talking with yah.
---
Thy do not summon people however
---
well druids pretty much just stealth to the last boss. But yeah they are soloable for any class that can do damage.
---
The meeting stones are there. But they don't summon.
---
I never placed it solely on him. The fact is though that the buck stops with him, because he is the top dog and has the most influence on the game.
---
The genre is only dying because the games are bad. It's not like teenagers don't exist anymore. Just wait unil Classic WoW starts growing after a couple months, instead of shrinking. Then there will be no doubt.
---
Meeting stones yes but they can not be used to summon. Just to meet.
---
Ya, I didn't even know I could've used wands till like level 30 or so, lmao.
---
I still slapped shit with my staff to raise that defense skill. You are gonna have to stop to drink in between kills so why not lower that health and eat while drinking too (it also took me a while to realize I could eat and drink at the same time)?
---
Embrace next week as the final week of peace for a good while.
---
You would think! Can’t get anything delivered to that address unless you’re talking to a local mom and pop on the phone that has delivery drivers. Which everyone just uses postmates and doordash around there it would seem. They tend to try and keep everything flowing through the shipping and receiving department, so I’m not surprised they worked so hard at scrubbing the option for delivery where they could.
---
Yes and yes. That said it shouldn't be so bad, you can replenish some in bgs with drain soul just before they die. Also I recommend putting a supply of shards in your bank as well for when you are farming bgs.
---
They are there, but you can't summon with them.
---
There is no sign of intelligence here anyways when you serious geniuses confuse chance with probability.
---
Server already opened -- roll Stalagg before its too late
---
Rogue is poop in PvP in 2019. Unless you like sitting in the flag rooms all day and instantly dying in WPvP if you don't open and have every Cd.
---
You say that but people keep upvoting shit memes. People just have really bad taste
---
You are, what some would say, beating a dead horse.
---
I don't think they can drop before phase 3.
---
Also you need BWL materials anyway.
---
Was a great interface, I'll use ElvUi but TukUi is even more similar to PfUI.
---
Found the official answer here: https://gitlab.com/shagu/pfUI/issues/1074
---
It happens though.  And when it does, it’s a pain in the ass.  I remember waiting for half an hour to an hour trying to get another member over to a dungeon, begging guildies, etc.
---
It is fixed.
---
I agree Jade Forest is a beautiful zone, but our favorite zones really seem to be correlated more with the social experience than the environment art. I started playing in WotLK and my first actual raiding experience was ToC. I have super fond memories of that raid and the surrounding outside area, despite it being a bit unconventional, because I had no idea what normal raiding was like at that time.
---
I'll miss it for sure in Classic, but finally getting to raid MC while it's still relevant will bring about new experiences that I'm really looking forward to.
---
Yes, but you can't use them to summon party members, that was added in the TBC pre-patch.
---
Wrong: Femtrolls look great in gear, only downside being the gross feet.
---
&gt;Featuring the return of slow travel and a level-60 cap, the upcoming release will be a major nostalgia trip for those who slowly lost all of their friends and gave up on their dreams as they spent countless hours grinding for loot in **beloved** dungeons like Blackrock Depths or **Uldaman.**
---
Well, I know the Onion didn't fact check that statement.
---
&gt;I HATE ART
---
what's going on???
---
Player retention over 3 months will not be high. Blizzard is expecting it and its obvious.
---
Everyone here seems to think this game is going to have million upon millions of players but it's not very realistic.
---
What nerf are you talking about ?
---
Ya they upped reputation gains in TBC. Very slow grind in vanilla
---
Catacylsm was when most of my friends quit, and when my server went on a massive population decline.
---
It was pretty well regarded as one of the worst expansions. WOD/Cata/BFA are easily the worst we've seen.
---
Eh I think a big amount of (potential) returning players haven't played retail for 5-10 years and thus aren't really following them on social media.
---
Paladins are a lot better at fighting undead. They gain like 3 or 4 abilities that only work on undead and demons.
---
If you’re already comfortable with MW click to growl, maybe ctrl+MW click could be a good pet stay option
---
lol, what are you talking about?
---
Still debating between hunter and druid.
---
I too noticed this persons awesome choice of server.
---
Hey, I really appreciate your team's work. I actually unsubbed from r/wow and have only been visiting this. I think you guys have a good balance that reflects the freedom of Classic WoW itself. I agree with what OP said regarding art. However, I would also caution against too many rules. I can't count how many subreddits I have left because the rules become silly.
---
Yeah they are. I cycle through sweatshorts not sweatpants, and I drink coffee now, not Mountain Dew.
---
I’m a 44 year old working dad, it will be hard enough getting some quality game time in as it is without having to have the few hours I manage here and there destroyed by being ganked continuously while I try to get some questing /grinding done.
---
Calme toi Bobby, tu joues à un jeu-vidéo. Respecte un peu les "neuneus normies qui puent la merde aux jeux-vidéos". Gonfler son égo par le fait de "tryhard" un jeu-vidéo, ce n'est pas très glorieux. D'autant plus que tu devrais savoir que WoW a justement été pensé pour ces "neuneus normies qui puent la merde aux jeux-vidéos" (Ce qui explique son succès colossal : il brasse large).
---
Que tu pestes le fait de jouer "pour le fun" confirme bien ce que je dis.
---
You consider a week off work a "head start"? You're going to have your mount within a few days if you don't need to go work.
---
Just don't buy anything you don't need to and play as much as you can, you'll get there. If he's also got a week off and he's rolling mage? You're probably fucked.
---
Not sure if you mentioned it, but an addon that is a MUST for me in retail is Consoleport. 
---
Wish it was available in classic
---
It means “enter here at your own risk” because they are overcrowded servers and will have long login queue times at launch.
---
On the flip side, after the tourists leave, you might be left with a healthy and vibrant server instead of a ghost town.
---
Be human - Win
---
&gt; My mother, 70, is starting to play WoW again with classic (we both played through TBC together). I was going to roll PvP but she wanted no part of a PvP server again. So PVE server it is. I am sure I’ll find some good guildmates/friends on any server, but she is only on one server.
---
Love reading things like this. I'm sure you'd rather blow through content (or at the very least roll on a different server like you mentioned) but instead you make changes to play with her. Warms my heart.
---
Interesting research, does the hunter data include melee weaving between shots or only range?
---
Also I'm still sceptical with this hybrid dps data. As you said, they are only spreadsheet simulation and without knowing every mechanic of every class, I would bet the data includes a lot of unrealistic variables like obtainable gear, buffs, maybe raid setup and so on.
---
If you took that into account and these are numbers that we could expect from hybrid dps - if they would put in the necessary effort - then that's awesome.
---
You don't have freedom of speech in a videogame pal
---
I think you should pass on Classic and just play retail.
---
LaYeRiNg iS gOiNG tO RuIN tHe GaMe!!!
---
wasnt it the inns that did that? shitty lfg thing
---
Well, why would a loot council give you gear over someone else when you're only making half the raids?
---
Find a guild that only runs when you're available, whether that's once a week on the weekend or whatever. It will be better for everyone involved imo. Or just do pugs. MC will probably be puggable pretty quickly, and you will be able to roll on stuff.
---
I feel the same way when I lose an argument but not that intensely. I just don't have a lot of room in my life for hate or being upset by words.
---
They have taken the bridge… and the second hall.
---
Silver\* or Gold\*
---
Wonder if there's a guide like this out there for Hunters considering the mechanics are probably the most significantly different for them between classic and pservers.
---
I kinda suspect that r/wow is deep in blizzards pockets. The rise of highly PG content and squashing of criticism drove me away from that sub.
---
You queue up at battlemasters in the cities.
---
This is evil. This is genius.
---
Its true but not like how people are thinking. After wow I did all the usual stuff. I drank, smoked, got laid, partied a lot. Bought a car, finished college. Got married, had kids, got divorced, got married again, had another kid, got divorced. Owned several houses, still owe three, no debt, I'm well within my means to retire and have been since I was 25ish. During WoW was the best time of my life, it was better than sex, it was better than drugs, it was better than relationships and kids, it was better than owning a home and driving a fast car. That is the depressing part.
---
As a fellow Wrath baby let me share my perspective. 
---
I was too young for Vanilla and too "cool" for BC. Once I started playing and realized how crazy fun it was, I was always a little disappointed that there was earlier content that I would never get to experience while it was relevant. It was fun running through the raids as a level 80 and collecting old tier sets, but I knew it wasn't the same feeling as going through them while they were relevant. Classic finally gives me that chance.
---
Not trying to push you into playing, just showing the other side of the coin.
---
Oce
---
I had a lot of fun being a Tauren.  The combo Warstomp -&gt; Lesser Healing Wave -&gt; Earthbind -&gt; Try to cast ghostwolf to run away/kite was a great time.
---
No no no no. Diapers.
---
Any warrior is good for tanking although Orc would be the best since it really fucks over rogues in the open world if they try to gank you
---
Summoning via meeting stones was added in BC. In Vanilla (and also in Classic I believe, didn't test them in the Stress test) they are used to be put into a que that forms a group with other que members, however it wasn't really good at synergizing classes/specs so it was usually never used by players, from my experience.
---
Thats nice. But now that you announced it... its not a suprise anymore :|
---
You'll be able to queue from cities. It was a *really* short timespan original in which you had to run to the entrance, they will not put that back in.
---
Council is not favoritism based, it’s community based. It’s goal is to maximize the guilds time by maximizing upgrades, while still gearing everyone up eventually
---
&gt;Hunters get bows before warriors and rogues, and warriors and rogues get melee weapons before hunters
---
This pretty much happens with DKP too, no warrior is going to be spending his DKP on a bow before most other pieces of gear.
---
&gt;let me just cherrypick to prove my point  
---
there is always the entrance for the area with dungeon in it. Its not like meeting stones were marked on the map. You already had to know the location.
---
Yes! at one time it definitely was ! you could get a little hark in 1000 needles looked just like him
---
he's too laży?
---
Both Normal and PvP existed from the beginning though.
---
There has been no info on future plans such as Classic+ or TBC, bugs should continue to be fixed to make the game as close to Vanilla as possible.
---
If you want to do the most DPS, play Warrior. If you want to tank, play Warrior. If you want to heal, probably Priest or Pally.
---
Layers will probably have less, I believe they are supposed to be per continent so I suppose 1.5k would make sense, in reality I bet it will be lower.
---
The casual guilds didn't mind back then, why will they now?
---
Yeah now you just have to deal with parents being torn away from their computer by their kids
---
Disagree.
---
Good thing I have Fire Emblem to play while I sit in queue =)
---
It was supposed to be huge. Game changer. I know myself and many others were very excited, especially anyone that played swg back in the day. Star Wars!
---
And then we joined and realized it was an online single player game modeled after WoW with some good voice acting.
---
hmm gotcha.  Not a huge deal on the turn in.  Those are typically easier to find.  It's more so that I don't miss a quest pickup.  Thanks for the info; I'll be giving it a shot once classic launches!
---
I don't want to join any guild that uses Loot Council. I would prefer some type of decaying DKP with the ability for someone to intervene if someone is being dumb and taking a massive upgrade away from someone. IE: A Rogue trying to take Cloak of the Shrouded Mists from a Hunter.
---
Back in the day the one single raid I missed in my entire career was the one in which the second binding dropped.  
---
Took me NINE YEARS to see it again.  
---
And ever since I've completed it, I've seen these drop a lot more on my transmog runs. On my paladin, first MC, both bindings dropped. On my warrior ? Same thing. Both bindings, the very same day.   
---
The others have at least one binding. And even for the amount of times I run Molten Core each week on various characters (those elusive classic plans ...) I had never seen the Eye of Sulfuras drop before I did it for the first time on my warrior. That run I saw Both bindings and the Eye. Go figure the abyssmal likelyhood of that happening.  
---
Didn't farm another Thunderfury after I completed my first but dropping the eye prompted me to blitz farm the Sulfuron hammer. I had bought the plan years ago, kept Sulfuron Ingots around in case it would happen. All I was missing was the Arcanite bars, and a couple of Blood of the Mountain.   
---
I seriously wonder if they upped the drop rates or if I'm just insanely lucky these days. Been farming Vanilla content while waiting for classic (collecting crappy transmog mostly that means) ... never saw that many epic/rare world drops drop. I mean even in Ulduaman I got a Pendulum of Doom on the 9th clear the first day I farmed XD.
---
To add a complete answer to all the semi-correct ones you got already:
---
A lot of warrior skills deal (Weapon damage+X) damage, most importantly the famous Mortal Strike. Weapon damage includes both the raw damage of the weapon itself (higher for slower weapons), and bonus damage due to your current attack power. Before Patch 1.8, weapon speed was also used as multiplier to your attack power (weapon speed * attack power/14), so a slow weapon would deal significantly more damage than a fast one with all your instant attacks. That meant that often a very slow weapon with lower DPS was much stronger than a (nominally better) fast weapon with higher DPS, especially in PvP where high burst rules it all. 
---
In 1.8, Blizzard tried to fix that issue by introducing weapon speed normalization. All weapons of one kind now have a constant multiplier to attack power that is used for instant attacks, i.e. all two-handed weapons use a weapon speed of 3.3 (3.3*attackpower/14). Now only the raw weapon damage itself depends on the weapon speed, and that means in most cases the weapon with the higher DPS is actually the better weapon, regardless of the swing speed. Only when comparing weapons with similar DPS you still usually want to prefer slower ones. 
---
As there is an abundant range of weapons with similar DPS to the Arcanite Reaper that don't cost half a leg and a fortune to make, I don't think the Reaper will see the popularity it once had for a while in real Classic.
---
The video is from May. They were simply referring to "layering" as sharding at the time because that was a term that more people were familiar with.
---
Whether he's come out and said that their plans have changed since then, I don't know.
---
You didn't like Skyrim 5.0 for the nintendo DS?
---
The sheet supports melee weaving (again, shoutout to those guys, setting the bar for spreadsheets), but I didn't include it. I'll rectify that for completeness when I get home.
---
Poor asshole has to cover for me 😂 he’s the supervisor, I’m lead hand.
---
Big yikes on this one
---
Not every guild is hardcore 5-day a week raiding guild. Most of those people will be socials and then there will be 2 raiding groups, I bet.
---
I only recognize KTM and DamageMeters.
---
Clearly you have never sucked down loot council member's  targelies, if you know what I mean.
---
What would be the best profs to go in order to help a guild get the mats and such for this and hand of rag? Sounds like the most helpful ones would be mining/alch but to level alch would be ridiculously expensive without herb as a gathering prof. I'm thinking of just double gathering herb/mining for the gold since I can gather any node on the map, and then use my smelting cooldowns to make bars where I can. Any opinions on this would be appreciated
---
Many of us here have played on private servers. It isn't like the last time anyone played at least a 95% recreation of vanilla was 15 years ago. People are playing vanilla today in fact.
---
i am hyped for no heirlooms !!! but getting all the flight paths is going to suck
---
&gt;Here are some examples:
---
&gt;much longer leveling (Joana's speed leveling guide, which I actually bought after I did many dumb things leveling my first character -- an undead warlock, advertised 1-60 leveling in 5 days /played -- 120 hours just to start the game, and that was speed leveling)
---
fewer flight points
---
fewer graveyards
---
mounts at 40/60 instead of 20/40
---
gold making is much harder and you really had to focus on it
---
requirement to grind for consumables for endgame
---
more gold sinks (repairs expensive, epic mounts hard to save for)
---
running to dungeons
---
people dropping during dungeons
---
more frequent dying/corpse runs
---
ability trainers
---
lengthy attunements
---
weekly raid lockouts
---
leveling crafting professions taking forever
---
probably tons more
---
Hmm what you and every other person saying "classic will be dead within 6 months" DONT understand - is that this list are the reasons we DON'T play retail or any other shitter mmorpg in 2019.
---
This shit you listed is what we want to play as an mmorpg. If someone seems that as time sinks - welcome to gaming.
---
I love that despite thots just being a meme,  people still be like " wamanz tooooooooo!!!!!"
---
We get it. The meme is funny how it is however,  get over it!
---
If your way of having fun is to min/max then go for it. If your way of having fun is to follow no specific plan in game then go for it. The World of Warcraft is your oyster regardless!
---
I liked Wildstar for the few hours I played it after it went F2P. The telegraphing feature was really nice. I think it's the first time I've seen telegraphs so clear in an MMO. On the down side, I've seen videos of PvP, and with so many telegraphs, it's very chaotic-looking.
---
It can also fix problems of people saving dkp and letting upgrades get sharded instead of used even for a little while. There are a number of items in each tier better than the previous tier's bis, but worse than current tier bis. So if everyone is saving for the same stuff, all that stuff just gets sharded and your guild isn't actually progressing.
---
I just wanted to encourage others who felt like doing the same as there’s only one work week left! If I posted after the fact it may be too late.
---
That's true for all of classic wow. Streamers on one, Brazilians and south Americans on another, cringelord white boys on another. 
---
I think we have a true Vanilla wow experience ahead of us!!
---
You made the classes sound a little unbalanced there. If you had to power rank the classes, how would it go?
---
It's not really about timing in the way you phrased it, unless I'm misunderstanding your point.
---
Wow, Reddit is life for this guy.
---
I lean towards pfquest/codex generally, because of the precise mob locations and searchable database if your farming specific mobs/resources. The downside is when your tracking multiple quests it can get spammy and hard to tell the dots apart, so you have to toggle individual quests on/off. I like how questie uses little icons for different quest types (gathering, kill, loot) and that makes it a bit cleaner when there's a lot going on (but of course it doesn't display every location so there's less clutter) If codex had some options for these dots where you could customize them a bit more instead of just clicking to change color, maybe showing quest type (a letter instead of a dot perhaps? hard to say what would look best/simple) that could be a possible improvement. Also when using QuestLogEx it doesn't show the toggle options, but when I click the quest tracker frame for the quest it opens a broken default blizzard questlog but does show the toggle buttons. I didn't get to try the latest version so maybe this is fixed.
---
What server and in-game name do you use? I want to.... be friends.
---
This sadly happens to almost every sub once it gets bigger. Hope it doesn't happen here. Reddit is strange, smaller subs usually have great insight, then when they become bigger it becomes arts and crafts and memes.
---
haha yeah what a retard providing content for other people for free stupid streamer haha
---
Biggest disadvantage of rolling Horde. Ragefire Chasm sucks :(
---
Or be orc and resist the stun, or be dwarf and stone skin..
---
The solution to your problem is to use weighted numbers. Nobody here seems to get what I mean. If you have 1 name reserved on one server and 2 somewhere else you count as 1/3rd of a player. i.e its 33% chance that you will play on that server. 
---
If you have 1 name on the server and one somewhere else you count as 1/2 of a player. 
---
That way the reserved names would be some sort of estimation of actual population come launch.
---
Consoleport can handle up to 40 bindings.
---
I think it will be enough.
---
It was back only for people who were on closed beta. And it ends today.
---
You miss the part:BFA was a disaster
---
True, but not in phase one. Also you really don't get enough honor from leveling to compare with like an afternoon in BGs.
---
That and hunters wear lots of leather (at least pre raid gear) and compete with rouges warriors and ferals for it
---
&gt;I have a friend with the exact same mindset as you though and he ended up quitting WoW but he's the type that cares more about winning on demand and not really having to struggle for what he wants. But to me that's where a lot of the fun comes from, overcoming those odds and prevailing.
---
I think we have the same friend. One of mine thinks the game is broken because pvp doesn't have a cooldown to avoid getting camped.
---
Glad I made a priest!!
---
Scatter/trap DR was in during Vanilla 1.12 and it sounds like they will not fix it. It was changed at the pre-patch for TBC. I think they should fix it since it seems more like it was a bug at the time. 
---
Duels are a terrible way to judge how a hunter is in wPvP and BGs. The limited range takes away the ability to kite effectively.
---
I always loved Darkshire because I love the spooky feel it reminds me of halloween. So Hallow’s End in Darkshire is like my absolute favorite part of WoW. 2nd favorite is IF during Feast of Winter Veil.
---
HYPE !!!! Woooooo
---
Do we know (have a guess) as to what population number constitutes full vs high? Are we talking 50k people, or like 12k? 
---
Im being serious.
---
This is great thank you! Yeah I tend to go for the laziest macro setup possible so linking petattack to every spell was my way of putting it on cruise control. I will rework some of these macros tonight and get them updated in the google doc.
---
Yeah, he has almost no chance then if you're talking about the lvl 40 mounts. You'll be level 40 in a few long-play-session days and you'll probably have nearly enough gold  by then already.
---
wtf is wrong with the face on the newer model
---
People have been misunderstanding a bit and this is just an example, but in private servers it was very very common for items like this to sell for ridiculous prices if you caught the market at the right time. 
---
I've sold many stacks of iron ore for 10g but no, it doesn't happen every day. Iron is the example, it can apply to anything that is relatively uncommon when the server first opens.
---
I know of a ton of players from retail that just simply reserved names with no serious intention of playing a lot in classic. could be a significant portion of people from retail just doin that.
---
Y’know people can play and enjoy both, right? You are forbidden from one if you play the other.
---
I am in the same boat. I don’t have as much time to play and for every great and fun PvP experience, I have been not just ganked, but camped. I usually ended up logging out or switching characters at that point.
---
Lol add me at launch! Theophillus the undead priest
---
I vaguely remember you would get a repair bill if some1 mind controlled you and guards then killed you. I might remember wrong tho.
---
You also used to be able to write alot of spaces behind a whisper, making your next text arrive on the next line. This made it so you could fake a whisper from some1 else. Easy to figure out but still turned peoples heads
---
Ah yes the terrible %s.

Just having the world be dangerous makes the experience so much better for me.  Sure, every once in a while it's rough (phase 2 will be a bloodbath, and may be really hard for non pvpers who really don't like the thrill).  But most of the time you'll have a few extra deaths/kills/sidetracks that feel like quests themselves.
---
You might get run off your favorite grinding spot, group with someone who also got run off, spend the night with them tracking down the guy who ran you off....finally killing him and reclaiming the spot...just to find it's time to go to bed.  But it's going to be hard to sleep because your thinking about how amazing your game time was.  So much better than if you had just kept grinding and got an extra bubble or two.
---
Also know that skinning will not give you the materials to make cloth armor. I made the same mistake coming from EQ1. Skinning is for leatherworking, cloth is for tailoring and it drops off humanoid mobs.
---
For sure man, enjoy the free meal :)
---
I see that you too are a man/woman of culture.
---
IDK why anyone is surprised by this, there are so few servers compared to modern WoW, and even the people who don't really care about classic are still creating chars with intentions of trying it because of all the hype.  The real telling story of population health will be in 2-4 months.

You're most welcome :) There's a bit of trial &amp; error involved with writing macros, so it's best done in-game where you can test it live....which is obviously a bit difficult for most of us right now. I need to update a lot of my old ones too, which is what I'll be doing at launch (plus configuring addons) because I'll have a few spare hours before my friends can play.
---
Where's BFA? And it starts with cata? Lame.
---
Nope, they are spot on.  I quit several times telling myself to never play again because I had no social life. Yet here we are.
---
&gt; However, you can do the same on an RP realm, which has more features and the same gameplay
---
RP also has like... all the furries and shit.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA you know whats even worse... I started streaming because on the chance I become successful. I can justify playing 8 hours a day. Maybe I  should have said I was a recovering neck beard. Thought I was out of the game. Then they pull me back in with this shit. lol
---
Because it doesn’t matter on trash if the healer is paying attention, and it makes the run a lot faster
---
Implying you have the mana for that many moonfires.
---
I think most people are drawn to classic *because* of the things you see as negatives, not in spite of it.
---
Fair enough haha
---
If it helps with you acceptance of UD on the horde, remember that the forsaken start with ‘neutral’ reputation with the other races and vice versa.
---
My wife and I play together, I usually play something tankie  and she plays a healer. We have fun for years with this formula.
---
Exactly the same boat as you, except I never gathered the mats specifically because I didn't expect to get the second binding any time soon.
---
I ended up getting the second binding on a random run in WotLK.
---
Step 5 should be step 2.
---
Also, half the raid will have WotF anyway.
---
Ahh, remember when it was feasible to chart out every item that drops in a tier and plan out who should get it? No, "but what if a base item drops first, then a titanforged one?" No, "but you got the heroic version, so we'll give the mythic version to the next one in line.
---
BiS lists are my most hype thing coming back.
---
Yeah but the question is: Is this old style queue where you are waiting for people to log off to get in, or new style queue where it's just load balancing and is constantly moving forward. (Former is what we are used to, latter is what should happen with layering)
---
So what should i do for professions then
---
-2/10
---
Really depends on how long you will be 60 before phase 2 starts. If it's going to be awhile then getting a regular epic mount seems prudent since saving time is good for making money and sanity. Don't forget the warlock mount doesn't take up bag space
---
Good lord...this kind of incompetence is why everyone wants #nochanges.
---
All the points you made on why vanilla was bad, are all the changes they made to retail that ruined the game.
---
this is bad bait and you should be embarrassed.
---
Read this with Bane's voice:
---
«It was depressing for you, not for me.»
---
listen
---
we will do our best and the groove we got goin is all that matters
---
It's not like I can look into the future and see if they are going to end up being assholes or not.
---
👌🏼
---
I still don't understand why legion got so much positive reaction. Maybe I was just burned out after all these years, but I couldn't stand the expansion at all. Since that expansion I couldn't immerse myself anymore at all.
---
People will probably use it yet (for some time atleast) because of the large amount of new players.
---
They know if you are logging into characters in retail or in classic.  They don't have to make the knowledge public, but they have those play time metrics on yours and everyone else's account.
---
So tailor enchantor for professions
---
Good job, i think you managed to get a tattoo that is representative, doesn't make me cringe, and can look interesting even to people who know nothing about WoW.
---
Really good job
---
Because clearly ideas only happen in a vacuum. -_-
---
The people who have left wrote down those ideas and didn't keep them all in their heads.
---
About tree fiddy
---
Give me Wrath Classic or give me death.
---
oh ok, sorry
---
That's the problem, I'm about 85ms to pacific and was about 105-110 east. I know it's not as vital to wow as it is to a twitch shooter, but I'll have to test it personally. I can't stand lag. It ruins the game for me. If I can feel a difference it'll be no bueno.
---
People who weren't healers*
---
Great list, I'll start looking at them.
---
Is there is Central installer for add-ons or I'll just find a YouTube on how add-ons install and work.
---
Mmh, yaoi
---
Yeah, I'm rolling human as well. Fear Ward is great, but everyone and their brother will be rolling dwarf. I also value the 10% rep gain over the marginal advantage Fear Ward gives.
---
Perfect. Just the information I was waiting for weeks to see someone compile together. 
---
I still can't decide where to be a druid and meme feral dps or a rogue. Was leaning towards rogue the last few days and you got me all confused again.
---
Still great job researching this. even if numbers should be taken with a grain of salt.
---
I have friends that never ended up playing that game because of this. It really sucks when you can't create a character on the server that ALL of your friends play on because it's full. Kinda bullshit.
---
Yeah I've been wondering that, I find it very odd I don't think it will be coming back, at least not for same account transfers.
---
If it does I won't care much as I'm really not into having a bank alt, but I can see hardcore players being really upset about it though having to wait an hour to get back whatever item they need from their lvl 5 enchanter alt lmao.
---
I think it is considerably more expensive than 10s.  
---
I  was thinking 1g, or even 10g , correct me if I am wrong
---
May the Lord have mercy on your soul
---
Perfect, thank you! The fishing tip in particular is 👌🏻
---
Yes, it won't be the same if everyone already already knows her location
---
Unbelievable! This is an amazing piece of Art!
---
It wasn't ready in the beta or stress test, but will be when the game launches.
---
Except there are stories all the time on this sub about the exact same things happening in vanilla in DKP systems. So if your argument is only that “assholes can abuse the system,” that’s true in both situations. 
---
Given the assumption you aren’t playing with complete tools (seriously though, flirting?), loot council is better for the overall progression of the guild.
---
I think you've got the wrong outlook / selling points for your friends. It's important to pace yourself during the leveling process if you intention is to prevent burnout and enjoy the game.
---
Leveling is an awesome part of the game that should be enjoyed, and you should be relaxed while doing it. You shouldn't feel like you need to hit 60 so you can finally "run dungeons and relax". You can run dungeons while leveling too. Those can be some of the most fun dungeon experiences.
---
Still, there is plenty to do at 60. Dungeons and PvP are the primary group activities though, so if you're not into PvP, that's unfortunate. Many peoples' incentive to get gear is for PvP. Plenty to do in Dungeons though, and down the road, people might be interested in raiding, which can be epic. For many, the ultimate endgame is Raiding and PvP.
---
There is no must do daily maintenance, unless you want to make it that way. I hated daily quests and world quests in later expansions for that reason. Obviously there are raid resets so a lot of people optimize their schedule around that, but that's more like a weekly thing. Also if you're like me and don't want to feel like you \*need\* to log in, consider staying away from professions that have a 24-48 hour cooldowns, such as Alchemy or Tailoring. I.e. Transmute Arcanite and crafting Mooncloth, etc.
---
Oh damn, thats big! From what I understood, failing a powershift would be a big dps loss due to setting your swing timer to that of your caster form. Seriously considering rolling feral for p1 and going back to my main (warrior) later on.
---
&gt; World pvp is the best way to play the game
---
I started in Wrath, but world pvp still happened plenty on PvE servers.
---
The difference is on a PvE server you can decide if you want to deal with it or not.  For people that might only be able to play a couple hours after work some night thats a very appealing option.
---
Except that doesn't work with vanilla. All you do with merges or connections is ruin the community. Get rid of layering over a couple months or so and have one server with 2500 people at peak times and you will have a good community. Have 5 servers that lose most of their people over that same couple months and then jam them together and you have chaos. 
---
Layering is a decent solution to the issues they face, and will be gone by the time most people are getting to 60 anyway.
---
That's just awesome!
---
Why is being hardcore tryhard considered not fun?
---
How about you call gameplay styles what they really are, Hardcore vs Casual.
---
Literally just logged in on Herod and got Fartmuncher.  Thanks for the idea, folks!
---
Won't even need to waste time with ww axe after getting corpse. Just run ulda for your next 40+ wep
---
Why not?
---
Ya, but this time will be different! I can stop any time I want!
---
When cyclone was introduced feral druids would stop fighting other druids, just because they could hibernate spam + cyclone spa, that was really fun to do in bg.
---
For me personally the gear grind and raiding is pointless if i don't get to use the gear to crush others.
---
Haha I forgot actually how many times we had to stop dungeons because someone had to eat.
---
A single Enhancement shaman that totem twists, while wielding Annihilator/Nightfall and working in some chain heals between melee auto-attacks is viable. I, personally, think a 0/22/29 enhancement/resto hybrid (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbdVMZV0et0xa) is the most viable en Shaman build. A more pure Enhancement build based on DPS is probably not viable due to poor DPS numbers. Ele has great burst DPS, but unfortunately they go OOM super fast, they don’t have great raid viability. You can read more about the different favors of Enhancement Shaman here: https://forum.classicwow.live/topic/823/enhancement-shaman-raid-and-world-boss-guide
---
Life, uh, finds a way
---
I only discovered classic about 2 months ago.  Really glad I found out recently, can't imagine how much it'd suck to have to wait since the announcement.
---
How dare you ? You don't know what shame it is, for minorities.
---
DKP incentivizes you to hoard it for that one item you want. Why spend my hard earned points on a slight upgrade when there is a chance my BIS will drop?
---
Problem is then some people might have to go all the way back to their starting zones for class quests. So then you're sitting around waiting for them to get back.
---
The way I look at is, it's going to take 150-200 hours for most people to level to 60. It's just more efficient to spend the first 2 in your starting zone, then hook up with your friends for the rest of the journey after.
---
Thank you! I hope they like them as much as the fun I had making them ^^
---
It's been confirmed in blue posts though that the actual minimum is 15g, sourced within the site I linked.
---
My whole group of friends decided to go from Herod to Stalagg when that server was released. The writing is on the wall for Herod to be insanely populated.
---
Have people that will be joining your guild, funnel you money til you have 10 silver. Gotta recruit up front. Otherwise, you should have 10 silver by level 6ish.
---
HA.  Plenty of people obviously got the joke based on the upvotes.  But mods on a pointless power trip are what keep the internet running I guess.
---
And we will see a lot less people pirating this type of server and we will save legal costs.
---
Plus we can hype up different events so people will train and we will make millions of dollars before we even launch.
---
This is exactly what happened.
---
A lot of the dungeons are some distance away from the stone -Wailing Caverns for example, instance entrance is deep in the cave and the meeting stone is about 100 yards away from the cave entrance.
---
Sadly i don't think you will be wrong about herod
---
You probably won't want to go further than 5 on your keyboard, but everything before that is fair game. If it helps, use ctl, shift, and alt, and you should be able to keep wasd, but since you don't really want to keyboard turn, a and d are sometimes rebound as well.
---
It wasn't an event. It was a bug that almost crippled the game. You're confusing Corrupted Blood with the Scourge Invasion world event before Wrath launched.
---
I think the best way to get into trying it is to just use 1-9 on your keyboard instead of clicking. Once you’re used to that move on to baking in shift/ctrl/alt variables.
---
&gt; unless you have some sort of chance on hit weapons and/or trinkets, I dont its use.
---
SOR procs weapons and trinkets tho. So SoR increases proc chance by 100% vs 40% SotC.
---
Yep... I go on deployment 2 weeks after launch. Zero internet where I’m going. 😭
---
&lt;MUSCLE DWARVES&gt;

EU - Mirage Raceway PvE [Alliance]
---
What up? We're a bunch of cool Dwarves and Gnomes who are looking for other cool Members of the Alliance who want to hang out in our party mansion. Nothing elvish. Dwarves in good shape encouraged. If you're human, you should be able to find humor in the little things. Again, nothing elvish."
---
Druids okay so long as you spend as little time as an elf as possible. Bears and Trees are practically Dwarves. Elves are not
---
We're looking to maintain a chill social atmosphere with semi-casual endgame content. Mostly focused on building a chill and enjoyable community to be a part of, who help each other out and get a good name on the server for ourselves. Raiding for fun and progressing as a group rather than min-maxing every last detail. We won't make you play something you don't want to, or push you to raid 5 nights a week, but when you do turn up we expect you to be prepared, present and focused.
---
https://www.guilded.gg/MUSCLE-DWARVES/games/WowClassic
---
https://discord.gg/yKYQF4q
---
Professions will be everyone's individual responsibility in some respect, due to everyone trying to establish themselves at different times as they hit 60 throughout P1.
---
Lol I was just joking at my past selfs expense.
---
Dominos is running a 50% off sale that week. 
---
THAT'S the efficient leveling.
---
I can't comment on EU, only NA. But i'm playing on FULL Herod. And i'm not upset about competition in the slightest. Because that means the AH is just as flooded, which means even if you got the mats, you wouldn't be able to profit off of them as much as you would on a dead server. Everybody benefits from cheap mats, unless your rp goals are to herb and mine all day.
---
I know exactly what  you mean.  Ive played on PvP servers on retail, ive played with Warmode on a fair amount...and i just dont want to deal with that all the time on Classic.  
---
I still more than expect world pvp to happen, it did when i started playing in Wrath on a PvE server.  I just dont want to be forced into it when i have a limited time to play after work some night and i just want to relax.
---
I am running a couple of UI related addons (Dominos, OneBag etc.), but nothing like any of the quest/zone guide ones.
---
7 hours? Amature.
---
Shaman's don't need a code for this to happen.  Shamans are unified and never fight each other on the field of battle.  Shaman &gt; Druid.
---
My friends send me Venmo requests to split a $6 Uber.
---
I'm confused how this post meats literally any of those conditions.
---
Being able to “decide” if you want to deal with it or not on a PvE server, takes away the PvP aspect of the game. 
---
The fun of world PvP is being forced to deal with the opposite faction, calling in team members to fight a common enemy.
---
And two people don't know the way to the instance, but the tank already went ahead.
---
Speedrun timers.
---
100% agree. I can’t stand all the art.
---
My bad about nightfall - that will hurt casters a bit, fixing it tonight.
---
Ill also add the comment about healers providing SW, good call.
---
I absolutely loved my drood. Clearly not the most powerfull class. But during dungeon, that feeling when you save your group by putting a heal here, tanking a mob there. It was the best.
---
Now I want to roll a NE Hunter......
---
Where the whoooorde at
---
Add new content but not any gear with increased stats
---
I REQUIRE FOOT FAN ART OF FEMALE NIGHT ELVES AND CHIBI'S PLEASE. WILL PAY MONEYS, WITH JAINA WHITE HAIR NODDING THING
---
No it wont lmao find me a source.
---
No the point of layering is to not have too cramped zones. The queues are just added because they don't want to many people on the same server. So long queues at launch makes people go to other servers. I don't think there will be any queues after a couple of days because the layering can take care of all the players that decide to stay.
---
Because some people are wimps that are afraid of some action, literally choosing to skip half of what the game has to offer.
---
/s-not-really
---
What is the scale on the left? Individual searches? Is it scaled by x10, 100, 1000? Great pattern but just curious on magnitude.
---
Wasn't the entire time retconned to be in service to the Legion, just so they could be used for an Artifact quest, last expansion?
---
Pretty sure it was like 2 hours.
---
I don't think anyone's outrageous but I honestly don't even remember my autogenerated names anymore. I remember my friends Hambone, Happyslap, and Dzo though.
---
Just quit school no one ever learned nothing from school I didnt go 2 school

---
I am having my first child in December. Wish I could play WoW with her.
---
Just the PSA: you do realise that this will not be happening in Classic - UNLESS the devs WANT it to happen - it was classified as a bug and was therefore patched. The version we're playing with will not let this happen ;)
---
Everyone have their own keybinds. Just experiment with different keys until you find something you like. Personally my favorite keybinds for spells are §12345qertfgzxcv, mousebuttons( have 5 on my mouse). Also use ctrl, alt and shift as modifier to reuse any of the mentioned keybinds for even more possible keybinds.
---
&gt;  Should I continue to use W,A,S,D with Q,E strafe and thumb on spacebar to jump to move or do people typically rearrange their movement keys?  
---
Use what you like but I would suggest switching S and D into strafe. You don't need any keybind for turning. Just use the mouse.
---
Definitely gonna mess with this with my main. Very cool to know
---
“You can be hard-core without caring about speed or raiding” 
---
That word. I don’t think it means what you think it means
---
When did guards get beefed up perception?  I remember rogues killing bankers
---
Leeroy
---
[My troll](https://imgur.com/wfReaLN)'s going to look as close to my original retail main as possible.
---
that's unfortunate
---
Right?  People cry "try hard" all the time in video games.  Fuck off mate, a 16 year old kid just won 3 million dollars, more than you'll ever make in your lifetime at your shitty job, for winning a single Fortnite tournament.
---
So you stay up and get no sleep before work?Really?
---
Pretty much this, though it's really that every single one I've played with is dogshit at the game. Whenever I'm a healer in a dungeon, and if the tank is from Ragnaros I leave asap.
---
I still drink Mountain Dew.  Evolution can bit me.
---
personally for me I just got a mouse with buttons for 1-10 and then for extra action bars I just set them to use ctrl/shift/whatever
---
ever since ive gotten the buttons on the mouse ive never been able to go back, but that's just me
---
Cool! Will add support in a future build then!
---
 It sounds like layering makes people concerned about not seeing the same community every day. Why can't they do something like have 5000 players put into a "group" and then if the activity of those players drops to 2500, combine it with another 2500 group, to keep the 5000 player experience consistent and not break up groups of people?
---
Same
---
Right at launch
---
&gt; Don't learn new ranks of your abilities after changing spec 
---
I totally forgot about this one.
---
I would stick with the general template WoW players have been using for years when it comes to guild recruitment.
---
Casual, Semi-Hardcore, and Hardcore. Can google these but:
---
Hardcore is racing for server/world firsts
---
Semi-hardcore is a competitive raiding or PvP guild that clears content but on a scheduled weekly basis, not rushing
---
And Casual is maybe dabbling in raids, doing some BGs recreationally but not dedicating a lot of time to improving in either.
---
What exactly does it automate?
---
I’m trans and I love wow
---
I usually use WASD (A, D strafe) and space for movement, Q,E and F for split second abilities, CTRL + same for split second cooldowns, 1-6 for spammable, like primary dps stuff and CTRL + 1-6 for less urgent cooldowns like damage boosters and such.
---
 At Blizzcon 2013, a fan asked J. Allen Brack for vanilla WoW. The answer was: "you think you do, but you don't".
---
In 2017, Chuck Norris gave J. Allen Brack a call and said: "You know what? I miss the old Barrens chat..."
---
in fairness, that talk was pre-beta and idk how it actually turned out. Other players are saying reality didnt match the intent
---
Thanks I remember seeing this a week or so ago.  Looks like a bit of an undertaking to use, but may be worth it to help prevent some perceived biases people may think loot council has.
---
Never
---
Starting an apprenticeship hopefully beginning next year, till then I'm studying in Uni.
---
As such, I'm probably gonna play a shitton of WoW for now and then reduce it incrementally. I'll be fine.
---
Actually for warrior I'll prefer stam + spirit on my gear till about 25. Bigger difference than a bit of strength can give. Instead just get a high dps weapon.
---
One does not simply forget where ManKrik left his Wife (Womankrik?) at.
---
Luckily, while it's still not fully respected to have an social life online, it's much more accepted these days.  Wholly a different time.
---
I'll be sure to attack every Druid I see from now on so this won't be a thing
---
BGs are phase 3. MC will have been out for months and is 100% faceroll. Dire Maul will have even been out for a while.
---
How are you getting such similar results for MCP vs No MCP for spelladin?
---
MCP is hundreds above Flurry Axe / Hanna / Ironfoe, not just 13.
---
No, Staysafe said on stream that the yoga gang told him the ooga gang died with the beta
---
You're not wrong, but people overall devote less time to games than they used to I think, so even Classic WoW can feel like too much for a lot of people.
---
I'm fully aware of what it was, and it didn't "almost cripple" shit. It disrupted the use of the main cities for a couple of days. Ironically as a whole, the community thought that it was pretty cool. It's what inspired the pre-wrath event in the first place. Were you even playing then? Because I was, and it sounds like you read this shit in some article.
---
I never got to experience this originally and looking forward to the thrill of the potential to get murdered. I was hesitant at first given I'm not sure how much I'll play everyday but then realized I think PVP servers are the best way to experience the game.
---
100% this! I was so pumped for AoC and still stuck with it until level 40 or so but idk how I did looking back.
---
reaper is still BiS for orc warriors pre-raid i belive but the real issue you run into is simply cost. people will rather get a lionheart helm first while grinding out the weapons then you will enter the raid.
---
it is just a stacking effect where it becomes unlikly that you will find yourself in a seat where you will have the money and need to get a reaper inorder to step up in DPS.

Update*  All the Big streamers are going Faerlina, none on Herod.
---
Faerlina is now unbalanced 55 ÷ ally / 45÷ horde
---
There is no low pop server mannn :p thats what i am saying add more realm so that we have a choice
---
To illustrate, I never saw a single binding drop in over 100 MC runs in 2005-2006 and 2013-2019. (with many breaks in between)  Note: I was a warlock or mage, it didn't affect me, and the guilds I was in did get bindings, just never when I was in the raid. 
---
Now I think of it, I'd better not mention this to guilds in classic, they might start to blame me when we don;t get bindings.....  :D
---
Huh? Not rolling on an item is exactly the situation you’re saying you don’t want because then loot gets sharded. Additionally there 100% are crap items that are in no way BIS for ANY spec but upgrades if you’ve still got a green or bad blue.

Start them as Tauren, so the +15 Herbalism helps them grab Earthroot early and not be discouraged.

Hurricane, moonfire and wrath...that's pretty much all they had.

God, I would be depressed if I played a shaman with the five elements set.  That shit was garbo.
---
all very true
---
Yeah you're probably right. I do think that people are underestimating non-optimal specs though. And by people I mean my friends. And by non-optimal I mean ret pallys. And by underestimating I mean forcing me to play warrior.
---
LOL
---
Of course individuals have some responsibility.  But, if I go mining/herbalism to fill the guild bank while levelling, should I not expect a ROI when I switch to BS at 60?

There's a private RP-PvE server called Turtle WoW which actually implements the dark(er) nights and the survival secondary profession (building torches and boats &amp; tents to rest in the wilderness)

what does "FULL" means? no new characters can be created on that server?

Like, what does a full server mean? I won't be able to create my character there or will I just endure queues?
---
they implied it would be more consistent, but it sounds like the implementation in beta failed to live up to that

you'll find your game

Ya i hate it. I never use the launcher. I just right click the icon in my system tray. Even if the last thing i played is classic when i select wow, it launches BFA.
---
ah, that explains where I had the 1g and 10g  numbers from, ty
---
Classic wow from a difficulty standpoint is the easiest the game ever was. Min maxing your race is quite literally not needed. If your guild can’t kill onyx is due to a lack of dwarf priests, get better tanks.
---
I hate to be this guy, but have you ever even played wow? Let alone classic? Or are you just parroting what you’ve read/heard? 
---
Even at the top, your vodka, limit, BL, method, Exorsus type guys will tell you they don’t need racials to kill a boss. They do it so they maybe kill the boss on attempt 567 as opposed to attempt 568.
---
The real question is are tanking pets good, and the answer is no.
---
you'd be surprised
---
People will still ask.

server discord guild recruitments.
---
Never played retail since 2008, but I was confusing it with the guild tabard design which appears to be 10g
---
Yeah we definitely don't know better than a handful of people that worked in the original game
---
Pick the lowest pop one, last time I checked the ratios were even enough that the difference won't have a great impact on your experience.
---
Just came to upvote that fantastic art, no gonna lie.
---
Create troll character. Take shortcut to Ratchet, and then boat to Booty Bay. Run to Gurubashi Arena and loot the chest. Bam, easy 2 gold. ^Disclaimer: this might not work if Blizzard remembers to disable the event for launch.
---
By far my favorite spec in retail. Only one that feels close to vanilla Hunter imo.
---
DKP doesn’t solve that though. The master looter can always give items to whomever they want. Officers can forge DKP counts if they control the system. You are putting your faith in them regardless of what system you use.
---
No, it just means "Please Don't Join this Server", but doesn't lock anyone out.
---
And thus, the great "hunter's being invited into groups blackout of 2019" began.
---
I really hope you're joking
---
One step from being a filthy casual
---
I need a swing timer even leveling, at the very least.  I need to know exactly how far I can kite a mob before I jump and swipe at it while I'm grinding from mob to mob.
---
This is a big one. I paid for my hunters epic mount by renting out the materials needed for the quest.
---
Yeah and I didn't mean it to come across that way, poorly worded on my part. I just know I personally aren't interested in retail and haven't been for a long time for issues I see in it.
---
That requires being comfortable with tanking, which, depending on dungeon and party, could demand more attention and patience than some players can commit and still enjoy the game.
---
Ahh okay see i didnt know your commitment was that much stronger!
---
I like herb over mining because sometimes (usually) mining a node requires you to mine it several times, and they tend not to be as “scattered” as herb nodes. Saves you an extra space in your inventory as well.
---
If you don't care about speeding or raiding... what are you considering being Hardcore about? 
---
Being "Hardcore" at an MMO usually implies trying to be the best in a certain spect. Investing massive amounts of time in something. If it's hitting 60 first, finishing Naxx server first, or getting R14 in PvP... those are all considered various forms of hardcore.
---
Otherwise... you're not. Playing a lot and doing nothing doesn't mean you're hardcore really (ya ya ya, gatekeeping).
---
Protector, but that fits both warrior and paladin for me. My primary would be paladin if they were a more viable tank. I end up a warrior because I am a protector/tank first, a class second.
---
"DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD, WHERE ARE MY HEAAAALS!?!?"
---
&gt; fastest is 4-5 days and that was highly regimented record making run
---
Joana's OG Record is 116 hours - he is anticipating 96 or faster this time. Many speed runners are expecting 80-90.
---
Shit's changed in the past decade and a half. I'm expecting about 110 hrs as a paladin.
---
Those decisions could easily be sorted amongst friends.
---
Here here, i want it
---
Helper- individualist.
---
Depressing? Oh hell no.
---
Meh it took me 50 minutes to get into Character creation on Herod. Still got my names because they weren't some stupid pun or internet meme. But yeah if you wanted your name to be "Destruction", I guess go to a different realm...
---
Fewer abilities than retail? Not counting duplicate ranks, I don't think that holds true.  
---
Fair list and I didn't realize this is just your personal list...
---
but how is everyone IRL going to know that I play video games xD
---
Remember that time we waited from November 2017 to May 2019 with no updates?

High school really was the most depressing era of my life and I played WoW throughout it. My closest friends were through a club soccer team I played on and none of them went to my school or were in my grade. I wanted a girlfriend so bad but I had no idea how to act around them and i was a friendless quiet kid. why would a girl like me? I always had WoW to go to when I went home so I think WoW enabled me to never put myself out there and make friends in high school. I knew things had to change when I went to college so i quit cold turkey.
---
I joined a fraternity in college. Had the most sterotypical fraternity college experience you could expect. I had more friends and girls anyone could ask for. My life was amazing. On top of that I graduated early with a masters in engineering and have an incredibly lucrative career now. I have the most perfect girlfriend in the world for me now and most of my closest friends have moved to other cities for jobs. 
---
I'm back to having very little responsibilities outside of work and have had a lot of free time lately. I can't wait to play WoW this time around. I'll have just as much fun as before but I'm really happy with my life IRL now. I won't be escaping from the real world when I play and I have a bunch of IRL friends joining along this time!
---
Anyone got a link to the ret paladin spreadsheet? Cant find it with a google search at work.

It's rare but not difficult. That's what he's saying. It's rare to win the lottery but it's not difficult to buy a ticket every week.

As a Warlock you can summon people right at the edge of a cliff. After they've been summoned they fall to their death.

I love beeing a Warlock.

661 total days. 100 - ( 10/661) = 99.98%, am I doing it wrong?
---
That is awesome!  
---
Where can I buy one of these? :)
---
Yeah 100%, one can only have hope. I work in IT and think that the modern day server infrastructure should handle all this no problem (since they are using layering) but no way to know for sure.
---
See you in Azeroth, friend! (Hopefully not after a 3 hour queue)
---
lol my bad 5
---
Agreed. Especially considering that many people might want to play something opposite of their personality IRL.
---
hey it's me ur friend
---
that guide doesn't go over tutorial zones - they're pretty straight forward.
---
It starts at lvl 5 / Dolanaar since that's when things start requiring routing.
---
2.5-3k is the desired population based on *vanilla game mechanics*. 
---
More and you end up with severe resource scarcity, as well as crazy overpopulated hubs (IF/Orgrimmar)
---
I'm actually hopping back on because life as i got older life isnt more depressing for me but just more boring, i have a good amount of friends but instead of hanging out basically every day we hang out 1 a week maybe less, life now is just work eat sleep
---
Wow holy shit. I didn’t know that
---
This is going to come down to a guild by guild basis. Some guilds with understanding of the debuff slot change may be open to taking in one singular shadow priest. Others may just be looking to fill with whatever they want.
---
If you’re set on it, go for it. But if you’re keen on getting into a raid spot, you can start applying and speaking with various guilds on your server ASAP (there’s several recruitment threads).
---
I agree. I personally stopped playing shortly after BC released. The first few drops in Outlands just made my stomach turn. I think BC is when Blizzard realized that catering to the cries of the weak was the go to profit model... Years later, you can basically buy max level, skip all the content that made WoW great, and group up for dungeon wipes with people that have no clue how to play. Not to mention, individuals farming for Legendaries that took entire 40 man raids months to get, and that's if RNGesus smiled upon them...
---
BC was the beginning of the downfall, it's also when they lost all their momentum from a subscription stand point. 8 mil prior to BC, 10 mil peak before WotLK. Everything just goes downhill from there, but BC is where it all begins.
---
As far as I know layering was meant to be only below lvl20 and in starting areas. Isn't it for the entire server and for every level now?
---
It's like when two dogs see each other
---
Everybody poops
---
I know the feeling. We were deployed at vanilla launch. Didn’t get to play until 2005.
---
From looking at the Herod discord at least, this doesn't seem to be the case. I was surprised honestly.
---
I hate art... In the context of it drowning out discussion and other valuable opportunities to learn.
---
What happens to players that are named something like that on an RP server? Are they forced into a name change or does the community just shun them?
---
Be down with a lot of build out happening, but Azshara is great to just be a peaceful chill zone with nothing going on. Very nice change of pace.
---
Cons outweighs the pros imo.
---
Transmog ruins a core aspect of RPG gameplay
---
Play hunter.
---
I got my hunter bow and staff quest from mc and what a bitch that was. I wouldn't even want to do Tf even tho one of the coolest items in game
---
&gt; but you can’t sit here and try to say PvE is the same as PvP the only difference being you get to choose when you want to participate.
---
I never said that. And a random gank here or there isn't the issue I foresee. It's the cumulative time wasted getting attacked fighting when i'll really probably only have time to just play the game period.
---
I never understood the trope of 'making my wife/gf go healer.' Healing is stressful and can be quite frustrating. I feel like something more relaxing like Hunter would keep them invested longer.
---
Wait that's Illegal.
---
Not necessarily true. I have the option to download the Beta, but cannot play it.
---
Imagine if they made her live this time and you and mankrik have to save her from a quilboar encampment and it’s a huge multi quest storyline and in the end it turns out she was hanging out with the quilboar because she’s a ho go sho?

It was a rudimentary LFG function.
---
Oh nice! That decision didn't make much sense to me.

Didn't realize reposts of reposts can get so many upvotes...

Yes! The snacking potential is through the roof on these things!

Keep advertising and it won't be 50/50.
---
The left axis is just a scaling. Here's Google's explanation...
---
Reference: https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4365533?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6248052
---
How Trends data is adjusted
---
Trends adjusts search data to make comparisons between terms easier.
---
Search results are proportionate to the time and location of a query by the following process:
---
Each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents to compare relative popularity. Otherwise, places with the most search volume would always be ranked highest.
---
The resulting numbers are then scaled on a range of 0 to 100 based on a topic’s proportion to all searches on all topics.
---
Different regions that show the same search interest for a term don't always have the same total search volumes.
---
Could one connect to the servers with a VPN or are the accounts region locked at creation?
---
10/661 = 0.015 = 1.5%, so it's actually 98.5%
---
Well that's shit. Where am I supposed to roll if the two English-speaking PvP servers are full?
---
I have to tip my hat to you, this is arguably the greatest troll initiative in classic WoW. Yes everyone, no spec is meme, in fact whoever told you mages were good was lying. I can't wait for the flood of crying feral druids doing 200 dps. 
---
You really better hope you find a good guild that knows what they're doing. With all the misinformation out there's going to be a lot of special snow flake meme guilds.

Because level cap is not 60 on retail..?
---
Great post. Also knowing when to switch between hawk and cheetah can really help kiting the other more mobile classes.
---
Lol, it literally was a minor inconvenience. Most serious coding issues the game has ever experienced? Lol, alright. Pretty efficient bunch that it was so serious and they fixed it a couple of days later, just like the other bugs that disruptive normal game play. Once again, you talk like you read this in a book.

---
I actually enjoyed SWTOR, I hope they create a better Starwars MMO, something more like Galaxies.
---
FWIW, i still have the beta shown there, but they launch button is grey'd out.
---
I think if you got invited to the first (or maybe second?) stress test it still shows up, but you werent an official beta tester.
---
After one of those stress tests they stopped using the beta client for the tests and it just showed up as classic.
---
Thanks for all the positive feedback last time everyone! 
---
Making these really helps pass the time. This one was a request from my classic WoW buddy who'll be hitting 60 with me.
---
You kidding? Diapers have to be changed eventually. Just have Ma hold the bucket

Let’s just make sure they are good memes.

Don’t forget about their mana problems. They have a hard time in longer fights.

---
And this is why I won't play with streamers...  Whenever they try to use their influence to negatively impact another player's experience disproportionately you know the streamer should be black listed (e.g. ninja banning people).
---
There's also the potential for streamers adding people who weren't actually sniping and then you false positives.  
---
I really think player's should avoid streamers who show participation in this sort of practice.
---
It is a timesaver but also a lifesaver. You need to look at it as an extra free runecloth bandage that you can use. 
---
On some pulls you can abuse ledges to reset pathways of mobs and just string them along for another minute until your bandage cd resets and you can get more hp/mana again to dps them down. But on other pulls you don't have the option of a ledge and you need to kite with CoEx or juggle fear/howl/banish while you dps down 1 mob. While the other mobs are CCed and you're low on hp/mana being able to bandage+CB+healthstone makes it a lot easier.
---
For DM North at first I ran into respawns until I refined my technique and got better gear so CB was essential for speeding it up. 
---
For DM West I needed CB to survive some pulls because of the massive magic dmg, I also used a shadowresist set there.
---
I'm pretty sure in Scholomance to clear the last rooms I also really needed CB but I didn't do it that much so I might misremember, I only did that instance for fun not for gold.
---
If enough people report it, it’ll be flagged for a name change. This is due to a naming policy only effecting RP-RPPVP servers.
---
Well if they just master loot an item that's a lot more obviously corrupt than loot council. And in terms of dkp count, if people just keep track of their own as well then you'll be able to tell if they're making up numbers.
---
Dal rend and immolation potion ruins my immersion
---
people can report you. If the reports are legit then you will be forced to change your name (for free).
---
Seriously lol... We cleared 15/18 of Naxx and I don't think a tank had more than 11 into protection for the entire time. Outside of the main tank I don't even think it's optimal to have a prot warrior, the minor differences you gain nowhere near offset the dps loss from being prot while needing to do damage.
---
I don't even think I had a shield leveling up just was in defensive stance and it was passable.
---
I initially started the game as alliance, but switched to horde after a few years and I've pretty much been horde since... until now.
---
Going all in on alliance in classic :D
---
As a non rogue player on a RP-PVP server back in the day, the way I remember it was rogues were required to troll you with chain sapping, but never actually attacking. Unless of course they were high enough lvl above you to insta-gank.
---
I was planning on power leveling 10 alchemists with transmute mastery before I learned this.
---
Yeah agreed
---
Because people dont like to tank. You have to know the dungeon and be ok leading the group.
---
This is amazing!
---
Except even the simplified talents they introduced had clear "best" choices for content. Let's not even add the other things they added into the game that needed to be simmed/studied like reforging, gem slots, azerite traits.
---
&gt; buy a few raid runs
---
o.O
---
The amount of runs you'd need puts you in the cost to bribe enough people at Blizzard to just have it added to your account.
---
Sort by population you heathen
---
Is this measuring created characters, or people actually logged in at that moment?
---
Because I thought it measured current logins, and could change based on time of day. If it's measuring characters instead, imagine how it will be once we can create more.
---
I can, I noted this on the 6.) point. I'm looking at it from now, I'm not worried how people though back then. Fact of the matter is, PVE in WoW has gotten a lot more complicated than vanilla like I said
---
Do you think people are scared of 2 weeks of layering?? Where did you even get that from. The last official comment was "before P2".. The levelling process takes the average player months, you're very confused on how long layering will be on a server like Herod.
---
It’s one banana how much could it cost? Ten dollars?
---
Honestly in every raiding guild i've been in we just let people roll for it with the unofficial "loot council" (the GM and Officers) overseeing it. 
---
If something stupid is about to go down, like someone's going to get a sidegrade over our there every week ride or die raider who needs it for a major upgrade, they will speak up and discuss it. 
---
99% of the time they just agree it's a way better upgrade for the other guy and leave it at that. People who wanted to make a big deal about it, well I wasn't in officer chat but coincidentally they didn't make it to very many raids after that.
---

I love druid, but I enjoy other classes too, so I'm doing something different this time. :)
---
I'm more hardcore than my 3 friends who are coming back to classic. I reserved my names on 3 different servers now. Each time that server got full so my friends would not be able to join in a couple weeks. So I delete and moved my names. I hope these servers aren't all full when my friends get around to logging during launch week. :(
---
You talk about utility for hybrids, but dont forget primaries have utility too.  Mage food, warlock cookies and summon.
---
Nobody said that
---
I mean just based on your post I'll tell you right now you wouldn't want to play on a PvP server, much less one bursting at the seams like Herod.
---
Where can I get that?
---
Everyone knows that. Classic is Hard because it is Time consuming

Pat, Maydie and Grim and many others were never really good players. Vurtne and Laintime were so far ahead of them.

---
I'm suspicious of anyone who actively opposes loot council because they might not "get theirs." Such people seem like they're focused on their personal advancement rather than the guild's progression. Anyone joining the guild to get some specific epics so that they can quit raiding and PVP instead or to hop over to another guild with more bosses on farm can fuck right off.
---
The good thing about focusing upgrades on the officers and core is that those people are most likely to continue raiding with the guild long-term so the loot that they get continues to help the guild progress.
---
Simply being a LC guild works as a filter to keep away loot-hungry newcomers. Anyone whose top priority is being part of a team that beats all the content will become a core raider eventually.
---
Where's the patch note line though. I can't find it.
---
My friend played a lock on a lot of pservers, his response when someone asked for a summon was 'Haven't trained it, too expensive.'
---
In Warlord of Draenor, I would have my 5 year old fish for me.  Now I've added a second account and they will be rolling a new toon with me.
---
Stupid meme shit, eventually, seems to basically take over every community on the site. You have to change subs every year to stay ahead of it. From here, to TrueWoW, to TrueTrueWow, etc.
---
Not me, I don't get back to work until the week after launch, so my money's pretty much gone.  Side effect of working at a school, but I love my job and it fits around the needs of my kids so I roll with it.

On the plus side I was able to keep my subscription active so I'll be able to play at least.

Unless you played back in vanilla you don't realize how much of the current ui (or classic ui) was originally parts of various mods that eventually made its way into the base game like scrolling combat text, our modern raid frames showing dispellable debuffs and class colors and a lot more.
---
In fact until 1.12 there was an add-on basically considered mandatory for healers called decursive that practically played the game for you until they broke the functionality of it.
---
I agree if anything streamers are against the spirit of vanilla.
---
I like that we get a midnight release in Europe. It's exciting, like Sylvester as kid, waiting the whole evening to stay up all night. 
---
Buying a physical copy would be silly in 2019, tho
---
If you only play one side, you're only seeing half the game! Especially true in Classic WoW. If questing is your thing, there's much more to be had when you run out of quests on one faction.
---
Unless hot pocket is a euphemism
---
Do they work though?
---
I met my first GF on wow and I moved 1200 miles away to live with her. Lasted 4 years lmao
---
Real hot take there chief.
---
Literally nobody would argue that vanilla bosses are more complicated than current bosses. It wouldn’t even make logical sense. Of course as the game progresses and players get better it gets more complicated.
---
You wrote your essay for nothing.
---
Warriors use ALL of the stats on the WEP (AP + WEP Damage) on all their abilities and autos.
---
Hunters only use some of the stats some of the time (Only used WEP damage on a few abilities)
---
Hunters can roll on it but only after Warriors that don't need a good 2H pass.
---
Always enjoyed those names. I was Kingslayer Lolsean in WOTLK.
---
Please report back if IT happens😗
---
Because they don’t want to mess with/be messed with while out in the world. Duh. Pve servers attract chill people and generally have positive communities. Also, girls.
---
Get a new weapon and didn’t level the skill!
---
😂
---
What’s the band in this clip? Sounds like perfect grinding music
---
The Onion is satircal. Everyone relax.
---
Awesome design! Lok'tar, dirty Alliance scum!
---
If only because they spelled Zul’Gurub correctly. You can always tell when someone who has no idea what they’re talking about is writing these because they screw up in-game names constantly.
---
endgame raiding wasn't the main focus of the game, information about mechanics weren't nearly as easy to access as today's day and age. it was their first attempt at raids. pretty pointless thread, nobody's gonna argue this
---
&gt;Grim
---
Grim has a Twitter account ( [@grimtherogue](https://twitter.com/grimtherogue) ), he announced he'll be back on  Gehennas EU (PvP)
---
Lol, there will be PLENTY of people to play with on Friday... believe me. It's not like the starting zones will be empty. The vast majority of the playerbase will be under level 20
---
Get a mule and enjoy both!
---
Most guilds won't give a flying fuck about being super efficient, Because you need 40 people.
---
Debuff limit on the other hand is a serious thing on bosses.
---
Personally i hope i can make 2h fury work on alliance.
---
Can you please expand on why the AH will be unbalanced?
---
We'll see multiple new servers between now and the 25th. At a numerical level? Great news. Good luck convincing your friends and guild to keep moving. They're already showing their fanatcisim over numbers at the cost of community experience.
---
Except, you know, that giant blue dragon
---
Kotor3 died for this.  Although if it's being shit out by bioware idk if I even want it now.
---
Thank God Larian has BG3, actually have hope for that game.
---
I just got dumber reading this. Thanks
---
 I haven't played retail but in other games dailies for me has been a reason for burn out and ending up quitting. 
---
 Last game I played with dailies was the card game MTG Arena. Did dailies for months and ended up with a very impressive card collection without spending any real money. The grind though just ended up feeling like work after a while and it stopped being fun. Many times I wasn't in the mood for playing but logged in anyways to complete some dailies( the dailies consisted of getting wins, capped out at 15 wins per day).
---
 My own fault obviously but it's easy to fall into the trap of logging in to do them. Guess that's why they are in the games. To make us hooked and keep coming back. Experienced the same in Hearthstone with dailies, eventual burnout.
---
You bet your ass I’ll be there for every grueling second.  I’ll report on my trials and tribulations.
---
The big exodus will happen between level 25 and 45. It's like on PServers, where most guilds started recruiting not before level 40 because so many players drop out earlier. We will see how many players will make it to the endgame. Being on an official server, I assume it be a lot more than on PServers.
---
Tanking is a responsibility that most players, including most warriors, don't want.
---
Back in actual classic going affliction drain tanking with a DPS pet was way faster to lvl than relying on blueberry to tank for you. All the way to 60.
---
I don't cry over the inevitable.
---
Because everyone with a keyboard is a data analytics expert in 2019.
---
Don't have any set plans really, and group is wide open for anyone to join in! So feel free to tag along.
---
Only when she's off duty. In uniform, she's Officer Nasty

Haha clairement en War t'es pas aidé. Après comme tu dis il faut savoir s'entourer.
---
My super lazy crock pot go to is italian sausage.
---
2 packs sweet italian sausage.
---
2 jars of spaghetti sauce.
---
1 yellow onion.
---
3 green peppers.
---
Cut up the onion and peppers into strips, dump all that shit into the crock pot cook for 6 hours on low, boom. Throw a sausage and some onion/peppers into a bun whenever you are hungry.
---
Nah. I like to see it.
---
That is entirely up to the mods. If they allow low effort then it will turn into low effort.
---
I scheduled my vacation that week. 
---
Boxing a hunter/warrior to be one of the earliest level 60 warriors.
---
You think you.....Oh shit, THEY DO!!
---
You don't use stoneform until the other rogue tries to blind you and run away.

"lol no im the satire boy guys, why don't you believe me?"

Wow that's cool, trying to think of a WoW tattoo myself. I hope whatever I get is as rad as yours!
---
gehennas is gucci
---
&gt; *concurrent population
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; As in, online at the same time.
---
This is super obvious.    
---
We are both talking about population on a server at the same time. Max players online right now.   
---
We have no source from Blizzard what the will cap the servers at?
---
Faerlina is a cooler name than Herod but streamers made that choice for me.
---
Yeah *once* you get the two bindings.
---
Could this BE any more depressing?
---
1. Don’t shake hand with people using your shit hand. That’s rude, even though it’s probably clean.
---
Ele Sham, Warlock, and Mage scale extremely well end game. 3-4k crits are common w/ damage buff.
---
Shadow priests are strong but have no way to remove Viper Sting so they go oom fast.
---
Warriors w/ Might of Menethil (Naxx 2H) are strong but susceptible to range issues and get bursted down quick by casters. The idea that a Warrior scales to be the best PvP class is false, even with a healbot.
---
Rogues are great in niche stealth role and can win BGs but have same range issue as Warrior. They die quick.
---
Hunter damage is laughable and they're only good as a Viper Sting bot.
---
Druid dps is a joke but they have strength in defending points and running flag. 
---
Paladin dps is completely useless but Naxx geared Holy Pally is the best PvP healer in the game.
---
-----------
---
tl;dr:
---
The one class that always stands out to me in PvP is a Naxx Ele Shaman. They're so damn strong. For classic, I narrowed it down to Mage and Sham but I much prefer Mage in PvE. Mage is also great "high octane" PvP class w/ Engineering.
---
TRUE LUL y you already know.
---
“Unpopular opinion”
---
“Facts”
---
Pick one buddy.
---
But your prot warrior literally will be able to roll on bows with good stats though?
---
If you're saving something to be used later is that useless? I don't think so
---
dungeons give little exp
---
Ally for the first time ever here...i still feel a bit disgusted with myself ;)
---
Starfall didn't exist in vanilla, shitpost. RREEEE NORMIES
---
My question is, respectfully but why are you opposed to voice? Ran across a lot of people like that and just seeking to understand the why.
---
Shame they won’t work unless they release BC realms
---
do u need to talk in raids?
---
Someone in my guild got a blue response that says it has to be level30... if you have a friend with an open slot just have them reserve your name while you customize. Otherwise just do it at a weird time and you will probably be fine
---
Only my 2 cent on this, i guess you will be fine as a warrior. Yes it's harder to level compared to other classes, but in the first phase there are plenty of other players that help with hard quests, elites and stuff. So i don't think it will be THAT hard :)
---
As you saw in the pictures.
---
The Addon shows you a small window ingame. The window contains simple instructions on what you should do.
---
It basically tells you:
---
*"Follow this road to find a house.*
---
*Accept quest A from the guy in the house.*
---
*Turn in quest B to the other guy in the house.*
---
*Leave the house and go left to find a mine.*
---
*Do quest A inside that mine.*
---
*Go back to the house and turn in quest A..."*
---
It's like a tourist guide so you don't get lost, don't waste time running in circles, don't miss quests that you didn't know about, don't waste time in useless quests etc...
---
I won't trust a single fucker in a guild. If i do good DPS i expect loot. Unless you have a reason for giving it to someone else.
---
Depends on the amount the melee contribute to the raids progression prior to that point... also how good that weapon is for the melee VS the hunter...there are only certain  weapons really that should flat out go to melee over hunters (e.g. if they have good change on hit abilities... or are super rare and really beneficial, to melee dps).
---
My horse is gonna ride me!
---
Rogues had a bigger dps than warriors even in naxx
---
Is there any way to filter on tags? The way I read Classic wow is to scan the titles and skip anything with the Humor tag.
---
6 years on reddit isn't so easy though!
---
They become mind-numbing so quickly too.Imagine if Mankrik told you to go farm 40 boar tusks every day. for 50 silver.
---
Would we do it?probably not.
---
but if that mount is so expensive, every bit counts right?
---
(classic mounts are expensive. but can be bought pretty reasonably if you're good w expenditures)
---
The dailies in BC really crushed a lot of the experience, and as rRobban said, change it to a chore.Logging in for 2-3 hours, and most of that is dailies? Or, "woah, I have to do dailies on my alt too!"
---
I was saddened when my Original guild just faded away in BC.
---
"Hey want to pvp?"no. I gotta do dailies
---
"hey, want to try a dungeon?"
---
No. Dailies
---
"want to do anything?"
---
dailies.
---
WoW: Relapse
---
RemindMe! 10 days
---
that and obviously it got them a little money. Blizz isn't doing nearly as well as it used to. If a million people reserved names between all regions (which is quite possibly a conservative estimate) then that's a cool $7.5 million for free basically.
---
What's CRZ?
---
The no change people gonna have some rude awakenings.
---
Aye.  Exactly this. Not only are there Lore reasons to uphold the Druid code, but more specifically mechanically it’s difficult to kill another Druid. You can both break the primary CC you have (roots) and there’s not much lockdown potential. 
---
Only time I get killed by another Druid is when I’m eating/drinking and low and a cat Druid takes me out from behind.
---
That’s definitely not the majority that thinks raiding is harder in Vanilla. That’s a misrepresentation, perhaps people say it’s more *punishing*, which could actually be argued.
---
However, you also lump all of PVE together. You even mention dungeons, but make practically no real assessment of them or your argument as to why they’re the easiest they ever were.
---
Here’s the thing with dungeons: It’s hard to compare anything to the current game, where there is literally infinite Mythic difficulties. So perhaps comparing dungeons to baseline Mythic is appropriate?
---
Regardless, I think if you’ve played Wrath and Vanilla, you’d probably think that Wrath was easier. There was possibly 2 dungeons that took even a shred of skill or patience. Cata heroics were hard at the start, but they quickly became a joke, through nerfs and simple overhearing. But even at the right gear level, Cata heroics turned into Wrath heroics, as did Mists. 
---
So really, barring Cata launch heroics and BC, until the advent of Mythic, I actually think 5-man PVE was *much* harder than later versions of WoW. Sure, boss mechanics were simpler, but there were patrols, aggro struggles, you couldn’t just AoE, and you had to tilize Crowd Control And watch your surroundings. You could run out of mana and turn into a paperweight. 
---
Again, nobody would argue raiding is easier in Vanilla than other versions of WoW, but the 5-man side of things is a different story.
---
I’m glad my guild was able to clear naxx (10/15 pre tbc patch, the rest just before tbc) without all this drama. Having a different experience from you, I’ll say that most guilds are not going to be like that. The exceptions that I’m thinking are top10-20 that may push Raggy week 1/2 and they may still have a “toxic-free” blast. Maybe you should consider a mid tier guild of veterans if you want to make some chill raiding?
---
Sorry did you read your own description? 
---
&gt; The Addon automatically parses all chat messages and lists them as groups to queue up (even across layers!) Note: If you apply for such a group it will whisper the leader of the group with the message that you provide
---
&gt; it will whisper the leader of the group with the message that you provide
---
&gt;  it will periodically write in a public channel of your choice
---
So it writes messages for you to other players and it posts message for you in public channels. Without you doing anything and so you're saying there's no automation at all here? 
---
k lol
---
I was really hoping TS5 was out before Classic WoW.
---
There is nothing wrong with this. It's just that the gamers of today don't have the patience for Hunter pulling. Some groups even ignore traps as second rate ccs
---

---
Yes, I never thought it would be up for release. Maybe a few weeks or months after.
---
But tracking buff and debuff and spell abilities everywhere on my screen is just a nice QoL addition.
---
Also some people put stuff like energy bar, or combo points close to the middle of the screen.
---
Also some dungeon may benefit from WAs.
---
So excited for classic!
---
Quality memes are fine but the art has to fucking go
---
It will cause queues if not enough people leave. Read the comment I originally responded to. It seems like people are fine with intolerable queues, but only if they happen after layering and not on launch day.
---
Exactly, and cutting out every post this thread is talking about removing will kill this subreddit growth long term. It will eventually balance itself out into a healthy mix of memes and discussion where the good stuff gets to the top. During content downtime, there won't be anything to discuss and people will need a reason to keep coming to the subreddit. If you want super hardcore discussion 24/7 make a discord or another subreddit for it.

U/McconnellReeet
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/135764 is the policy for RP naming.
---
Im still a bit unclear on names that are clearly nick names? In lore there are many characters that are referred to by a nickname. 
---
My character is a rogue with the name Butcher, and im unsure if that would be acceptable.
---
Might be a reference to a Hunter. Having a hunter in the group can make the last boss a lot easier
---
Iron jaw no eyes spike hair
---
Make her a chance to spawn anywhere in Barrens.
---
Yes I change I can support place on the bridge to Astranar. I know it will be a long walk for horde to find her.
---
Yes, it did do that. That's what I said in my post, and it's true. The respawn time was around 2 seconds after the mob died. Maybe on your layer/realm it wasn't like that, but on EU it was. I wouldn't lie to you, it would just be pointless. I have nothing to gain from it. However as I say, Blizzard have respawns like that too. Mob dies, 2 seconds pass, it respawns at the exact same spot. Kill it, it respawns again. And so on.
---
&gt; why worry about a hypothetical problem
---
To prevent it from happening. Risk assessment based on previous experiences with Blizzard.
---
Sounds good, ill be using it
---
1. Hunter, Rogue, Prot Warrior, HPriest, Rshaman wear most of their tier pieces.
---
2. As a MT yes you do need to have a mic and be vocal. 
---
3. Hamstring kiting works but but it’s not as effective as on private servers. 
---
4. I believe the spell batching window was reduced drastically in BC. So yes there is a big difference in spell casting. 
---
5. There’s plenty of addons to see enemy casting bars. 
---
6. There’s an addon for dungeon maps
---
7. Yes the zeppelin exists.
---
And that’s fine, you can see it... on r/wow, where people post anything and everything relating to the World of Warcraft.
---
This is a niche sub, and would be like posting your dope horde tattoo on the r/warcraftlore subreddit. It’s irrelevant to the stated purpose of the sub - discussing all things about CLASSIC wow.
---
Did you get your 8 year old nephew to draw that?
---
Jk my handwriting is trash too I can relate.
---
First, your return to Moonglade was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement so I must do nothing. And secondly, you must be a Druid for the Druid's Code to apply and you're not. And thirdly, the Code is more what you'd call "guidelines" than actual rules.
---
ele shaman probaby cuts the cake for the biggest burst output
---
Lol, my dude. Making comparisons from cataclysm to 4e. I like the cut of your gib.
---
No problem bud, i forgive you. &lt;3
---
Coincidently, I'm going to a Weird Al concert on the 27th, release day for classic. It was a tough decision but I'd probably just be in a queue anyway.
---
Normal wow is way more relaxed, it's easy mode compared to vanilla.
---
&gt; without worrying about someone else deciding that you're going to have a bad day, 
---
Yeah that is kinda my fear. I work in a high stress job and then have a wife and home to look after at the end of the day, as well as other hobbies to keep up on. 
---
When I get a few hours to sit down and play wow, that's the thing. I actually want to play it. I think you may be right.
---
Tanking in general requires a skill set that makes the process easier and less of pain in the ass. Even then, the group needs to help you out by CCing and following your instructions/plan.
---
Most Warriors aren't willing to put in the time to learn the pulls, and boss tactics that are required. This is pretty much "the fear" that strictly DPS Warriors have.
---
Then comes building a "tank set" which a minimum is a 1h+shield, but also should include better optimized pieces like nice stam piece.
---
Lastly, Tanking even as prot could be difficult with a "difficult" group who breaks CC, doesn't target the right mobs, pulls when you aren't ready, and doesn't give you a second, literally a second to build some threat. Tanking as Arms/Fury makes this mechanically harder.
---
At the end of day, it's laziness by players. A real DPS warrior understands they might have to tank in a blue moon, and develop the skill set/gear, increasing their worth and value as a DPS Warrior. 
---
A bad DPS warrior will never be dedicated enough to gear themselves up for DPS, for the same reasons they can't be bothered to even develop a decent Tanking skillset.
---
There have been so many things I have forgotten about Vanilla that I have kept away from reading up on.  I feel it's been so long that I can feel like it's the first time again.  It'll be more of a remembering of things, but the discovery I hope will be comparable to learning it for the first time.
---
I didn't imagine it, just go watch any big twitch streamer bring up the idea to anyone. Chat goes instantly crazy split on it. Lets not be narrow minded, some people do think this. Mostly the people who are not as informed about WoW as this sub is. Chill
---
It is hard to say Vanilla is easier than Retail. You would need to disregard a lot of things like how hard was it compared to video games of that age/era. As technology gets better and more easily accessible of course they can add more complicated mechanics and scripting. This is kind of a pointless thread.
---
My name was taken on Stallag too. :*(
---
Yes. As long as the air is drawn from the outside and not the room itself, it's alright.
---
Yo shout-out to bringing up suicide kings loot distribution. Still haven't found a guild that uses it but I think it's pretty awesome.
---
But yeah this is my sentiments exactly. I've been a part of alot of guilds and there's nothing like sitting around for literally over an hour because people are arguing about whether or not the sword rogue officer should get perditions blade.
---
Or European maybe? Could be during their typical fall vacation time frame and multiple countries could travel together with minimal time/money spent by car or rail.
---
So they only helped future Orc children by ridding their race of it? But they keep the skin coloration?
---
That's something you need to talk to your guild about. If you're just donating to your guild with the expectation they help you when you switch professions and they don't know that then it could be an issue.
---
For pve your choices are UBRS worg for piercing howl (the only one with that rank of the ability in the game), Broken Tooth for speedy crits if you're BM, windserpent although I'm not sure which patch they fixed their lightning breath, and surprisingly a plain old owl. For leveling I recommend the strigid screecher as it can learn screech which is great for when you aggro multiple mobs, snaps aggro right off of you, not to mention its attack speed is .1 second behind The Rake so you'll be critting often.
---
For pvp anything that flies is annoying and cat will cause casters bars to continuously push back.
---
Yeah... OP painted with such a wide brush, it makes me wonder if they’ve cleared the content. Even ZG is harder than Wrath-Naxx, and the 5 mans are certainly harder than Wrath heroics.
---
I'll have about 30 minutes of play time right at launch and then I got to go to a class.. I'll try and just grab a level or two quick but I'll have 4 more hours that night when I'm back.
---
I'll have a 28 hour gap from Tuesdays to Wednesdays. So like you, by the afternoon of the 30th, I"ll be up from my nap and have until Monday evening to go all out on it.
---
The starter zones will probably be very busy again as it's the first weekend..
---
it's really $7.50, since in 2 weeks everyone playing will be subbing anyway
---
It's not because you're trying your best at something, it's because people are so obsessed with whats "best" and min maxing these days, so it comes across as tryhard when you're playing the known bis race for your class. But yeah who cares honestly.
---
On a boss like Ragnaros its 460+ yes, but thats only with 20-25 DPS which is a pretty low number considering most comps take 25-30.
---
There's a reason, for example, that the theorycraft consensus is that Balance Druid's biggest problem is it's poor DPS in general, not it's mana problems. Because as soon as an average raid gets full pre-raid bis there's no way that you're regularly having boss fights longer than 90s in MC except on maybe Ragnaros.
---
In vanilla you had to collect 40 people for a raid .. already there its hard
---
I was mostly Horde in vanilla, so I'm going mostly Alliance this time around. Both to mix things up from my past experience, but also to get a chance to play a paladin.
---
Lol it's been that bad for a year already.
---
It's alliance dominant because a couple massive guilds have joined up, one of them being the guild Towelliee is in and also, pve has always been at least a little off balanced toward alliance.
---
Thanks for making this.  My group used it in the beta and it worked very well, and we plan on using it for launch.
---
2h is kinda shit for Warriors in PvE if you are alliance.
---
They're afraid to tank.  I'm tempted to make a warrior as my 2nd to level instead of pally, just because pally tanking really wasn't fun until TBC.  I'll probably wait to see what my group does with their alts first.
---
Map id please.
---
Hahahaha. So you think that you're worth making a second account to down vote the stupid shit that you're spouting? Hahahaha, and people say that my generation is entitled. It was a bug that you weren't even playing the game when it occurred, and 14 years later you decided to LIE about having been present for it to try to prove some point over. You're pathetic lol. And a liar.
---
"I feel guilty for something that I literally have no connection to, and want to make amends by going to a casino" hahahahahahaha haha. I bet you live an incredibly sad life.
---
I've played hundreds of hours of PvP at Naxx/AQ levels. Here's the tier list.
---
S Tier (Best)
---
* Shaman (Elemental)
---
* Mage (Frost, Fire)
---
* Warlock (Destro)
---
A Tier (Strong)
---
* Priest (Shadow)
---
* Warrior (Arms)
---
* Rogue (Ass+Sub)
---
* Paladin (Holy)
---
B Tier (Good)
---
* Hunter (Marks+Surv)
---
* Druid (HotW) 
---
C Tier (Average)
---
* Enhance Shaman
---
D Tier (Below Average)
---
* Combat Rogue
---
* Ret/Prot Pally
---
**tl;dr**
---
The one class that always stands out to me in PvP is a Naxx Ele Shaman. They're so damn strong. For classic, I narrowed it down to Mage and Sham but I much prefer Mage in PvE. Mage is also a great "high octane" PvP class w/ Engineering.
---
Problem with that is being pushed out of roads because you don’t have gear while someone else replaces you with better gear.
---
Cant tell if you are being serious or not.  I love being a father. A lot of us do.
---
*confused screaming*
---
Butcher is totally acceptable. It’s really about a name that could interrupt immersion within a fantasy world. Think more like a string of words, if your name was Bigbutcherman you might get some reports.
---
I don't know what that means and I've played up until wotlk.
---
Never quested in this area even though I was almost always Alliance. Fully plan on going here this time around.
---
Also i would have fucking loved 2 different specs. 1 for world and 1 specific for BG's/PvP.
---
50g to respec fucking RIP.
---
You're kind of answering your own question with all this pretentious "Are they afraid of roleplay" and "RP is a grand majesty" stuff.  They're not avoiding RP, they're avoiding the RP community.  It's not enough that you have your own entire servers to do your thing, you then have to wonder loudly why apparently inferior people won't come and play the game the way you want them to.
---
What makes normal servers enticing?  The mutual understanding that we're just here to play a game and prove nothing to anybody.  The relaxed rules and more forgiving social atmosphere.  Nobody yelling at us because we're running in the inn.  Nobody whispering blatant sexual innuendos.  We care about the lore, but not as much as you and so what?  PVP players sometimes act like they can't have a good time unless somebody else is having a bad time, and so-called normies just want everybody to have a good time.
---
For the record, most of the MMO's I've played have been on RP servers or in RP-friendly guilds and environments because yes, as you have stated it's a generally more immersive experience even if I don't participate.  But this idea that people rolling on normal servers are somehow having the wrong kind of "bland" fun or are "afraid" or "opting for a safe and lame way to play" is ELITIST. BULLSHIT. of the highest caliber.
---
That’s a good point. I think when every boss has its own resource meter and spots you have to dance between, it doesn’t feel like you’re taking down a boss. Personally, I think BC and Wrath has the best balance between “simple believable mechanics” and “mechanically engaging.”
---
Do you think farming Gnomergan 3 hours per week to do any meaningful DPS is fun? Go feral.
---
On the one hand, I want a relaxed guild that doesn't have the toxicity. On another, I want to raid seriously, I want everyone to have the pots, to know the tactics, to not suck, because I think of myself being able to do that. And from my own experience, combining the two is impossible. Hence my frustration. Sure, I'll probably have to settle for a sluggish guild in the end...

On Herod? It'll go for at least 350

There have been shitty unfunny memes since day one. Mods refuse to ban them, it's a shame.
---
1. Hunter, prot warrior &amp; rogue wears the most tier. Shaman, priest and druid wears some. Mages/warlocks/paladin only wear the very endgame pieces.
---
2. You need to have a mic as a tank in almost every single guild. That's 100% required.
---
3. It does work if you simply adapt to leeway. Here's a video of a guy doing it on the beta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rsx2ARJyXY
---
4. Not that I know of.
---
5. With addons you can since it shows up in your combat log.
---
6. There's addons for that. Atlas map is what you are looking for.
---
7. Yes it does.
---
[What about this?](https://youtu.be/8zuH8srcwE0)
---
So did we. The younger portion of my friend group (early to mid 20s) fucking loves discord and I hate it. I get that TS has a shitty looking UI, but i dont have to boost for better sound quality. Plus being able to run your own server has its perks. Discord might as well not have a privacy policy either.
---
Didn't think it was possible but you're most welcome.
---
Dude, stop being so god damn greedy and just think of others a bit more ok? You realize why the buttons name is "greed"?
---
Staysafetv guild is really hardcore and they are bringing a boomkin to raid
---
Is shazzrah really that popular? Why? I'm gonna join it because my friends/guild will, again because it's the unofficial Scandinavian server.   
---
Is it due to that?
---
The Horde zones may not be as warmly picturesqe as many of the Alliance zones but they have strong character worth experiencing on the darker side of beauty. The vibes from Horde zones can be haunting and cold, but are all equally rich in the way they feel to the light, comfortable Alliance zones. Especially with Halloween coming up soon after release, it might be a good time to embrace the discomfort of Tirisfall Glades, Silverpine Forest and the like. In the end most of the zones you will be going to are shared by both factions, but will be characterized by the traits of each faction's attitude/values. More so than the few exclusive zones, your decision should be influenced by the more pressing elements of each faction, their races, architecture, lore, culture etc. If you feel at home in the Alliance stay with the Alliance. The Horde may be different in many ways but is an equally good and rewarding choice.

Because they're shit names, Valarasha

Got some sources? All I've seen on his Twitter is him talking about games, surprising amounts of detail about his fetishes, and some political talk. Are there some outrageous examples of a consistently unhinged character there?
---
Or are you saying there are a few examples of him getting mad at someone on the internet? I would argue every person on reddit is guilty of the same.
---
Not saying you're wrong, but if people want to keep pulling down his reputation, use concrete facts and sources.

A guildie reached out to get some in-game assistance.  We will be running with a third generation WoW Player.
---
We had fun "dragging" his kids through zones, dungeons, and raids.  Now we will be teaching his Grand Kids.  Good Times!!
---
unfortunately, so many other people are thinking this same way and its gonna overpopulate the server with non RP type. Not a good thing for the community there.
---
I disagree at times especially during lulls in content there really isn't a lot of meaningful discussion to be had. I agree we low effort memes and ms paint drawings shouldn't be allowed because they fall directly under "low effort" but the occasional high quality art post of everyone's favorite Scarlet Monastery boss? I don't see a reason they should be disallowed outright.  
---
The weekly art thread isn't a solution because let's be honest they're always dead. Real content will always have priority but there isn't an endless supply of it.
---
Yeah but that's also the issue with pretty much every system unfortunately. Someone doesn't want to suices/spend dkp/get gp for the boots because they're hoping for mage blade or something
---
And you were part of an, at that point, extremely small minority of players.
---
The absolutely vast majority of players did not mind playing wow at that point.
---
Yeah it'll be tough. But if you're an active raider and a team player you should be fine.
---
Lol what?
---
The cheap markers don't. You gota get a fancy paint maker than has those accessories
---
Wow did this once upon a time as well.
---
Repeating of course.

The attunement was cake. Buy some stuff on the AH if you don't have exalted.

 I have the names Victory and Judgment on Herod looking for similar names for paladin.

As someone who’s also really positive about 99% of how Classic is being handled, I’ll still probably be complaining about layering, if it really is that bad.
---
Of similar calibre? Hang on, I'll roll my face on the keyboard there....
---
What exactly does classic+ involve? Keeping level cap at 60 and just adding new raids and stuff?
---
Yeah, one of the main reasons I don't want to play a healer or tank for classic. Sucks at everything other than dungeons/raids.
---
Well everyone is telling me to roll a human rogue but I love the dwarf models and animations. So fuck them I'm going a fat short dwarf rogue.
---
There is no context needed. You spelled it all out. You just fucking lied about it, lol. In one post you said that you starting during the war effort. Later on, you retcon yourself when it's convenient for you. That's not called context champ, that's fucking lying. Hahahahahaha, what a sad little man
---
They do enough damage to to naxx vanilla wow was never about the dmg meters
---
In WoW, real life violence occurs when the sub is canceled by parents.
---
Not reading official forums for one.  When has going to those *ever* been a good idea?
---
i think i started by binding every ability. i also used an addon to make my bars "clickthrough" so i literally cant click anymore.
---
to test what keys to use for binding purposes, rest your hand relaxed on your keyboard. then look what keys are the most easy to reach for you. for me its: 1 2 3 4 5 q w e r a s d f v b space. those are prio1 binds. prio2: &lt; t g y x c . prio3 are binds that are not used for combat purposes because you have to heavily move you hands. for me: z u i h and some f keys.
---
decide on how you want to use your modifiers. are shift alt ctrl always the same abilitys?( 1= frostbolt, s1=rank 1 frostbolt, a1= mouseover r1 frostbolt etc.?) or are those used just to get more keybinds on your prio1 binds?
---
then i started testing and thinking about every use case for every ability and their combination use with other abilitys.
---
for example: you dont have to move for casts so beeing able to use your movement keys and the cast keybinds is not as important, while free movement during gcds of instant abilitys in very important. (i use an instant on "2/3" because i can use "a" and "d" at the same time while using "2/3", i can also use "v/b/space" while using "a" "d" AND "2/3")
---
once you feel like your binds "make sense", test them for a few days. (if you only test them for a short time you cant tell if your binds are bad or you just arent used to them yet)
---
keep some binds open for utility items or consumables (even when you dont have any currently). nice bindings are cool until you forget that you have no left for healthstones/ grenades etc.
---
also think about macros. can you simplify some "combos" by using a macro. are there "smart" macros that free up prio1 keybinds? etc. etc. but keep in mind that there are moments where you dont want to use that "combo". so dont be reckless with macros. popular example are swifty macros. they are bad, dont use them just to safe space.
---
thats all i can come up with for now :). hope that is helpful :)
---
I don't really understand this fear. I'm new to r/classicwow and I've been subbed to r/WoW for a while. Why do people not like the art/tattoo posts? Its not like they're hyper prevalent or intrusive, I think it adds to the sub's variety. I totally get trying to eliminate reposts but why someone's art that they put time/money/effort into?  I mean clearly they enjoy the game and want to share their passion.
---
This is a genuine question btw
---
Yup. Just played a pserver of woltk where they literally buffed all mechanics and shit by 30-50% and it was still easier than vanilla. You can tell so easily if a player did naxx in wrath or vanilla by asking about Heigan. Vanilla players be like "yeah it was annoying iguess" and wrath players will say he was the hardest boss in naxx. Why? Because the stupid dance was the hardest part about wrath naxx, that's how easy it was.
---
Back in actual vanilla warlocks weren't expected to show up with 40 soul shards. Summoning large groups of players in general was uncommon.
---
TBH a centrally located realm makes more sense if they open some more realms. People from east or west coast can join and still have solid ping. Also a ton of people are CST so that's a thing as well. It's mountain time that has the fewest by far.
---
it doesn't load past episode 2
---
Man I got into the character creator at like 6:04 pm Est and reserved one name for myself and 2 for my one friend each. It’s gonna be lit. If you see Doubleoelf out and about come at me bro! Or we can party up depending on faction.
---
i really admire your clickbait title
---
Check out wowhobbs on youtube, to give you some inspiration.
---
Yup, I host a TS server for my 5 irl friends. But the entirety of my WoW friends use Discord and laugh at me when i suggest a move to Teamspeak.
---
super queues
---
Difficulty is relative to the knowledge of the playerbase, otherwise it's just a pointless argument because obviously as players get more sophisticated so will the game. Measuring the pure technical difficulty of something in a vacuum ignores the fact that players today are benefit from everything that has been learned over the past 15 years.
---
In Vanilla, no one knew anything. They had to figure it all out on their own.
---
Negatory ghostrider. You're such a super cool dude. Real pro. A+++
---
You can still create characters there, just expect long queues at launch/when logging in.
---
I believe classic is a separate client and you will need to redo your bindings.
---
Streamers will dictate AH prices. It’s just an assumption, could be wrong, but I remember distinctly during the Beta, assmanbald gave McConnell some “OP” level 30 gear and then he through that bitch on the AH for an unrealistic price. People will give streamers shit and then they will sell that shit for a huge ass mark up on the AH. Streamers being on the server skews everything towards their favor. It’s just the way it is, if people are willing to donate real money to them they will have an influx of in game resources. Thus raising prices for AH.
---
It looks like a mane. I really like the design. 
---
Take engineering, mind control the other faction and give them buffs. Be the bridge between both worlds.
---
That's not at all what I said. I said that it devolved to that in Goldshire on all the servers I've seen. That's a specific group of people in a specific place, not all Rapers. Way to put words in my mouth though.
---
Probably around 18 to 21, maybe.
---
False, the most depressing era of my life happened prior to getting back into the game after WotLK came out, where I played it as a distraction and was happier as a result.
---
Just introverted. Lots of social interaction at work, so I need some time to recharge when I get home
---
No one wants to face a geared warrior. Idc what class you play. A geared warrior strikes fear into everyone.
---
You're like a year and a half too late on that.
---
I have Looc, cod and cba any interest?
---
I think even their kids will have the skin coloration.
---
They got rid of the demonic hold over them, the green is simply a product of the Fel corruption.

Im not an expert though.

Video games are a perfect way to get better at english. At some point you will notice that Games and movies are way better in english then german. Alot of jokes get lost in translation.
---
What's the fastest way to get to Ogremar from Stormguard castle?
---
That's why the name was unavailable to an Alliance character on Herod.
---
Imo STV gets the bad rap because you can’t really avoid it. For 20-30, you CAN totally avoid hillsbrad 
---
Stranglethorn is very hotly contested because it’s relatively easy for both Horde and Alliance to get there, and there aren’t many alternatives. You CAN force your way through the 30s without STV, but it’s brutal and requires an intimate appreciation of centaurs and yetis
---
You might be in the wrong subreddit if you don't enjoy grindy games...
---
I see where you are coming from but you should be placed in a group with 4 warriors, so Improved Weapons Totem is pretty important to them. You’re right that it is a mana intensive build and depending on the length of the fight. You are altering your gear set towards more mp5 heavy sets in longer fights and away from it and more into Agility and Crit sets in shorter fights (mostly while maintaining Hit Cap). The 0/22/29 is really a utility build. Some fights, like Ragnaros and Skeram, you’re going to be healing, on Shazzrah, you’ll be on purge duty while tossing around chain heals. On Gehennas, you’ll be almost full crit and swinging freely with maybe a few chain heals. Obviously mana pots and runes are a must.
---
kinda retarded from blizz to only open 2 servers for the germans
---
Queue times and new servers w/ free transfers hopefully.
---
My guild on ND had a string of perds. We had 4 back to back but then it went dry.
---
Let the spite flow through you!!!!
---
There was also a start of the outlands zone in the original game files.  I believe they later took this out.
---
Because everyone hoards dkp and it winds up being loot council for all unwanted items anyways.

Only people with toons on that server can create more atm

Any idea which servers were chosen by majorities from countries without dedicated servers?

I vote to hide her in the huge area under IF that most players never find.

Thank you for the quick answer!

I went with that blue color, #7 in the dressing room.  Seems like it will stick TF out in a BG in incite terror into the Alliance.  "Oh no, its that guy again".

Alliance obviously...

Didn't he get fel infusion as a baby, or in the womb. Cant remember off the top of my head

&gt; I think the best way to get into trying it is to just use 1-9 on your keyboard instead of clicking

 I think the best way to get into trying it is to just use 1-12 on your **mouse** instead of clicking

FTFY
---
The starting zone will be crowded for weeks, no worries
---
Honestly I feel like your timeline is beginning arbitrarily and thusly implying causational relations where none might be. You arbitrarily start the timeline in Cataclysm - I assume because you didn't like it.
---
It's a nice graphic otherwise, but your starting point is biased and arbitrary. I could make a point that flying introduced in TBC pissed off a lot off people and the failed attempt at removing flying in WoD started the no-flyers to long for a time before flying ... you know? Doesn't mean it's true at all. Also WoW's growth declined in WotlK. Yea, the player numbers were still rising, but NOTABLY less than in TBC and classic. Now it might have been due to a natural peak (not everyone is interested in MMORPGs) but the piss easy content turned me off for one.
---
I honestly have problems understanding people who love classic who think WotlK is the best expansion. WotlK had/introduced so much shit that makes retail the crapload it is today (flying, dailies, pisseasy leveling, raid difficulties, ...) that I still have problems understanding how people who hate retail can praise that shit for anything but the atmosphere/story, which obviously greatly benefitted from featuring the coolest character arc in the game (Arthas, duh). Aside from that? Gameplay wise? Huge disappointment aside from ICC and fuckmeforgotthenameofthesecondraidtierinwotlk.
---
Now that I'm done ranting about WotlK: I just think your entry point is weird.
---
Really you can do just as good clicking.  I always clicked and had no issues topping or being in top 3 dps in raids.  I actually think it's better if your bars are setup right in high movement fights.
---
That sounds cute as hell
---
You're missing out on the excitement in the air. The sence of finally being among others like you. I'm sorry for your loss.
---
Probably 15-20g per xmute and then it’ll drop.
---
Its not even 3 hours of farming you get 2 to 3 per hour based on reset cap yes but you can hit reset cap in under 15 min is literally like 45 to 1 your of farming for weapons
---
What was the rework?
---
I remember leveling and getting deathcoil roughly the same week as the change.
---
I didn't rly pvp until after that and in other xpacks.
---
Warriors are the most played class but most of them are dps and tank warriors gear up super fast and after that they don't spam dungeons with your for your rare drops.
---
When kiting with a boar pet, you can command it to stay until the gap for its pet charge is big enough, then send him back to attack.
---
This is correct. The corruption is essentially a genetic change. All orcs descended from those corrupted will be green for a very long time.
---
Sure, however other systems usually have some way to deal with it to mitigate it at least a bit. with SK its usually a "all or nothing" kind of thing, unless you really start to customise it with how much is each item worth - at which point it essentially becomes overcomplicated DKP.
---
For reference, my guild is planning to use EPGP with a weekly decay, and lowered cost for additional offerings. What this means is, when item drops it is offered for 100% of price (and people can claim main spec prio etc for it). If nobody takes it, it's offered for 50% (and nobody can claim any kind of prio on it anymore). If nobody still wants it, it is offered one last time for 10% of price - and finally its sharded. Also, every week the EP and GP of all members is reduced by 20% (meaning they keep their prio order, but hoarding is significantly less effective, as they both hoard less and their "bought" items decay faster).
---
Would u happen to know if any addons work for classic that i can re-arrange my action bars similiar to elviui
---
Wow! Very nice names!!!
---
I play with 250 latency, would it be better for me to go for tauren instead of orcs because of the melee leeway if i pick warrior class?
---
Theres always some stories, discussion, a facebook page that posts, etc...and i'd say that all happened with Classic.
---
The commercials, facebook sponsored ads, etc always seem to be pretty close to the movies release, i think?
---
I guess maybe the exception is movies that are going to be sold out, but i think thats moreso local places doing some advertising, or they post on the facebook page, etc?
---
Not really.
---
Yup I've realised this now xD
---
Gasp!!
---
So your saying people who picked Herod don't like "foreigners"?
---
Wait... what? Depressing?
---
that sound like an interesting system, I wouldn't mind trying it out.  I already have been in traditional dkp and LC guilds
---
I noticed that, too. I feel like some of the new subs here have not played vanilla and are now very hyped (like the gaming industry has them conditioned to be nowadays). 
---
Well either they'll find fulfillment in the game or their hype will die off and a lot of them might switch to the next AAA game that's released. We'll see I guess.
---
It's too late. Already medium and will be full, I'm sure, by release.
---
Just say 'Haven't trained it, too expensive.'  when someone asked for a summon taken from one of the comments above.
---
Medium or High pop servers are in relation to each other server. It is not indicative of how many people are on each server but how many people are one each server in relation to every other type of sever. Medium or High pop servers can still have long queues. It’s all gonna be dependent on how many layers each server utilizes and how long it takes for people to get through the slog of queues. Blizz has been pretty hush hush on the whole thing so we will know more come launch. People will tell you not to roll on “full” servers, because they want their queue times reduced. I’m personally rolling on a full server because that’s where my guild decided to go, ideally a medium pop server would be the best imo but high-full pop has a higher likelihood of surviving after all the causal players stop playing.
---
Orcs who didn’t drink the blood would turn green over time due to the presence of warlocks. This is especially true for the Frostwolves, even though they didn’t even have warlocks of their own. Either his parents would have turned before his birth or he turned soon after being born. I don’t recall which is which. It’s like the eyes of a Blood Elf. Even if you don’t partake in the Fel, if you’re around it enough it’ll change you.
---
You’re ruining this game.
---
Don't forget, Horde locks have to deal with dwarf priests' fear ward too!
---
Very true.  It's all about your priority vs how well you are clearing raid content.  I'm probably not going to get reaper unless I'm absolutely having shit RNG luck on getting a 2h through MC or some other boss drop.
---
The astounding amount of effort you put into this really shows
---
In the past I wasnt the RP type but I have come around. If someone is even considering rolling RP, then I think they are probably ok as a faction-mate.
---
I have Gouge planned for a rogue but decided i like my other name better, would take Doc for a priest
---
I just play PC games while laying in a tanning bed.
---
I will be somewhere in the middle, but I'm not sure it's hard to understand why someone would want to rush. They want to compete and they want to be the best. That is how they have fun. I don't think it requires a deep analysis.
---
I remember never getting gear back in the day because we switched the raid nights and I could only attend 2/3 of new schedule. I kept getting docked dkp for missing the raid (just was the way the rules were set up), but didn't want to leave because I had been with the guild for months. Officers were unsympathetic to that one night being impossible for me, and I was 10/11 at the time so I never stuck up for myself or just left. It really ground my gears because I was always the worst geared healer in the guild by a large margin, but I still had one of the highest (or top 3) heals, least (or at least bottom 3) over heals, and a decent number of dispels. That isn't to say those meters were what was important, but I clearly was contributing but getting little.
---
I think the key isn't that vanilla/classic has it terrible, but that I let myself get into a bad situation. You have to make sure your guilds operating style is what you need/want and that you're compatible with the guild's culture. If you're careful choosing your guild, I think it will be much harder to have such problems.
---
Tyvm for this
---
I'm just excited to play the game as myself now as an adult. When I played vanilla I was so young that I really had very little total understanding of what I was doing, but now I'll actually be able to play the entirety of the game.
---
Blizzard HQ is on the west coast (Irvine, CA).
---
Now, obviously, number of servers in an area has to do with the demand of that area and not the company’s HQ location, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t at least a little bit of favoritism for the area because of that 😋
---
Remembering the retail Vanilla WoW servers, I feel like some of the west coast servers should have been moved to the east coast because there were more full east coast servers than there were here in the west.
---
I could be way off, but that’s just how it seems to me
---
A few months ago I got the orb on retail when farming mc. I had been looking for the transmog for my shaman for ages. Then I realized I got it on my dk. fml.

Warrior is clutch priest is enjoy /thread
---
Weird, I have mates that constantly talked about how chill and relaxed and congratulatory their Raid Force was. Shamans making it into the Warrior group and being like "this is my time, boys", people joking around in party chat, people passing on upgrades because it was a bigger upgrade for somebody else, etcetc...
---
The only time I heard mentions of anything being nippy snippy was during Naxx progression, because there wasn't a lot of time to clear Naxx and everyone began to lose interest with Burning Crusade around the corner, a lot of Raid Forces began to dissolve.
---
Sure, my server had the elitist guilds that were proper arrogant pricks and maybe their guilds were full of shit heads, but it was like 2 raid guilds out of like dozens of raid forces. You just gotta notice the red flags and move somewhere else.
---
In their defense, the vanilla talent window is just a single pane, e.g. Fire. It's a narrower and more boring visual. I bet they used this on purpose because it looks cooler.
---
Any faction | Any server | NA.
---
I'm looking for a guild with a strong focus on activities outside of raiding. I can't currently commit to specific nights, but I plan to be active in PVP and am a pretty big fan of professions, dungeons, and alt leveling.
---
Another thing I thought of is you don't see warrior tanks idling around because they're never idle. I have a group of friends to play with and I'll be their tank. Even if they all drop out, guess what, other people will add me to their friends list and ask me to tank for them. I'll never be sat around in Org waiting for others
---
Sounds like you need some new friends!!
---
Sry no just talking about the talent called "setup" in the sub tree
---
&gt; do you want to force others to play according to your vision of the spirit of the game?
---
Tips does. "Blizzard should break this addon because **I** don't like it."
---
The smallest dungeons are 5man but you both won't have any trouble getting in those casually.  If raiding and pvp aren't priorities just play what looks fun.  Shaman and warlock is fine.
---
 That’s awesome dude!
---
I have to believe that discord and other modern player connection platforms will make this process much faster. Bigger guilds with more people too.
---
Give him a break he got those names reserved and thought Of them all by himself!
---
MC is 40 people, the bosses have at most around 800k hp. 
---
If you're running 30 dps, you need each dps to deal 27k damage, assuming tank damage is negligible and healers aren't doing damage.
---
30 dps dealing 300 dps kills the beefier bosses in 90s. 
---
300 dps is incredibly easy to do, so 90s is a pretty reasonable assumption for the fight.
---
&gt;You can be hard-core without caring about speed or raiding
---
No. Just no.
---
The left might have control of reddit, youtube, facebook, and twitter, but we own general and trade chat in World of Warcraft.
---
Lots of miserable people in this world. That's why you have dislikes lol.
---
There are pictures of that on google, not many, perhaps. But there sure are pictures of it.
---
well no shit, next thing you'r gonna say that the lack of summoning stones also benefits the social aspects of Classic vs Retail.. it's not like this is being said for over a decade or anything :P
---
I must have missed that, is Herod where you and the rest of the Good Morning Azeroth crew are planning on playing?
---
If you're gonna play together, one of you should definitely be a healer. That will be very useful leveling

Yeah my guild had like 2 or 3 before I was attending as a main raider, but during that time (was about 1.5 or 2 years?) only one dropped. It was a heartbreaking way to not get it too because I went into the raid knowing I had more DKP than any rogue in our guild at the moment, but nightslayer bracers dropped and I was the only rogue without them so the guild forced me to take them even though I had BF bracers. That expense put me under another rogue and when perds dropped, he took it and subsequently quit playing wow a month later or so.
---
It’s possible but IMO the policing of attitudes via their Discord, I’d say Fairbanks would be the likelihood
---
Fear Ward isn't as bad because it's a one-and-done, but it's absolutely another factor they deal with.
---
gdkp is the fairest system, change my mind
---
I was 21
---
it was glorious
---
raiding, drinking, working. a tiny bit of sleeping.
---
it was a nice time
---
Everyone stopped playing because beta.
---
Remember all the angry posts in this sub about how Blizzard weren't advertising Classic like a month ago?
---
&gt; What does that matter?
---
I dunno. I thought we were playing the baseless accusation game. Nothing has to matter when playing that game. It's baseless accusations!
---
I got my name on Herod but it was taken on Stalagg when I logged on the night it launched. I guess the guy I took it from decided to play there instead

It is highly dependent on how the whole process went about, how many dependencies you have, etc. It's pretty crazy to assume 15 years later Blizzard would have everything in place for a 10 minute reroll. I don't buy that for a second.
---
There’s gotta be at least a couple, but it’s probably coincidence.
---
Or so we think...
---
1.5 AV
---
Loot council should be more like 3 people who are most likely friends making the guild. Who will insist that their ret paladin friend needs gear over the 10 fury warriors.
---
This sounds like semi-hardcore or casual+ tbh. Actually wouldn't even call it semi hardcore.
---
I swear if hunter needs on SM armory's strength helm I'm flipping the table.
---
Honestly, you need giantstalker gear 8/8 then you are good for pvp. Aimed shot, autoshot, multishot autoshot opener, religiously one shots clothies.
---
Pretty sure this dude isn’t rocking a Razer Naga mate. Obviously mouse would be cool but baby steps eh?
---
"just replaced in 10 levels" im not sure you understand how significant that is.
---
You greed for money and need for upgrade in gears because gear. End of story, stop being so greedy and try to justify stealing other peoples loot.
---
Any two classes will work for what you want. It's a good idea to have one that can heal so you're good there. It's also a good idea to choose classes that use different gear. Warlock would be cloth and shaman is leather/mail so you won't have to compete for the same items. Be sure to choose different professions as well. Maybe one of you can grab mining while the other grabs herbalism. Leatherworking and tailoring could make good 2nd options so you can craft your own gear later.
---
Gotta save room for those call of duty icons.
---
If it was up to me, I would give her like 20 random spawn points in northern barrens and she stays there for a period of 2ish hours so it would actually be beneficial to ask in hat where she is so you dont spend an hour looking for her.
---
Im just really bad at finding images :P
---
This.  I was in two guilds.  One left to another server because my server was garbage, but I stayed behind.  Then I joined another group that I really enjoyed and loved hanging out with.  
---
There was pretty much no drama at all.  Very chill.
---
2 Guilds lmao.. the dishonestly is real.
---
Its relative.  In TBC Gruul was a guild killer...the main mechanic people failed at was splitting 5yrds.  We have quaking as an affix now and its considered free in M+.
---
Different times.  
---
Its like saying basketball in the 1940's was the easiest time in basketball.
---
I always forgive a druid that tries to help their buddy, but stops when they see they're outmatched.
---
I'm saying people who picked Herod want to play with English speakers mainly, and apparently (from what I've read, not experienced) there's a trend that comes out of Brazilian WoW culture, that they are toxic players. This is the experience from wow players who have played with them. Whether this is accurate or not I don't know but this is their reasoning. 
---
But at least it's realistic that a trend like that can be seen from a specific culture of people from a specific place, there's no trend of "white people" as they are all across the world and don't share anything unique culturally just because of they share the same skin colour.
---
Haven't enjoyed PvP since WotLK, looking forward to having fun again.
---
That’s not a daily occurrence though, that’s wpvp at it’s peak. Usually you get ganked until you’re forced to log or go away. Let’s be real here and take the good with the bad.
---
WoW will be the death of WoW killer #9471
---
Tier 2 was in MC from release
---
Before P2 could mean 2 weeks. It could mean 2 days if the population calls for it. 
---
The average player didn’t reach 60 in Vanilla, it will be the same in Classic. There will be many people quitting very quickly. Many of the people who stay will cut back their play time after launch week. There could be 30,000 active accounts on one server, but only 3000 players online at any given time. 
---
New phase releases won’t bring people back to play since the people who quit won’t be 60, I.e. the new phase won’t have anything for people who quit. 
---
The population of a server will steadily decline. At some point layering won’t be needed. It could be as soon as 2 weeks.
---
Aw but now you've spoiled the surprise! 
---
Awesome idea :)
---
That's true. I hope you have so much fun in Classic on your mage! :)
---
You should all meet in the gnome starting area, it will be less crowded than the human one.
---
Banana suit. But i most likely won't get it until players stop quitting(most likely after grinding r14 LOL)
---
Alliance now, I guess. My friends wanted to be horde on Mankrik but switched a couple of hours ago to Pagle so now I have no names since my Mankrik names are worthless now. ;n; lol
---
Human Paladin when I get a name! :D
---
I never suggested spending money.  Why have a guild bank at all then if everyone can just trade for the mats?  I just don’t see why one player should get BiS gear and the other gets nothing.
---
This is the worst list
---
&gt; Uhhh Brazilians isn't a race? it's a nationality.
---
This is a ridiculous distinction. Disparaging *all* Latin and South American people is okay because that isn't a "race", but you draw the line at white people? 
---
lmao what a mess
---
End of BRD trinket u mean seal of justice? Don't steal that from melees bruh

I thought it was more like 5-7 people.  Idk though, that's just always what I imagined.

Honor system is phase 2, alterac (and WSG) is phase 3

Just like DKP systems, EPGP can be customised.
---
You can have every item have a customised GP cost, depending on how "wanted" this item is for various people (i.e. BIS is more costly) - or you can give every item "type" same cost (as we do), meaning ALL 1h swords are 1000 for example.
---
You can add, remove or change weekly decay - our guild will have 20% weekly decay, but you can set it to 10% for example, or remove it. We also plan to have a 50% decay one week before new raid tiers, to avoid pre-tier hoarding, but we might discuss that further so as to promote people to show up for previous tier.
---
Is the hunter mid/late classic drop off overstated? I am still split on hunter or mage but have decided on mage because I keep reading that hunters suck toward the end of classic.
---
Someone should do a post with various ways of loot distribution, there are terms  I am not familiar with.
---
What he mentioned can be achieved with keybinds, maybe that's what he meant.
---
Community and the fact that your reputation (as a player) will matter. Mostly being able to experience the "MM" portion of MMORPG once again, instead of playing queue simulator.
---
You mean Heroes of the Storm?  And yes it is significantly better than LOL and DOTA2.  Blizzard just over-invested in the eSports on that game and had to pull the plug a bit.  Game is still going and still great though.
---
I would argue this is false. You walk out of the raid with nothing in dkp and council if you don't win anything. gdkp you walk out with gold.
---
Ohhh man I miss SWTOR. On release I played Sith taking the most evil story options possible. Watching my character physically change the more evil I got was so cool. Lowkey miss that game.
---
Honestly I don't think there will be a noticeable difference on any of the servers whatsoever, maybe Gehennas will be slightly lower pop than the other two thats about it. Stuff like this is blown way out of proportion in this sub, same kinda thing as streamers "ruining" servers.
---
Unpopular opinion. But trying to tell new players 'how to play' is going to dimish the Vanilla experience. Especially to these RP standards. Just let it play out. THAT'S Vanilla.
---
I totally agree with you on every point.
---
Must suck to have pre-k reading comprehension.
---
[Boomkin piece of shit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnNITODORGg)
---
other good options available and limited points really. imp sap and serrated blades are must pickups and you want to reserve points to use in assassination for CB or combat for imp sprint and still get some assassination points.
---
I didn't play in nilla so I didn't believe the feral thing for a moment, until this comment. flight form chicken was a common olympic-level sport in tbc days
---
Rogues could use it, however it was THE best possible cloak a Hunter could get. Rogues got a better cloak in BWL. So it's BiS for Hunter, and a hold me over for Rogue.
---
They can use numbers in wpvp
---
Man, I love that place, it's such a cool dungeon in terms of design, and doing when it's level appropriate with event at the end felt so epic.
---
No fucking way!
---
I've never been more happy!
---
Thanks for sharing that.
---
It was not meant to be a solution, but an acceptance of what what trees actually were.
---
its favorite now, it wasn't anyones favorite back then. 
---
too long, too low level of loot for most 60lev characters, way too large range of levels in the instance (like 10 levels) so bad for levelling, it was a maze the first few runs, especially before altas, everyone wanted to do some different event or boss so groups had to compromise who to kill, who to skip etc.
---
Well done
---
What patch is classic going to be?
---
*that* is interesting. Thanks for all the info.
---
Good luck and stay healthy. How much sleep are you thinking you'll get?

She's only on another layer because she joined another man's party.

---
2 man dungeons isn't really a thing.  Unless you want to go there 15 levels higher, so doing a lvl 30 dungeon at lvl 45.  (Min you, you will mostly get lvl 27 gear there...  Not very useful for a lvl 45.    But you will find a couple of other older players with the same casual mindset (trust me) and with 4 it's perfectly fine. 
---
So the other replies already had some good advise.  I would only add it is nice if 1 of you can stealth,  this is a very handy and time saving ability for casual players to get to some dangerous spots and grab that ingredient that one of you needs.
---
Vanilla actually wasn't a bad time in my life, TBC on the other hand was rock bottom for me, that being said it's also when I met my now wife (partially through WoW), so in the end it all worked out, but it was a bad time, and honestly running a raiding guild in TBC helped keep my head above water during most of it.
---
It hurts things like Heroic Strike for sure. When it comes to Bloodthirst though, that's based off of AP. It would greatly effect abilities like Mortal Strike(won't have as fury), Cleave, Heoric Strike, and Whirlwind though. Otherwise it's basically all white damage auto-attacks and procs. A dagger in your Offhand(Felstriker maybe?) wouldn't hurt, but your Main hand should probably be a hefty Axe/Mace/Sword(Ironfoe maybe?).
---
Yeah, 100k is practically nothing.
---
This shit hit way too close to home.
---
I thought maydie was a tauren. Or was that pat?
---
I don't fucking remember, they were just iconic.

---
I got the sub for stress test. It cost me rougly the same as cinema ticket, but more fun.
---
I believe there is a dagger from lbrs that gives crit profs and people would run it in their offhand.
---
They also stated (or at least I've read they have) that now they have the framework and tools in place, it'll be a LOT easier to retrofit newer content.
---
Oh i totally forgot about that strat but it just woke up so many memories!
---
due to dungeons being easier and better exp leveling as rogue, paladin, warrior and shaman is way better. Rogues seems to have taken the least falls out of any of the classes. They can do stupid shit to abuse hunters and mages in classic that they can't on pservers. 
---
But on pservers you could dispell soul link of the pets which I'm pretty sure you can't in classic, so maybe soullink is way stronger in classic.
---
Moonkin when accounting for moonkin aura is 76%~ of a mages DPS. Mage is 72%~ of feral druid with MCPs DPS. If we look at raw DPS numbers it's 141 DPS and 236 DPS. So if a mage is worth bringing but a oomkin is not, that basically means bringing mages should also only be done if there are roster issues and feral druids/fury warriors/rogues and a hunter in each group of 4 warriors are the only people you bring for damage. Or we can accept that it's doable, not hot dogshit.
---
I honestly believe going back to a similar talent tree on live would make the game more enjoyable so long as the talents were well designed.

&gt;The /r/WoW subreddit is now just Deviant Art, Screen Shots, and shit memes. 
---
A big part of that is because BFA is shit.
---
Why do you care about faction balance on a PVE server?
---
Nope. There should be 1 sm ruin lock.
---
Wait until you see the storyline for future patch / expansion, this tattoo will age very well.
---
First figure out faction and class. After that pick a race. Don't worry about the details, you'll have plenty of time to learn and research as you level up.
---
If you need help with classes, lots of youtube overviews
---
There might be some suggestions posted on [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cr6f74/this_is_probably_a_dumb_question_but_google_is/) from earlier too. Sub is active these days so it was buried a bit.

My guild decided to play on Whitemane, but grob mob will be my horde alt.

Oh, so it's because there were better alternatives, not because it was really slow? Thanks.
---
He may have come from the RS community where names such as this are sought after,
---
Sm ruin lock, paladin, feral OT, warrior OT, MT
---
Because the talents leading up to the level you'd need for it in the combat and assassination tree are *much* stronger. It's only useful for soloing and PvP. There is *some* mild use in leveling as something like hemo swords and picking it up, but in general it's subpar to leveling as combat.
---
I mean their raid dps is crap, not sure why anyone cares about raid dps. They are utility dps, they kite and stuff, their job isn't to top charts.
---
Perhaps in a full guild run. Most won't have full guild runs, Many members will be pugged.
---
Wow a ton of work has been put into this thank you for posting.
---
What is?
---
Your not reading what I'm saying... Everyone gets BiS... Everyone who can farm mats Pools them all into getting everyone who uses BiS crafted gear their gear.
---
Some classes don't get anything because they don't need it. Better geared players, faster clears benefits everyone though, which means they get the chance to get there own gear in a better stress free environment.

Female trolls are high tier
---
Was just about to say, a ret pally will judge, and have aura that will increase holy damage by a lot.
---
1.13-ish. I say ish because they are making some slight changes here and there but overall keeping the bugs, i mean quirks of the time.
---
You shouldn't be having sustained fights as hemo. That build is all about controlling your opponent with stuns and you do that with the crazy amount of combo points that it generates already, without using setup. 
---
[This](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhe0oEzZhZxMe0chRo) is what I'm going to spec for as hemo. What 3 talent points would you shift around into setup?
---
Depends on how you're defining hard.
---
Warriors are hard because they are heavily gear reliant. Often miss or parry, and will die if they fight higher level mobs or more than one at a time. Its not hard to level a warrior it's just more tedious.
---
Hunters suffer the same issue until 10 then with the pet tanking you rarely face dying unless you manage to pull several mobs. Neither of these are hard in actual skill ceiling.
---
If you want to level in a way that requires more thinking, skill and coordination the something like attempting large aoe fringing on a mage might be better.
---
If you literally mean hard in the sense you will die more and spend much more time eating then go for warrior.
---
While waiting for the first Warsong Gulch queues to pop in Ashenvale, I watched a Druid and paladin duel for 25 minutes until one of them ran out of mana.
---
I think this truce was based on their inability to kill or be killed.
---
Eh, call it whatever you want.  At least I dont work at Onion and contrive stories to make a living.
---
“Just because it’s YOUR fave doesn’t mean it’s ours!... ah, whatever ice cream is ice cream”
---
It's one of those things WoW really should have stolen, and I'll never understand why they haven't.  That and the public events in Warhammer online should be in Wow today.
---
Well this is likely a baked in ad, so it was likely written from copy points Blizzard gave them. The onion is run by the Fusion Media arm of Univision which is the same group that owns Kotaku and other media outlets. I've paid for these types of sponsorships in the past and this reads like a terrible version of that.
---
Turtles are extremely good, except that they don't eat meat, so you better be fishing.
---
You're the best kind of friend!
---
For me I think it was because it was my first dungeon. I was still young and WoW just blew away every other game I had played before. Then you get to your first dungeon and you encounter so much cool stuff. Bosses that are way stronger than any mob you've encountered before, blue drops, figuring out how to play as a team and communicate effectively etc. That first dungeon experience just sticks with you.
---
The raid content was probably the easiest it's ever been, sure.... But organising 40 people to be in the right place at the right time with everything they need for a progression run? Most people can't even get 5 guys to turn up for D&amp;D night.
---
To then make those 40 people do all the things they have to do, co-ordinated to do them correctly and not screw it up, is like trying to herd sheep into a country pub full of loud drunkards.
---
Sure, raid guilds that want to progress as quickly as possible aren't going to have a hard time, because every single player is dedicated to completing that raid above all else.
---
But the average raid force? You got people that lose track of time and turn up late. You got people that signed up but then made a commitment RL and can't make it. You got parents and their kid have a nightmare. You got people with pets and the pet is puking. You got a random teenager that has had too much cola, bathroom breaks... So many bathroom breaks.
---
Yeah, Classic content is easy enough. People? People are not easy to deal with, man.
---

Holy shit this is amazing - the quality, the attention to detail and effects, and especially the humour. It's timed so perfectly too which I feel is something kind of lacking in most Machinimas these days.

Subbed!  💚
---
That's the boat we are in. so we are just trying to get a good idea
---
That sounds lika a guild that will disband before the next raid so they wont be using LC anymore.
---
Yeah I just meant in general that’s a problem that Druid runs into.
---
Pagel horde will be fine. My whole guild is rolling there, we just don’t have an famous streamers and don’t feel the need to advertise where we’re going
---
Corrupt LC guild will disband before the next raid, so they aint using it.
---
This author wrote this article based on copy points Blizzard gave Fusion Media Group.
---
Um the gold has a process of multiple applications to be accepted and requires a lvl 60 within 10 irl days of launch they plan on being the best guild possible. I don't think that involves a publicity stunt
---
Ill definitely go without questhelper but I will be using instant text.
---
Yea i heared it too that it got better, i even sometimes see posts from their subreddit on r/all and they're all positive, so thats good.
---
Trying to figure out what race to go on horde. Out of male troll, orc, and tauren, which has the best animations?
---
Yeah people at least talking about the game even if it's repetitive.
---
Dude dont foget watching Leroy Jenkins on Repeat and Love Not Warcraft over and over :) !
---
I might also go buy a ruck load of dorito's and moutain dew :D :D
---
Yeah try bribing the murloc guards at the gate to let ya in, a few raw fish should do it.
---
PvP used to be a much larger part of the game imo. The rewards were much more meaningful and impactful. PvP is literally like half of the game, it's a lot to miss out on. 
---
World pvp is going to be nuts in phase 2 when the honor system is brought in, along with pvp rank rewards. There's gonna be no bg's and the only way to get ranks is going to be world pvp. That will be amazing imo.
---
&gt;something more like Galaxies.
---
Now that brings back my real nostalgia, I stuck around till the NGE, that's when I fully transitioned to WoW, I played before that to 60, but the NGE was where I fully gave it up.  I'd kill to get a game like that again, though I don't think it would ever be successful.
---
I highly doubt that the servers will get locked from adding new characters. I have been out of retail since I tried Cata for 6 days. So when I resubbed I hopped on  retail server and it was “full” but I was still able to create multiple characters. Full doesn’t mean locked. Full just means it’s a high populated server. You also have to realize that people have made 3 characters on the server and won’t be playing all of them at the same time (unless they are boxing). In the grand scheme of things, 80 people isn’t that many players when layers are going to be 3k players deep. My only skepticism is that low to medium pop servers might die later on, and in blue posts they have already said there were no character transfers in Vanilla with no plans to implement them in Classic. Which means if a server dies you will have to reroll on a higher pop server and grind to 60 again.
---
The reason MCP works for them, is feral druids damage isn't based off the weapon. So you're just using the weapon for the attack speed buff. And a SoR paladin doesnt care so much about white hits. His damage comes from the bonus holy damage off each attack. The faster he attacks, the better.
---
I like this. I remember playing a druid because they seemed like the most neutral class and idgaf about the Hoard/Alliance beef. I had my own agenda.
---
I agree 100%. I'm a fast clicker and I need void crystals. Too bad I keep only getting nexus crystals. Guess I just need to keep disenchanting.
---
My guild is going to Atiesh. Characters made &amp; ready to roll.
---
That means Nihilum had poor leadership, which is a weird thing to say.
---
Takes like 30 min per run, easily repeatable. Hand of Justice isn’t hard to get. The hardest item is Edgemasters by a long shot if you are a race that needs it. Painweaver might be a bitch. Bloodmail boots is 100x bigger problem. 
---
So yeah, HoJ is the least of your problems.

---
What in the actual fuck are you going on about? I'm using the word racing because anything before the launch date would be rushing into it. I like that you're fixating on a word, that has nothing to do with my point. I guess stupid people make stupid assumptions.
---
While Daggers weapon damage is lower than 1h swords/axe/mace they attack faster resulting in more white hits and therefore better rage generation.
---
While your Heroic Strikes won't hit as hard with a Dagger, you will be using Heroic Strike more often with Daggers than with other weapons.
---
Seems we do.
---
Literally a shitpost.

---
Thank you so much for this! This looks amazing
---
That’s up to you if you want to play Tauren more than Orc. Personally I would always go Orc. 
---
I wouldn’t go Tauren just because you have high ping though , that shouldn’t make that big of a difference.
---
I think warlock+shaman will be a great combo. Warlocks are a really solid questing/leveling class and adding any class that can heal compliments them nicely because of warlock's ability to turn health into mana to keep on fighting. It makes for little to no downtime. Plus you both have a lot of useful abilities for tackling elites and such, so I think you'll make a strong pair.
---
I'll be playing similarly with my husband actually! Might have his brother playing a warrior too though, but we were thinking about trying to 3 man dungeons...not sure if it'll be doable though but it'll be a fun little challenge to try out.
---
Whatever happened to Main Spec Need /roll?

The scale of that raptor is way off.

PREACH! LEVELING IS SO FUN IN CLASSIC - EXPLORE THE GOSH DANG WORLD WE FOUGHT SO HARD FOR YOU TO EXPERIENCE. RETAIL IS ALL ABOUT ENDGAME, CLASSIC IS ABOUT THE JOURNEY AND COMMUNITY. ENJOY THIS SHIT.
---
The easiest way would be for you, or someone like you, to create your own classic wow subreddit that you can curate to your exact specifications. I think any time you have a grab-bag general sub like this one, it's unreasonable to expect the scope to be limited aggressively in favor of one type of content over another.     
---
            
---
Relying on a third party, like the mods here, to intercede on your behalf when they have obligations to the body as a whole is just a recipe for frustration. Seize the means of moderation!     
---
And if you object to that notion thinking, "That will never work because only like 100 dudes will come over if most people are here and it'll be a dead subreddit" I would contemplate on what that means as far as how many people feel as strongly as you do about it.

Imo people making characters on realms that they have no intention of playing just to sell or trade is toxic as fuck, they may as well be bots, and all of those posts shouldn't be allowed on this subreddit.
---
You too!
---
Blizzard knows how many will play far better than all of you. This whole thread shouldn’t exist
---
No bullshit scaling gear.
---
Example when bfa first released prior to m+ unlocking, I had nearly min maxed my gear for available content.
---
Logging on now, my 125k hp isn’t shit compared to the 340k people just strolling around.
---
In classic, the difference is there, but it’s not as pronounced.
---
I'm going to murder every Druid I see in classic as I've been getting Warstomp Cyclone'd in tbc arena for too long
---
How many in your guild?
---
When I get home I'll pm you some. I have a ton that are yet-to-be-written as I dont have beta and will need to test for myself to make sure they work with the 1.12 version on the newer client. :^) I hope your project goes well as this seems like it could be such a good resource for players!
---
If someone made a website for private servers, you can absolutely bet they'll do it for classic
---
Might happen to me too,  but after some days.  :D
---
maybe someone else mentioned this, but i didnt see it  
---
they dont spend time looking for groups and often get to reserve the items they need. it leads to them being 'done' with 5-mans, for example, faster than anyone else.  
---
just know there are never enough warriors. ever  
---
no matter how heavily played, theres never enough.  
---
*side note - get some spirit on your gear while leveling. end up with next to zero downtime. warrs regen rate from spirit was OP in vanilla(and nerfed in tbc.) take advantage of it. The spirit is almost free as far as the item weight of stats.  
---
like an 'of the bear' might be 8str/sta but another same level item may have 7str/7sta/7sprit ... get a few of those spirit ones.
---
Sure, when all you do is pug, GDKP may be best.  But later on when guilds are more established, or have a good rapport with another guild to get full runs going, another system will work better.
---
This is much more in depth than mine, well done!
---
I looked it up, in  WOD it was 1300, in legion they bumped it to allow 4k. So I am unsure how this distance would affect FPS. Did you try it in the test?
---
If the guild I’m in goes as far as we’re predicting, you may enjoy seeing a similar image I made in the top dozen or so guilds, come classic! Looking great tho!
---
WHAT IS THIS BLASPHEMY?!?!

I believe myself and others have given you enough information to speculate and research for yourself at this point. Good luck in your quest.

Not to be pedantic, but the conversation was:
---
&gt;Do we know if bindings are going to be dropping in p1?
---
&gt;I assume so? Why wouldn't they
---
&gt;Mcs original loot table is much smaller and got updated in 1.4 and 1.5. Bindings are useless until bwl comes out and were added a bit before bwl originally
---
Given that the expected time it takes to get both bindings to drop is probably 8-12 months (?), whether or not you'll be able to farm them in P1 is very relevant. Just because the items themselves were useless during that phase, doesn't mean that those items wouldn't still sell for thousands of gold. 
---
To say they are useless is the just the wrong answer to the question of "Why wouldn't they[drop in phase 1]?".
---
Me2?
---
No you just sound ridiculous. Why point out you are an adult in the first place? As if it is something special xD 90% of the player base are adults.
---
Yup, doesn’t seem like a disruptive name either.
---
The 2% chance for extra hit applies to melee only. You would take away a proper insane and rare trinket from a melee just for the 20 AP Stat stick that it is to you. Proper huntard thing to do.

I hate it so much, they shamelessly call those videos as classic guides... While they are only private server videos with shitload of inaccuracies.

The whole private server boss mechanic was built from 0 with lot of guess work. Guess how accurate that is.

---
The issue is people are always going into the leveling dungeons too early to actually complete them because you can get the quests at lower levels. Same thing happens in Uldaman, people go at like 41-43 but the last boss is level 47 with a bunch of add spawns to top it off.
---
This is blasphemy...
---
I love it
---
Nihilum is not the guild to make the gold standard. They are unlike 98% of guilds in that they are minmaxing, elite players. 
---
Every guild is different, but many are similar. Find one that fits your play style and your reasonable expectations, and you'll be fine.
---
given that 5-10% of active players are online at any given time. that’s a very dead server. but reddit population is only a fraction of total players which is a good thing.
---
They're just questing in the mine for some gold dust. She'll be back soon. We're gona level together. &lt;3

Yup. There's so many directions this can go. I hope it continues to survive and have a thriving community similar to what happened with OSRS vs RS3.

If this is anything like the pserver I played on. When you go to get your aqua form you will be moonfired by a 60 constantly. There is no druid code outside of the guards aggro range
---
Herod is probably at something like 9000 (in the most conservative) to anywhere up to 45000. None of these goal posts, or any number in between them, or remotely near them, resonate with a small amount of layering.
---
Or are you going to tell me when the server is marked as full (therefore que times) that doesn't actually mean it's maxed and maxed with its layering capacity.
---
You can modify the addon to add more cast time, that is what you see on the bottom bar... watch the video.

The addon doesn’t adapt to the delay. And the delay is not always there

Human prot warrior.. I like the fantasy setting, the different races, cultures, etc. But I was like this in AD&amp;D too. Almost always played humans. For all the different storylines, plots and other things I could imagine for RP, I had a hard time dis-identifying the main character from myself, and I had a hard time picturing that character as anything but looking similar to myself. I often play the human good knight-type character, who usually has personality traits similar to my own. I've been working on that a bit in creative writing recently, trying to write characters who behave in ways that I, personally, could never. But it is definitely something I have to practice. Perhaps with an alt. My main will be a human prot warrior.
---
"My favorite dungeon hmmm?"
---
Man I wonder what the question could have been.
---
There are like 5 old schools Llane guilds all rolling on Herod as well, it's what convinced me to move off Atiesh, can't wait.

And the hydraxian warterlords!

im in EU most likely on gehennas
---
There is no other solution so please SHUT THE FUCK UP
---
Not going to help with your background, but back in the day I played exclusively Horde and had only my Rogue for the longest. My favorite thing to do was stealth all the way into Alliance major cities and take screenshots of me waving as close to the leaders as I could get without being detected.
---
It was super cheesy but my 15yr old self loved it

nice

I'm hoping they don't see this ^^

Can vouch for the G402 which is essentially the same without the bells and whistles. Great mouse, been using it on all the stress tests, will be hanging on to it. If you go with the 502 you may run into the same hiccup with me where Windows doesn't register some of the side buttons as mouse buttons. What you do is download the Logitech software and bind those buttons to keyboard keys you won't use, then map those keys in game.

I will main prot warrior  but my most played class will be a hunter for farming gold.

Don’t need quest addons, have my brain. It’s all in there 😎

My journey began in 2011, when I quit retail and had to dwell on private Vanilla servers like a Gollum (peace to The Rebirth).
---
Its really awesome. Better interface. Slows down questing. I love it.
---
Tanking is by far the hardest instance role.  You have to be the team leader instead of cruising to gear and blaming everyone else.  Also not everyone can tank, especially in vanilla where it requires skill.  If you are awful at dps the instance will just take longer.  If you are an awful tank you won't be able to clear the instance.
---
So can the others...
---
But don't you think your guildmates are also on this subreddit and have seen the memes themselves and so you're just showing them the picture they themselves saw 30 minutes prior?

There're almost as many Full/High servers on Classic as there're on Retail.

40 people can kill him in 1 minute if every single one does 438 damage per second.

Or, 20 people doing 877 dps.

or 40 people can kill him in 30 seconds if all 40 average 877. And so on.

1000% support this. Partially because streamers generally suck (except for a few) and because they go against recreating the Vanilla wow experience as streaming did not exist from 2004-2007. and also it's hilarious and I really want to see them rage about it.

Yes, if you browse for 20 minutes, of course you will see similar posts in new. They're new.

"our faithful recreation of the game servers as they were over 10 years ago will be a real treat" - is it a faithful recreation of their servers if they have multiple layers for months? Nope.
---
"“As soon as you step into Stormwind as it was back then," again, not a thing with layering. "WTS mana potion, at SW mailbox!" only to find no one there at the spot because hes not in your layer.
---
Just because Blizzard keeps repeating the same phrases doesn't mean they are actually true. It won't be a faithful recreation. Perhaps still enough to no life, but people are gonna notice the difference very fast..and their false advertising isn't helping the reception when launch is about to happen.
---
Didn’t blizzard say they’re labeling the servers as to what the think the population will be after launch and not what it currently is just from name reservations?
---
I'll try and edit it.
---
My theory is that 
---
Herod will end up being the Illidan of Classic, very high pop and mostly Horde dominated.
---
Pagle will be Sargeras of classic, high pop and mostly Alliance dominated. 
---
Faerlina will likely stay fairly even due to the streamers. After a lot of streamers start leaving though who knows. 
---
Whitemane is a tossup. I think this could be a fairly even server tbh with maybe a skew towards alliance.
---
Wheres the erp
---
You forgot stage 8, where you leave your guild to go to the best guild on the server after acquiring it.

Isn’t a mage’s rotation just Frostbolt/Fireball?

I was Horde from Vanilla to Cataclysm.
---
I'm going Alliance this time.
---
Why?
---
Cause I want to experience the same game, but also a new game. I've never seen most of the Alliance leveling/starting zones. I haven't done any of the quests and Alliance quests were much better fleshed out than Horde quests in Vanilla.
---
I spent days of real life time experiencing the Horde. Why would I want to relive hours upon hours of grinding that I've already done?
---
I want to see something new.

You have to take the boat from Mythril Harbor to Duskmallow Marsh and then run through the Bare Wastes.

I would say Druid or priest would be best option then. Druid really only gets gear that helps them heal from raiding loot and can tank heal or dps any dungeon at level 60 with the ability to be versatile in BG’s especially WSG. Priests can heal in dungeons or BG’s pretty well they just rely on tanks and dps to keep enemies off of them but fights in BG aren’t super long before ya win or die so you won’t need all the fancy gear a main healer for a raid will

Seen plenty of drama happen in DKP guilds too. When a "non-optimal" class/spec spends all his dkp on Drake Fang Talisman/Neltharion's Tear, this causes just as much drama.

Hemo daggers is generally always subpar to hemo sword/mace. If you're going to use daggers, you're better off just foregoing hemo. Hemo will be more about generating combo points and stuns, daggers more about bursting down quickly.

Just what I came to say.

Imo, AQ collection should definitely be swapped around so it's different materials.

I think I’m in the same boat. I spent hundreds of hours grinding through the horde zones back in the day. I suppose it’s time to see what’s on the other side of the world.

"The west"

I played SWTOR way longer than I played World of Warcraft. The vanilla game and those first two expansions were super good. But I think at some point the devs had a hard time figuring out what the game was actually supposed to be and how that butted up against the Hero Engine. That lead to that kind of meh Revan expansion. It seems like they'd change focus every other patch, which instead of pleasing everyone, really pleased no one.
---
But man did it completely go off the rails with the Fallen Empire stuff. That story was... lacking, almost felt like someone's fan fiction that they decided to make into a AAA game. And the group content just got really watered down as well. 
---
I'll probably go back to it when it reaches maintenance mode to take in everything with at least one character, but it really feels like a wasted opportunity. I agree with you that another Star Wars MMO would make me very happy.
---
And then before you see how it comes up, check if you were holding your breath for a certain result.
---
oh I know.
---
you'll dig up some nonsensical stuff like how herding 40 cat is harder, even if each cat job is 1/100th of what they have to do nowaday, or how managing the DKP system is such a chore, or whatever other excuse to pretend classic was somehow hard, instead of accepting how absolutely horrible people were back then.

You’re right, countdowns shouldn’t exist.  Why are they a thing again?
---
The best guilds in the world use group loot, because they know what their BIS is and what every other class/spec's BIS is, and they trust each other.
---
Literally 99.999999% of all guilds in WoW in the last 12 years have used LC if not group loot. Nobody uses DKP SINCE maybe TBC, and that's because DKP is trash. I swear, everyone arguing for DKP literally hasn't PLAYED since Vanilla it feels like. And we're not talking about the best guild on each server. Just any normal raiding guild looking to progress, since like freaking Wrath at least. Hell, DKP died out in TBC tbh. 
---
Guilds are ran a lot more efficiently nowadays then back in 2004, when people were backpedaling clickers that sat around waiting for something to do. DKP is trash. And is about as corrupt as it gets, go read literally ANY forum post about guilds that used to use DKP in Vanilla and how corrupt it was.

**Western world**
---
The Western world, also known as the West, refers to various nations depending on the context, most often including at least parts of Europe, Australasia, and the Americas, with the status of Latin America disputed by some. There are many accepted definitions, all closely interrelated. The Western world is also known as the Occident (from the Latin word occidens, "sunset, West"), in contrast to the Orient (from the Latin word oriens, "rise, East"), or Eastern world. It is often correlated with the Northern half of the North-south divide.Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome are generally considered to be the birthplaces of Western civilization (with Greece having influenced the development of Rome): the former due to its impact on philosophy, democracy, science and art, building designs and proportions, architecture; the latter due to its influence on law, warfare, governance, republicanism, engineering and religion.
---
It is simply the way the game was meant to be played. It's a lot more exciting when you know you could be attacked at any time. 
---
&gt; Finally, after spending your whole time leveling getting ganked, I really have little desire to do the ganking once I get to max level.
---
See, you say that but once you try it you'll find it delightfully enjoyable. And it's not always as clear-cut as clubbing baby seals.
---
I remember one time on my Druid back in Vanilla, I (Aliiance) was roaming around Thousand Needles for whatever reason, and as I came across Horde I was ganking them. Now, I was a resto druid. So my damage wasn't great, but it was enough to kill the lowbies I found.
---
So I did this for about half an hour, going back and forth across the zone. But then suddenly, as I was passing under the main Horde quest hub, I got jumped by a 7-8 group of lowbie horde!
---
Apparently all the lowbies I had been ganking got together and formed a raid to kill me. Now, me being a resto druid, I wasn't exactly that easy to kill. My bear form could tank a lot of damage and I could swap it and heal back up when I got low. 
---
But I hardly did any damage either, and since the raid of lowbies had a couple healers it was near impossible for me to kill any of them. I did manage to sneak a couple of kills, but they just ran back and rezzed within a minute.
---
So this battle continued on for about 10 minutes. This raid of lowbies fighting my raid boss resto druid. Since I was next to the main quest Hub more Horde kept showing up, until eventually I had about a dozen on me. It was too much, so I had to run away. It was pretty difficult, with so many people on me, and I almost died a few times. But eventually I made it to Feralas and the raid of lowbies stopped chasing me.
---
It's experiences like that which make PvP servers great. Sure, sometimes you get ganked. It happens. Not the end of the world if it does. All you lose is the little bit of time it takes to run back to your corpse.
---
But you also get these amazing experiences out in the open world. When you see that Horde about to take a Black Lotus, but kill him and take it for yourself. When you come across a friendly Warrior being ganked by a Mage, so you heal him up and turn the fight around. When you gank so many lowbies that they form a raid to take you down.
---
It's just so much more fun and interesting than rolling on a PvE server.

This post is so long yet says so little.

Tldr- rp realms are rp realms

Grobbulus is ERP. Just look at him.

Thank you for the clarification. I assumed it was additive but I wanted to double check.

No. That's my entire point. You have to pay gold to the trainer to respec. It's not free at all. The gold penalty gets very high very soon if you constantly respec.

There could be up to 500k worth of concurrent viewers based on the streamers who have already said they’re playing on release... so I’d assume a lot more people than 500k will be playing the game. The queue for one server on NA hit 12,000 for name reserves, and out of the 20 or so people I know playing only 3 of us paid for an early sub to gnab names.. furthermore, during the stress test server pops hit 30k. One would assume that the capacity of Herod for example would be comparable to that of a stress test server, thus indicating the concurrent demand for Herod at the time of the name reserves could have been approaching 50,000 at times. But who the fuck knows!

How do you get from Strongwind City to Ironfort?

But a countdown does exist. Blizzard has one.

Personally I would start with removing the word casual from the equation. Just make a guild and outline the flexibility in raiding schedule. Any two players see the word casual and they will instantly have a slightly different definition. So just don't use the word.

To kill dragons and clear content. Only selfish casuals literally ONLY raid for loot.
---
But you can still switch your talents at any time with a respec. This obviously invalidates the talent trees and should be removed so that your talent choices matter!
---
And you would be mistaken. It's by far the most involved DPS.
---
yes!
---
This can make it possible to get more HS than a non dagger war this is not a problem as aliance since salvation as horde you will face threat problems ware 2H WF fishing is better.
---
Also there is the point if you can sustain rage for execute on each global you will do more damage in the last 20% of the kill to.
---
Day 1 no doubt about it. Any servers w/o a queue on launch day will soon have one as people who don't want to wait will just hop into that server, even if it's just to make a character they don't plan to main.
---
Exactly at the STV level... Coincidence? 🤔
---
Is being nonRP on RP bannable? I would hope so...
---
I'M A GIRL, AND I HAVE NO CHANCE OF EVER CONVERTING MY PREPPY ASS GIRLFRIENDS TO PLAY WITH ME. WHY CAN'T THEY JUST LET LOOSE AND ENJOY BEING NERDS FOR ONE GOSH DANG MOMENT?!  TO ALL THE DUDES WHINING ABOUT NOT HAVING ANY RL FRIENDS WANTING TO PLAY WITH THEM, TRY BEING ME FOR JUST A GOSH DANG MOMENT. MY ENTIRE LIFE HAS BEEN SPENT PLAYING GAMES WITHOUT ANY RL FRAAAANDSSSSS, IT SUUUCKS!
---
No problem! Esp since different games treat that topic differently (anyone played path of exile?).
---
I've played on an RP realm since 2005 and by all means I'll respect everyone's decision to participate in RP. But you have to respect the fact that not everyone wants to, and even RPers themselves aren't interested in being in character 100% of the time. People are going to use the universal chats to have conversations with other players, not their characters.
---
People that roll up on RP realms, not to RP, are usually doing so for the sense of community that RP realms are famous for. There is a kinship among all the players, everyone is generally friendlier, and this is a very inviting atmosphere for an older or more relaxed player to be a part of. This does not make them obligated to participate in your Role-Play, and it does not give you the right to dictate how they should act around other players.
---
If someone intends to roll up a permanent character on your RP Realm, they likely intend to respect your right to Role-Play, but they are by no means obligated to, and they certainly are not obligated to participate in it if they do not want to.

BGs will be cross-realm, so that's not an issue.
---
I'm concerned about faction balance more in the sense that I don't want to choose a server with very little of my chosen faction. Close to an even split is also nice on a full server, because you get to see lots of the other faction.
---

It's happening in my pants right now
---
Damn that’s why dkp is antiquated in my opinion. Loot council has worked for my guilds recently but it still comes with some problems. What I’ve found that worked for my last guild was having the same consistent rogues raiding every week and having a prio list for pieces so you knew when you were up for gear. Usually they would ask you your top three pieces that you wanted from that tier and they found a way to whack it up.
---

---
Mages get a lot better as phases progress though.
---
T'inquiète classic a des mécaniques bcp plus simple et le jeu est plus lent que BFA. Les mauvais joueurs ressortent sûrement sur bfa vu l'intensité du mythic+ mais ça se passera carrément mieux sur classic a mon avis

Dude he bodies 3-4 people at a time. Vurtne shows there is virtually no skill ceiling for mages

oh man I love seeing twitch chat talking about WEST VS EAST  also when I pick my region in a game, I totally see WEST AND EAST wtf is NAW NAE?  EU? asia? oce?  never heard of em
---
&gt; Literally 99.999999%
---
No they don't
---
&gt;Nobody uses DKP SINCE maybe TBC, and that's because DKP is trash.
---
"People don't use it, that's why it's bad"... that makes no sense.
---
Thank you for the clarification. I assumed it was additive but I wanted to double check. Thanks for the link. I wasn't aware of that item and am actually looking into working it into my build!

---
This could only really be calculated for bosses with enrage timers. If they don't enrage the time part of the equation is however long your healers can keep the raid up - which obviously has a ton of variables.
---
If you don't have fun without the add-ons, then use the add-ons.
---
Hi mate, we are coming back for WoW Classic, we are about 780 EE and on our discord I've gathered up about 100 people from old bloodscalp, Flado, Xsjado, Sorgoth, Roxx, Gingaone, Lysithea and like god knows how many more.
---
If not to play with us, come and speak with like anyone that was on the vanilla Bloodscalp EU
---
https://discordapp.com/invite/013SFCCtN8wKrIixI
---
Yeah, his tone didn't help that case. Nor the "boi oh boi" which seemed pretty sarcastic.
---
I think we're talking about different streamers then.
---
The hate people have about the blacklisting or "entitlement" stuff is aimed at Sodapoppin, who has been playing private servers on and off for over a decade. There's no next big game that's gonna take him away from classic. It's a similar story to a lot of the dedicated WoW streamers. I.e. Esfand, Venruki, Ziqo, Cdew, Madseason, Tips, Staysafe, etc. At worst, a few of them (particularly arena players) will continue playing certain aspects of retail alongside classic.
---
There are definitely guys like Shroud, Timthetatman, Mizkif, and Summit who are more variety streamers and will probably bail before long too long.
---
That being said, I still think the potential effects of that are exaggerated, as this will likely be a small portion of the community and will happen to some degree on every server regardless of what streamers are playing there. I highly doubt any US PvP realm is going to have any issues with population down the line. Even when more casual people get weeded out, you're not going to feel it as much due to layering.
---
Tbh my biggest concern going in was faction balance, because I don't want either faction to dominate in world PvP.
---
Don’t let it hold you back. I know a lot of people who play healer with high ping, and are great players. Go for it!
---
Is there a mousover macro to invite players?
---
Sure! A couple of people have asked, hit me in a dm and we'll sort something out :)
---
Lol join grobbulus I’ll heal u guys
---
Gonna go set a google alert for "where is Mankrik's wife"
---
Ahh the r/classicwowcirclejerk subreddit is forming i see
---
Yeah I guess the summoning stones near the entrance are not working
---
That's /r/classicwowplus
---
But yes I feel the same way some of the shit done on OSRS really ruined the main game. You pretty much have to play ironman to play true runescape and that's still not accurate since you can't do random trades and stuff with people.
---
ITT: People taking the bait.
---
What gets me more than Evo is Blizzard. You have to click the ability aim it then click again, that's just slow.
---
What a joke.
---
It mostly comes down to name rules, that's about all that people really care about on rp servers.
---
It kinda reminds me of Harry Potter
---
"Like an elephant in a porcelain store"
---
Or just don’t let the game take over your life and go outside every once and awhile.
---
I disagree with your disagreement
---
The leeway/range is entirely independent on hitbox size. But yes the range is the same.
---
So 99/100 of all pserver guilds were super hardcore? None of them were casual raiders, or semi-hardcore? They were all super elitist server first world first big-dick epeen guilds? Really? Because again, literally none of the PS guilds, whether they were raiding 40 hours per week or 4, were using DKP.
---
The same reason you bring more than 1 class to a raid.  So that they don't have to spend the entire raid night crafting water when some one new joins  or someone whispers for more buffs or water.
---
&gt; It sounds like you've never played Classic.
---

4 years of vanilla pserver screenshots. Thanks for insulting me though. Since you're not interested in rational discussion anymore and are instead resorting to "REEEE NOT CLASSIC, YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT LOL", I'll go ahead and block you now.

I haven't played the original release, started in wotlk, and I look forward to finally finding out where she is!
---
Do you have a picture of what they look like printed vs a computerized image?
---
How absolutely dare you predict the future of retail.
---
High end raider don’t make the best game designers. The art and quest design in retail is the one thing the vanilla community unambiguously supports.
---
The proof is in the pudding. The game has introduced many negative features since vanilla which have made the game worse. Not little ideas here and there, but the big picture ideas which make up the major game systems.
---
Brack is well known for saying how dungeon finder fixes the problem of having to look for a group and get to the dungeon, but that feature is one of the most hated of all time by the vanilla community.
---
Ion is known for trying to make raiding more accessible, because not many people were able to access raid content. Not many people entered Naxx for instance. But that is what made WoW great, there was content which seemed so hard to get to that there was a sense of scale. And even in a period of the game where raiding was not accessible and barely anyone did all the content, where most players were actually just leveling, that is when the player base expanded the most. It was actually the leveling and questing which attracted more people, not the raiding and endgame.
---
Allen Adham is an example of one of the actual minds behind WoW. He pushed for world PvP and for the two faction system, and he had to work very hard to convince a lot of people that it was a good idea, and it is one of the defining positives of WoW.
---
Kevin Jordan was one of the class designers whose philosophy made vanilla so great. The classes were so unique and interesting, and there was a strong focus on roles and archetypes.
---
The people who joined after vanilla and supported things like flying mounts, dungeon finder, dual specs, personal loot, and class homogenization *gutted the game*. They did not understand the original philosophy and only tried to appease the whining hardcore raiders. They did not understand the fundamental design of the game. Their improvements actually made the game worse. Kevin Jordan has said that he argued strongly against many of these things but was overshadowed by the “new” hires who were vanilla players, and he has said that “hardcore players” often make bad game designers because they can’t look at decisions objectively.
---
The people that came on after Vanilla only rearranged ideas and changed things here and there, they did not actually improve the game much from a fundamental design standpoint. The fundamental changes they made were almost all terrible ideas. They have not added much in terms of genuinely new ideas which are good for MMORPGs. Fundamentally they don’t understand that some elements of the game which people complain about are actually totally essential to the core of the game. Even retail players complain constantly about how WoW feels like a single player game and how it doesn’t feel good to get rewards.
---
They haven’t been taken over by suits, and I never said they were. They were taken over by people who can’t make tough decisions that are controversial but good for the core game philosophy. Like removing flying mounts or dungeon finder teleportation. If they actually improved the game, I would be the first to support them, but I can’t see how the game has improved at all except for raid mechanics since vanilla.
---
If you have an idea of how the game has improved big-picture design-wise, I’d like to hear it.
---
As someone who never got to raiding the first time around, I'd definitely appreciate this.
---
On the plus side at least OP can't be killed.
---
do so
---
We got people from Bomen Zjin Relaxed, Substance, Dagon Roots, Shiver, Mortifiera, Hollow Grin, Hrafnin Flygur, Suicide Kings, DiE, Nightwatchers and god knows how many more guilds
---
People get really worked up about this stuff.
---
Anyone can suggest an alternative for Vanilla addon SPELL ALERT for Classic?
---
Spell aLert addon warns the player of the spell being casting from the hostile units by displaying a text message on your screen:
---
PLAYER X GAINED VANISH - PLAYER Y CASTS CRIPPLING POISON ON HIS THRASH BLADE - PLAYER Z BEGINS TO CAST FIREBALL - PLAYER T CASTS CHEAP SHOT ON PLAYER E
---
If any of the popular private servers were any indication of how population will work, it will increase all the way to BWL and slowly dwindle (bar new phase releases) after. WoW is like crack up to BWL.
---
I'm sure you can try it and later down the line you can find someone to fix your impairment as part of the RP if you don't enjoy it
---
I disagree, enchanting is a damn gold sink till you get patterns that are kinda rare.
---
Random respawning anywhere in southern barrens on a 5 min timer
---
That ... quest ... text ... just ... scrolls ... so ... damn ... slowly .. that ...
---
LET ME READ THE FUCKING TEXT!!!
---
... it drives me insane.
---
OSRS operates on the "so bad it's good" level, while the entire culture is built around shitty memes, and it works.
---
Every other sub just takes some popular instagram/twitter meme template and badly photoshops X character onto it.
---
Lol, no they don't even kind of.   Unless we're in world where 100=110 or 95=100, that's some neat math.
---
You can play with instant text and still read all the quests. the default speed is just sooo slow.
---
well currently he's fire so many he changed it out when he was frost? There's at least some hope there, but no evocate keybind? cmooooon
---
The only good thing about either sub are news reposts and the weekly threads.
---
SM cleave was definitely possible
---
And IDK what kind of guild you're used to, with people coming and going every night.
---
In fact, if people are coming and going every night then DKP makes even LESS sense. like wtf.
---
No more character creations allowed for a while. Should go away in a day or two dont worry
---
Of course it's not a private server. Look at that aspect ratio
---
Nah, gotta get that bread cuz
---
If a server is full it is full. You will not be able to make a character there unless you already have one. This is stated in a blue post from blizzard on the forums.
---
There won't be realm transfers right? It would suck to start on a french server and seeing it die a few months in.
---
Nothing. Like, till launch at the most it means that the first week might have a queue.
---
Why cant they compete?
---
This is one I made for myself.  I use a Corsair 12 button mouse, and have the shift, crtl, alt bound to a mouse button since I cannot press those keys on the keyboard normally because of limited use of my left hand pinky.  I made this based off of Warpborne's post.

auto-loot with a keypress(ex: shift+click) was put in 1.9  
---
classic will have single click auto-loot as an option
---
WoW Classic won't be using the same patch as World of Roguecraft. You'll need a good weapon.
---
Are the meeting stones to allow for auto-matchmaking for dungeons? This was implemented during Vanilla but everybody hated the system; I wonder if they might be useful this time around (especially with a newer add-on).
---
No you need to spend 2k on a new PC to run classic
---
Can't remember my first green or blue, but my first purple was Wall of the dead. It dropped off of a random skeleton in sorrow hill. Can't wait to experience it all again.
---
You don't know what I can and can't perceive, everybody has varying levels of sensitivity to input lag. I'll roll a character on an Eastern server after launch and determine for myself. Thanks for the downvote!
---
Any other profession is a gold sink that doesn't have a "till".
---
lol.  i never went hoarde in original vanilla so i'm looking forward to scouring the entire barrens trying to find her.

Your average European is probably more like upper class for Americans. So to your average American, You're rich.

---
The perfect answer is to have engineering.
---
shine on, you crazy diamond
---
&gt;So 99/100 of all pserver guilds were super hardcore?
---
Yes. Do you not understand how much extra work actually playing on a private server is for the average person? If you don't then you must be pretty disconnected from reality.
---
Grob Mob!
---
I played the same way (evil as possible). My buddy joined and noticed that most of the quest evil replies boiled down to "there will be no survivors". So - need to go pick up some power converters at the next station over? "There will be no survivors".
---
Even more indie than Jagex
---
Okay :)
---
That's right. There was also a bug with Rogues where sometimes Vanish didn't drop the "threat" from a pet if they did it too late, and the pet would ignore it and hit them anyway.
---
I remember Rogues bitching about that one, to which I would answer from my alt Rogue "Vanish sooner then homeboy".
---
Yeah, good art.
---
But good art is rare - le wifey's crayon drawing of a level 20 Night Elf rarely qualifies.
---
Yeah, the hard parts for stuff like this in Vanilla was typically the low drop rates.
---
*a stealthed trio of 2 rogues and a druid appear*
---
STV isn't even safe for groups my dude!
---
+1 internet points cause funny tho.
---
Thats really nice of you, i appreciate it. And im glad you liked it!
---
So would a 1hr do better for SoR Ret?
---
im doing the same thing, ive played horde 10 years since vanilla its time to see the other side ! Also trying a new class so the "fresh feeling" stay longer
---
Tbh, I can see not having it keybound in classic. It's not like the rotation was really busy or you really had to move around alot.
---
Legend.
---
There will be so many butthurt people :D
---
Depends completely on the auction house on your server
---
Can you imagine being on the other end of the BG and seeing through the computer screen to a 4 year old girl staring at the screen just messing around?
---
So awesome haha
---
OHHHH HELL YEAH
---
I've always been in a DKP guild and I've never seen gear sharded until we got to the point were it was so on farm that even our off specs were stacked.
---
You bid DKP main spec, if 0 bid DKP offspec -&gt; if 0 you can /roll or LC.
---
No rule that says you have to shard stuff just because no one wants to bid on it.
---
Okay I’m not getting into an internet argument with an idiot so last response but heres why you’re wrong. 
---
You’re defining logging into WoW which retail players do most days anyway as’Racing’.  You’ve made a some mental gymnastics to define ‘’rushing into it’’ as logging in once in a week to create characters with zero downsides to doing it. They’re not paying anything extra, it’s taking 5 minutes of their time. It’s literally advertised on the WoW launcher as they log in. 
---
Everyone knows their will be a high volume of ‘tourists’ just checking out the game. The vast majority of these tourists will be retail players, as they have zero barrier to entry and they have a sunken time cost in retail which will be hard to give up. You’re disputing things that everyone is in agreement on and for what? What are you even arguing for?
---
&gt;i think i hear something about this being changed
---
You may be thinking of autoloot everything like in retail. You can autoloot in vanilla but just one corpse at a time.
---
I think, maybe i've had too many mojitos and am misremembering.
---
Wow isn’t RuneScape.
---
There's this stigma associated with being a hunter that exists for some reason. People will think of them as dumber players, because the class has lots of ways to kind of fuck over their group. Examples would be not dismissing pet before jumping down a ledge, so the pet takes the long way through mobs and aggros enough mobs to cause a wipe. Or forgetting to turn off growl so they keep stealing aggro from the tank. Hunters also shoot stuff with their bow when you right click them, whereas melee classes just stand in the ready to attack position when you right click a far away enemy. This unfortunately meant there were many a guild that started bosses too early when a hunter clicked the boss. 
---
As for the dps, well, it's not great. All the other dps classes as well as warriors will do way more damage than you in later raids. By AQ you're pretty clearly the worst dps class in the game. Tier sets are however pretty damn good even in early raids, which can't be said about many classes. So when you're in mc and bwl you'll get a nice power spike before most of the other people, so the lack of scaling between you and your peers won't happen until the dungeon is basically on farm. 
---
I would say hunters are pretty great in pvp, but in 1.12 all their CC shares a DR so I really don't know how they're going to fare. 
---
And one last thing I think is worth mentioning every time hunters are considered, is that they have the best quest in the game. The quest for their epic staff and bow is by far the biggest test of skill that any quest has to offer.
---
most of em were bad once arena's came out. in the end battlegrounds and world pvp it's the numbers and gear that count. not how good you are.
---
&gt;And IDK what kind of guild you're used to, with people coming and going every night.
---
Casual guilds... dude... you don't understand the average player.
---
&gt;(and I played on Nost, K1, K3, LB, ND).
---
This proves it.
---
Horde priest Zella.  Duo leveling with my partner as a warrior.
---
What if I don’t enjoy Sub’s playstyle but prefer PvE&gt;PvP. Or what if I love shadow but hate PvP?
---
PvE servers = Nice mature people
---
Yeah, having mained a druid, when I tried to picture that I pulled up a picture of the talent tree in my head, thinking "even if you took all the bear-only talents, I'm pretty sure there aren't...:google to confirm:...yeah, there are only 46 available talent points in that tree. I bet if you *never* played the class, you might not realize how much they condensed it in 1.8." Pre-druid patch, you could really design a thing of beauty, though.
---
It's a beautiful thing that so, so many people talk about druids on this sub like they have any what they were talking about, but there are fully two people I've recognized as having demonstrated any knowledge of the class.
---
That's a horror story, and it's a reason that loot council isn't right for every guild, especially in classic where you're managing 40 people instead of 25. But it has no bearing on individual guilds' situations. If the officers don't want to learn all the bis lists and item tiers, then yeah, don't do loot council, but if they can do it well, it will unequivocally progress your raid faster.
---
Two weeks.
---
Damn my kids are 1 and 2.  Makes me wish they were old enough
---
A friend of mine had the same question the other day, so I'll tell you the same as I told him; just have a decent name and don't interrupt other peoples RP and you'll be fine.

Something similar
---
It's really not at all. West and easy aren't regions in gaming aside from na.
---
Any chance you made an extra? lol.
---
I don't think you did it correctly . The area that is DM on the wetlands side is pretty far south from menethil
---
I got my masters and DNP online and save little kids lives daily for the last 8 years. Please tell me more on how my "online" degree is a joke, jackass.
---
is this an r/wow post.
---
This is awesome! Thank you for pushing my hype even higher!
---
The actual reason is because any threads that criticize the game get shut down by the mods.
---
Sure, I know, that's what OP asked about. I was just adding to what you said, not disagreeing with you.
---
The original video was a Harlem shake thing, and I think it was back in WoD when starfall was just ridiculous
---
Undead are great for silent RP. The guy with no jaw, he ain't talking much.
---
Old School Runescape is run almost exclusively by the community. Almost all new content must pass a 75% approval by the community in order to be implemented into the game. This would work very well for Classic IMO once the need for new content comes.
---
Okay well I'm actually disputing specific points that you're bringing up (ie. 40 man vs 25 man and private server guilds vs casual guilds) and your only argument is "PeOpLe DoNt UsE iT aNyMoRe"
---
Wtf at those keybinds 😳
---
I took a week off!
---
We had a lot of interest saving names. Just because we aren’t going serious into it doesn’t mean I was accents in my names. 
---
People seem to forget that it’s not all or nothing. Just because you aren’t raiding top content doesn’t mean we won’t hop on during down time. 
---
Most people I’ve spoken to on retail just want a change of pace between running keys and raiding. It’s free since we’re already subbed and we have the chance at quality names from memes, innuendos, or cool shit... why wouldn’t they take it?
---
10% extra warlock damage is nothing to scoff at.  People did this.
---
Oh 100%. Lysithea is probably the best unit in the game tbh
---
Omg yes pls
---
A lot of it has to do with the pet management and ammo I dont want to deal with this time around. If those things dont bother you then play it, shot weaving is super fun and aimed shot is crisp.
---
No. The 2nd one is obviously Official
---
Warlock after phase 2 (double free mount at 40 is pog) 
---
Before hand, probably warrior tbh.
---
You decided to comment on my comment with the intent to flame me. I don't see a difference.
---
There was a 4 day discussion thread a while back.  https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cexn5y/4day_chat_4_raid_loot_distribution_guild/
---
Looks like the Spitter from LFD2
---
I didn't care much about sleep when I was younger and many of my friends didn't either, are you daft or just pretending to be?
---
I agree. PoE and EVE educate players in game mechanics, but they also spoil them for games where wording is less consistent and complex.
---
I GOT ALL MY FRIENDS TO ROLL ALLIANCE, MUAHHAHA. THE CUTENESS OF MY DRUID HAS BEEN SECURED
---
So these are all still flaws in the system.
---
No one main spec wants to spend dkp on a slight upgrade, so it goes to offspecs: still not upgrading your raid to upgrade a spec someone doesn't or does rarely play in raid. Would prefer a shard for the guild bank anyway.
---
You have people roll or move to loot council: giving main spec loot in a dkp system that doesn't cost dkp sounds like a flaw to me.
---
Loot council has flaws, but those flaws come from bad execution. I have seen LC executed well. It happens. The flaws in dkp I think are less severe but more common in that they spawn inherently from the way the system works - dkp hoarding, overly punishing or rewarding to new players depending on the specific dkp system, etc.
---
They can't because enchanters can run a time spot. They have to be on, offering, and in an area to do so while every other proff just has to make it to the AH every now and then. 
---
Once again, that's not Enchanting, that's having the right enchants and working your corner well. HOWEVER, this thread is on RoI and enchanting is one of the most time consuming while Alch and Tailoring can literally log in and make a bar or some cloth and be done and gain a return for no effort or special bp.
---
This is what I worry about with DKP. If we run LC for my guild, it needs to have some decision making agency by the players. 
---
Or another system.
---
You have osrs in your name so I imagine your hardcore. Do you think the grand exchange was a good thing for old school?
---
starts with the end of classic style Wow, the overhaul of and downfall of the game
---
Yeah really.  I put memes below art on the "quality" scale for sure.
---
I have no problem with seeing both memes and art here though.  /r/2007scape does it and I love that sub even though I don't play the game.
---
No server at this point will have population issues. It's likely imo that more will need to be added before or at launch
---
It means your first rep grind, is to kill off enough of the opposing faction repeatedly until the reroll somewhere else and we no longer have Login Queues.
---
Won't be funny leveling on a pvp server, if everyone else is running around in BWL gear, that's for sure.
---
It's going to be even worse now that people are accustomed to LFD'ing their way into dungeons.
---
Oh yeah, I know very well just how much is wrong on pservers, breadcrumb quests is one thing I fixed on a non-released one, at least some of them. Never looked too deeply into the mangos core, mainly to see how they do it to compare, but much of it is just hilariously bad or wrong, same for the DB :D  
---
And yes, crowdsourcing is probably the only reasonable way to do it. That's why I asked if there is an easy way to collect data. Because I don't know of one that works, at least for targets.
---
I suppose. Like I said however, I don't believe it would fit as well.
---
somewhere...out there
---
They used polls and worded questions in their favor to manufacture consent from the playerbase. Then they can make any changes they want and say "well, you guys wanted it".  Just make sure none of that player polling bullshit comes to classic because ones it's there, it's a trojan horse you can't get rid of.
---
I hate layering and yet same
---
*shakes crystal ball*
---
damn, its broken
---
Besides the initial tank gearing, I don't see the point of loot councils
---
I feel the same way - don’t agree with a lot of the updates to OSRS, especially GE... I think problem was a lot of people that joined OSRS who played more recently than the old timers... like bc or wotlk players who might come to wow classic. And then also completely new players who come to the game and start throwing their baby opinions about.
---
Also when OSRS started getting taken serious and getting too big of a team assigned to it - all these devs with no idea about the heritage of the game trying to make it look like they’re doing something by introducing shite.
---
Hopefully wow learns from the above - also a variation on the player polling system in wow would be a good thing to take from OSRS, keep the pass percent super high but only let og players vote
---
While leveling I always took skinning and made pretty decent with it.  I was already killing the mobs so time spent was just one extra click after killing it.
---
Doggo will be best wufflock ever
---
yesss
---
I’m probably gonna spend a bit more time leveling than the average person,  but my ultimate goal is to do endgame raiding with my guild. Figured I’d stick with DPS
---
I didn't get savvy to the AH game untill late TBC/ Early Wraith (idr exacly when). But that changed the way I played the game big time. I stopped wasting time camping nodes and began playing ebay on the AH
---
I’m not in love with the GE, no, but I don’t think that’s the point of this thread, is it?
---
This guy fucking GETS IT
---
lmao. I seriously have no idea what guilds you guys are used to, or how anyone can be so greedy for loot as to fall under what you assume to be Maxerx's ideology. Again, none of the PS guilds since Nost used DKP. 
---
No guild on Retail has used DKP since freaking TBC. From Wrath onwards to today, since literally 2008, I've seen ONE dkp guild. Ever. Across 6+ expansions and 5+ med-full servers. ONE. And it was a joke.
---
If DKP was any fair, or any good, or any efficient, don't you think the vast majority of guilds today would use it, even to this day? Or at least some variant of it? At the very least, a large minority, say 1 out of 4 or 5 guilds would use it right? Not literally less than 1% of all raiding guilds?
---
Honestly with the AQ war effort it would be enough to announce the items would be different, but not really do it.
---
&gt; We have decided to randomise the items needed from each faction.  This way we ensure the spirit of the original opening is kept as much as possible.  
---
Of course it's always wise to stockpile, worst case you get to sell a lot of materials :)
---
I wish that classic and retail didn’t share a login. I was hoping to play both at the same time on superstar screens &gt;.&lt;
---
Grob mob! Snobs will be robbed, nobs will be Grobbed. Don't sob when we roflstomp you, dog, or lob you like a clean corncob. Do your job and play on Grob.
---
Pet families have modifiers.  Are you saying that a level 50 turtle has a lower starting damage, than a level 50 raptor?  Then it gets modified again by the pet modifier?  
---
Here is the raptor family modifiers https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=raptor
---
Here is the turtle family modifiers https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=turtle
---
I always was taught that pets have the same damage at identical loyalty and level, but that health, armor, and damage gets modified based on the pet's family.  This was to make hunter's less desirable to search for the one perfect rare pet out in the wild that has a line 40 people long trying to tame it, and then raging when someone else comes along and kills it.
---
I really like this.
---
Yeah sorry, I didn't mean that. I know certain races have different hotboxes, by tauren would always bang his head xD.
---
I meant that client side models wouldnt affect server side hotboxes, but I saw your reply to the other guy and I remember about that guild getting banned back in the day  for passing through terrain. I just looked into that and you are correct, client side model does affect hotbox, etc. Thanks for the info.
---
yeah thanks , i think vanilla forced you to shift loot you could not setup the option to just not need to hit shift
---
It won't matter too much one way or the other. The input lag is there but it's pretty minimal. On the other hand G Sync only exists to eliminate screen tearing. As long as you are getting consistent frames around or equal to your monitors refresh rate you shouldn't be experiencing much tearing either. I would turn it off. If you do notice tearing, turn it back on.
---
THE JINK APPROVES 10/10
---
It is, I'm not arguing that enchanting is bad, I'm arguing that enchanting is a terrible "Crafting profession as the best ROI in terms of time spent"
---
Thrall gon give it to ya. UHH thrall gon give it to ya
---
I am one of them! Lost my GF, nearly dropped out of High School and  my parents wanted to kick me out. Now I have my own company with 14 employees and I have given everyone off who will be playing classic first week of release..
---
My brother which is the co-founder is also going to play with me- so we will be setting up at my place to no life it the first week.  I know i wont be able to play more than 3-6 hours a day after release and no life it only in weekends.
---
Even now as I write this, Kragoz is streaming in the background whilst I am writing to a customer and browsing this reddit like a mad man! I cant wait!!! we are finally going home!
---
Lol. I Pres butan I receive purpal
---
It's really hard to fuck that up though.
---
*beard clips through head out of anger*
---
Cap fps 3 less than your monitor with RTSS rivatuner, use G sync on, v sync on (control panel).
---
No input lag, no tearing, profit in every game.
---
I just want it to be gone within a few weeks. Not 6 months +. And layer sizes to quickly increase as we spread out. Plzz Blizz.
---
I won't enjoy it more. But I won't be comparing it to my first time
---
Would a laptop work?
---
Ohhh nice tip
---
Boss combat*
---
You can still release if you die fighting trash.
---
Ok jaba... go home you are drunk.
---
petition to ban dumb ass posts like these so this doesnt become r/wow
---
Honestly for me it’s that the server I’m playing on will actually have a community and I’ll see names I recognize on both factions. Also reading the server forums just browsing all the drama. They’ve sucked the community out of this game long ago and I’m most excited to just have the community back. See you all in ten days.
---
This place is already a giant circlejerk
---
Week and a half : &gt;
---
I really wanna see the holidays
---
Where have they stated this? So far all they have stated is to expect high queue times if you are on a full server
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/what-exactly-does-full-server-mean/69937/2
---
And misdirect (less for tank aggro and more for punishing those afk Chad's in your group).
---
I think from what i have seen thou only in some recruitment and general chat, from private servers i think Shaman will be 2nd highest class played on Horde. Thou i feel alot will go PvP
---
Seems to happen to a lot of the big subs for any game or hobby. r/gaming is probably the worst place to talk about video games, r/dnd the worst for D&amp;D and so on.
---
The smell will give it away
---
way, WAY too late
---
Computers have come a long way since 2004.  A modern server can handle the same load, and much more, than a typical 2004-spec server.  Now let's just hope they actually have modern servers.
---
If only they had some tech prepared that will allow the servers to hold many times their normal population. Like... a system to run multiple copies of the world per server. Almost like some sort of *layers*.
---
You stink of retail. You won't last a month in Classic.
---
I hope it does. Blizzard also said it wouldn't work how it currently is too so dont have much faith in them.
---
Theonion nottheonion at the same time
---
Thanks mate #feelsgood
---
No misdirect in Vanilla. Ya got feign though!
---
Nice screenshot.
---
Postcards &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; selfies.
---
Now: mature, experienced, skilled, well-mannered.
---
Then: the opposite.
---
Now you've ruined the surprise :)
---
Sorry, but she's in another castle XD
---
So what? People that have no interest in Role-Playing on your realm are just going to ignore you. They have no interest in participating, they don't care what you do or where you do it.
---
Is it because your immersion gets ruined? Is that your point?
---
If that's the case then hold your RP in the usual venues then, where no one has any reason to go. The many empty pubs in Stormwind City. Stormwind Park. The countless empty buildings in Darnassus and Ironforge. The more scenic areas in Duskwood and Dun Morogh. Stormwind Cathedral and it's Catacombs. No one has any reason to go to these areas.
---
My server was once considered the big RP Server of EU, there were RP events held every week that were advertised on the Realm Forums, they never got gate crashed, they never got ruined, they never got interfered with in any way. No one that actually resides on your server is interested in ruining your experience, they just want to play the game as peacefully as possible.
---
My son is about to turn 3 so he is still a bit too young but I am SO looking forward to mother and son gaming sessions :D  
---
I wonder what kind of games will come out that he will love.
---
And here I thought you were about to go rescue Deckard Cain!
---
what laptop is it?
---
It probably would if you turned everything down to minimum actually. But experience would be better on a bigger machine. you can build a wow-ready pc pretty cheaply to be honest.
---
Honestly the people who did all the research about Feral druids + MCP are actually incredible. I know these numbers are with extremely favourable circumstances but I hope that this go around of Vanilla we can shake the Druid stigma! My goal is to play a feral DPS Druid who also has off-tank capabilities.
---
Okay Mr server technician
---
They only average 8.5 gold per hour profit
---
Hmmmm. That doesn't look like Hellfire Peninsula to me.
---
I swear, both German Servers were full like 30 minutes after Name Reservation opened up. I had a 11k Queue to get on Luci and I logged in like 30 seconds after it went online.
---
Like how much?
---
Misdirection was added in BC and is not available in classic.
---
Man you're stupid, don't pretend like you aren't reading this LOL.
---
Stop creating some weird convulted argument based on the word "racing"...it has literally zero bearing on what I'm talking about. The bottom line is retail players aren't coming to classic pre launch server naming in masses to create a character...they aren't the driving force of this population.
---
Come apologize to me in a few months when the cards crumble. I'll accept it, I promise.
---
Very similar, honestly. Raids were bigger, there was no arena, and no heroic dungeons, but almost all the design philosophies were identical.
---
Any suggestions on where to make some before launch?
---
There's a dank plate helm in there with a lot of spirit on it which I want for health regen on my warrior so bad.
---
I'm not 100% if all pets can use growl, but I think so.  But you have to tame a pet with it and use it to learn it as a trainable skill for other pets.  
---
Cats are preferable because of dps output, 19% more than bears, therefore more threat generation.  Bears have more health/armor though.
---
the classes will be different, level cap will be 60, there will be no outlands, blood elves or drenai
---
Level cap 60
---
Fewer talents
---
Raids are 40 people
---
No flying
---
Countless other things.
---
yeah this. Never saw "123".
---
I leveled as prot on Nost and went prot first, everyone telling you you need consecrate to tank dungeons is wrong. If you want to aoe farm consecrate first is better, and I guess if you have some plan with a coordinated group to aoe dungeons it would work, but for most pugs you want to be marking packs for single targeting stuff and cc.
---
A guy provides crafted NR and resist pots to all the huhu soakers in the guild. If a loot system does not provide a away for me to give loot to that guy  without "breaking the rules" then fuck it.
---
The loot systems that reward only raid night attendance result in guilds full of raid loggers who don't farm or prepare adequately to progress.
---
More like expecting a ton of biased loot distribution, Especially given the fact that its 40 players. And going for a warrior i am basically prio 1.
---
By logic if it's a loot council guild you will see within 1 raid if the leaders are biased or not.
---
Hopefully you are right. But I have heard people having different opinion
---
I played Horde and Alliance both in Vanilla, and always have. (on different servers) IMO, the only real difference between the two is the flight points.
---
Lots will be different, obviously non of TBC content, hundreds of different balance patches, shamans and pallys on separate factions etc.
---
I haven't subbed yet. I will be there on the 27th. There are a lot like me. Blizzard, the fuck are you doing!?!
---
Servers like nost are far and few between because they require someone to bank roll all the costs. And when it's just a handful of broke volunteers who love warcraft and some shady Chinese group offers you money in exchange for selling gold... And you get the picture.
---
But... If you can't see him... how would you know he's there in the first place? /yell isn't shared across layers...
---
Don't worry, you can treat yourself to the occasional bite of Darnassian Bleu or spring water you find off of a mob, so you're not wasting bag space or money/time! :P
---
I'm super glad you enjoyed the post! Good luck with your adventure to 60!
---
Damn, now I'm reconsidering Fairbanks.
---
It will weed out the kids that had their first wow experience in cataclysm or mop.
---
Remove 3 people from stallagg and it’s accurate
---
People who make 80 posts with "and here's the next one!!" are the bane of my existence. A few months back someone was basically just feeding pictures of lore characters into something that was generating "pixel art" made up of WoW icons. They posted like three a day with "cause you all liked the last one so much!!" Literally stopped visiting for awhile.
---
No. People will leave naturally and more people will leave when they se APES. Gehennas will literally be a ghost town before phase 2.
---
Citation needed
---
Well for French and Russians I'm not sure. Blizz should probably take a Russian and German Server and make it German.
---
Amusingly the name I wanted was taken on Herod, then I tried to get it on Stalagg and it was taken there. *Then* I tried to get it on Herod again and got it. So I guess whoever took it rerolled.
---
Trash HSO
---
You have just described layering.  Are you talking about making it impossible to switch layers?
---
That's a fair opinion to have, but retail does cater to a certain demographic, and if they're happy there...why the heck not.
---
Any horde hunters down for running to teldrassil to tame an owl? :P
---
Most bosses in MC don't live for more than 90 seconds or so.
---
You bemoaned the sub's behavior as if it isn't warranted
---
What? You sure? I swear I remember using it in Molten Core.
---
I honestly think I was more prepared for Illidan by the time we got to him than I was for my first encounter of Hogger.
---
Heh ... heh ... age = maturity now? Since when? I'm in my 30s and most of my friends are idiots.
---
Ok
---
I saw both of them and the orb drop in one run. 3 weeks before Burning Crusade..
---
Or they don't have any and look down on people who do have them.
---
yikes....
---
If you tell your group not to AoE or throw a big heal at the start then you can, but you *really* have to start Tab targeting to apply Holy Damage to every mob.  
---
I would say this method won't work at all with most Druid healers, because they can't quickly heal you to full and will want to put their HoT spells on you ASAP which you won't be fast enough to out aggro.
---
It's also not very reliable if you have damage absorb like Power Word Shield or you get "lucky" and dodge or parry the mobs you pull at the start since Retribution Aura won't hit that enemy.
---
This might seem like a death sentence, but it's no different from a Warrior who will often tell his group to wait for 3 Sunders or a Druid who pretty much has to cast HoT spells on himself before every AoE pull.
---
We already know petitions don't work on Blizzard. But .I'll sign it!
---
I'm really confused.  This is not a real tattoo, right?
---
I have gsync on and it works perfectly. Display is 1440p, 165hz
---
Quality
---
Gotta get yourself an anime tiddy mousepad.
---
Extrapolation is admittedly flimsy. Yet consider that Blizz had publicly said over 100mil unique accounts have subbed over the game's 15yr run.
---
Maybe to work that week.
---
[No regrets](https://www.google.com/search?q=no+regrets+tattoo&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_odfGhYjkAhWGYlAKHdr1A-wQ_AUIESgB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=941)
---
Just fyi misdirect is a tbc addition, not in classic.
---
too late
---
This is incredibly accurate. Look at [thing] involving [symbol] from [product we share an interest in] which is outside the game. That format is almost invariably garbage content. 
---
Frankly, I don't have a problem with *exceptional* art. The problem is that reddit won't downvote average or even subpar stuff under a lot of circumstances, so the only solution is to just ban it entirely so the place doesn't go to hell.
---
I thought dominos was with EQ2, you know, /pizza and all
---
Make them after launch, in the game.
---
It should be an organic process, and explaining it is sort of antithetical to that, but it's also you've got the nervous anxious energy that many people here have and you have nowhere to put it so you put it into worrying about the future.
---
It means Blizzard don't want you to roll there but you should roll there anyway because every server that isn't full will die
---
Wait, melee hunter does higher damage than enha shaman? How?
---
People that keep spreading this rumor probably never actually played PvP during these times or just not st a competent level. Sure breaking fear was annoying. But that has a cooldown and you can wand, melee, or even make a macro to have your pet auto kill tremor totems when you click it. 
---
You wanna know what’s absolutely game breaking. The massive swarms of paladins constantly dispelling all your dots and fears off everyone. Horde only has one class capable of actively dispelling magic. Paladins on the other hand are common as fuck.
---
It is about the game, though? Constant discussions regarding the game are wevaed between memes. Also they have it flaired so you can filter it out if you wish.
---
Very cool, The name's from the raid group are amazing.
---
It's almost like if we did have 2005 vanilla, he'd be on a different realm or something.
---
The wife baked me these horde themed cookies when I got home from work!
---
That gnoll area is a nightmare lmao
---
Yea my name is rare, but now I'm regretting it because the server I wanted to play on is full
---
well considering your account is a month old, you have switched accounts for some reason, besides your comment being vague sounds like talking shit.
---
&gt;Maybe im just worrying too much.
---
Pls share what the fuck else there is to play that's nearly as good?
---
If you only like "new patches" play retail - you have access to both with a single subscription
---
Magtheridon was great. That tick damage when someone doesn't click that cube...
---
Damn this might have been me lol
---
That sounds like an incredible feature and I don't understand why they got rid of it.
---
Yes. There are obviously exceptions to the rule, but GENERALLY the average 30 year old will be more mature than the average 14 year old.
---
If you’re going Horde I would do Druid/Shaman and Warlock/Hunter. The first two are a toss-up but I’d give a slight edge to Warlock for the added bonus of being able to give the healing class a soulstone to rez if you ran into any problems.
---
It's 20% from boar(-10) to cat(+10).  If 20% is meaningless threat wise you obviously haven't tanked.
---
Enhance is not better than balance, enhance is literally a slot machine and balance with t2.5 and in the right hands is one of the better PvP specs in the game
---
not better than an MCP, but potentially better than a non-MCP 2h
---
Doing dumb shit like melee hunter and hemofist rogue.
---
For starters, the names I use are unique
---
How much did you pay? Now is a solid time to build your own budget PC.
---
&gt; Maybe im just worrying too much.  
---
probably  
---
as for the warr leveling... its not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. is it the worst class for leveling? yeah, but its not like some punishment as some would lead you to believe.  
---
quick tip: get spirit on some of your gear.  
---
warr regen was OP in vanilla, to the point the nerfed it in tbc(was only class whos health regen was nerfed/changed)  
---
we didnt know about it back then, and most pserver players still don't know about this(though its become somewhat better known lately) bonus: spirit has nearly no stat weight
---
an 'of the bear' might give you 8 str/8sta where a same level other item may give you 7str/7sta/7spirit. make sure you have a few of those spirit ones.  
---
aside from occasional bandage you'll have next to zero downtime. To the point of not even needing to carry around food.
---
I think my guild will be giving the tank first dibs and then everything else is DKP. Best system in my opinion, until the tank leaves lol.
---
Ok bye
---
All existing realms will be overpopulated come release
---
You shouldn’t be forced to level as prot ... I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy.  In beta every warrior leveled as either fury or arms and just popped the sword and board and just switched stances for dungeons or group quests - we only had access to Lvl 40 stuff but it was fine all the way through.
---
Awesome, ty!
---
1440p 165hz, no issues. On 2080ti.
---
I remember something like this.  I will not be initiating fights against other druids in Moonglade.  In the rest of the world you are fair game.  Still druid vs druid takes a while.
---
No Stuck no care
---
Just a personal question, what is your draw to the streamers and the server they'll be playing on?
---
Big chance you might not like it.
---
It's the best version of wow but a 2019 gamer is much like a goldfish
---
I get what you are saying, but that specific post combines the horde and alliance sigils to one. So it's quite unique.
---
This is exactly right.  It really dis-proportionally effects loot from late-raid bosses.  As if a character is saving points for the shoulders off of Baron Geddon, they might pass up a lesser upgrade earlier in the raid.  It can hurt raid balance optimization.
---
In classic we did a loot council with rolling.  If you had good attendance, you were allowed to roll, preference to those completing tier set bonuses.  This was all coordinated through class leaders in chat.  Basically you know what pieces you had a shot at each time you joined the raid.  No surprises etc.
---
Thex is not a filthy damn manlet. He is a proud shaman!!
---
I see you fellow Grob mob and I approve. Noice.
---
Absolutely premiere content - thank you!
---
Dudeeee aux is the BEST. Look up Simon Hirsig, he has a github or something where his email is listed. He created aux. I’ve emailed him before about questions about the addon and he replied so maybe ask him to confirm.
---
So glad I picked this server! Now I just need to find a guild to run with.
---
Pretty sure yes - it's trends for Google's Organic Web Search
---
It's 14 days of play time, not real time.
---
So if you play 8 hours a day, it will take you 42 days in the real world.
---
Memes keep people sane while waiting for the release
---
It really depends on the weapon. There are a few 2handers that have the right stats. But if you dont have MCP, and want to go 1h'ers. Do the grind for ironfoe! And get a good int+spell damage off hand.
---
I got my second half of the bindings just 2 or 3 days ago and was super hyped. Then I saw how expensive elementium bars are on the AH and I noped out. Guess I'll never get thunderfury.
---
Just do a bid system on those items.  You might not want to spend 50dkp on it, but 5 dkp it starts looking pretty good...do I hear 10?
---
What in the motherfuck.... gatekeeping? Get a grip.
---
My point is if you don’t go engineering you are fucked in pvp unless you have a massive gear difference.
---
In pve it depends on class but on hunter it is really huge to have to push your numbers. Obviously not required though. I cleared naxx in retail vanilla as hunter with no Eng, but I was dumb about min maxing back then.
---
"My wife"
---
Boohoo
---
so are you saying it is possible to run more than 5 men in  a dungeon?
---
My first boe blue drop was troll’s bane leggings.
---
And who or what decrees that your spec defines you? You can put an equal number of talents in all 3 specs, so it's not really like you character has a single well-defined "specialization." Why is it better that your talent distribution defines you, rather than your class? The class is what you pick at character creation. I think that is what defines you. Your talents are just enhancements that you ought to be able to retrain with a **reasonable** investment.
---
The game balance across specializations is pitiful. There are parts of the game that you simply cannot participate in if you pick the wrong spec. However, every class can participate in every part of the game.
---
For this reason, trying to lock people into a single spec permanently is not an option. Why is it worse if you could switch between tanking and dpsing every day, instead of only once per month? Why is it worse if you are defined as a good healer/dps druid instead of only a good healer druid?
---
I don't think the cost to respec should be removed, but it is needlessly extreme in classic. And the fact that it only gets reduced by 5g per month is absolutely ridiculous.
---
That sounds more like people you just hang out with and less like “friends”.
---
Vanilla had a world and burning crusade forced everyone to play in a space theme park where every ride sucked.
---
&gt;Him being a part of the fight mattered whether you like him or not   
---
Not really part of the fight except where he tried to make himself important, and claim credit.  
---
Blizzard would have met with Nostalrius if Mark Kern did nothing.  Streamers did a lot more to put pressure on Blizzard.   
---
No one cared that he printed out a petition, wasted all that paper, and gave it to Blizzard for them to recycle.    
---
Blizzard asked to meet with Nostalrius. They decided to do Classic. Kern had nothing at all to do with it, except maybe to advertise the fight a little on twitter.    
---
If I like him is irrelevant.  He just didn't do much at all.  Blizzard didn't want his input on anything.  He didn't lead anyone, he just jumped in after it was already big news.  
---
You can't really rewrite history.  People love to say Mark Kern did anything, but it's not true.
---
“Unavailable” would be the best name ever
---
“Hey babe if I let you name my character can I no life this game for 300 days” 
---
“Oh of course my little pear”
---
I mean, this is a 15 YEAR OLD game which has the most hype from a game since...? The hype stands for endless reasons. Up to you if you want to play.
---
&gt;Want to change spec? There's time, money, and work involved in that.  
---
&gt;Want to change profession or even specialization within a profession? There's money, time, and work involved in that.  
---
&gt;Want to wield a different type of weapon? There's time and work involved in that (and some money for acquiring skill)
---
Trying to equate all this with "might as well have a button that does it instantly" is what was degraded WoW to the grindy idle game that it is today.
---
What bet?
---
This, I feel like most millennials that grew up with the game look back fondly on it compared to the debt ridden, soul-sucking, office job or minimum wage hell they're in right now. At least back with WoW, the biggest source of stress in life for most was schoolwork.
---
Hearth. Fucking noobs.
---
1. you dont have to speed level.  classic is here to stay when you get to 60 there will be plenty to do especially as a tank
---
2. raid as what you want most raid groups will take 4-5 of each class so that the loot isnt wasted,  if you want to raid as  feral your best bet is to be properly geared, sign up for raids, and be on time when the raid start
---
3. a warrior is the best tank hands down and 40 people that you are going to be pretty tight with are trying to do something together so it makes sense not to take chances cauise a paladin or shaman wanted to tank....  sorry they fixed that in retail but this aint that 
---
4. if you want to make a name for yourself in classic then play and make some friends and do stuff together.  The whole server or subreddit may never hear of lastofOz the guy that tanked BRD and we didn't wipe but your buddys and guild will know and you will be there go to guy
---
5. leveling alone as a warrior isn't bad...  just remember to stick to green level mobs 2-4 levels lower than your current level and you won't be dying and using consumables as much.  Also you will meet people along the way and you will get asked to tank things and if you kick ass they will invite you to a guild even if you arent actively searching 
---
6. I think the phases will satisfy the itch for content.  Phase one the end game is getting pre raid BiS, learning the fights in mc, getting your raid geared, AQ event will be fun,  Struggling to get the raid geared enough to get into Naxx, Farming REP,  doing the fishing tournament for once,  crafting epic shit that doesn't mean anything in retail.   idk how you feel about that stuff but I never did it in 2005 so i want to do it now.  
---
7. Idk I am playing on faerlina and I don't worry about the streamers.  I will probably participate in PUGS, pvp events and other stuff but I'm not worried about being griefed by streamers....  it will cost them more than $15 if they grief people and get banned.  
---
8. no one ever said speedrunning is required in anything....  play at your own pace don't let your self be held to other peoples standards
---
Do you think this is a game?
---
no personal questions please
---
Streamers are not getting any world firsts .   It's a race for hardcore guilds. Hardcore will be much more hardcore than back in 2005.  
---
What will be bigger than world firsts, imho will be SPEED RECORDS.  
---
A world first is a one time only event, and will be influence by luck.  (your server not crashing, login queues  etc.)  We will applaud the winners, but it will be just a statistic.  But then they get into speedrunning!    This you can practice, train your skills and hone to perfection!  And once a time is set, you can always break the record.  So it keeps being a goal.   It also makes for great streaming content, a guild can announce their new tactics  to shave a minute from their clear time and the audience can watch if they make it or not. 
---
Speedrunning will be a major thing for the hardcore guilds.
---
Got enough boxes?
---
I laughed.
---
Doing your pre-fight research, how long is the fight?  Is there breaks where I can FD drink without affecting dps?  Did I down rank my shots for manapool/fight length, did you pop your mana pot or demonic runes at the right times such that the cooldowns are up appropriately, or to maximize berzerking cooldowns did I run out of mana at the exact end of the fight?  That is ideal.
---
Currently debating between gfuel or Aldi's version of Red Bull.
---
Better at the AH
---
I don't think full means no character creation it just means they expect login ques.
---
Don't worry, he gonna learn.
---
you sound like the snowflake my dude, mad someone took your basic ass name on Herod?
---
There's a helmet drop there that would charge you at a mob or PVP opponent and sap them for 30 SECONDS. I hope it makes a comeback, it was by far the best PVP/utility tool. It even sapped higher levels so if a ganker attacked in my 40s/50s it was more than enough to make a getaway.
---
Only the best dogs know to farm ZF as a Warlock
---
&gt;Eviscerate is flat damage
---
Is it? In the stress test the tooltip said it was increased by attack power.
---
In regards to the drop rate, I was under the impression probability does not stack?!
---
true, neither would I if it only procs in melee.
---
It's outclassed in phase 2 by this: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18473/royal-seal-of-eldrethalas
---
Oops my bad, this was meant to be a reply to another user who said he will level 2 warriors and 2 priests to 60, I bet that he wouldn’t lol
---
That's some bullshit. I'm sorry buddy.
---
Same, i was just 4 when my dad played wow, I played a bit on his account but nothing fancy, I was only 4 years old... but im glad that I will finally be able to play with him, a few people from his guild and relieve by the stories he told me as a kid.
---
After seeing all of the name reservation posts, I have a lot less faith in people's abilities to come up with good unique names. What's with the attraction towards naming characters strings of words or meme names? Thanks, I hate it.
---
It's pretty pointless to participate in a world first race that ended 13 years ago.
---
It would actually be cool if the location changed between several different spots once a day or something.
---
Dude on my shaman a got a world drop at lvl 43 that skull flaming shield. Sold it for 30g or something I was so young and naive

What are keys and attunements? I've played wow for a few months but have never heard of them.
---
I saw a graph of sub numbers from vanilla up through BFA. Not all of the data is confirmed by Blizzard, since they stopped giving out that info. But the guy who made it used some good data gathering, and it's bound to be pretty accurate.
---
Anyway it showed a steady decline since WOLTK. Even though there were upticks right after expansions launched, overall it was just a downward slope. His estimates at the low point of BFA was around a million subs or a bit less, down from over 10+ million in WOLTK.
---
It's just really sad to see that despite all their effort, they have failed the long game somehow. It kind of explains why they scramble so much to try and change stuff that doesn't need changing.
---
10 days bro
---
I will be an Orc Warlock on Herod named Guildleader. I forgive you for excluding me in the pic as it is Alliance.
---
&gt; it would be a major blow to stockpilers
---
Depends. Couldn't it also make stockpilers very wealthy since there is a Neutral AH?
---
Player 41 also joined the guild knowing they were not in the main team for that phase. If you join knowing what you know, then you can't complain imo. I certainly don't.
---
Agreed.
---
I'm not as fluent in english than I would like, sorry, it's a rough translation from my language (french). Well just check around the 24 minute
---
&gt; The desire for classic servers existed since TBC
---
No shit. But the fact of the matter is that request didn't get loud until cataclysm. People complaining in BC were just seen as annoying idiots who can't accept change. By cataclysm it was becoming much more obvious the game was being stripped away from player made choices
---
You may wan to watch vurtnes videos and look at his gear lol
---
Golden Power?
---
I remember the silithus part feeling like it was bugged but I finally got it done.  Was dope to have two weapons for the price of one
---
Who hurt you?
---
they were mostly pvp vs pve talents
---
So loot council is officers and guild leader decide who gets loot?
---
That's literally the point of the post hahaha.
---
Symbolizing the location of a dungeon and being the place to gather are both purposes.  They're "meeting stones" not bullshit warlock 
---
and world travel replacements.  Travel and World are all downhill after vanilla

Nothing like it. Sports center is the best background noise for wow
---
I'm also an addon purist (at least while leveling). The hardest ones for me to live without will be OneBag and something that tells me the vendor and AH price of items in my bag on mouseover. We'll see what happens :P
---
Well, I can just sit at home that week and get the same result.
---
I'm more looking for the paycheck that comes between being given time off for phase releases.
---
Sacrifice yourself to the pestilence and ask for acceptance first
---
Troll Shaman! This picture is an insult to Thex.
---
Posts like this make me wish I still knew people who will play Classic.
---
People really upset they weren't able to reserve a name on the most populated server in NA? it was listed as full about 1 minute into character registration, to be honest you should have been prepared and looking into the population polls if you really cared that much. I had my game on the server screen while they were still offline about 30 seconds after they were live my character was already created.
---
And yet you're commenting about it
---
[obligatory boomkin video](https://youtu.be/-kfr3602ANI?t=23)
---
Well let's not fool ourselves completely, they made it because money.
---
You give no respect where it’s due. 
---
All you do is hate. 
---
We’re getting Classic stfu.
---
I don't know if I would say they failed. You can't expect an MMO to keep it up forever. Everything dies.
---
But disenchanting, requires no recipes, no /trade and the mats regularly sell on AH to people with time to spam /trade.
---
As young as I was that’s pretty much all I did lol never got to raid except for when my cousin tele’d me in to his when I was only level 25 or something
---
Dwarf paladin obviously
---
&gt; For example, the revamp of the zones when Cata came out were well received, it's only in hindsight people have started to complain/miss the old world.
---
I'm gonna have to disagree with you on that. It was pretty much 50/50. There were those who were glad the zones were updated to make leveling more streamlined, but before the changes were even applied there were a lot of people upset they were ruining the zones.
---
Arcanite Reaper. If you don't have time, at least get Dreadforge Retaliator.
---
Clique, elvui, and mrp. For healing, a pretty UI, and role-playing.
---
.... what?
---
Right clicking a mob does not cause you to shoot your bow, you go in the melee attack stance as everyone else, you have to toggle auto shot on to start shooting or press a sting or shot spell.
---
I played retail vanilla, and I have played most of the private servers. Every time I level I still find places in the game where I had not been before, or quests I have not done before. And I still haven’t leveled all the classes to 60.
---
And every time I have played the same class at 60, the game has been different because the ppl I have been playing together with has been different.
---
My rogue found a guttripper in Tanaris the first few weeks of release in vanilla, I was so hyped.  Off a ravaged dog that jumped me and I survived with a sliver of health left.  I vividly remember the encounter and joy I had during that instance .  
---
At 57ish I found a Krol blade in eastern plaguelands while questing.  Think I also found a Druid 2nder in ungoro but instantly gave it away in guild chat not sure when that was prob post 60 doing some attunement quest or finish up left over quests cause I got jumped while trying to turn in one of those colored crystals quest

Wow, I broke my "No bot rule" for discord. 
---
This is the first and only bot.
---
I'm not looking deep, just curious. And how do you know I'm an outlier?
---
No it means that you should. Medium is essentially dead. Classic won't gain players, they'll lose them. The only safe servers to roll on are the full ones.
---
totally agreed.
---
Or if you don't like BC just keep playing classic when they eventually release BC.
---
Then we'd be getting into tasty pieces of meat, and that'll devolve quickly.
---
It's also a useful gold sink to keep the economy from inflating too fast. Which is probably going to be a problem since you can abuse layering to farm easier.
---
Many games are made with detailed worlds, great stories, but little replay value once the "mystery" is gone for the player. If I play Fallout 4 I know where everything good is and how to get it; I know where the secrets are. In wow I know these things, but it will still require effort, teamwork, and time to acquire what I want. Thats why i say its not about solving the game.
---
I would suggest yall hold off launch day party a few days.  Because if this is gonna be anything like we see now servers will be crashing regularly the first day.

Now I’m curious to find out who this is haha.

I THINK that Spartan UI (SUI) can change portraits to the class emblem.
---
So you dont like tattoos and are embarrassed by your hobbies. Not really our problem.
---
It's just Shaman. Both plural and singular
---
Last I talked to him he hadn't touched WoW since a brief stint of leveling in MoP.
---
Shamans

This guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about. It’s been confirmed but no ETA

Couldn’t agree more. r/wow is basically « Blizzard can we have this mount/this transmog/play this race please? »

There’s no discussion regarding anything meaningful. Hopefully r/classicwow mods will manage this sub properly.

I'm not advocating to change BC, this is just speculation of what a more "Classic" BC would look like

And I have decent posture :p
---
Enrage timer in classic, at least in MC, are usually "kill the boss before the healers run out of mana".
---
*Gnomey high five*
---
So, to clarify, the servers will die because the servers will be so busy there will be an hour long wait to even log in to said dead server. I get all that right?
---
And when you find out she double crossed Mankrik and kill her out of retribution, she drops the stolen silver.

I was simply agreeing with you

Eating better will have your energy last longer.

Please do, I love being immune to blind and gouge.
---
It is technically BIS for PVE with +15 agi enchants, but it is not much better than the next best. Personally, I wouldn't roll on Dal'rends because dual wielding is actively bad for PVP, but if I were a dedicated PVE player, I'd be much more likely to roll Need.  I'd probably make that decision based on the group e.g. if they are your friends/guild, and a Warrior/Rogue needs it, I'll pass.  But if it is a PUG and I have no connection to the people, I'll roll Need.
---
Sub numbers go up
---
Post quality goes down
---
Welcome to Reddit.
---
Trade chat will always have real life talk in it andI've been on wyrmrest accord forever. It will no doubt be much less applicable while classic is still fresh, but eventually there will be those people who speak freely. 
---
As long as you aren't rude or obnoxious in /s then do whatever you normally would, spam your trade every few minutes or have fun going all Chuck Norris in Barrens chat. Azeroth is your oyster.
---
Me and my guildies have been debating this since we voted for Grobbulus. There is a small different but it is truly negligible and wouldn't bar you from the higher eschalons of PVP stardom. Probably.
---
I was a balance druid back in 2006, the raid leader was a mage and wanted the 5% crit. Didn't really care what my damage was like.
---
People were super POed when I won a Staff of Domination
---
No, Master Loot is pretty rare in 5-mans. Private Server meta may be different, but even if you're reserving an item the "need before greed" (default) setting is standard.
---
HMM.
---
Please can you keep these posts on r/wow?
---
Tbh, I wish they would add achievements.
---
Medium just from the people that reserve names. Every single sever that’s currently available will be full come launch.
---
how do you know suomalaiset will go to golemagg?
---
I definitely can’t stand straight up scrubs anymore either; I was mainly referring to pugs and giving another reason why I don’t think gearscore will be all that popular in Classic.
---
Lmaoo thank the higher power cuz I was not blessed w/ good posture and it's such a pain in the ass (and back) correcting it now
---
Yes most probably free transfer from full realms. 
---
And then later down the road, character paid transfer because $$$$.
---
It also teaches you how to play your class well. There's a selection bias as a result; the people that are able to make it to 60 as a warrior are probably pretty good at rolling warrior.
---
Haha I know I didn’t want to come off too harsh
---
These changes I have no problem with, and are fully in the idea of an 'alive' world. Even adding zones and creating Classic+ sounds good to me.
---
It is the changes that kill the immersion or make your progress invalid that I have a problem with.
---
Like transmog, exp increase, level boosts, heirlooms, groupfinder, flying
---
Exactly. I'm sure some days I'll put in 4-5 hours most days will probably be an hour or two. I'm not concerned about falling behind as I'd much rather play to have fun than stress about min/max and what the right "spec" is.  I believe there will be just as many people playing this game casually as hardcore, if not more.
---
An off tank isn’t always going to be swinging nightfall. Usually guilds have hunters do it.
---
A lot of dancing in Goldshire.
---
You have to take 40,000 IU a day to start experiencing overdose effects.
---
Most vitamin D supplements are 2,000 or 5,000 IU. You'll be fine.
---
You could move her 25 feet and that would throw off most people.
---
You can do delay streams.
---
Would you be willing to make/sell one? :) They're awesome!
---
Layering wont be in after phase one, but could be removed earlier if Blizz thinks it can be removed on a server (depending on active players on a server). If you have some link/quote that says otherwise, pls show it.
---
Hey, don't crap on my server, yank.

It had the highest stam of any helm iirc, great item for PvP.

This is a shit quality picture of an addon for PLAYER &amp; TARGET unitframes back in vanilla, with what addon do you believe I would be able to replicate the look of the unitframes? Or do anyone actually know what the name of this addon is/was and if it was continued project?
---
*(it is a bit blurry, but the HP percentage is shown to the right, outside of the actual HP-bars)*
---
Do you think I might have to make some custom textures to get right look of the bars?
---
I don’t have the link but I have seen the blue post. It was someone asking if there were going to be realm transfers. The answer was “it was not in Vanilla, it will not be Classic.” Then the question was asked does that include someone who has multiple accounts switching characters between accounts or between realms. The blue post responded with “Neither will be available and there is no plan in place to add it.” The blue post exists. Look it up.
---
I think thats an important distinction. 
---
Art from say, Metzen or Wei Wang, is part of the history of the game. Especially Metzen's early sketches. I think they should be allowed now and again, but amateur posts should have a WoWArt subreddit or something.
---
And move her around every other week!

Starfall didn't exist then ...

Same here - I'm gonna need the honor at some point, but my druid is a druid, and is probably the more neutral about faction than about the fact that he's a druid.

I won't engage another druid unless maybe if we're fighting for the same mobs, or if it's a group thing.

You can do it with one tank technically. But oh god you really want two tanks, especially the last boss.

Or you'd hear mom in the background on vent screaming at him (No offense ladies, it just never happened to me) to take a shower.

friendly reminder feral charge is an interrupt

Priest can cast damage spells when people are behind but inside their circle, which wasn't possible on private servers. It made priests a lot weaker cause rogues would jump around and mess up the casting. Now you can smite that rogue that is backstabbing you.

---
But we’re talking about alliance :/
---
cataclysm was the last time the game had talent trees instead of the pick-one-of-three system.
---
Best answer I have seen. You will have to turn in cloth regardless but this early rep starting from level 1 is invaluable.
---
Disenchanting, is probably best investment. you only need level 1 skill to disenchant anything. You don't even need a copper rod. You don't need to farm any rare recipes, many people would prefer to buy the mats on the AH, and just pay enchanter Mats + tip anyway.  Enchanting however, has Rare drops, and Rep based recipes, and really only way to make money with enchanting is with the rare recipes, or just disenchanting and selling the mats instead. It can take forever to sell enchants in /trade. SO I would rate Enchanting as the worst profession for rewards versus effort, but disenchanting as best profession for rewards versus effort.
---
Alchemy (transmute arcanite) and Tailoring (mooncloth) both have a cooldown that earns money every few days. The biggest bag recipes are hard to come by but you can sell your mooncloth to those that do have it.
---
Mining starts out strong money maker but slows down as server ages and people finish power leveling their engineering, blacksmithing.  Blacksmithing gets it's day in the sun when people start making their arcanite reapers, but then fades away to "rarely used".
---
Herbalism, and Alchemy starts out strong, then gets stronger as each round of new raids get introduced. Many times the herbs will sell for more than the potions though so you'll need to be prepared to sell in whatever format makes most profit.
---
Some of the good alchemy recipes require rep grinds, which means they are garunteed after a certain amount of effort.
---
Engineering, is a money loser, It's considered Must have for PvP and Try Hard Raiding, and since all the best stuff requires engineering to use, you will find many people put this on their main, so really the only things that are going to sell are going to other Engineers that are too lazy to buy the mats and click the "make all" button. Or People that have the opposite specilization, E.g. They went gnomish and want the better goblin explosives.
---
Make it like this, but only on the Mankrik server.
---
Can you explain what itemization means exactly?  I've seen a couple of videos mention this and I'm not quite sure what it means.
---
If you cleared AQ40 and Naxx in vanilla, you are not casual in any way.  But I agree that casual is a sliding scale based on one's own outlook.
---
&gt; but even if you're reserving an item the "need before greed" (default) setting is standard.
---
There's no way in hell I'm leaving it on group loot if I've reserved something like truestrike shoulders or hand of justice.
---
:O what server are you playing on?
---
Eh. Whatever. He did pay for all the mats, basically. He did help us with lower raids as I said, and we eventually merged with another guild that had one. And he came back to us at the start of BC to be our main tank. It was just a business decision really/sadly.
---
Nooo it's deleted I wanted to see it
---
"Hey can anyone tell me where to find Mankrik's wife?"
---
"she's under my desk"
---
"in my kitchen making me a sandwhich"
---
"i dont know where she is now but i banged her last night"
---
"she ran off with Mankrik's younger brother"
---
etc
---
Layering, wrong animations, too few servers which will probably end up with layering not being removed past phase 1, 1.12 versions of items that have no place at the start of the game which will significantly reduce the difficulty of early raids and dungeons, right-click report, battle net integration which will support cross-faction collusion, using the 7.2.5 client to simulate the actual 1.12 client which will in turn bring many issues such as wrong movement speed, unfaithful graphics to the original game etc. , oh and did I mention Layering which will single handedly destroy the economy phase 1 and many other crucial aspects of the vanilla experience such as server community and social interactions. There you go lil zoom.
---
Self reliance is important in this day and age.
---
Great video! Thx for reposting fr :)
---
Realm transfers WERE in vanilla. You look it up.
---
Very interesting. Describing it as a trap certainly seems to fit what's happened over the years.

If you do loot council, then run a (fixed price) DKP system in parallel. Make it public for your guild to see. Consider it when distributing loot. 
---
The reason for that is that DKP is in general seen as a "fair" system. But it can be exploited (hoarders, ...). If you run a bidding DKP system it also has it's downsides (collusion). 
---
Your loot council can overrule these problems. People will like that. But if you cannot show that you distribute loot in an even way (maybe except very key players - read: main tank) then people _will_ distrust your council. People will see favoritism (and it will most likely be correct).
---
So hold yourself accountable by running a public well known/accepted system in parallel and do consider your decisions looking at it. Your bad / often missing players will thank you for it. And remember - it's classic. Unless you are one of the top guilds on your server you will need those people.
---
Eleven levels was the rule of thumb I’d heard. Two expacs is another reliable way of saying it.
---
Well, this is just on a whole other level
---
They are repeatable as long as you have enough marks to turn in.  There are no dailies in Vanilla
---
Will there be a way to migrate add on settings from live to classic? For example can I copy my sexymap set up so I don’t have to configure it again?

Meme posts should be restricted to a once a week occurrence. Each sub I frequent that made this change had a huge improvement in overall quality. 
---
Even subs with a way younger target demographic than this one took this route. 
---
I just hope this something that the mod team is considering. Maybe try it for a week and make a poll about it we, the community can decide.

i've just been running old heroics and raids for the mounts i don't have yet. have a bunch of alts parked outside sethekk halls so i can do them quick

I believe personally that you may have chosen to play on this server for improper reasons but still wish you the best regardless and hope you enjoy playing the game for many months to come.

This sub is completely fucked. The casuals have come and now it's ruined. Once casuals infest anything, it's ruined forever.
---
Mods are shit at their jobs and never moderate properly, since it's an unpaid job there's no real incentive to deal with the headache.
---
Just move on and and don't come here anymore. It's only going to get worse over time as more respectable people get sick of the casual fluff.
---
He mentioned Joker as well, the name I'm forgetting ends in Y im fairly certain. It'll come to me.
---
The whole #nochanges thing needs to die.  The original idea was to oppose any possibility of adding in a cash shop or LFR or flying mounts.  We didn't get any of that... Classic will be a faithful remake.  Now that we know Classic isn't getting Activisionified, it is entirely possible to change things to improve player experience, and trying to suggest that any and all changes is the equivalent of LFR is just counterproductive.

AV has quests. Really good exp from them too. But you only get exp from turning in 3 badges. You get 3 for a win and 1 for a loss. But it's an incredibly small amount. Don't depend on bgs for any form of leveling
---
What about an addon which shows you the best in slot item for various levels/level ranges (Like level 20-30, level 40-50...)  
---
For example: once you reach level 55 as a rogue it is known that the devilsaur set is a must have. It would be really useful to have an in-game overview.
---
Do you have data to prove that?

I'd be interested in seeing how much gold is spent a week per player respeccing on a private server.

Yes it’s vanilla pre tbc prepatch. So unless you want to play a resto druid id play a different class. Resto druid is pretty fun though, eapecially if you pvp.
---
&gt; As soon as you step into Stormwind as it was back then, it’ll feel like walking into that bleak era when you would sit for days on end in dirty, unwashed sweatpants, and the only social contact you had was coordinating Zul’Gurub runs with your guildmates, all while people your age went to parties with their friends, nurtured relationships, and had important life experiences

Remember the population status is mostly just ppl with an active sub now that reserved a character. Once release hits the server will no doubt fill up.

I will do my part to keep and harass/insult anyone who posts cringe on the subreddit.

I dont think they have a taunt, and they otherwise are limited by mana.  In 5mans, it's more stopping to drink than anything else.  In pve farming, I dont understand the question...  Doesnt seem relevant.

In raids you wont be able to keep threat the entire fight because you run out of mana.

It is like having a second job except for the most part you get no reward/paycheck unless you count incessant /w or mail from people expecting you to fix their problems for them.

I would not recommend leading a guild to anyone.

Whole heartedly agree, I’ve gotten posts manually removed on here for “low effort” despite posts on the front page with hundreds s of upvotes and not removed with the same or less effort. Mods if you want to make a rule about what can and can’t be posted then either enforce it 100% to the way it’s written and be consistent or remove it. The mods here are shit and I don’t know who appoints them but whoever it is did a bad job
---
LOL @ that whisper from image 5... Brings back DKP memories.
---
"Is there a reasonable amount of money that will get you to pass?"
---
Its probably because so many adds are full of shit and look awesome and then you download it and the gameplay/graphics are on par with an NES game. When an add looks kinda normal it shows more promise.
---
I do not generally play mele so I cant comment much on Rogue but Mage is really best in deep frost. There are a ton of good talents in the frost tree you almost can't go wrong. There is nothing wrong with putting almost all of your talents in that tree. There is nothing in the Arcane or Fire tree that are 100% required for leveling anyways. 
---
You can use the wand progression portion of this guide to help you target wands though : )

Good luck!

That’s awesome. I cannot wait. Are most of the streamers playing faerlina rolling alliance? Or are some playing horde?
---
I suppose you could use atlasloot to try to find good pieces for your level, but to my knowledge there is not a list of best in slot pieces for level brackets, but that could be a really good idea. There are some lists for Twink best in slot lists maybe that can work kinda, but they won't be in an addon.
---
Doesn't dual wielding let you use skull of impending doom?
---
&gt;  but is the class balance in Classic WoW the same as it was prior to TBC in Vanilla WoW?
---
Its patch 1.12. Druids are much stronger at that point than they were in early Vanilla.
---
Both are modes of transportation, just like both are spells.
---
I don't think the fiercely autistic nochange crowd would be pleased with that.
---
For me it's because of the world bosses. You have big guilds fighting for control of them against the same on the opposite faction, sometimes with multiple raid groups on each side.
---
Truly a war zone.
---
I spent a lot of time rerolling alts in vanilla. As fun as that was I did end up doing a lot of same over and over and by the time I finally reached 60 on my main mage, TBC was around the corner. This time around, I'm going to go in focused. I want to enjoy my leveling experience and get all the feels but I'm also going to stick to my main so I can get to 60 sooner rather than later and be able to enjoy the raids I missed.
---
I don’t understand the sarcasm lmfao
---
You dont have a choice and its already that way tbh
---
I wonder if I could find the post. Would like to read it again and share it here maybe.
---
I love how, even despite the huge mountain right in the middle, most of the questing areas are pretty accessible. They're pretty much all right off the main road and if you need to do stuff on the west side of the zone, Raven Hill especially, you can just fly to Sentinel Hill and run across the river. No need to cut across massive expanses of mobs ready to daze you
---
Nice work already rolled Grobbulus need to start advertising on retail RP forums.
---
No idea about that tbh
---
I’ll defiantly be at STV day 2-3 willing to help for the horde!
---
Yikes your burnout is your own problem LOL
---
I have an older Logitech keyboard and I use red, it’s easier to see in the dark.
---
You do know classic will have phases right? Phases that continue to change the game?
---
Rolling horde this time around, and im not gonna lie, ill miss doing these quests. So many good memories there. Greatest zone in game imo.
---
Whats layering?
---
Imagines that are unnecessarily wide and can't be looked at in 1920 without scrolling are so fucking annoying.
---
There needs to be a reasonable discussion about that can of worms at some point.  Especially when it comes to the question of what comes after phase 6.
---
Then play retail.  The purpose of classic is the play the game as it was.  Most of us who played in 2004 - 2007 now have full-time jobs and families and we're lucky to be able to spend a couple hours per day -- at that rate we'll have enough content for a lifetime.
---
I am off the week of launch day because I’ll be on vacation. Hopefully by the time I get back the starter zones won’t be completely filled.
---
Double mage is probably among the best duo, both going aoe spec. Gear competition isn’t an issue outside dungeons and even then it’s still worth it.
---
Both mages really complement each other and you can pull huge groups together.

Idk for me personally class and race come after the general background.

My character and couple of my friends will be from Alterac and grind Syndicate rep to neutral so we can take Durnholde Keep and RP there and kill all invaders.

I'd love to do the same for Stromguarde but that will take cleaning out mobs.  
---
As of race I will of course be human and for class I'll be a hybrid between shaman and a priest. Cloth wearing but mace and tome wielding priest which uses Mindflay as skin for lightning element.

How will the Scatter + Feign Death + Freeze Trap work, will there be Diminishing returns? Will they share DMs with Intimidation?

TBC with no changes please. That was arguably the best expansion ever, closely followed by WotLK

Yep art posts, tattoos, etc need to stay off this sub. I’m not here to browse deviant art. I want news and discussion. Guides and well made instructional posts (i.e. not profit driven churned out clickbait) or theorycrafting is great. Occasional high quality meme is also fine. Just my two cents.
---
Just don't ask where she is in Barrens chat.  You'll never get a serious reply.
---
*"She's attending a party in my pants"*
---
*"She fucked off and joined the alliance"*
---
*"She's having a shit, check back later"*
---
Few major things off the top:
---
1. Classic is geared for hardcores more than casuals. 
---
2. There is no arena system. So PVP takes a different form/execution. 
---
3. Hybrid classes are inherently weaker than single dimension classes as this was Blizzard first attempt to balance the classes.
---
I've seen enough '90-day fiance' to know either he's getting used or she's handicapped lmao.

Same here. 168 straight hours of wow here I come.

---
Jokes on them, my most depressing era is right now!
---
I have personally experimented with these setups. Its really not that simple. Rage generation is not just based on how many times you can hit a target. The amount of damage you do on a white hit is also taked into consideration.
---
With these things in mind its gonna be really tough to challenge a good slow MH.
---
However if luck is on your daggers side and you end up with some decent daggers before you get your deathbringer. Id say go for it.
---
there will always be loot drama regardless of the system
---
the success of a loot council depends on who is on the council.  if they are smart and fair then things will go smooth.  corrupt loot council and things will eventually fall apart
---
CauthonLuck is amazing
---
cool story bowlcut.
---
and that matters why? you really think you need to be one of the top leveled/geared players on the server to gank stv? im also rogue so i can take the fights i want, when i want. don't think ill have a problem getting camped. especially if i have a team with me. don't comment on my thread with negativity pls :) P.S. ppl who are gonna be level 50 day 3 are most likely going to be out of stv and grinding. pipe down.
---
It isn't.
---
Off topic: are there addons yet to have old styled raid frames?
---
&gt;Everyone here seems to think this game is going to have million upon millions of players but it's not very realistic.
---
Only very few delusional people were saying shit like that. The rest of us expect there to be tens of thousands of long term players. Something supported to the pserver community.
---
I don't know why, but I forgot that only certain Weapons Masters taught specific Weapon Skills
---
Hehe
---
Cancel Classic, this is unacceptable and we should wait a few more months so they get the right picture.
---
Yeah. I remember the fights lasting more like 3-5 minutes, but that was also before class reworks. We had a lot of strange specs floating around. We'd lose 3-4 people to disconnects on a regular basis, which meant we were bringing more healers than we needed (if you bring 8 healers and 3 disconnect, you're going to have a bad time, especially when the login queue is 90 minutes). Some of our players were rocking 5 fps in raids, and that hurt their dps, too.
---
it was not in vanilla, but on a pserver...   With the raid already on farm for over a year so it was 'easy' for a semi casual like me to join and do those raids.    I had to do a minimum of preparation outside the raids.   and I didn't have to attend every raid , as long as I was reliable I was welcome whenever I signed up.  If that was only 1 night a week, I could play  5 hours a week and be in a AQ40 or Naxx raid.  That's pretty casual from raid point of view.
---
16, at home, part time job while attending college. Not as much playtime as I would have liked.

Now 32, moved from EU to NA. Work from home and became a responsible adult with house upkeep. Now all my free time is actual free time, nothing hanging over me that I know I should be doing.
---
You're still thinking about FF14 in WoW terms, rather than it being the fifth iteration of the Final Fantasy job system.
---
Rogue is decent with just about any partner, they hold a lot of the cards when it comes to world PvP, and Rogue + Mage has a lot of control in fights. Else, some kind of healer, Paladin is best for PvP.
---
Sorry man, gotta get your facts straight before going off on a rant  and just spouting whatever regardless of what's actually true here. Also, chill out, it's just reddit, your life will be a lot more enjoyable if you stop getting pissed off at random strangers on the internet. Just cause people correct you doesn't mean that's any reason to fly off the handle. 
---
Anyway, we can go down the list here: 
---
&gt;I'm misguided when you're the one claiming Classic is a bigger money printer than the cash shop? Really?
---
Not what I claimed. I said *for the resources required*, which is basically nothing since they already have all the assets, it's hugely profitable and basically a license to print money. The bulk of the work was simply re-engineering the 7.3.X client to work with the Classic assets. Once that was up and running, the rest of the work is tuning and bug fixing, which is a tiny, tiny fraction of the amount of work building a game from scratch would be. 
---
&gt;Blizzard's gone on record that BfA is the most profitable expansion ever and has less then a 3rd of WoW's peak numbers.
---
Again, nope, not true. They've stated it's the [fastest selling expansion](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/battle-azerothtm-becomes-fastest-selling-world-warcraftr), **not** the most profitable. You quite literally pulled that claim straight out of your ass. 
---
&gt;And at what point did I claim there was a "shadow cabal?" The fuck is that even supposed to mean?
---
Aaaaand another swing an a miss, I think that's three strikes. Claiming Activision is in charge ("Activision doesn't like games like that") is exactly the same vein as those conspiracies claiming Activision is secretly running Blizzard, which is bullshit as previously stated. Activision Publishing [is an entirely separate arm under Activision-Blizzard](https://www.activisionblizzard.com/about-us), the parent holding/shell company. Activision Publishing literally has zero input on Blizzard Entertainment's products, the parent company, as previously stated, is simply there to facilitate investor relations and other financial administrative work, *not* literal low level game design decisions. The people working at the parent company are a very small number of people in the whole org, and none of theme are in areas of game design. Again, this has been debunked quite literally dozens of times, by Mike Morhaime, Kotick, [community staff](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/activision-and-blizzard-relationship/68419/38), regular employees (as I said, some even to me personally who I knew/know), it's a tired dead circlejerk at this point in time, people gotta move on and assign blame to Blizzard for their mistakes, not Activision.
---
&gt; Activision bought out Blizzard and made the company in charge of everything into Activision-Blizzard. And every subsidiary is beholden to that company. That company has made it clear that profit through extra transactions is their standard, and thus the standard of every subsidiary.
---
What are we at, four strikes now? Who cares at this point tbh ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Activision did **not** *buy* Blizzard. They *merged* ([learn the difference](https://efinancemanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Merger-vs-Acquisition.jpg)) with *Vivendi Games,* which actually *did* own Blizzard at the time. Key difference here being that Vivendi owned Blizzard, whereas Activision never has. They simply merged into one company, Activision-Blizzard, by way of Vivendi eventually selling out their shares in the company back to Activision-Blizzard (which is composed of Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, and a few other smaller segments, King etc). 
---
Now Blizzard Entertainment and Activision Publishing are on the same exact "level" or playing field within the org. If either is going to have more influence as a unit, it's more than likely going to be Blizzard as they consistently pull in a higher percentage of the overall revenue of Activision-Blizzard as a whole. Kotick and Morhaime, contrary to popular opinion/circlejerk, worked very closely together over the years, and by no means had an antagonistic relationship as some would want you to believe. 
---
&gt;Kotick proposed the merger to Activision's board, which agreed to it in December 2007. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California). [Bobby Kotick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kotick) of Activision was announced as the new president and [CEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO), while René Penisson of Vivendi was appointed [chairman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman).[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-16) The [European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission) permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any antitrust issues in the merger deal.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-17) On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-Merger_Approved-18)

&gt;Vivendi was the majority shareholder, with a 52% stake in the company.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-Merger_Approved-18)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-19) The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the [NASDAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ) stock market for a time under [NASDAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ): [ATVID](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/atvid), and subsequently as [NASDAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ): [ATVI](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/atvi) (Activision's stock ticker). At this point, Lévy replaced René Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-ukgamespotabrendan-4) While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as [Sierra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment) ceased operation.  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt;On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-transofmrativepurchase-33) At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-34) and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public.

Again, this is all laid out for you, it's publicly available information.

u can try, but ur gonna fail, ur at the very bottom entry level of stv, that means everybody in stv is at least as strong as you.  you're rogue?  so what, people 5-10 lvls above you gonna see you a mile away.
---
The detail of this statement makes me feel like it comes from first hand knowledge :(
---
Only absolute morons think this is a solved game.
---
Amphy
---
Native speakers do it too sometimes but absent mindedly. Numbers that end in 4 through 0 end in th (fourth, fifth, tenth, twentieth, etc) but numbers ending in 1, 2, 3 end in st, nd, or rd (first, thirty first, forty third, etc). The only exceptions are eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth.
---
FUQ no gimme the twinks
---
They waited until weeks before, when advertising would be most effective. The hardcore playerbase that is interested in playing already knows about it (and some casuals). More casual/less game crazy people that would love to replay old WoW or try it for the first time, but if they were told about it a month or 2 ahead of time they would likely forget. 2 weeks though, that's a much better time to get those people hyped without them forgetting by launch.
---
Lol? What would be impressive? 20 hours? That’s not possible.
---
Not Warriors. Instead of going OOM, we go TMT (too much threat). Similar results in the end, really.
---
Yes, that is the one context in which you should swap out the 2H for dual wielding. You can swap weapons in combat so if you anctipate needing Skull of Impending Doom, set up a macro to switch your weapons to mainhand + skull.
---
Top notch comment!
---
Dumb tattoo. Also stop posting tattoos
---
I looked back at the front page of this sub and I didn't find any posts matching that description not flaired as art. You can just filter that flair out
---
Why is it so bright?
---
I turn it off when I want to aleep
---
If people want to do it, why not? The game was a lot more sandboxy than we have now. We had hybrid specs that were pretty crazy and worked.
---
Not everyone is going for world/server firsts, some people just want to do things for fun and try to push the boundaries of their skill.
---
The argument I am trying to make is, don't let classic turn into BFA - it's a game not a job. You should feel like you want to log in, not being forced to. Just keep in mind, not everyone will support your choice and that's okay no need to harass them for it, you can always find people who want to just do things that break the mold.
---
damn you beat me to it
---
Yes, Amphy, thank you my friend!
---
Yeah same, completely forgot about it until a few hours ago!
---
My guild is switching to the freshest realm, which is Stalag!
---
How is that problem solved by rolling UD priest?
---
And then he ditches the group to eat pizza and watch TV for an hour, then he comes back and acts like he left 5 minutes ago.
---
Super cool explanation. Thanks for sharing. Do you have rules around newcomers? In this system if someone has never gotten loot they will get the first piece of loot they want correct?
---
I'm usually not the kinda guy to go all grammar-nazi on people, just found it ironic how the guy who said "we are not that fluent in english" writes better English than the guy responding :D
---
But yeah you're right, watching movies in their original language is way better, and in general media consumption (not just videogames) in English will indeed improve your proficiency.
---
We used to just have people type in a number or say "Summon"
---
&gt; I want Blizzard to know without I doubt that I'm coming back solely for Classic.
---
It does not matter that you came back for Classic or not, it matters that is all you play.
---
&gt; In no way did I say that simply having tattoos is a shitty life choice
---
You literally said someone who has a wow sleeve has clearly made shitty life choices in the past. And you came to this conclusion because of a tattoo....
---
For those of you rolling night elf - shadowmeld will not take you out of combat. It can only used out of combat.
---
Seeing wayyyyy too many people talking about double vanishes for rogues or re-entering cat stealth.
---
Pretty much anything. The only class combo that's probably not going to be amazing is mage/warrior, but even that would be fine and fun.
---
The ping difference seems to be of debate, but I've been reading that the impact would be negligible. Will know more on server launch.
---
Oddly enough Emerald Dream seems to be taken out. GM island is taken out as well.
---
Meanwhile Azshara Crater and Old-old-SM, as well as apparently Programmer's Isle do remain in the game.
---
Pretty odd...
---
Can't we just enjoy classic? Why are we already trying to look past the product we've been begging for?
---
God damn sahn
---
MOVE THE FUCKING TIPI
---
Little out of context, but worth mentioning. Orangemarmelade (wotlk) showed me there is no skill ceiling for mages.
---

---
Take a look at a tournament where he turns a 1v2 with 10% health into a win
---
2.0.1, so the one after 1.12/1.13 which is classic. We will have regular meeting stones however.
---
They have sales, check Craigslist or even goodwill. Their warranty has issues and they’ll make you pay to ship the chair back so it’s usually better to sell and buy a new one.  I would link their sub but they swapped it to private a year+ ago.
---
I wish we could form a guild just the two of us, while you roleplay a girl. Perfect fit.
---
"my god....this person is a master tactician. What complex thoughts are thinking to be able to run in this pattern"
---
"Daddy, I'm chasing the butterflies in the game!"
---
i like it, it denies [raider.io](https://raider.io) ,
---
bring back GEARCHECK AT BANK OG
---
I'm just teasing. Sounds like you have a good thing going, good for you mate.
---
Except anyone who does both PvP and PvE competently is constantly respeccing.
---
Why would that combo be poor?
---
If anything, I’m glad I got you to go out and fight for something you believe in. I’m proud of you son.
---
This comment is true to its words, I turned it on max straight away and was suprised to see all the foliage and clarity. But still looks like vanilla, so its a win win in my opinion and will be playing like that!
---
I forgot layering
---
Hi, /u/Drmalcolm03
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/crbkrx/stalag_is_the_best_choice_because_its_the/). 
---
I do and shes a gamer and kicks my ass at disc golf.
---
Yup and it's usable for quite a while. Same with Gravestone Scepter from BFD and the spinning dish hat from Gnomer. Got all 3 on a mage once and had them equipped til I was in my 40s.
---
Druids and hunter are really fun classes to play casually.
---
With classic, everyone is happy to be there, and most people are helpful and pleasant as a result.
---
Overcrowding will absolutely not be an issue with how they implemented layering and dynamic respawns.
---
On the stress test, I hardly saw another other players outside the lvl 1-5 area. And even in that area, I only saw a handful of people. Dynamic respawns were in full swing too, mobs had a respawn time of like 30s so you were never competing for anything.
---
Layering essentially take what would be a full world and turns it into several different dead ones. Which is great for leveling, but sucks when you're trying to find people to duel, or you're running through Stormwind and see no one.
---
So don't be afraid to play immediately at launch. You'll be able to level up just fine.
---
I mostly do PvP and feral was terrible in PvP.  It was basically like playing a shitty rogue combined with an ultra shitty warrior :)
---
Aww, Rebirth was fun! Good people there.
---
Feral was probably one of the few meme specs that did fine in raids.
---
Oh interesting! Good point. I'll consider it for sure.
---
That's a weird way to spell bipolar.
---
Didn't Blizzard make this into a HotS hero?
---
this is correct.  once you get to revered the regular mobs stop giving you rep.
---
the rules blizzard made say so, since the general chat is meant for everyone on the server and the server is labeled as a english one
---
It's the dreaded pop going down that is the biggest concern. If I toss my lot in with a guild that loses its members...
---
BGs are cross-realm? Nice.
---
How much is very little, in your opinion? 
---
&gt;Close to an even split is also nice on a full server, because you get to see lots of the other faction.
---
But still the question remains unanswered: why does it matter on a pve server?
---
Im not trying to grill you, just want to understand your point of view.
---
Skyrim made me realize how the devs made better rpgs
---
Just remove rpg elements from the game and it will sell more. (this isnt a bethesda thing, just rpgs in general, even mmos)
---
Because you've made statements that would be more forgivable if they were casual ignorance.
---
Not me.
---
Like you I will be joining the game on the 30th and hopefully by then and launch related issues will have been resolved and the starter zones will be less congested.
---
&gt;  the idea that the end-game is the actual game.
---
And the idea that the end-game is the actual game is one of the fundamental missteps that took WoW down the path of ignominy that we see today.
---
i'm the grobgrogobgolus  
---
i love RP  
---
and this server is a true treasure trove
---
It ain’t easy, but it’s honest work.
---
thumbs up blizz
---
is rare creatures made pets better than normal ?
---
Without knowing what "medium" actually means this is baseless speculation.
---
TBC came after nax, that's the true Vanilla experience then. That's what you're suggesting as well then, I take it?
---
\&gt;I just assumed the thumping beat was my grobbing erection.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Catch you there, thanks for making awesome classic content!
---
Give it time I'm guessing some new viable specs will emerge some will be thanks to private servers ( not all cause of the differences) and others will evolve naturally.
---
Except RET pala never those.
---
Do I want to pay respecc and re-arrange my whole UI just for one day of Battlegrounds?
---
If that reddit poll was any believable, then all PVE servers have more Alliance pop. Pyrewood seem 2:1, so you will love it.
---
Deviate Delights you speakin my language
---
Diminishing returns on CC were introduced in earlier patches in vanilla, so they should be a thing. Diminishing returns works on similar mechanics afaik, so one stun will give DR to the next one.
---
Flying kills Wpvp
---
Cant w8 for all the love i will get from melee as a Shaman free dps boost totems to the ppl!
---
Where are you finding these spreadsheets?
---
Like for instance I cannot find the Rogue source mentioned anywhere in my searches.
---
ML is probably going to get used a lot tho because of the grace period where BOP items are tradable. Else everyone will need everything and ransom for gold.
---
the [ironman challenge](https://wowchallenges.com/index.php?Show=IronmanRules) is a fun way to pass the time
---
sadly with the state of retail even the ironman challenge is fairly easy depending on the class you pick
---
Ok, so for authentic Vanilla, TBC should come after phase 6, got it.
---
Helped a lot. What do you think about the Tauren animations? I just feel like Tauren works so well with their lore and being almost Native American.
---
Maybe that's it. I don't know about the alleged account sharing.
---
I asked the guards to put you on the list.  Approach one and right-click
---
Who the fuck goes to official forums.  That shit has been a cesspool since Vanilla.
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Actually just enabling Vsync in-game fixed everything.... I remember when I started playing Legion I had the same problem. Its the only game causing me this problem.
---
Considering how many people aim for week 2 or 3 MC clear, druids are S tier: fast to level, easy to gear.  
---
I want to point out feral tanks can be armour capped way earlier than warriors. They get hit harder, yes, but with a larger health pool and better single target threat generation through MCP when compared to warriors it just might be a tradeoff worth taking in phase 1.
---
Only if they run out to greet me!
---
Mostly Discord servers. Rogue one was from their class Discord.
---
Pretty much every spec has its uses, but not all of them work for raiding.
---
For clarity I was referring to the feral tanks not dps. We had some good fer tanks in pserver. So I hope the post was fake. 
---
In vanilla our guild didn't allow ferals to tank at all.
---
I mean, now's your chance, really
---
I still like the cata one better, you can see MANY more buttons which is nice, in yours you could literally only see like 3-5 buttons in each row cause its cut off
---
That sounds more to what I'm used to in America, but in Europe I'm more used to what op is doing.
---
Oh yeah for sure, I wouldn't expect that to go on the website or anything. It was mainly just to illustrate a point that if someone with no graphics design experience can make something half decent with free tools then the marketing team at Blizzard could probably put the vanilla talent trees on the site and make it look good.
---
this is incredible. 'You are test subject 1' beat drop - Welcome to the GrobMob  
---
gave me chills. stupid good job on this. /applause
---
Haha don’t do me like that
---
That epic mounts were 1000g and that making 1000g takes 84 years
---
I remember doing Upper blackrock spire when it was 15 man. then lowered it too 10 and eventually 5 ...
---
Or r/shittytattoos
---
i have to say that with the newborn i had way more time to play than now 😂
---
No, but I am IN YOUR HEAD! Nice night elf porn collection btw.
---
That's merely a rock, paper, scissors approach to balancing. The easiest type to achieve. True balancing would allow everyone to perform equally as good at everything they're physically capable of doing, while offering them each their own personalized twist and differences, and also requiring a different skillset and experience.
---
From what I know it depends a lot on the engage, if the hunter can control range from the start and just viper sting kite then he can win, if the priest gets a fear off and gets to put his damage in before he is oom then no chance for the hunter (talking shadow here, any other kind of priest would be too slow to kill the hunter and run out of mana for sure).
---
I'm not spamming this, my previous post was deleted and I'm not sure why. I'm not breaking any rules here, just trying to get my name.
---
&gt; The path to level cap is filled with discarded warriors
---
Very true.
---
If there is big imbalance then smaller faction will find problems finding groups for quest, dungeons, etc
---
Neutral AH is 15% I believe but you’re right, it’s most likely still worth it. Just thought I should mention that. I don’t see the neutral AH being used that much either, so maybe it’d be a bigger risk to put stuff up with that in mind.
---
guess i skimmed over that part of the title, thx
---
it also does not look anywhere as good, it shows only like 5 talents per spec cause it would be cut off like the one above.
---
I’ve decided to role hunter and spec to be really average in both. Saves a lot of money.
---
W8 so did it just put 5 random classe in a group and like party fixed gl?
---
bender is 90% rogue.
---
Herod got like over 7k when I checked this morning. Though not everyone has participated in the they selection yet, it looks pretty even. I'm just wondering if a majority of players reserved names, or if those who didnt reserve make up the larger playercounts.
---
I'm really picky when it comes to memes so what i have to say is - the icon for the spell is wrong / or the name whatever that pic and that spell name don't go together, it was added in wrath or tbc I don't remember and also boomkin in vanilla lmao good luck
---
I've never roleplayed despite playing on Emerald Dream (RPPvP) for 4 years. Was drawn to it for the great faction balance and enjoyed it quiet a lot. Great guilds too.
---
Because it will sleep a lot in the first few months?
---
Pumped full of nether mana and converted into a twisted abomination that presides over the BRAND NEW BARRENS DUNGEON
---
Don't tell the trolls
---
That's what I would do
---
Well to be fair I wasn't really a wow player at that point. 
---
I quit midway through TBC and had come back very briefly to level a character to 20 for a hearthstone quest and again when I got 3 days free game time.  And both times made me want the original game and not what it had turned into.
---
Enjoy killing the Zero alliance players that will be on that server lol
---
Minimum Specs from: https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-pre-launch-test-8-august-20-00-cest-and-minimum-specs/65918
---
I'm starting to see a trend here.
---
I was REALLY hyped about wildstar and it failed.
---
I was REALLY hyped for NMS, it was really disappointing (at least initially)
---
I was REALLY hyped about nether, it failed horrible.
---
Now I'm hyped about classic wow. If it fails it will be my fault.
---
I'd rather they just up the monthly price.
---
I dont give a shyte what happpens to this reddit honestly, I never was a redditor and will never really be. I just come here to catch up on WoW classic news and relieve some hype till launch. After that, I'm out!
---
lol hunter
---
I feel you man, hope you get to do exactly that
---
...
---
I don't mind faction imbalance so long as my faction is bigger ;P
---
What upsets me the most about #nochanges is how much they hate the idea of a very slight class re-balance to perhaps make some of the memespecs slightly more viable, or maybe even make, god forbid the thought, tanks besides warriors more viable in end game.
---
It bothers me because during vanilla there was a TON of rebalancing that happened.  The classes weren't static.  Wanting classic to have static, never changing classes isn't even the true experience.  Not knowing where your class was gonna be in a few months or a year was the real vanilla experience :P.  
---
Now everybody knows exactly what the capabilities of every class are now they won't change.  That is very....not vanilla.
---
I need to know what a salsa sandwich is. My wife is going on a work trip for two weeks during release and I'm going to be starving. What is this magical sustenance?
---
You guys have a low bar for what “playable” is. Sure you can click buttons and things happen. But moonkin and prot paladins felt damn near unplayable in most content to me. Enhancement and ret felt useless in pve. Ret still felt like crap in both pve and PvP. But I guess was atleast “playable” in PvP. Elemental shaman was a damn near uphill battle in raiding but was amaze balls in PvP. Shadow priest where fine. Feral was fine. 
---
And a lot of classes ran weird hybrid specs not even going full deep spec.
---
Because its an expansion that "resets'' the whole game dummy. 10 levels of content and new zones making everything else obsolete. Just like that... making your stupid logic even more obvious. Do i really have to explain to you the difference between new content via expansion and mashing content on top of content without "reseting" the game in order for people to catch up?
---
Toxic Pserver vet...you better thank us, i doubt you'd have seen Classic without those toxic people constantly asking for Blizzard to make it.
---
its only 1 pvp server for russia and 1 pve. which server are you going to take,  smart head?
---
It's just a normal truck when you're not in it.
---
Hunter and warlock because pets, paladin and shaman are good because they have sustain and utility. Other classes can ofc but those seem the best
---
This is sort of true for ret. White damage is still a very major part of the damage. People don't realize that a MCP with the active on is essentially a 1.3 speed dagger with like 43.5 dps, which in terms of dps is on par with something like Alcor's Sunrazor, but it benefits from the human racial and from the 2H spec talent.  
---
Is that the best white dps ever? No, but it's far and away what you'd expect out of a level 30 blue.
---
this hit me hard in the stress test, got a gun for my hunter and got excited
---
but nope fuck me, gotta walk all the way to Thunder Bluff to learn how to use it
---
and then I forgot to buy ammo and had to fly back to buy some
---
Wait.. you just contradicted your own comment above lol. Here you say it'll turn into simply a pvp server and in your own comment you say you're in for a nasty surprise if you don't RP... 
---
You a hater bro
---
I guess its inevitable with any IP? I would really like to see the numbers 1 year after classic launches to see the uptick and drop off. Also what % of subscribers play classic, retail, or both.
---
Honestly, you want the fastest attacking pet you can get because it pushes back spellcasting. Spellcasters (players and mobs) will give you the most trouble, so essentially locking them down with your pet will be incredibly beneficial.
---
Ah, my bad then! I just recognized the model, downloaded it a few times and scaled it down to use for quick test-prints.
---
honestly I think we're going pretty casual, which is fine (we're pretty Horde heavy on Retail, and we're going Alliance...soooo).
---
So I'm not too worried.  I think I'm gonna make an Orc Warlock on a PvP server regardless to get my rocks off in WPvP
---
I was a #1 ranked Shadow Priest in vanilla, and the only time I ever had trouble with a hunter is when they're BM and have Bestial Wrath. Otherwise I just ignored and feared the pet and won the fight through pw:shields and stuns with with rank 1 mind flay spams.
---
No problem! I may end up rolling druid myself and based on skarms vids he hasn't even mentioned that change and is still rolling bear and is pretty optimistic about it!
---
Shadowmeld ambushes with aimed shot will basically be the only reason to roll a ne hunter aside from irrelevant cosmetic differences.
---
Glad I have an option off the cesspool server that's still on EST
---
While leveling theres only one addon that i'll be using and i'd recomend EVERYONE to get. Theres a few that does the same thing and the name is
---
# DingRecorder
---
Or any addon which takes a screenshot every time you ding. I've not looked into too much which addons are available or which will be once many of ous will reach max level. But two of them would be to get the functionallity of Viewporter and Kg Panels. Viewport to get a higher field of view(FoV) and Kgpanels to get some awesome Warcraft 3 themed UI
---
That’s weird. I asked them the other day if there was any spreadsheets and I was just pointed to Shadow Panther’s site.
---
Well if people want it and there are enough people, sure. If it risks splitting the community too much, then better be careful. Not only we need people  but we need faction balance, otherwise one dies.
---
Still i would prefer TBC than some classic+ bullshit. Met enough people with their "ideas that wont change much". Funny thing is how they forget that everyone got them ideas.
---
As much as I agree, it's too late to change that for modern WoW.
---
This is true! At the time I was a smoker but I smoked indoors..... It was my first apartment on my item, and the last one I smoked in. I plan on playing priest again but I've been smoke free for a year!
---
omg ppl whinnig before  launch started
---
wtf chillax
---
1. there will be 100+ layers on every server
---
2. i bet 80% !!!!!! of players will never get 60 lvl and quit
---
3. i bet 50% will never get 40 lvl
---
having 20-30 k que its ok. we have same every POE league start. just wait 10-15 min to log in or dont play first 2-3 hours stop fking whinning.
---
i better have  1 hour que at start than DEAD server after 6 - 8 month (or even earlier)
---
Drustvar is a better Duskwood. Don’t @ me
---
I have screenshots of killing that jerk. (because I'm a data hoarder and I have them all) I should look at see what level we were.
---
Not necessarily. They may have Gear Points based on what gear they enter the guild with, but probably have 0 Effort Points.
---
Or, the guild may start them out with EP equal to the lowest EP for their class.
---
It's really up to your guild to choose.
---
archaaaaaaeoooooooooolooooooogyyyyyy
---
Give in to the Goo
---
Nah we haven't had sub numbers in years sadly
---
I like your ideas.  When it comes to heroic versions of dungeons, however, I'm on the fence.  I do like harder versions, and would enjoy running every dungeon at max level.
---
mainly it's because it has abuse written all over it.
---
i'm from EU and i've checked recruitment ads in discord. every fucking shit guild has LC because tHEy ArE aLL goINg FoR wORld FIrsT* :).
---
if you cast aside the private server community, the vast majority of the remaining demographic is formed of random strangers on the internet. adding the fact that loot council is  based on trust, you have the perfect recipe for bulshit.
---
Have a backup game of two ready.  You know the servers are going to be shit at launch.
---
This sub is not much better:
---
Me and dah bois X
---
Server fanart
---
Which class gois?  
---
Here's a guide!
---
Reading quests again, awesome.
---
Hey guys, remember to install Questie!
---
Layering, ewww.
---
Come on sheep, roll PvP...
---
Do you 'member...  Yeah we 'member!
---
Lul, retail.
---
Hunter rotations rely on timing autoattacks with your abilities, it's actually fairly satisfying once you get your rhythm down.
---
ME NOT THAT KIND OF ORC!
---
That was dumb.
---
I liked it.
---
In pvp with a hunter, is it better to kill the pet then the hunter, or just the hunter (assuming i'm playing warrior and will get kited a lot)
---
Wow, had never heard of that! Thank you
---
Listen. We will be there, and we will be dancing. We are not sad oomkins, WE WILL BE BOOMKINS! (in our hearts)
---
Not sure i'd post that other key online.  Pretty sure blizzard sometimes uses that key to recover accounts, someone could end up messing with yours.
---
wrong. cause those are for original 1.0+ client not 8.+downgraded to 1.0
---
Feral druids is actually quite decent as dps in classic, tanking is generally hard since you don't have any taunt.
---
If that's the code you used for your account on the right under the CD, I'd reupload this picture with it blurred out.
---
France has a border with 8 other countries i believe
---
no way medium would be 20k people...that would make the high realms a disaster
---
around 45% of the Server is EST
---
Give me my weapons and armor at the end of a difficult journey rather than at the end of a menial task once a day for a month.
---
I hear you. I have struggled with wow addiction my whole life. 
---
What I have found is that there’s nothing that I can simply ignore. I have to develop healthy boundaries and include all of the things in my life that are authentically me. 
---
I have to play WoW, and I have to learn healthy boundaries with it.
---
Kinda similar story, except I am the regular drinker and we all forgot how to do that part.  I walked in and clicked the first one.  Nothing happened so we decided to hit them all.
---
Death ensued, but luckily after that we all remembered just how stupid we had been.
---
In groups I join and run, it will be all Need on BoEs.  If the winner wants to trade to someone that will equip that item, it is their prerogative.  If people don't like that, they can do without me in their group or they can find a different group.  Different strokes for different folks.
---
That's fairly impressive, considering people were still fairly optimistic about WoW back then, after the success of Legion.
---
Male trolls have the best bow animations, that horizontal bow attack animation looks awesome.
---
With guns and crossbows they look goofy as hell though.
---
Aight Im wishing you good luck. I like you Boomkin semi-furry humanoids, but you'll probably end up getting rejected the same way ret pally gets bullied.
---
1 hour feels like 5 minutes if you are fucked up enough.
---
PvP.  just because i have a job and family doesn't mean i became some lame carebear who can't win a fight :D
---
Wow I forgot Classic had meeting stones.. They were added in March 2005.
---
But I have like ZERO memories of using them for some reason. I vividly remember in my 40s and 50s and at 60 using the Who search in the friends list, and just searching all level 60 Warriors and whispering each one, one by one asking if they can do this dungeon. Isn't that what everyone did?
---
To be fair shadow priests can heal 5 man's just fine
---
I think I am going to wait. At least 95% of the guilds I have seen posted are *too* hardcore about it, and sadly I don't know how fast I can get to 60 (married and uni starts monday...). There is one particular guild that seems a bit more casual and I might join, but at the same time it might end up being *too* casual for me haha. I really want to raid but I can't really commit to beating MC within 2-4 weeks of launch, but would love to be able to do so in a few months.
---
Tanking in PVP was honestly pretty engaging and fun. Just using threat abilities to reduce damage, and even a Bodyguard system to protect some key ally?
---
It was dope.

Your add-ons folder should only contain other folders, each add on (or component sometimes) will have its own folder in add-ons.
---
Nay. She is the new boss at the bottom of the Teldrassil cave.
---
I'm not here to play whack-a-mole, I'm here to melt faces.
---
The current data shouldn't be held in high regard, I have reserved my name on 3 realms simply because I'm not sure where I'm playing, I'm sure many did the same
---
I got my name on Herod and Faerlina first thing when they opened while waiting to find out where the streamers were going. Missed the announcement for Stalagg and name was taken by the next morning.
---
Part of me hopes I can find who has it and they'll trade. The other part of me is resigned to the fact that I'm stuck on an over-popped server unless I sacrifice my name.
---
If you are friends with the guy handling loot I'd be weary. Not sayin bail out, but dont let them use you like a tool.
---
I'm not arguing that.  I'm just saying you can get by on pet damage and auto-attack.
---
Especially while leveling.
---
Played on private servers and fought with 30 people for one boar before and guess what? After 2 days and after you outlevel the zerg everything goes back to normal, it certainly beats having Layering AKA Sharding ruin the game and the economy for 5 months at which point it is pretty much beyond salvaging but hey what would lil zoom know about that, you probably started in mop, you never knew what a healthy economy and server dynamic looks like. As for your other corporate excuses, bud you asked me for examples and I gave them to you, I don't give a flying fuck how are they not able to fix them because guess what? A few random nerds managed to do a better job on private servers. and I'm 24.
---
&gt;How much is very little, in your opinion?
---
&lt;35% is where it starts to suck.
---
&gt; But still the question remains unanswered: why does it matter on a pve server? 
---
There will still be wPvP for several months on PvE servers, since BGs aren't until phase 3. So having an even split between factions for that is very important. 
---
I also just like seeing lots of the other faction without my own faction being empty. I played on Silvermoon for a time, and it was massively imbalanced towards Alliance. WoW doesn't feel right with one faction mostly missing.
---
I thought it would have already been mentioned by now, u/tvanddy but UBRS was 15 man, Strat, Scholo, and LBRS were 10 man, before they all got rebalanced.
---
Good luck finding a raid that’s happy with having free carry spots. 
---
Yes. People sold carries. Now many people did free carries?
---
Awesome utility! I found one thing to fix: when you select an alliance race, mana regen from mana tide totem should not appear

This is absolutely the way to do it if you're starting with someone. Make a friend or two in-game who is a reliable DPS and you're golden.
---
I rerolled on a different server during TBC with a friend. I had been Priest, they had been Warrior, we both liked our classes but wanted a change. We swapped and their SO went Shaman (and was absurdly talented at DPS). So we had 3/5 of a dungeon group, with everyone knowing their role well. We often just added another DPS and cleared stuff 4man.
---
Yes I'm sure when the game released it required CPUs/GPUs that hadn't been invented yet and an operating system that wouldn't exist for another 5 years...
---
These are the finalized minimum specs for Classic that are available on the official Blizzard forums. Do you have a test PC with similar specs that shows they're inadequate?
---
You're really underestimating how many people want to play this game. If you think there won't be more then two full east coast pvp servers then classic has already failed. Stalagg will fill up the first week
---
Too late, we already have memes and tattoos.
---
They could offer free transfer to X amount of people/guilds to a new server, that offer last X weeks, and while you have the possibility to transfer your name is reserved.
---
For example, I create a char named Slugkitten. They open a new server and offer me a free transfer. For 2 weeks nobody can get the name Slugkitten in the new server, after that, if I didn't transfer, the name become available for everyone
---
do i really need to tell you how washed down retail is in comparison? i really don't want to waste my time listing everything just for you.
---
Without getting into it too much, it pretty much goes like this:
---
Left college &gt; Got shitty job &gt; Left shitty job &gt; Joined army &gt; Left army &gt; Live with parents &amp; studying for a chance at better job
---
Typically they'll turn it on before starting the boss with said reserved loot on it. 
---
*Expect to see this a lot during UBRS and BRD.*
---
This is Chinese right?  I was in between that and Korean.  I couldn't figure out the characters.
---
Between your bad grammar, and bad punctuation, I'm not exactly sure what your bitching about.
---
Care to re-state?
---
In todays Day n age its Hard to stop cross fsction collusion
---
While leveling, all of the guides say to go 1/2 Imp Mend Pet.  I always go 2/2.  Because if my pet gets feared, sheeped, or stunned, I want that stun off ASAP.  50%/tick may over-dispel quite a lot, but it also is more reliable at getting my pet cleansed as quick as I can.
---
thank you very much ! I dont think thats my old code, but I'm not 100% sure. I didnt know that somebody could do something with it, so thanks for the information!
---
Yea i expect it to fall
---
Doesn't matter. This sub is donezo in 2 weeks
---
Thanks! I do appreciate it

How gear dependent is the priest? My biggest fear is that I spend the time to level up and in 6 months or so I hit level 60 just to find out that everyone out gears me terribly and I just die the moment they look in my direction...
---
Just made my priest on Grobbulus, never played on an RP server before and not sure what to expect
---
Elon Musk: hold my beer.

Your left nut isn't safe just yet.

He has the same heart condition as Arnold Schwazneggar

Props for keeping him at 26. Gives it a role-play aspect since all the other undead enemies are around that level.
---
which is negligible
---
Hell, most modern smartphones could probably run it from a hardware standpoint. Any computer bought in the last decade should be fine. I'm sure enthusiasts could get it running on older systems too.
---
because i saw people wielding two of them, that's why i asked.
---
Just move her 5m for the original position and no-one will find her XD
---
If you read the commented post, you’ll see that they aren’t wrong. Sure you’ll have a better time with the newer minimum specs, but the point was the minimum from running the game.
---
That's all well and good, but that CPU is not going to be playing classic.
---
Ok this was a good shitpost.
---
Quality fucking content.
---
PVP, definitely looking more so to simply do WPVP and BGs
---
The only correct answer btw
---
Lol this guy thought he was right..
---
The Rest of it is travel time, Lunch time, showering, preparing food etc. I think that was pretty self explainatory
---
Give me the code and I'll test it for you
---
The most important part of the blue post:
---
&gt; when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2
---
"You think you want it, but you really dont"
---
I cant remember honestly, I’ll just ask barrens chat ;)
---
Only Druids.
---
Standup desk ftw!

I remember having lock offtank adds with his pet in some runs
---
I think you're in the wrong subreddit.

/r/wow
---
Why would classic fracture the playerbase?
---
Everyone has access to both games and both are able to be played casually. A lot of people I know will hop back between the two depending on which one has the newest patch/phase.
---
I doubt they would have been able to do it in 10 minutes. But if they weren't tightly linked to infra it could have been done in a day. From what other posters have said they have a true 1.12 build running since 2017 running but they wanted to do a ton of upgrades (as one would want to)
---
There are no hierlooms in classic lol
---
You may trust and be fooled/betrayed.  Just a feeling of trust can be misleading.
---
#showtooltip Arcane Shot
---
/cast Arcane Shot
---
To explain what each line does:
---
#showtooltip Arcane Shot [shows the tooltip of the ability on mouseover, rather than a blank icon]
---
/cast Arcane Shot [casts the highest rank of Arcane Shot you have learned]
---
/petattack [sends pet to attack your current target]
---
Get gold, buy tokens, have “free” classic game time!
---
The goalposts being that Rogues have thr ability to dump their aggro and druids do not? The goalposts that rogues can take 5 seconds to deal with mechanics if they have to, and not half their DPS for the whole fight? The goalposts that none of this list has AoE damage where most raid tights are cleaved fights? 
---
You're clueless, dont talk.
---
Oh god... The goo! It's spreading!
---
One sec, I gotta ~~infect~~ cough I mean, "invite" my IRL buddy who's starting classic with me.
---
Reroll the character creation :-)
---
Honestly, it's the preferable of the two options to me as well, as much as I love TBC. That said. Isn't reliving the past exactly the point of Classic? :D
---
I don't even know why they need a beta, it's just the same game, just release it - how hard can it be?  
---
*yes some people actually argued this here 6 months ago*
---
I would like to see transmog but I don't need it.
---
I mean I never said boomkins would never get to raid... but sure. Facts.
---
SimpleEnergyBar
---
I just read that he wont do it because of health issue. Also, I believe there are already people slighty faster than him too
---
I call you lil zoom because you act and think like one. I didn't bother to answer your other ''arguments'' because all you did was to give excuses to the issues I brought, did you even bother to read what I wrote about these issues and what these issues bring about? 
---
  Damn right I expect them to create a different launcher for Classic WoW, or at the very least disable every functionality of battle net within Classic WoW, because that shit ruins multiple very important aspects of the game. 
---
 Right Click Reporting ruins untamed chat channels for which Vanilla is well known, like the infamous Barrens Chat, and creates ways in which you can ruin an entire raid and incentivises people to be spineless instead of just ignoring people that have been ''rude'' to them.
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler isn't even that good for anyone except Feral, since they don't suffer from the abysmal lvl 30 dmg range on that weapon.
---
Their weapons are just stat sticks, so you just treat it like an extra (very good) trinket for like 30s or whatever, then swap back.
---
Agree 100%. Unmoderated content means the front page becomes highlights, memes, and fan art. Actual discussion becomes a rare offurence. See /r/overwatch and /r/apexlegends
---
No changes
---
I'm glad to say that I've forgotten most of the intricate details of end-game dungeons and raids, which hopefully will make them somewhat of a fresh experience. I literally had to check up who Shazzrah was after seeing the server lists, as I had completely forgot that boss existed.
---
Two things:  
---
&gt;when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.  
---
&gt;Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.  
---
Now this is interesting information.
---
thats what he said, its the pre tbc pre-patch, previously known as the pre pre expansion patch first of its name. if it wasn't obvious to you.. then thats a you problem buddy
---
Druid or paladin.
---
These are adorable.
---
Keeping in mind this toon had 2 years and about 3 months to get that play time. That's 27 months. They played about 10 months / 27 months which is 37% of the time. 
---
That means they were online just a little bit more than 1/3rd (37%) of the time. That's actually insane.
---
Hopefully they release a few more realms so I can have a chance at actually reserving my name.
---
This
---
I made a post regarding RP name policy and it did NOT go over well, to say the least. RP name policy states multi-word names ie "Iwillkillu" and such, it also states famous real people like "Hughjackman" but the one that seems to cause the most confusion and I seemed to catch all holy hell and downvotes for is common non-fantasy names "Milk" "Egg" "Pancakes" "Toast" "Bicycle" and again, I don't work for Blizzard, I didn't create the rules all I did was copy and paste what they were and people like "Durrr! I have a good RP backstory and your gonna report me!?!?"              
---
I didn't even say I was, all I said was those kinds of names probably would get reported. Anyways it doesn't matter if you create some giant back story about how you wound up with the name "Milk", Blizzard won't ask you why you chose that name and 99.9% of people who report it also will not ask you why you decided to name yourself "Milk". All that's gonna happen is maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks, maybe a few months you're going to receive a message stating you violated Blizzard naming conventions for the server type with a block to type in a new name.
---
I see one with ony head &amp; ZG but no DM T buffs is interesting
---
Power leveling also isn’t really a thing.
---
Always gotta look on the bright side
---
Pve. I'm gonna be so far behind the curve wpvp will be impossible.
---
😭 poor souls
---
Never worth it to kill the pet,you would just want to Fear it, or Hamstring it.
---
Druid is the least played class but it’s not a coincidence if you catch my drift
---
He means with the 1.13 client the map files for Azshara Crater are still in the game.
---
I work 7 on 7 off Wed-Tues, so I took Mon and Tuesday off and will be off 9 days.
---
That's probably what the quotes were for.
---
&gt; if I throw a ton of cash at him
---
That doesn't mean I can't take precaitions. Sure it can happen to pretty much anyone at any time, but my odds will improve significantly :p  
---
And if you were referring to the "while playing" part specifically, I mean during the 2 or so years that the first round will be.
---
The amount of ppl needed o fill out the game world is the same tho, and we are far far exceeding it with layering. Not that that’s what’s got me worried, it’s the things it’s gonna do to spontaneous and repeated interactions as well as community integrity. That they can layer us all on to 1 server if they wanted I don’t doubt, but it’s not what I want gameplay wise.
---
And nobody says 14 days wtf thats a huge overkill if youre leveling at normal pace
---
Ain't browsing reddit to calm your doubts, go browse the likes of "Language specific servers" on the subreddit, you'll find what i'm talking about, check the reactions
---
Read for a bit and then realized just how long the list is...
---
Was going to stop because theres no way ADHD lets me get through this, but im so damn desperate for Classic at this point....i think ill keep reading and hope it tides me over for a bit x_x
---
I had an add-on like this in eso and absolutely loved it
---
That and 
---
" Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006. "
---
At least do the dance!
---
I think he means like a weapon whit 41 spell damage on casters and so on
---
Lolol
---
Happened to our guild to.  We got 3 geddon bracers.  No Garrs.  Wasn't until I was soloing it that I got the remaining binding.
---
When you find a fellow hobbyist model painter playing classic. Play any table top?
---
Try to find original vanilla players. I reconnected with old guildmates and people from my old server and I would say the youngest person is late 20's. Most of us are 30's and 40's
---
Hi Kurt
---
Depends on if it's a BM hunter or not. Killing the pet will *always* annoy the hunter regardless of spec, but once a Hunter get's geared the pet is basically a killable DoT.
---
Ah yes. I recall using Feign Death&gt;Goblin Jumper Cables a few times also. Will be interesting to see what strange mechanics will still work.
---
I think this was only in the Deadmines and it should still be accessible from retail.
---
I just kind of noticed the style was Chinese after watching other Chinese works over the years. 
---
Upon closer examination those are Chinese characters not Korean yeah. 
---
Source: Uhh I took Japanese in high school and my teacher also introduced us to Korean and Chinese and we saw how the characters generally looked.
---
&gt; honor-points are server-specific so server does matter for ranking.
---
ah yeah true
---
I mean were already going 6 phases deep into reliving the past, why is this where the line is drawn.
---
The true heirloom is a skinning knife with spell power enchant
---
Left half is baron and right half is garr. Kinda nitpicky sorry
---
I'm planning on leveling/raiding as 20/31/0 and tanking 5-mans whenever I can but once I start targeting pre-BIS gear I expect there to be some drama if I run public groups.  After all my main target will be DPS gear...but when I'm actively tanking it kinda feels bad to have to roll for it.
---
I don't know, I'm hoping to just spam dungeons with Guildies so that we can all get what what we want.
---
That’s some insane level of dedication to a game, I’m guessing he maxed out everything?

My first epic in vanilla was the Lei of Lilies, dropped on a gorilla from the caves in Un'goro. I was about level 50 with my warrior and I'm pretty sure I equiped it.
---
My first epic on private server was Alcor's Sunrazor. I had just gotten to level 60 the same day, it was my first Strat run and It dropped on a thrash mob right in front of the ziggurath with the boss that does mind controls. All 5 of us rolled need to sell on AH and I won.
---
I sold it the same day for 1100g to a larger guild's main tank. Got my epic mount the same day I dinged 60 and it basically paid for half of my girlfriend's mount as well. I remember meeting the warrior I sold the dagger to in a bg a few days later... he was still riding a 60% horse. Poor guy... literally
---
I've had that too. It got corrected, I'm fine now.
---
Mine too, except I sold it to buy an Orb of Deception and to train some of my skills. My f'in face when I found out that Orb of Deception only lasted 5 minutes on a 30m cd.
---
It's not fallacious if the slope is real. As such, claiming that "this one change would result in a ton of other changes is by definition a logical fallacy" is in itself a fallacy (a so-called *fallacy fallacy).*
---
Nice :D

---
Viable, Possibly. Optimal? No.
---
No. All pets of the same family have the same abilities and base stats. Only certain pets have lower attack speeds. Petopia has a list of all pets by attack speed.
---
I was something like 12 or 13 back in Vanilla... I was in school, not a care in the world. 
---
I'd go to school and talk about WoW with my friends all day, then come home and play WoW with them all night... rinse and repeat. 
---
They were good times. 
---
I'm now coming up on 28, living with my beautiful girlfriend, and my 11 month old son in a nice house in the lake district (UK). I work as an insurance broker for a subsidiary company of Marsh and McLennan.
---
Can't really complain at all...
---
Yeah on private servers I mostly quit after some time because I was thinking "well this server is not gonna exist in a few weeks/month, not worth it to dedicate any more time to it".
---
But now the servers are actually gonna be there forever so I can finally fully dedicate!
---
Classic until the end of Wrath is 6 years. If they can keep the game popular for 6 years, thats a huge win for Blizzard.
---
In my ideal world, we would get an alternate version of BC that maintained a vanilla philosophy(rework badge and arena gear, fix the horrible plot), but that depends on how much resources they are willing to put in.
---
Maintaining a Vanilla&gt;Wrath timeline gives them 6 years of a game for very low investment.
---
It’s a 12% decrease in run time, so that’s pretty significant
---
He's saying 6 months is exaggerated, phases will probably be faster.
---
YES PLS THIS WOULD BE AMAZING

---
a holy paladin will get instant invited. Farming isnt horrible, you just have to work harder and longer. Cloth is your friend but there is some key pieces of plate and mail loot that will be good. In PvP holy paladins are insane, but don't expect to be wrecking on your own. It's a support class
---
If this were any other expansion you'd be right. Unfortunately this is vanilla WoW and bosses do not move. (Not at this gear level, anyway).
---
Right? I thought the same thing, it’s another example of Blizzard’s handling of this giving me hope. I really do feel like they have a good grasp on what to do, I just pray that I’m right in feeling that way.
---
In PvE, a lot of stuns are magic effects.
---
In PvP, there are a few you can remove (i.e. Hammer of Justice is a Magic effect).
---
Ssds are notorious for bricking like this though and all I did was unplug for a moment. But go off nephew.
---
No, there's a quite linear progression with no room for alternatives.
---
You keep Rhok'delar until you get Ashjre'thul (crossbow), and then that's pretty much what you have forever. Technically BiS is Nerubian Slavemaker, another crossbow, but that thing will be rarer than most legendaries for a while.
---
Early on you may have some options, but not many. Even preraid bis, Bloodseeker, is a crossbow.
---
" a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006 "  
---
shit is fucked. this is way bigger than they thought it was going to be.
---
I dont wanna roll on another realm :(
---
I guess I meant computers can be garbage when you need them most lol.
---
&gt; I feel bad for the people expecting to play within the first 6 hours of release.
---
I feel bad for the Sysadmins and Net Engineers getting fucking bollocked by the upper management when all this goes to shit.
---
Daily reminder that the pserver ND had a release with over 16k ppl of which all got in the game at the exact same time with 0 lags, server instabilities, dog shit layering or any other kind of player inconveniences. That server was founded by donations, scripted by a 24yo norwegian kid and had a stuff of not even 10 people.
---
Meanwhile small indie game companie Blizzard:
---
Holy shit this is what I remember from when I first started playing. I never realized it wasn’t in vanilla. I guess I only played a week before BC came out.
---
^^^
---
The blue post said medium pop servers already have way more people than the most crowded servers in 2006.  There is no need to worry about population.
---
Don't know if you play on EU or NA but on Eu it's sometimes really crazy.
---
Most say "sum pls" or "123".
---
Then you have my fellow countrymen, the germans, who are used to scream "port" and "port pls".
---
And then you have the frenchies who just write "tp".
---
Although to be fair, it has only been noticeable on retail since they enabled cross server raiding and dungeons.
---
No hit while leveling you're rage starved every pull it feels(for me currently readying up for classic) it's not fun solo that's for sure. No hit leveling up makes it feel slow because it is without rage and missing half the time lol
---
Really? I read the exact opposite.  they are refusing to increase the pop cap out fear of creating large servers.
---
this of course fucks everyone.  Like what happens when the people dont quit.
---
Slow down, you still have to survive ten days my friend.
---
Yeah... this whole "authentic" vanilla wow experience is kind of bologna. I'm stoked. Can't wait to play. But I'm not on the rabid side of making everything in WoW classic exactly the same as it was. Things will be different and that's okay.
---
I don't care.
---
Even alliance don't have competition. Ain't nobody gonna give gear to a ret.
---
Almost like betas and stress tests are likely to have occurrences that differ from the released product.
---
If you want to bitch about it "BEinG ShaRDinG In rEAliTY," at *least* wait until launch and see if it still acts like sharding.
---
You guys remember when people were like "Classic server cap needs to be 3k players or its not vanilla!"
---
I wonder where those people are now.
---
Amphy was already 10 hours faster than Joana by level 40.
---
If you're that bothered by it, probably should roll another class. I personally cannot see why a crossbow would bother you that much. The only thing close that makes sense to me is a Paladin wearing dresses to heal, but that's the entire look of the character.
---
Yeah just cuz someone else knows every single item location and min/max combo and hits 60 in a week doesnt mean that I'm going to get less fun out of it. 
---
I played from 2007 to 2011 and did endgame raid content for all of TBC and WotLK.... but I've never seen the inside of Scholomance. I've never done all the associated Blackrock mountain instances/raids. I've never Even played alliance. 
---
I was worried about the same thing as OP, but this time, I am deliberately doing things differently to see more of the world. I could play an orc warrior, which is what I played all those years ago, but I've already seen undercity, tanked the hard dungeons, leveled through the Barrens. But I've never even played through 30 on Alliance before. I am going to construct a new game for myself by playing a class, a race, a faction, and a playstyle that I havent done before.
---
Don't you put that evil on classic, Ricky-Bobby.
---
And they’re all in this thread. And they were all rank 14.
---
Frostitute.
---
I spent a lot of time playing a character with my dad in wotlk, then when bfa came, we were finally able to play together, then, we realized there wasn’t a lot to do and both cancelled subs. Now we are both excited for classic.
---
D:
---
Yeah it was just funny :)
---
[Brits aren't budging, we already have an anthem.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03kP-pbntyw)
---
Some of the highest pop realms had queues on weekend days/nights even during tbc, and not during expansion launch but months later. I would suspect Herod will have queues at high play times (nights, weekends) well after launch, assuming the pop stays very high.
---
Move stolen silver to 2% drop from raptors only lootable by one person in group.
---
&gt; You also don't factor in raid rebuff slots. Nobody is going to give feral bleeds one of 16 slots in a raid setting.
---
These numbers are without any feral bleeds. If they get access to a debuff slot their damage would actually be slightly higher.
---
It's even easier because the addition of modern API tools allows you to bind the entire powershift to a single button.
---
One of my earliest memory from WoW Vanilla was walking with my level 26 across two continents to see Thunderaan being summoned by the top guild of my server.  
---
I spend hours dying and walking back to my body just to witness that epic event.  
---
A few years later, I managed to farm it solo twice on two different characters by running MC on my own every week.   
---
I love MC and BWL so much, brings so much memories.

That makes it sound like they will be ending layering as planned even if a server is heavily overpopulated which will then result in massive queues. I am good with this
---
This is why I don't post here, only respond to comments. it's a more than a little annoying
---
Look at this guy bragging about how he has friends to split Uber rides with.
---
I'd try to come up with a real name
---
[https://i.imgur.com/gNp0LTf.png](https://i.imgur.com/gNp0LTf.png) Comparison. Yeah i far prefer theirs. Much more clean and easy to see.
---
Hordies have to run from Kargath to the Blackrock raids and dungeons, right?
---
Happy to see that medium pop oceanic servers mean a healthy population.
---
Well, shucks.
---
Which makes sense
---
I didn't get my name on either, but I got a better one on Herod, so I dunno what I wanna do... then there's the mess of trying to decide between friends on what server we wanna go to now, and now names have already been done
---
Spaniards better fucking stay on Shazzrah along with the other nordic rejects choosing to stay earlier.
---
Whatever animation you prefer
---
No, *you're* salty
---
I wonder why everyone thinks it will be 10 days /played to 60 now.  The general rule of thumb used to be 15. Was 1.12 easier to level in or something?
---
If you think that applies to retail then I'm sorry for you
---
Fuck moving now. All the realms will be full at launch and more servers will be opened probably. I'd rather take my chances now and switch once they open up even more servers.
---
Please stop posting trash content like this.
---
For me it's 2H enhance shaman!
---
...that won't get to raid :(
---
They are looking at my new ssd and old hdd , my ssd with my os for booting is bricked I think and now I have a pile of junk. Probably going to run to a electronics shop and buy a laptop for release. I’m sick of computers
---
Also a good point.
---
Understandable. I hope Classic goes better for you!
---
Time for CTProfiles
---
I spent two hours last night trying to decide the same thing. My main in retail was called Drazil which is lizard backwards, he was a troll so it sort of suited him. I also made an UD mage this time around and went with Drazul for a little more of a undeadish feel.
---
Unoriginal
---
They're coming to terms with the facts: "You think you do, but you don't... Or do you?"
---
Me too but I'm 24. Life hasn't been kind to me.
---
Fuck yeah FAIRBANKS BABY!
---
someone has a different opinion than i do. this must be a joke i cannot believe this
---
Out of curiosity, why did you join then leave Grob? Insurance in case the other pvp realms stayed too populated?
---
No, I do think the sub needs more game related discussion posts and less memes even if it's just for the fact that discussion posts can bring an improvement to a players ingame experience. Memes on this sub aren't really bringing anything to the table, especially not for new visitors who can't relate.
---

---
Holyshit. The just said that current estimates of low/medium etc are actually higher than total populations of vanilla wow servers.
---
Did I understand that correctly!?
---
Unpopular opinion here, but I think the cataclysm talent system is the best (with exception to the one talent point per two levels).
---
I feel one reason why not enough people are switching to the new server is that the time between announcing it and the actual start of the name reservation was too short. 
---
You won't get a whole guild to reconsider if they only have about four hours to talk it through - especially if said guild and its members already managed to get their names on the other realms.
---
People keep saying that the character was account shared
---

Incel forums are that way.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/crcgf3/any1_know_of_a_list_that_shows_the_armor_and_hp/). 
---
Holy Pal yes, most of the time raids need healers more than dps.
---
Don’t sweat over pre-60 gear. Even when you get a sweet lvl 48 helmet you’re gonna replace it.
---
If you are worried about blowing things up, though, play the warlock.
---
Pyroxenete
---
All of those names are wack man. Come up with an actual name.
---
Around level 20 on my hunter I saved up money so I could buy a white gun from a vendor in wetlands because it looked like a shotgun and did so much “dps”. The sad thing being my weapon was so old it was an actual upgrade and then I went around dueling people with a white weapon and bragging about it. I was so proud of that vendor purchase 😂 .
---
What isn't?  If anything it's way faster than that on retail classic.
---
cries in druid
---
No need, of it brings you put /wave at them and just leave the area.

You’re a beautiful soul thank you

I know its a meme, but if a person says something like that, they are going to get reported.
---
I can provide info on the weird specs. Whats your discord name? PM on reddit.
---
This is true.
---
It's too late. We've already started seeing posts like "My wife gave me this EPIC gamer food package of only 15 000 calories for today!" and "I got this legendary nostalgia tattoo, am i the only one who is hype?"
---
And they're reaching the front page of the sub as well.
---
Yeah people on internet are retarded.  I used to get annoyed by such dumb takes but I've learned to just ignore them.
---
Death knight or demon hunter?
---
That must be the last pic?   (my knowledge of paladins is minimal)
---
Everything will get to raids unless it's a hardcore one . Remember , people will have a hard time noticing you over the 40 people in the raid
---
To be fair, my friend who was a gladiator warlock was a clicker.
---
The cataclysm one looks about 500 times better though.
---
whats the point of growth if quality declines
---
I think it will only exacerbate retails problems now that we have our safespace. I feel they will be less hesitant to braindead the game even more than it already is, figuring that the hardcore players who care about a cohwsive world and engaging gameplay will self segregate to classic.
---
I've given up on retail. Multiple years of collective /played, many rare mounts and achievements that are becoming increasingly devalued with every new expacs catchup mechanics. So many abilities lost over the years. 
---
At this point they would have to straight up nuke retail for me to care about playing it again, remove it to the barebone mechanics, go back to the wrath talent tree, delete the 1000000s of mounts/xmog items/dead continents... idk just fuck it man. 
---
Hopefully it just becomes a filter for shitty updates, similar to how rs3 shields OSRS from garbage mtx content.
---
Thanks for the response! My biggest fear was the farm at the end game and not being able to make gold to support myself at 60. Slowly changing my mind though...
---
rtx and overcloked cpu in this bitch or you are not a real gamer
---
It's rather simple, choose another server. You're not losing any time invested on Herod yet.
---
Mind quickening gem
---
The trinket description is "reduce cast time by 30%" but they basically must just use a spell haste numeric value which is what I think this guy is asking for (but I don't know where one would find it)
---
Not really, this is why we have layering to fuck things up.
---
Got me there lol. Was wondering the same as the topic starter, and searched for it. I don't even have a warlock lol, but remembered their epic mount quest was in DM. Wondering if the Pally one will be available in phase one, or if that's also barred until phase 2.
---
But yeah, also wondering what they will ultimately do with classic after all phases have been released. In my opinion they should have just left a copy of every old expansion and their servers, so people who favor some older expansion can keep playing it, or just jump on any time with some friends to have some fun (like an undead stratholme 45 min run :D).
---
Every knew this would happen. Everyone wants to stay on the original servers and not move to new ones
---
Blizzard has the resources to balance every spec and just chooses not too. They don't want mythic strategies to change vastly from early on kills. Lets say method brings a few frost mages because they can burst an add in the final boss of a tier. If blizzard nerfs frost because it's doing too much and has too much priority then people who are gearing their raid out for that final fight get fucked over hard. 
---
I know that personally my raid leader was planning on which classes/specs to gear out by week 2 of the tier. This was weeks of planning and priority so we could kill g'huun efficiently. Most guilds that get cutting edge function this way because it's the best way to play for an average CE guild.
---
Because of this there isn't room for nerfs really. You can't justify nerfing prominent strategies for raid that take multiple months to be cleared by average mythic players. This leaves us with only one choice; buffing stuff that's bad. Buffing stuff that's bad has it's own set of issues in that it can create a NEW prominent strategy for bosses which makes older ones seem inferior to the point where they don't feel worth pursuing. This can lead to you feeling like you wasted your time and resources which can lead to hard burn out.
---
The side effects of this design are felt HARD in the mythic plus community. Healers are designed around having certain raid roles and can't translate that role to an effective M+ healer (priest compared to druid).
---
Oh, okay. Y’all just gonna leave out my boy Fairbanks?
---
They said in the post explicitly that they will not open a new pvp server until stalagg fills up.
---
It's like getting one is actually legendary and not a guarantee for performing nominally.
---
Though don't get me wrong I'd rather less chance and more skill involved.  And I wish my Rhok'delar was legendary because the demon fighting was back in the day!
---
tbc
---
Because Vanilla is the most obvious starting point.
---
Nah itll be literally full at launch day.
---
Looks like Medium now is more:
---
&gt;"a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006."
---
Maybe people can stop shitting their pants about dead servers and layering now? At least until after launch.
---
Right here, feeling concerned about what I just read! Classic was designed for a certain population. It wasn't an arbitrary technical limitation. Private servers are proof that large populations cause a breakdown in community and organic relationship building.
---
We love this game because of the community it creates. Megaservers detract from that core tenet.

Is this the CauthonLuck from Starcraft? What a legend
---
Holy shit I think I lose brain cells when I read that
---
They dont want to lose their reserves names
---
To have played a few mmo, more players is better as long they don't go into the extreme.
---
Yeah I'm aware.. never seen people refer to that as "hierlooms".. that's why
---
I work 4 on 4 off 12 hour shifts. I booked off 8 days (which is considered vacation where I work since it's two weeks of work). That nets me 21 days off if you count the first 4 I would've been off for anyway.
---
The neckbeard will be long and luscious.
---
Any. Don’t sign upto pvp if you don’t want to pvp.
---
&gt;What you won't get is long queue times
---
When the influx of people subbing around launch happens, I dunno if you will be able to say that haha.
---
Anybody we all thought that they had increased the drop rate since the expansion was right around the corner.
---
&gt;- Cross-realm grouping? Never. Realm identity.
---
Except for bgs though yeah
---
Thank you. It sounds like Faerlina will be the sevrer for me then i guess.
---
I didn't get my name on either... I had to put a fucking x on the end of it....
---
Layering was never not going to be in phase1
---
Idk why but the 24hr show countdown ticking noise played in mix of the zelda day 3 dreadful sound....🤔
---
You can actually just stay in DPS spec (as a healer class) for the majority of the leveling grind. Since you don't really get any +healing and Mp5 items until the 50s and 60s running dungeons mainly comes down to how much water you have in your bags.
---
I'm an undead warlock, EVERYTHING is kill on sight.  
---
And I will drop an infernal in your low level Alliance town, because fuck you.
---
I think you mean "gold"
---
This is a very good point.
---
If you believe Blizzard are inherently that bad, why are you even playing their games?
---
If you check his warcraftmovies profile.. he was online 2 months ago, I definitely think he has classic on his mind.. would be unreal if he came back.
---
STV is going to be like trying to level in alteric valley.
---
stalaggdiscord.com
---
Thats definitely not the hd-model...
---
I think a lot of people overestimate how important names are for most people here.
---
You need to get close to be able to use mindflay, good hunters won’t let that happen much.
---
Thank you for the information!
---
Them sticking to it and continuing to publicly stand by it is very important.
---
They really need to add a new west coast pvp server too.  On launch it's going to get slammed and you don't want to ask people to move after launch.
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
Don’t divine intervention the tank mod boss fight.
---
Do you realize that the 3k pop cap people are opposite of the private server community? Chill, you're just angrily flailing and not making sense.
---
You think Faerlina, Herod, and Whitemane display as 'Full' because thousands across the US are sitting at character creation all day?
---
Yep and these 2 realms are basically the “best” realms in the communities eye’s, that will not significantly change despite this post and Blizzard’s efforts to shift players unfortunately.
---
WHERE IS MANKIRKS WIFE PST
---
And a lot of those people will choose the first two servers as they know the population will be the safest. Imagine realising you're already on a non-full realm 1 week after release, it'll be pretty devastating.
---
I can hear the dice rolling
---
Curious on how they expect queues of this size. Isnt this the exact thing layering has been implemented to prevent? If it's a login server bottleneck, wouldnt that affect every realm?
---
so are hunters weak compared to say, a mage or warlock in end game 60 pvp? i hear they drop off pretty steep
---
Just do what my husband did, introduce her to your mistress, named Classic.  
---
Now look at me, here on the Classic WoW Reddit with my character names reserved and can’t wait until launch.
---
For a lot of people it is, but anyone who understands this is more than just nostalgia knows that it's also about reviving game mechanics and design philosophies that have been abandoned by modern MMO's.
---
Undead for animations, Orc for numbers.

I can assure u my life is more depressing now.
---
Just play on a low population realm? Just because there's a cap doesn't mean every server will reach that cap?
---
Hunter or warlock come to mind

Executus is already a retail server name
---
Yeah, our cities may be dirt pits and sewers.

Sure, we have serious posture issues.

And yes, our starting area does look like an irradiated death land.

But damn we do it with style.

Welcome to the horde.  Orc shaman or bust.

Blood and Thunder.
---
Why
---
Leveling is the most important time to not have layering problems though! You will never be more out in the world having organic interactions as you are while leveling
---
Yes that is referring to layering. 1 layer = 1 typical original realm.  ofcourse with multiple layers theyre gonna support more people in total on a realm.
---
What matters is the pop cap @ p2
---
This is the guy that will /spit on your corpse after killing you in STV at level 30.
---
Keep in mind that it is unknown to many people who are playing classic.  
---
After all, imagine Mankrik going back to the location of his wife to mourn her death, only to find her body moved.  Poor fellow...
---
Yep, hence the 6,000-9,000 estimate.
---
Who the fuck thinks phase 1 will last a few weeks at most? Where are you getting your info? Phase 1 will be at least 3-6 months long if not longer, everyone knows that.
---
My job is in digital marketing. I love data. This is amazing! Great research!
---
This kinda begs the question why the didn't lock it when it reached some kind of hard cap.
---
So Medium &gt; Vanilla Locked
---
Everytime I think this sub cant make me cringe any harder...
---
Than*
---
Why would he feel wrong? His statement still hasn't been proven false. We are literally still in the "You think you do" part. 70-90% of players could end up quitting a few months to a year down the line, which would be the "but you don't" portion of the quote. Start laughing at him for being "so wrong" come Aug 26 2020 if classic is still very popular.
---
There will be a queue for Broken Tooth.
---
Smash players.
---
I never really went through the math, but just assumed that in longer boss fights autoattack damage would have ended up being more than than ~25% of your damage in cat.  (Never raided on druid or rogue, so was only based on what I assumed and not any hard number crunching/parsing)
---
 You **take** the red **pill**—you stay in Azeroth, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. 
---
Remember: all I'm offering is the truth.
---
Just saying, that’s what happened to Old School Runescape. The community voted on and Jagex implemented the Grand Exchange. Plus a whole lot of other tiny features here and there to make life less tedious.
---
/u/zaxlor what is in that
---
What the fuck were they thinking naming 1 realm herod and the others trash?
---
Imagine if Blizzard saw fit to fix the one system that they didn't/couldn't refine in Classic, the disaster that is the PvP Honour System.
---
With an unhealthy amount of Battleground wins required to reach the higher ranks of 10+, it promotes every unhealthy addiction advert that has ever been made for the game. It punishes World PvP with the Dishonourable Kill system, resulting in the more infamous players being unable to participate in city raids. It has no basis of skill or ability, simply the co-ordination of a team on Voice Chat against a group of randoms who are likely either unco-ordinated or under geared, and either way totally unmatched. 
---
If by some miracle one Premade would match another an opposing Premade, one of them was almost entirely likely to simply forfeit the match and leave, because the match would often drag on too long, not result in a win, and ultimately be an honour deficit.
---
Sure, I get that raiding has and always will be the main focus of this game, and I don't except it to be different on Classic servers, but if anything needs to be changed it's this idiotic system. I want to be able to participate in Crossroads raids without sacrificing an entire week of BG farming. I want to be able to leave Battlegrounds alone for a few days and do LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE without forfeiting my next PvP rank.
---
For the love of god, PLEASE.
---
That is only the Swedes btw
---
It seems like most people are upset that names like “Death” and “Lolkilledu” are already taken. Not saying I’m the greatest name creator ever but it can’t be too hard to think of something that’s not taken on another server
---
Also requires training prot skills every once in a while, lol
---
It's crazy how it snowballs- word of mouth says X is best server, pop skyrockets, folks still make new toons on X, pop stays outrageous, new players see a high pop and know instinctively that's where the action is, and so on.
---
A majority of gold is made through trash drops, sure, but that means running and vendoring it all the time. Unless you get lucky on bag drops you're going to be spending more time running to town than it's worth, mix questing in with it.
---
Rage generation is based off DPS, you can get more rage slower or less rage faster. Faster weapons still get slightly more rage per second due to Unbridled Wrath
---
They had their chance dawg :\^)
---
The mistake youre making is assuming most hardcore/non-toursts are name reserving players. 
---
Theres a fuckton more from people who havent done that, that will join in. And we're already on 2 FULL(1 of which being so full its borderline exploding) and 1 on medium (gehennas). 
---
There's legit 0 worry that Gehennas would be a dying or empty server when you factor that in. 
---
The real worry is rather what happens to the 4th or 5th realm if theyre deployed POST-launch. Thats a bit more iffy.
---
But these 3 pre-launch? Theyre more or less guaranteed to thrive tbh.
---
Heroic strike becomes MORE rage efficient when using a fast weapon. It also lets you dump your rage faster if you need to. Nobody uses Slam while dual wielding. Cleave is a tossup.
---
Players fault for getting a hardon for herod. We have other servers.
---
Blursed
---
omfg epic
---
This seems reasonable. Will be interesting to see how high we go.
---
Ok? 
---
I'm not saying your calculations on that are wrong. I'm saying I'd like to see the DPS numbers for 'average' players, not players executing perfectly with maximum consumables.
---
Do what you'll love doing. My Hunter is going to be a farming alt and honestly, there are better professions it could have, but it's going to be a Leatherworker because I honestly find the profession so goddamn relaxing.
---
Yeah, it's not optimal to have your main be an alchemist when it could be an engineer. But fuck the system, man. I'm gonna do what I love.
---
How many people are going to be on the realms if there is going to be 10k queues lol
---
https://i.imgur.com/wP3y1SO.png
---
Stalagg is the only PVP server left that isn't at least "high" pop.
---
We simply need more servers.
---
and an Undead warrior stomping all over plebs is as ice cold as it gets.
---
Well all my friends and their friends have managed to choose the same server now, switching would be almost impossible as it's quite a big network of people.
---
Fixed the live/updated version in the comments. Too bad the original from the post can't be updated.
---
I’m playing a human warlock on Grobbulus. My Warlock doesn’t care for the factions and only works with the alliance when it benefits him.
---
So gameplay wise I will practice ‘self defense’ I won’t bother other players, but will defend myself.
---
This obviously isn't American unless they are boomers with retirement
---
It's not that bad.  You literally announce on your guild discord to sign up on a different server.  Done.
---
Daggers were useful prior to rage normalization where  previously you got x rage per hit and so an offhand fast dagger would generate more rage to use a big slow mainhand. Once it was normalized slow weapons became the effective in general.
---
Thex is only in BfA
---
Idk, I truly don't see how people don't have at least an hour a day to play if they aren't in the military or have a travel related job.
---
 I have about 2 hours to play each night, and that includes time playing with kids, spent with wife, and work (which is a minimum of 8 hours, usually 10+). If I had a regular job instead of managing/running a company, I could probably get 3-4 hours a night while still spending time with kids/wife and getting everything else done.
---
Just **Majordomo** Executus left. They could also go for more names like Golemagg (**Magmadar**, **Garr**) or the molten snake from BRD, Ambassador **Flamelash**. On that note, Fire Elementals from BRD: Lord **Roccor**, **Bael'gar**, Lord **Incendius**, and **Magmus**.
---
Overwatch reminds me on a consistent basis that people are dumb af. The average rank is low-Plat and people there are kind of stupid imo. 
---
Get pushed off the edge by a Lucio 4 times in a row yet they still go on the edge you can get pushed. Enemy sniper is consistently popping heads and people still run out without thinking..
---
That whole “the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over expecting different results” would suggest the OW playerbase is 99% insane.
---
To be fair if you're going to dismiss my concern because it's anecdotal, your feelings are just as anecdotal.  
---
And in my experience even a high (regular) population server was dead at night. You certainly weren't reliably finding Scholomance/Stratholme groups at 4-5am in the morning so I'm aiming for a bit more alive than what was considered "high" at the time.
---
See alliance, charge alliance, execute alliance.
---
I know several guilds from my old server, my old ally guild on a p server, and some RL friends rolling there. Going to be hard to convince everyone to move, especially when sp many people think I any realm that isn't retarded over populated will be dead soon.
---
That’s me!
---
GrobMob is miles ahead in the meme war
---
The ad campaign started before the name registration.
---
Maybe the most interesting part of the entire post(at least the US version) is Blizz saying that population size won’t change their plans for layering. It’s going away regardless.
---
Source???
---
Yup. Running to Menethil Harbour it's faster to just jump down the dam in loch modan, release and ress at the spirit healer than running down the mountain path. Just to name and example.
---
Can't wait to roll need on a Kang when it drops in Uldaman
---
Red= dead. The only reason I wont attack a druid is because it will result in a 30 mins fight with one person running away.
---
Completely different, spamming languages that are not the official on a server is harmful to other players. Imagine someone spamming random shit in Russian on trade which you or I or most of the server obviously can't read and understand it's just useless spam.
---
As I said before, I'm not a native english speaker and I don't spam my native language in public channels that probably about less than 1% of the server will understand because I'm not a retarded asshole. Anyone that does that deserves to be reported.
---
Wow that's so cool! Great how people are coming together for this, just like old times!
---
Hell it doesn't even need to be loot council to  mess things up. The first raiding group I ran with had planned to give their first TF to their warrior that had been there the longest. The only real problem was that he already had the hand of Rag &gt;.&gt;
---
Thalnos
---
Those are the first MC clears on the server. So yes, they kinda have to be.
---
Those are sounds not names
---
Now you're moving the goalposts from "no idea people"
---
to
---
"well the idea people's ideas sucked anyway" 
---
&gt; The proof is in the pudding. 
---
The proof ***is*** in the pudding world of warcraft is the longest lived, most profitable, highest populated mmo ever. You and everyone on this forum are literally going to pay retail subscription price for a game that came out 15 years ago. 
---
WoW Classic isn't a mea culpa by blizzard "that they screwed up" they're going to laugh all the way to the bank as people rabidly sub and play a game that they released a decade and a half ago where the biggest selling point is that they haven't changed anything. 
---
WoW has always been about having something for everyone, wow classic is just an extension of that core pillar of the game.
---
Yea that's definitely reasonable. I was just kinda poking fun at the reasoning being BC is "reliving the past"  when we are certainly already doing that with vanilla.  I liked BC, stopped during wrath.  No strong opinions here
---
And here I am in EU not giving a shit either way.
---
Man, I wish I'd be playing on US servers, this would be a no-brainer.
---
And then the 4th server will be in this exact same position.
---
I see your side of it.  I really do.  Both of us are excited for Classic Wow, but it would seem for very different reasons and it would seem we both have different expectations.
---
There's nothing wrong with your expectations, or mine.  But don't make the mistake of knowing the reasons why Blizzard is, opening up/releasing, Classic WoW beyond what they've publicly stated. 
---
As per u/Healingproof comment, it would seem that Blizzard is considering, and/or, planning to release additional servers per expansion, so that those who want to, can take their character out of Vanilla, and into the next expansion.  I'd be excited about that.  I get what I want, you get to keep what you want.  Everyone's happy.
---
I'll try and find the source too! Always good to be skeptical.
---
yes Medium (Classic With Layers) &gt; Vanilla (FULL)
---
But Does
---
Medium (Classic after layers) &gt; Vanilla (FULL)
---
or will
---
Full (Classic after layers) = Vanilla (FULL)
---
"Do you know where Mankrik's wife is?"
---
"Yes but not right now."
---
And I think it's also fair to say that the people who did that are a small fraction of the classic wow player base.
---
facts
---
Its always been discouraged, it doesn't mean a large majority of players don't use these types of services lol.
---
Every single friend/ family member I know has a memory of buying gold or a leveling service for WoW.
---
I'm not saying that it's okay to do this, but just because Blizzard doesn't do it doesn't mean people never did it.
---
Me too :P
---
Well, I made a character on 3 different servers though I will only play on one. Meaning I'm messing with the server pop numbers if they are only going on name reservations. I assume a lot of people did the same.
---
EDIT - Picture of them glowing in the dark

---
That’s only the case in PvE. Hunters are the hardest counter in the entire game to mages and will destroy them at any gear level, though mages do have more utility and are a stronger class overall imo. 
---
But on the other hand warlocks are very good at 1v1 and can kill hunters easily, but overall I think hunter is a lot stronger class. More utility.
---
Completely agree with you. Reddit is full of people who hate tattoos.
---
Let people "pimp" themselves with whatever they want. If they get it on their body it's obviously something they like. Tattoos are getting more and more popular all the time(that's a fact, whether you like it or not) and if people get tattoos of things they like, isn't that a good thing?
---
A lot of people are stuck in the mindset that "tattoos mean you're a criminal and don't have a job"(especially among Americans, you which are a majority on reddit) when in fact a lot of people have "meaningless" that doesn't affect their professional life at all. In fact, in many countries, employers don't give a shit if you have a tattoo on your bicep dipecting something you love with or not. 
---
That's just reddit for you, outside of the tattoo subs or the progressive subs people will hate on them. They're stuck in the last century. 
---
I already know what responses I'll get from this comment so I'll just block it now.
---
Well that's true
---
Post says server....you interpreted as layer.
---
You dumb?
---
Mankrik's wife now, LFG tomorrow.
---
No changes.
---
Keeping in mind that a server's pop, in 2006, was about 3k, as I've been told. 
---
So low pop would ressemble classic wow pop the most, I'm guessing medium is about 5k people online at the same time, high pop would mean 8k-9k people online and maybe a Q during prime times or events. I think Full means that there will always be a Q to log in, since the server pop cap will be 10k. 
---
If people don't reroll, Herod is going to look like an overpopulated New-York.
---
I think it’s still based on interpretation, I doubt they would only allow 9,000 with layering and then once they disable layering that cap becomes 3,000.
---
Props to him! She just has zero interest in video games on pc.
---
Mark* Kern
---
But does that make it the end point?
---
I'm just kinda poking fun that it's all reliving the past, BC or not lol
---
I know a bunch of very hardcore players who're switching there just so they don't fall behind due to long queue times every time they login for the first month or two.
---
Driving on public roads is the only reminder I ever need.
---
because of layers
---
do what germans do best. invade france
---
this is kinda cringe.. the chad herod realm frowns upon you
---
for wow realms that has also always been the right answer. the most crowded servers were the best experiences.
---
Lower Blackrock Spire is also technically 10-man, as it's the same instance as UBRS. Have to be in a 5 man to do the quests though.
---
My sister and I two manned dungeons as hunter and shaman back in the day, so warlock and shaman is probably a good bet for that.
---
I chose Whitemane, west coast player as well. Might reroll on Fairbanks though depending on queue times
---
I mean they spent $7.50 just to reserve the name early.
---
people have decided where they wanna go already, and it's a pain in the ass to try and get your friends (and their friends) to switch. they fucked it up by only having 2 (lol) servers initially
---
Queues definitely still suck, I agree. The real solution would be to not have a huge tourist dropoff, but unfortunately we can't force everyone who comes by to love this game as much as we do 😔
---
Good to clarify this, all the comments about gear dependency, falling off compared to other classes etc, are true. But all relate to DPS in a raid environment. 
---
A hunter can still put out enough burst to pop cloth and leather users and will whittle heavier armoured classes down quickly while they kite.
---
Watch some old pvp videos, during naxx almost all classes can kill each other in 1-2 shots. An aimed shot can crit for upwards of 3-3.5k killing mages instantly.
---
Jesus buddy lemme help you out, its an undead mage, dude was a living human before he died n now hes prolly called something like Jibbers or Finkleton. Like what fucking zombies name is off jesus christ
---
If Stalagg had been an option from day 1 this would have never happened.
---
Let us be real here. They are both going to be a shit show.
---
I'm aware. Blizzard should enforce these rules and people using these services shouldn't be this stupid.
---
is the lua api going to be the same as in actual vanilla?
---
Nice. I’m Nocturnalx on Herod, Nocturnal on Stalagg.
---
Grob takes all that takes his goo
---
At this rate I believe everyone is gonna have queue times.  Wait until all the folks on the super full realms stare at a 3 hour queue and decide the come test the fair waters and shorter queue of Fairbanks.  It won’t stay short long.
---
delet this
---
Blizzard has had no clue what their customers want for a long time now. Which is quite apparent with the lack of interest in BFA and huge interest in Classic.
---
Obsessed
---
As real fan would have peons carrying each icon.
---
Give the man a break, everyone knows what he said, and yet roughly a year later he had the balls to stand out on the podium and tell us it's coming. I'm sure he could have passed it down to someone else if he wanted to and act like nothing happened.
---
Also, sometimes blizz should know better, look where listening to the community brough us *cough\*bfa\*cough*
---
That a gem xd
---
I wonder if streamers will abandon Herod. Not good for a stream to be sitting around in an hour long queue.
---
Our first MC run.
---
We facerolled through the instance on first day and the when we reached Ragnaros, our guild leader said that we wouldn't try him, since we were lacking in gear (most of us didn't have a single epic).
---
So, after a lot of people still wanting to try it to at least learn the encounter he said that the raid is over, but whoever wants to stay can stay and we will do an attempt.
---
Almost half the raid group left and we got him down to 5% hp on first try!
---
Next day we wiped the floor with him :P
---
The biggest reason those players are not switching is because name reservations opened when there were no options for East Coast PvP. Obviously people didn't want to play with streamers, clearly they didn't want to be with the Spanish/Latin/BR communities either. That left one option. 
---
So players got their names, Blizz semi-stealth launched a new server in the middle of the day, and players now have to convince entire guilds to switch that might not even get the names they snagged on Herod. Naturally it's now an uphill battle to force players away from a server they were initially cornered into.
---
Luckily l have no guild affiliation and my names were still available on Stalagg, but plenty of others that are "stuck" on Herod don't have those luxuries.
---
I guess it depends on how its implemented.
---
good to know lol I've spent a lot of time playing with them in dota...
---
Hell yeah I'll be honoring the code.  No Changes means NO CHANGES.
---
Fairbanks for life.
---
My interpretation: They increased server pops so not as many servers. They anticipate a huge drop of players by the time phase two rolls around. If they had more servers, in their thinking, we'd just have a bunch of low pop servers.
---
why do u say hunters are stronger class in pvp then locks if locks can kill em easy? 
---
do hunters have any bad matchups?
---
You sure have taken all of these tongue-in-cheek comments very seriously.
---
Ye, what he said!
---
Not for the whole dungeon. For one boss? Sure, it's not that uncommon. People would ML Rend so often, and like any boss who drops a flask recipe it is worth doing on.
---
My UD mages name is innocuous
---
Blizzard tried to solve this with death knights in world
---
Dad?
---
Thalnos.  BR and French Canadian.
---
Yeah am I will be, but at 60 having to raid heal , I can't stay dps spec for that unfortunately ... At this point, it will be cheaper overall to make a grinding alt with like tailoring/herbalism or something to feed the main's alchy/enchanting ... Most of the important materials are now if I remember correctly
---
It’s not ridiculous at all, I just said the exact same thing to my husband.  
---
It’s only fair, I mean people did pay for their subscription two weeks early in order to get their names.
---
Retail Vanilla Resto Druid here...**. here is the secret sauce.....**
---
Level up Herbalsm/ Tailoring from 1-60.  Send all the herbs to a bank alt for later. Level up tailoring as you go and use excess cloth for 1st aid.  Why do you want Tailoring, because the pre-raid druid Bis consists of both Leather pieces and Cloth pieces. What you want to do is make all the cloth pieces at 60 that are pre-raid bis (which will take time as you need to make mooncloth. Use this time to stay in feral and get Ony attunement done + any other damage heavy quests). 
---
Why do we pick Tailoring over leatherworking you ask? It's easier to buy the belt (corehound belt) and cape (hide of the wild) you need from LW on the AH as most other pallies, shamens, and druids need those items too. The cloth are the expensive ones because of the mooncloth.  
---
After you have the Cloth items you drop Tailoring and pick up Alch. Send all the herbs you collected back to the main and power level it up.
---
Alchemy is superior for raid healing as it will allow you to farm for gold and make all the consumables you need. Further saving you money when BWL/AQ40/Naxx rolls around.  
---
Here is the BiS list:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#) 
---
Swedes and smart btw
---
Thus the LOL at the end
---
How is this retarded? Me and all of my friends are either giving up our name reservations or stuck on Herod because of the stupidly short notice on Stalagg being available. And they had so few viable choices for PvP servers to begin with that this was bound to happen.
---
Honestly its more that people care too much about server timezones. I'm EST and I've played on PST throughout my wow career and found that most of the players there are CST or EST, because that's where most of the people in the US are. A majority of the guilds were always recruiting with raid times that worked for EST/CST players.
---
There isn't generally enough food to keep a pet fed just from killing all the time, also if you feed your meat to the pet you are selling it to vendor, that's lost money.
---
Hunters only bad matchup is locks imo. 
---
Spriest can be hard , but they’re much easier to just mana drain and kite. 
---
Locks only main CC is fear and a lot of classes can get out of it easily. Especially the case if you’re wanting to roll alliance warlock. Tremor + undead racial lol
---
Hello fellow Executee
---
Stalagg is really the way to go...less Q times and less Pserver try hard min maxxers... I think Stalagg will be the best vanilla experience honestly
---
Yep, I’m just talking about the current count though.
---
Also don’t forget there’s a large population of BFA players that reserved names which will essentially be tourists jacking the current numbers.
---
*20 or 40
---
lol you just one shape shift to break a 16s CD spell. it's a non issue.
---
&gt; Grenades, tidal, CS
---
you can move while CSd. which makes so that the mage won't be able to hit cone of cold right after the frostbolt. grenade breaks nova which cancels shatter. tidal? yeah cause everyone has it.
---
but then again, equal gear and skill the druid will also have that stuff. and frost reflector. you don't even need travel form, bear/cat/chicken is more than enough.
---
mage can't kite forever if the target is close, CoC is the only insta slow, and between shape-shifting, cat sprint, bear charge and all the other gadgets you mentioned the druid will be close.
---
mage can't sheep a druid, that's the key problem on the matchup.
---
The type of shit people obsess over in this sub is absolutely fucking insane.
---
You can lead a man to water, but you can't make him drink, eh?
---
Somebody said mobinfo2
---
Yes, if fits the internal systems of the game, but I still didn't like it as a part of an MMO.
---
At this point every realm is neither underrated nor overrated, they are all rated.
---
I'm torn on this. We keep forgetting active retail players, who honestly might be the biggest group of tourists, could reserve names for free. Compare that to players who are waiting to subscribe solely for Classic. This thing feels hard to predict.
---
As a warlock I will gladly make the trip to the dungeon so that you dont have to, that will be 2 gold.
---
He probably meant herod
---
Important quote:
---
&gt; While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. (...)
---
&gt; Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.
---
As a druid, you need to find your own *balance* between what you think is fun, and how much of a tryhard you want to be.  Only you know this answer.
---
Tank heals all good for 5 man's
---
I just want to know how long phase 1 will last.  Are we gonna have to put up with layering for the first 3 months of classic?
---
Wow, that's taken some work.
---
Here's the Herod propaganda video.
---
https://youtu.be/zB8xHFoh7rw
---
Some jackwagon took both of my names.
---
They stated in interviews already.
---
I went from being a Classic Skeptic, to a Classic whatever, to Classic Amazing, to Retail Unplayable, as did a couple of my friends in my circle. Classic bloomed all of Retails flaws into focus and now we hate it.
---
It is the same shit every time something new comes out. I am super hyped for Classic but people need to be realistic and at the moment, most aren't sadly. A LOT of players will quit very soon after launch.
---
It happens on the private servers and I would say most people are polite about it. The only thing I hate is when you are referred to as your class or role which is a bit rude.
---
&gt; The subtext there is that they know a very large amount of people who never experienced the original game are not going to stick with it through Phase 2 and they're only concerned about the first week or so of launch times.
---
Which is the reason for the low server count and the very much necessary addition of layering, I don't get why this is so hard for some people to understand.
---
Lmfaooooo this was a good one
---
If they hadn't been greedy, and had released Stalagg from the start, the population wouldn't have been spread so unevenly. And now people feel stuck on Herod, because there was NO warning for name reservation on Stalagg.
---
I resubbed after 10 years just to get my names... they expect me to move now.  Not likely that I'll delete my names so I can be leetzorzxzxz on another server at this point with all the names taken.
---
Nope, and there wont be.
---
Getting away from rogue is pretty much impossible if he has sprint ready. You're just going to die. You won't kite a druid. Shamans can easily keep in your deadzone.
---
If you get the ranged opener, you can kill almost anyone, but once they are in melee, it's pretty much up to rng on rooting them etc.
---
I literally don't know where Mankirk's wife is, and I played horde back in 2005.
---
You have now been KIDNAPPED by the GROB MOB.
---
No open beta, the closed beta ends today. Less than 2 weeks til launch.
---
What concers did you have?
---
i really enjoy wow, i have spent years of my life playing it, made life long friends. im not gonna drop it cause the devs are monkeys, and instead i try to enjoy it by hanging out with my friends.
---
Yup I remember gearing my shaman for heroics and naxx, finding other fellow 80s in trade chat and /whisper to chain run dungeons
---
Uh, no, the 8th class is druid (you know, the class this post is supposed to be about?), the one with faerie fire and bearform, and the one class a rogue can't sprint away from.
---
The easiest option would be to offer extra name reservation slots for people who have 3 characters on super-full servers like Herod, Shazz, and Whitemane.  But the new slots would have to be on lower population servers.  
---
That would probably help, if nothing else.
---
wanna roll on grob but probably won't because some turbonerd can basically force you to change your name if it doesn't fit their notion of RP.
---
For instance people were joking about the name undeddie or some other bs based on eddie from maiden. Seems fine to me, since it is generic enough to mean anything or nothing. That person could have a great reason for it. But if someone reports it, their just fucked (zero ability to defend it) and have to deal with it.
---
Join the GrobMob, nerds
---
I'm not saying I wouldn't play. I'm still going to play haha.
---
I'm not switching realms at the moment, though.
---
/1 LF3 DPS
---
= instant full group any time you want to run a dungeon
---
Nost at peak had 13k players so how the are people getting 200k and all this crazy high numbers? Honest question
---
Hunters are quite good when everybody is leveling and right when people hit 60. They do get a little worse for damage in PvP as everybody else gets gear. I wouldn't say they drop off in end game PvP, but the play style does shift a bit to more control and support. 
---
Another thing about classic PvP, is that the gear won't ever get upgraded (as far as we know). So ranking will sort of peak at phase 3-4 and PvP will shift to a more casual, for fun, thing to do. Naxx gear is just way better for certain classes.
---
Right here buddy.
---
You read that wrong. The QUEUE ITSELF will be 10000 players... Which means it's at least 10k + server cap.
---
I've always loved Gnomes.
---
Gnomes have the best emotes. Especially /train. Whenever you kill a Horde, spam /train over their body and watch their head explode.
---
Gnomes fit into small places that other races can't go. I remember in Arathi Highlands, the Horde town of Hammerfall has an inn that's up on stilts. As a Gnome, I could fit under it while none of the Horde could. I would pop out, kill a Horde, and run back under the inn. Eventually there was a group of about 10 Horde trying every method to get me out, but there was nothing they could do :)
---
Gnome racial is really good. A ton of classes have slows and roots. Racial just quickly removes them. And it has a very short cooldown too.
---
Also, in Classic your gear will look bad no matter what race you play. Because unless your a Hunter, Rogue, or Prot Warrior, you don't your awesome raid set, you use a hodgepodge of various off-set pieces that have clashing colors and styles. So in that regard Gnome is a benefit since you won't be able to see how bad your gear really looks.
---
Classic is 10 days away.. what do you expect people to post right now?
---
20ms Ping can affect spell batching? If it batches every 200ms and I cast a spell with 20ms paing at 170ms into a batch, it'll be included. If I had 50+ ms, it would be in the next batch 200ms later.  
---
It's very small, but even 1ms ping difference could mean a different spell batch if it lined up just right.
---
I totally feel this post, and I've been gone from wow long enough that i don't even *have* any old friends to get in touch with. Now I'm starting with my first timer gf and trying to figure out how to find a decent, mature guild has been kind of stressing me out.
---
Was my first profession in vanilla, and boy did I hate it. I couldn't sell anything reliably while leveling up, and figured with only two classes wearing leather it was a lost cause.
---
What I learned later is that you have to get more creative. The trick is to find stuff you can make cheaply enough to be profitable to disenchant for mats, and to learn the devilsaur recipes. Also, to realize DPS warriors are a huge market you don't always expect.
---
Raw leather ends up being dirt cheap since everyone takes skinning, so it's definitely possible to make a decent margin even without a guaranteed money maker like mooncloth or arcanite transmutes.
---
No arena. Only battlegrounds and they're coming in a later phase. The honour system is also deeply unfair to casual players and requires a great deal of dedication to reach the higher PvP ranks.
---
For eastern time? One with a potential language barrier and the other is a streamer server (and more importantly their followers). Herod was the only choice to avoid those scenarios.
---
If you zoom out and scan this thread again you'll see the highlighted point that people reserving names this early most likely do care about their name.
---
Given that, any new servers have to be announced with sufficient lead time to get entire guilds swapped over, which means more than a few hours for them to discuss it and make plans to switch simultaneously.
---
Announcing a few hours before the launch of the server greatly decreases the population that will be able to plan together and take the risk of attempting the switch.
---
Herod is the servers the ‘no streamers, reeee’ crowd are going to right? Seems like they need to rethink a bit. Lol
---
Or just quote it in 5 seconds? Except you can't because that's not what the post said.
---
Can't help you with a link - but you're not delusional, one of the og vanilla devs did say that.
---
Wow your guild was a bunch of douche nozzles. I hope you find a guild that appreciates you
---
We already knew this though.
---
Private servers were actually more accurate in that regard as they also used pre-1.10 item values.
---
This one is lost on the kids today. I'm glad to be with my people again.
---
original music, animation \*and\* art. insane how dedicated these people are :)
---
I haven't reserved my name neither had my sister and her fiance. So, three more for Fairbanks.
---
You went from classic wow to fortnight? You are a heretic.
---
ok thx mate.
---
I'm the idiot who never recognized there were were two box variants.
---
Just pick a good name? Does not seem like that big of a issue at all. That name would be okay anyways
---
Aye, it's a sight to behold, gives great confidence in that they're doing things right.
---
haha
---
vanillafriends.com
---
lol and he's giving everyone a full week off from work to go play a video game. what a load
---
Wait.. where is my anecdotal and "feels" arguments? Im referencing the info we have in terms of server pops and some very obvious things such as a majority of players will be players who havent reserved names etc?
---
As for a server being "dead" because its hard to find groups for things that take a few hours at 4-5am.. idk if thats an indicator of a dead server. Thats just life committments prohibiting, what, 95%?, players from doing such and lowering your chances naturally.
---
The point is that I like choice, and I like specialization.
---
If you fully commit yourself to one aspect of life, you won't be as proficient in others. Having strengths and weaknesses that others can supplement is what makes teamplay fun to me.
---
Picking a class in an RPG should be a very meaningful choice, which is basically your character's identity - that identity is diluted when you can technically do no more and no less than everyone else.
---
Listen....

What patch do we get meeting stones summons? That was a vanilla thing right?
---
I went to see him Wednesday! I was about two rows in, and it's now my favorite concert.
---
Have to also remember that they advertised BFA online and possibly television ads if i'm not wrong. I'm not sure if classic has had much advertisement so that's actually awesome
---
World pvp, even got netflix and second screen to pass the time while ppl camp my corps now.
---
It takes a part of you
---
As I mention in a different post, I think the best bet would be to open up 1 or 2 more PvP servers and announce it several days beforehand.  
---
Then, Bliz should give people with reservations on full servers extra character slots, but only on these new servers.  That way people can still have a chance to get their names reserved, and if the queues end up being insane on Herod/Whitemane/Shazz, then they can jump ship on launch day to the other servers.
---
It'd be great if they thought about gamers that much but the Promo is because it's going to be the first week of NFL football.
---
AV and Warsong and honor system in P3, AB in P4
---
Well, we're all insane.  😀
---
Yeah, server population in-game is one thing... But you need to reach in-game first, and that means a long ass queue time.
---

---
going from mulgore/thunder bluff to barrens general chat was a huge difference. the tauren area was almost always super friendly and the barrens was pretty obnoxious most of the time
---
The realm sizes are already altered compared to retail vanilla. Hence layering being added.
---
Cosplay of thrall's butthole by me
---
There have been massive discussions daily about m+ balance (or lack therof), people constantly complaining because content is getting delayed (if you count skins as content I guess), and a whole lot more before 8.2 and the essences dropped. You are seeing what you want to see.
---
I'm right here, on layer 59.
---
Garrison techw was clearly unpolished. Sub numbers rushed back to 10 million on release and every garrison meant occupied space on the instance servers. Additionally, the servers got DDOSd pretty hard on release.
---
All that caused the fucked up launch WoD had.
---
Nah I don't want to be hindered by a shitty ruleset
---
I played on Arthas against Pat.  I remember him being late to leveling to 70 in TBC.  He posted on the forums that he was going to be leveling in Nagrand at a specified day and time and to come visit.  I remember flying out there and seeing Pat at like level 66 with 7 healers and full buffs/consumables.  We did manage to group up and kill him a few times, but it was hilarious.
---
Doh!
---
I will make sure to fix for tomorrow :)
---
Definitely! Thank you. Wading through meme humor to find discussion is frustrating. I like both, but the former tends to overwhelm the latter here on reddit, so separating them out would be nice
---
the real fear is not everybody reserved names yet me and the boss has but nobody else O.O out of the other 10 people who planing to play classic from work is utterly terrifying to say the least.
---
is this true? can you link a source? as if NEs needed any additional reason not to be played
---
I have faith in blizzard and the hundreds of employees that have working on this

Barely PvP if you’re level 50 killing some 30’s man. Basically just being a dick

yeah, it was a boneheaded move

It's the same situation for Shazzrah on EU(which has basically 0 streamers), this has nothing to with being or not being a streamer server
---
Damn thanks!
---
Ah yes the classic "can we not be like *insert sub here*". People make these kinds of posts because they see change because when a sub grows more popular it inherently changes and then the sub becomes exactly what people don't want it to be. It's inevitable as subs grows and there nothing that can be done about it. 
---
The mods can say "we'll keep an eye on it" but it always ends up the same. Enjoy what memes and shitposts being posted now because soon it'll all change to the same old same old.

With the new post about server pops, they need to lock Herod asap, imo.

Rank 14 weapons just weren’t nearly as strong for casters as they were for melee.  It was very common for casters to stop at R13.  The difference between R13 and R14 grind is pretty significant, usually another 2-3 weeks from my understanding.

Meh. Open another PvP realm, then. I was 10 minutes late to Gehennas and my name was taken, even though I easily got it on Shazzrah and Golemagg and on every private server ever. We know you're gonna have to open more realms anyway, you should have done it sooner to avoid this chaos.
---
It's a tough wait. I guess it's what kids waiting for Santa must feel? 
---
 Browsing this reddit and official forum lots of times per day like some madman. Not much else to do when game is not available and you want to get your fix. :P
---
Plans change, so more confirmation is always welcome, I guess that's what they're trying to say.
---
The best estimates we have from number of layers and numbers per layer that have been mentioned have population caps right now at around 33k with full layers. That means 43k total right now reserved on Herod assuming their queue number is based on everyone being online at launch. Already if 75% of that population left it would still be almost 11k when dropped to one layer. We don’t know how much they are willing to put in one layer at that time but any sane person would guess that their max pops right now are based on getting everyone online in one layer in the future.
---
I hope you can see where I’m going with this, but Herod is already going to be a mega server. They just don’t want to have a mega server with 5000+ queues.
---
Amazing reply dude seriously enjoyed reading this
---
And yet my friend still says "Herod will be the best I want THE MOST populated server for the true vanilla experience"
---
I ain't going with them especially being on PST. Nope to that
---
Part of the game. 
---
It is not pve if you’re level 50 doing SFK? Pretty sure that’s still called pve.
---
Gib me milkers
---
Whaaaaaaat? Nooooooo. That was... totally some other dude. But I hear he's awesome.
---
Well I wish you the best of luck my dude.
---
holy shit this actually works, thanks
---
Only if you're ok with spamming one button like the world's lamest disco.
---
Looking good my man, very expressive keep at it
---
It doesn't matter if it took 10 years or 10 days, they literally prioritize different things now to what they did originally.
---
You are fine. Feral tanking is pretty easy, since you only use maul and swipe and even have higher threat generation than warriors until BWL iirc. For leveling you both can just skill for DPS talents. Dedicated tank or healing specs aren't really required until 60 or the early 50s at the earliest.
---
Consistency is very much an issue. I admit I've fucked around a bit just to see what flies.
---
All the old VeCo folks know that old addage that VeCo is 4 fite.  And now.... GROB IS 4 FITE!
---
Then they should  not be complaining of massive waits now is there chance to move.
---
&gt; but I've never actually seen it happen in 4 years of private servers.
---
It happened to me therefore it happened
---
yep, still a risk, names are important on in classic, hence blizzard opening the name grab thing. GMs are doing a job, they want to close tickets and depending who you get they might not care how it gets closed.
---
Well fuck I better sub early and create a char
---
Cue?
---
"Dead" yea, sure.....
---
I mean it did back in the day for you, unless youve never played before
---
yeah no kidding.
---
You talk like you've forgotten that retail used to be classic.
---
Retail added group finder because *classic players* asked for it. And at the time, they *wanted* it. They *begged* for it. Once it was added, people were praising Blizzard. It was a great idea.
---
Nobody knows what the game will look like after a couple thousand 'great ideas'.
---
Or you could use the post that’s already made for things like this that thousands have already used.
---
A REALM FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE
---
but they are doing wrong think and it cannot be allowed
---
Am I the only one who thought it was "Mankirk" not "Mankrik"? 
---
Feel like I've missed a golden opportunity to reserve the name "Krikman" on "Mankrik"...
---
"Let's talk about that offline"
---
Why did you quote that in your response?
---
imo Wotlk started making it casual and easy and was the first step down. The content itself (theme and zones) were nice tho. I'd also prefer the balance Wotlk had.
---
I hated most of the east coast ones but I'm starting to like Pagle
---
How about one on both
---
Don't know what the hell that quote has to do with anything here.
---
This, but thinking about paladin to warrior.
---
Its weird i really like healing, but still feel towards to warrior. So now im unsure again
---
Is the midwest data center in chicongo?
---
I can see a 10+ hour que happening and the people logged in will use macro-programs to avoid the afk-kick timer making things worse.
---
Heed their warning Herod players. It's not fun being hyped up and unable to play.
---
Enjoy the queue
---
Ok daddy
---
so how long will it be until that comes out?
---
We have already done this multiple times. So if you didn’t go looking for those posts, why do you think yours will be of any more use? And we have a website for it. Www.vanillafriends.com
---
Thank you for your valuable and concise contribution
---
Upvoted for "turbonerd"
---
I'm just saying, the econ isn't going to be squeaky clean regardless of what blizz does/doesn't do.
---
People will buy gold whether it's safe or not, its 100x easier now than it was back then as well. I just think it'd be easier for Blizz and us as the community to accept this and just bite the bullet for the lesser of two evils.
---
I envy you. I've always wanted to do a weekend LAN. I guess we'll just have to settle for a lot of beer/Octoberfest later down the road.
---
When is P3 and P4 coming out, estimated?
---
You need to get a poop-sock.
---
Phase 1: No BGs, No honor system or PvP rewards whatsoever.
---
Phase 2: No BGs, honor system and PvP rewards go live.
---
Phase 3+: BGs go live.
---
There are no arenas in Classic.
---
That makes it more clear, thanks. I can see that coming in handy. 
---
For pvp though, in my experience cannibalize very rarely works out due to there almost always a dot or pet on me or just some kind of damage coming in to disrupt the channel and put the whole racial on cooldown. Do you have a different experience?
---
" a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006 "
---
Fuck all those people, and there have been many of them - on this sub - who have been claiming that pve realms will be "dead". My pve realm of choice is sitting at "high" and not only that - pve realm population is usually a lot less volatile!
---
Fuck. Didn't know all the brits were rolling on shazz otherwise I would've chosen there.
---
This!! I’ll sign! It’s been a long time for me though so I’m gonna go at it and NOT look on the interwebs. Let’s see if I remember 🤓
---
Haha!
---
Exactly what I hope to avoid. I hate to turn off the general chat Channel but I guess I'll do what I have to do if I get stuck on a streamer server
---
Here is another unfair use of Shadowmeld: while you're leveling, you'll be Beast Mastery and at 40, you'll get Bestial Wrath, at which point your pet will be an absolute unit easily capable of soloing clothies around your level. So in world PVP, if you manage to sneak up on someone, send your pet at them and right before they get to the target, cast Intimiation and then Bestial Wrath and then immediately shadowmeld your character before the pet engages combat. Your pet will stun them for 3 seconds and absolutely eat their face while you're stealthed and they can't do a damn thing about it.
---
How is it lan when none of the computers will even be connected to eachother?
---
Or are LANs just the new name for gaming in the same room together?
---
Interest in BFA was pretty high, relative to the interest shown in Legion. BFA and Legion are also similar in content but the difference being that in BFA they managed to "unfun" the content that was fun in Legion.
---
Psh, even pre-30. Feline quickness and the instant root is more than enough to kite people for days.
---
In all seriousness no matter what anyone says you will play WoW. So what I suggest to you is this: Do as much work on assignments as you can when they come out. Profs in my course will assign things and then give 2 - 3 weeks to complete, but most of the time the assignment is doable within a couple days.
---
Do your work well in advanced and then you'll have all the time in the world to play whatever you want for a week or 2.
---
This is what Ive been saying to my friends and people who are vary of rolling on a "low" or "medium" server. Its going to be fine. Back then there were a lot more realms to choose from, and you ended up with severe population differences and skewed faction ratios. That will be less of a problem given that were cramming more people into fewer servers this time around...
---
yep it was hard to get my work, my friends, my online friends and my summer friends all on shazz it is impossible for me to move the network after months of building.
---
It's really a shame, game was fun, but the terrible engine was so rough on it.
---
do we know when phase 2 or 3 is coming.. ish
---
But seriously though, get up every 30 min or so and do a quick stretch, like 10 seconds even
---
Embolisms are no joke, especially as the average age of people playing classic is probably higher than in 2004
---
A lot of players just search wow when looking for bfa, particularly before classic became a big thing. Its interesting but not sure on your search terms. Also sites like wowhead are so well established that people know to just go there. Still probably right though. Classic, anecdotally, seems to have far more hype than bfa.
---
Lol didnt even consider that, yeah def worth a subscribe to see if he chooses to release more classic wow bits, made made happy, nostalgic, and excited to hopefully re encounter some of these experiances again!
---
/woosh
---
I never said it was particularly me but I feel a lot of people make selections in inclusion with half of those options in mind. How is anyone suppose to know what type of people are going to occupy a server if that server isn’t released. Not everyone is a Reddit mongoloid like you and myself.
---
To where? All the PvP servers are essentially full.
---
true tho :*
---
You will. The worlds are going to be really populated, and people will constantly be looking for groups for dungeons and elite quests, even if people in your guild are not right at that moment.
---
Alt + keypad numbers = free letters. 
---
Just don't use an alternate character as the first 3 or 4 letters so people can /search at least the first half of your name.
---
Stalagg is also guaranteed to be streamer free (at least the big ones) at this rate though isn't it?
---
The moon is coming to destroy Azeroth!!
---
any medium+ population (which is quoted to be higher than even the most crowded 2006 realms) server is in for some bad times once phase 2 comes around. plenty of people here played places like nostalrius' pvp server etc. where there were easily 10k+ concurrent players online at any given time of day. it was a fucking nightmare. that's what you're going to get once layering is off.
---
blizz needs to massively lower population caps and start shitting out new servers for people to play on like it's the day after a taco bell binge.
---
/jojo on
---
your next line is "but the population drop off could kill new servers!"
---
/jojo off
---
population drop off is not going to be nearly as bad as people say where it would actually make a server "dead". the vanilla population has been mobbing every server they can get their hands on for years and years. other games that do this sort of thing still have plenty healthy populations as well, especially osrs. a single server in response to 10k+ predicted queues on a singular maxed server that already has a MASSIVE capacity difference compared to what original game was designed to have is not an excuse to not add more.
---
"but they're not even switching to this new one!"  
---
and they won't until they're actually met with those insane queue times because "someone else will do it so i'll stay"
---
The latter.
---
What happens if only a few of us are currently on a full realm (herod),  but we have a number of more friends planning on joining us on launch/later on? Will they be able to play on our server or will we be split up from the start?
---
Is BC and WotLK confirmed?
---
Shame you started with "if the slope is real" instead of "the slope is real here"
---
I could of argued that you are wrong, it is infact a case of the slippery slope fallacy, so you are committing the fallacy fallacy fallacy.
---
Idiot
---
very well put together spreadsheet! can't wait to become a critchicken
---
LAKAD MATATAAAG
---
Didn't think about that, thank you
---
this place turned into /r/WoW weeks ago
---
If they’re on the same internet connection, which I’m assuming you are if you’re in the same room, that is still on the same LAN and the correct usage of the word ...
---
God damn that’s cute! Lmao i love it! I wish I had a group of friends like that
---
Any idea how relyable his run would be for other classes? I remember Joana having a few "Hunter-Only possible at lvl x" quests.
---
With layering enabled. Each layer is an authentic ~3k size. When all the layers are removed we'll be back to what it always was.
---
Thank you for your kindness, bro.
---
That link had like one BiS from tailoring?
---
How much do you want to spend? 
---
These days, you can easily build a machine that will easily run not only Classic, but BFA, at decent framerates, for a couple hundred dollars. 
---
Personally, I would never go for a C2D machine and DDR2 RAM in 2019 – that gear was revolutionary when it was new, but these days it's mostly not worth it – especially when you have to actually PAY for it. 
---
So – what's your budget? How much are you willing to spend?
---
Gank some rpers while they stroll though stv? Forced name change Inc. Stealth into mage quarter and kill people RPing? That's a 24 hour ban, next time 72. Played on ED from 2004-2007, got my name changed 3 times and one 24 hour ban for ganking rpers. That's why I'm not risking it again.
---
Enjoy your 10k+ queues then, I guess.
---
What is the next best after Dal'rends?
---
Few servers*
---
r/ZandalarTribe it is then.
---
Rename it “Best Server” and people will actually move
---
World of rogue craft wayyyy back in the day I remember liking. Ancient vanilla wow myths by now.
---
Why do you assume that? He’s actually smart with what he does. Just because blizzard has made retail shitty doesn’t mean ion gets to inherit the fault.
---
Oh I image it will be rough with 16k full immersive vr when they are at their gaming peak, will be a fucking mess to bond them to real life....
---
Ha I did this today because I couldn’t find a 11 day one yesterday
---
Which is why theyre publicly urging people to make the switch *now*. Thats not something theyve ever done before, theyre just trying to get ahead of the problem - even if it was self-inflicted.
---
Ubuntu
---
Should have gone with the RPPVP server.
---
Oh I know that, but loot is supposed to be introduced in the "phase" they were added, so added in patch 1.4 means it isn't added until content phase 2.
---
Make more, it was nice and had sweet outro music
---
1.0 attack speed does zip for you while leveling unless you're just constantly pvping casters.   It's not worth the time to camp the spawn when you could be leveling with a pet that's just as effective against mobs.
---
Not really. Each layer is essentially a server and that size is authentic to how it used to be. Slowly they will strip away all the layers until you're left with one singular layer with an authentic cap.
---
&gt; In addition
---
&gt; no cooking, no fishing
---
That's impressive! ;)
---
Ye Shits about to pop off once launch arrives and after that its gonna be very interesting and wierd to manage for blizz haha
---
Either you are bad at trolling or bad at whining for sympathy, I am not sure which. Post more so I can figure it out.
---
Lol yes that was sarcasm
---
That’s the overall gear BiS list ranking of all phases combined. If it’s on the list at all it’s considered bis or bis adjacent.
---
Yeah that sounds like login servers going down. But I agree, there's a lot of things that have gone wrong in the past with expansion releases that will happen this time too
---
Anyone knows the song name please ?
---
Get rid of the fire and its right
---
Hey now, Fairbanks is BiS realm unless you have to be EST because of your schedule. Community, discord, subreddit all seem mature and normal so far. No streamers (except Skarm, who is not really a streamer and also respected), no 4chan, no regions taking over.
---
It’ll be pretty annoying for. While, then it will calm down and be an active server.
---
That’s my hope, at least.
---
I just want to Mind Control Alliance when near cliffs and make them jump off :D giod times, good times.
---
Yep I registered 3 names for me and my best friend on Wednesday or so. Not we’re medium then. Now both are full. That will be fun :D
---
Yea, you're right, it'll be worse
---
No, not all loot.  Raids and profession loot is being added.
---
This is a good idea. I'd consider the switch if I didn't lose names.
---
both will be shit shows
---
yes.
---
Sure but at the same time Blizzard are expecting a huge amount of tourists that will quit a few months down the line. Nobody is worried about release obviously.
---
Having a huge server like Nost had a lot of benefits too. Want to find a group to run a dungeon at 2 in the morning? No problem. Enjoy world pvp? Well there's 200 people fighting in Hillsbrad right now.
---
*Laughs in oceanica*
---
art imitates life
---
Have you considered not being german?
---
This post is a bit pointless, just saw the blue post about Herod queues and Stalagg. Nevermind
---
B... but what if you buy this 1-use scroll from the cash shop that will teleport you to any dungeon of your choice?
---
I think it's awesome. I hope there will be a ony buff every 10 min in SW lol
---
I avoid it by playing RP
---
I dunno about you guys but I will be using zygors classic Levelling guide which releases on the 27th. So pumped they did a version for classic, makes levelling so much smoother!
---
 [https://twitter.com/watcherdev/status/1121853269033328641](https://twitter.com/watcherdev/status/1121853269033328641)   
---
Is what OP is referring to.  
---
No, Majordomo shouldn't have any loot until phase 2, but this was a sweeping generalization that we have been warned might have some exceptions.
---
Yes but we are getting progressive loot tables, all bosses have their loot tables as they were in 1.12 but introduced at the same time (sort of) as they were in classic so catch up gear that was introduced at the same time as AQ won't be in while we are still only raiding in MC.
---
Blizzard: "With 2 PvP servers we have more than enough server capacity."
---
Players: "You think you do, but you don't"
---
Not if they are my healer.
---
This false dichotomy brought to you by a desire for proper logic and correct thought, right?
---
Haha, fair enough! A mage can farm 20 per hour consistently in EPL though.
---
That seems like a good bet. I think if a good 40% of Herod went to Stalagg, we'd have 2 high pop servers and they would be comfortable with opening another eastern PVP ahead of release. That's just my opinion though. I'm making the move myself actually. If there's a 10k queue just to get in, that's 10k PLUS everyone who is already on the server, which sounds like a nightmare. Even if Stalagg stays the way it is - Medium - it will be just as large or even larger than a high pop server was in Vanilla. That sits right for me.
---
And that would have been the perfect time to say "you think you do but you don't".  We now have the power of hindsight, so we should use it instead of saying "all ideas that sound good = LFD".
---
And no I didn't forget that retail used to be classic.  They philosophy is completely different, though.  If you look at dev interviews from 2006 the things they say about what they want to do with the game are basically the opposite what Ion says in dev interviews now.
---
&gt; WeRe ThE *tRuE* VaNiLlA eXpErIeNcE
---
&gt; -Herod players yesterday
---
Yeah, you sure are lol
---
Should be, but Herod was the only one they firmly said they wouldn't play on.
---
Yea I took off a few days that week to play. Wednesday they Friday actually. I just assume that Tuesday will be difficult, so I’ll work most of that day.
---
Like it or not, brand name matters. Name a car model "The Slop" or something equally silly and it will effect sales.
---
Take two servers. If you don't have anyone rolling with you, both servers are EST, and you don't know what types of people are playing on either, what else is there to compare between them except name?
---
Confession time: I used to guild hop just to borrow guild vents for playing other games with non wow friends.
---
All true. LC is both the best and worst loot method.
---
It can either be super fair and you see a wide range of people getting key pieces for the largest overall boost, or the 'inner circle' gets everything and good fucking luck if you joined the guild after they formed.
---
Can I come??
---
what gear combinations produce the highest dps in a controlled (sim'ed) environment. You could even do it with different combinations rather than each piece of gear. Doesn't take player skill into account but ilvl doesnt either.
---
He is going carlina also unless he changed
---
Technically they were all up to 40 man before Blizzard added caps
---
Rly dud rly most depressing is they high when they wrote this sht!
---
Fuck old org looks so good.
---
This is what I’m thinking too. I’d take this in a heartbeat and my whole crew would as well. Names are really important here.
---
I am on that boat, not paying for game time til 24 hs before launch.
---
Aw man, this is amazing. I tempted to roll on Grob and I hate PvP.
---
Wasn't it removed shortly after as well?
---
As a priest I wonder this as well for Anathema/Benediction quest line.
---
Last i heard they are open to it if there are enough players. Not confirmed but possible.
---
No, its the opposite. It means we're more likely to have health servers once the game goes live. They'll probably also end up needing to launch more servers on or shortly after launch day as well.
---
I hope Classic logs are not saving gear or talents. It was not possible to check people's gear/talents in Vanilla so it shouldn't be possible now. Otherwise peple will pull all the Characters from WCL and make an unofficial "armory" with gearscore and other shit. Then someone will create an addon to import those into the game and here we go again.
---
How unbalanced is the Horde/Alliance ratio on Fairbanks? My friend group and I all decided to roll there, but none of us are subbing until at least the 25th. I could convince ~10 players to roll alliance if it really is that unbalanced? A healthy chunk of us want to PvP, and we would love to be on instant-queue status with battlegrounds once they are released xD
---
sounds like a wholesome post. Shoot me a invite, id love to talk
---
Thanks man, I don't even know what server to play
---
Hi, /u/Doom_elf

---
This needs to imitate the osrs sub
---
It's like in PoE where you can respec whenever you want, but it comes at a cost.
---
It's more about getting people to drop out of queue when they see how large it is on day 1.
---
We shall all be Scarlet Champions!
---
I believe it’s a form of redundancy while functioning with boe items. It’s simply a nice interface that appears when loot drops and people can use it to easily ‘trade’ the item to the player they want. In a world without need/greed the same outcomes would be achieved for boe items but not for bop.
---
Does he exercise
---
If you are saying it’s nice to have tailoring to fill out spots quickly, then yeah. But if you plan to run dungeons for real pre-raid BiS, then no.
---
Oh shoot, I just saw that you’re EU, Herod is a NA server. Best of luck tho! Once you start playing you’ll meet tons of friends, don’t worry about it too much
---
I was initially dubious about my choice of Fairbanks, but it was the only place I could get muh names.        
---
Now? I feel like I'm sitting pretty. :D
---
Uh pretty sure the max of a layer is the max a server was at the time
---
You did not get winterspring frostsaber in a weekend in tbc.
---
Streamer only lol how do you even draw that conclusion
---
It's all good man, all the best to you
---
exept south park. South park is just perfect in French. The guys doing voice over in french for south park are just killing it
---
A portuguese server would be located in Europe my friend.
---
There is an in-app split feature though...
---
You’re fine!  
---
$600 is a good price to performance point. The only thing “hard” is applying the thermal paste and I’m sure that’s getting easier. Rest is making sure the motherboard and gpu has power.  Everything has a place and you can’t really mess it up. 
---
Only real difficult part might be troubleshooting.
---
I reserved names early because I could, not because I care overly much about them. I would bet that most of the people reserving names had an active sub for retail already an reserved names because, why not? Even if retail players only test it out and plan on quitting at level 10, there's no downside.
---
It's almost as if people have been urging Blizzard to add more than 8 servers since the servers were first announced only to be told by the Pro-Layering bros that 8 is fine.
---
Hard mode:  let your guild allow any spec you want.  Fight for debuff slots or be ignorant of them.  Chase them meters ret, enhance, boomkins!
---
The casual guilds are the ones that get the greatest challenge out of this game.  Props to any that clear content this way.
---
Should be in a museum, genuinely.
---
Agreed, I used to play Holy Paladin and being out in the world was awful - respecced to Prot and it was 10x more tolerable (but still pretty slow)
---
&gt; MoP had mixed reactions
---
Y'all have bad taste. Aside from the 13 (?) months of SoO, MoP was a gem.
---
it's the best system for the hardcore progression guild. What ends up happening is the vital players who are top performers are pretty much funneled gear so that the guild can quickly progress though and clear. Eventually these players are supposed to keep coming to raid despite being nearly BiS, and gear is now re-distributed towards the rest of the raid.
---
It turns extremely lulzy when a casual guild tries to replicate this.
---
Azshara has quests... not many.. but some. Also pvp in the ruins is epic.
---
Fuck it, I’m playing a serious alt here
---
If you look at osrs you Will se players averaging more h/day played  over  period of 6 years

I worked at R5 as he was exiting. I know firsthand :\

It is definitely beyond the pale to attack another druid in Moonglade
---
You'll do nuttin
---
Get real kid, the release is only 10 days away. Stop complaining about layering; stop beating this dead horse. Layering is going to happen.
---
THERE AREN'T OTHER OPTIONS
---
There may have been options in the past, but not now.
---
You're the only one "pretending" here.
---
God, these posts get redundant. We get it, Blizzard has no idea what they are doing and are a complete mess, even though all of these complaints eventually devolve into 'oh, I guess it's not as bad as we thought'. Enjoy playing the game like everyone else regardless of your distrust and complaints.
---
It's pretty much bystander syndrome.
---
Everyone assumes everyone else will do something to help (in this case move servers)
---
Wait that was removed? Mods must be on blizzard's payroll at that point. There was absolutely nothing wrong with that thread.
---
You're right it won't be as good as I remembered it. It will be even better.
---
Because this time I'm playing on a beefy PC with graphics settings maxed out and a fast internet connection. 
---
Instead of the the feeble laptop that could barely pull 11 fps on a dial-up connection like I had in Vanilla.
---
But hey, if the Classic experience isn't your cup of tea, you can always go back to retail!
---
NO SHOES
---
Why did they let that many people register? Surely they could have had some velocity control or monitored for user counts and potential thresholds of problems and close character creation on Herod marking it as Full and leaving a note stating as such. Not the greatest CX, but it may have been better then asking the population to move post-factum. 
---
 Give it a few weeks and concurrent logins will drop and they could re-open character creation.
---
That's like your boss stating you are getting raise but it means fuck all until it's in writing. Now we can hold Blizzard accountable if layer is not removed before Phase 2.
---
Not easy, it's simpler due to lack of healing variety/power but makes it up by just being a druid; emergency tank, lots of good little things like motw, brez, innervate, thorns, faerie fire (-armor so good, especially with sunder).
---
And this is true! Probably won't get to tank in raids, unless you bring your A-game with pre-bis/consumes but you can still carry all that gear and heal with a HoTW spec...no other class can heal and then in the next fight main/off tank.
---
Ever since they rebalanced the game towards the storylines (meaning you can basically level up just doing the main and class quests), its basically become Mass Effect with MMO features sprinkled in. And it seems to have been able to keep a fairly decent (in todays MMO market) loyal playerbase.
---
Same goes for GW2 and ESO. I dont play them (only for the occasional random 2-week binge once a year), but they have managed to carve out a niche for themselves. Once they didnt become the "next big thing" and the playerbase started to dwindle, they all managed to turn it around and stabilize themselves - which is great, really. Theyre not my cup of tea, but many people get to enjoy it. So many MMOs just die out immediately, refusing to change.
---
They don't have any Central data centers....

Obviously I'm speaking about Brazilian Portuguese.

I heard it made a ton of money in asia
---
It wasn't terrible. If it were, it would not only gain in popularity over the course of its life. Surely, some will switch back and forth since it is on the same sub. Time will show.
---
Population size? Realm type?
---
When they first were released and we knew nothing about the servers except for time zones and names, you had time zones to figure it out about.
---
But, slowly, we got more information. Now, we have a lot more information to work with. Now, people can still find ways to get different names. 
---
Your argument isn't relevant to the argument since there is much more you can use to compare it to, other than just names now.
---
When did they say they weren't removing layering before phase 2?
---
Your link appears to agree with me on what spell batching is. My position is that the window is effectively too large because of current connection speeds.
---
Just [earlier this month](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjwpv9/ghetto_heirlooms/), heck even some commenters on [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7rcmuf/controversial_opinion_but_they_should_add_looms/) threat from last year were doing it.
---
Hey he might make it to 30.
---
Should do druid Hunter combo.  Have Hunter dismiss pet, have druid in guild called (hunters name)'s pet and run around while in cat form or travel form.
---
Have him go cat, you go shadow
---
That’s not what I heard here.
---
But it did sound like they wouldnt cap servers to 3-4k or whatever in this interview, which seems to be different than what they just said in their last post about server pop... i’m confused
---
Imagine believing in reality.
---
Agreed. I think Blizzard is still significantly underestimating how many servers are needed.
---
Just don’t click that shadowform button while raiding - how will they know? :P
---
There will be a ton more people creating toons once its live. The final spread will be fine, its only people who are 100% set on a particular name that might have issues.
---
that's not the point... by cross realm play he means in open worlds and in interactions between players (trades).... instance content with people your never going to leave with after and you cant really interact with when your together isn't really cross-realm play
---
Is Chromie is classic?
---
We require more vespene gas
---
That’s pretty much what happened. It was either play with streamers and Brazilians, play with Latin American / Spanish speakers, or play with non streamer English speakers
---
Assuming you are still young you can probably function on less sleep. Do that for a little while until you get bored. If you have any random classes that you don’t have to take this semester see if you can drop them and take them next semester without it costing more money. This might be possible if your semester hasn’t started yet. By the end of semester the desire to no life it should have abated some. In the mean time just focus on any important classes that are pre reqs for later classes.
---
Different games for different folks. I don’t find BFAs talent system engaging, complete opposite for me.
---
only at this point you can say you've "completed" wow classic lol

Unless you're trying to access Oceanic or EU servers you won't even notice the difference.

D:I was handled wrong. Completely wrong. 
---
I can understand making the current servers full and try to hold back releasing new servers. 
---
They could try to add more layers but I’m not sure how difficult that is for them.

This is the best post in here right now. I dont come here to see what your SO painted or what art project you just finished leave that shit in r/wow i come here to see whats happening with classic I'll take the occasional meme like right now with the server name memes but lets keep all the arts and crafts out of here.

&gt;Based on name reservations so far, the Herod realm is looking to be **massively**  overpopulated. If all existing players on this server remain there,  login queues in excess of 10,000 players are a certainty, and possibly  much higher than that.

Hush man. The guy needs praise from someone in his life. (Though probably this mentality is why he never gets praise irl).

It's a solid warning, that when layering gets turned off, the login queues will be very long for Herod. So we should heed the warning now, and some people switch servers. Better to do it now, than later after Classic has been out for days.
---
I usually don’t kill grey levels. And I prefer not to gank someone fighting a mob. But if a good opportunity comes my away I don’t mind a fight.

the attrition rate will be glorious.  if blizz released the 'proper' amount of servers there would be endless bitching about dead servers.  they can't win
---
They could / should implement this by waiting until phase 2 to either implement the quest line, or they can keep the eye of shadow off the loot table in darkwhisper gorge until phase 2. Benediction / anathaema is strong as hell. That shit exceeds the power of most of the priest weapons in the entire game and is only really dethroned by cthun / naxx loot for healers, and a drop from nefarion for dps.

Even having that much put you well above average, I think. So many players never got their epic mounts. 60,000 gold in 2006 is like, one of the richest, if not the richest players in the game.

They don't need a new pvp realm right now, because staylagg is still medium. If it becomes full then maybe.

They 100% will on launch day at least, who knows if they'll add more before then though.

Yeah. High quality sub right there.
---
Even more funny was the people defending cause "blizzard knows better then you", and they might, but 2 PvP servers was a brain-dead decision, anyone could see that.
---
Charater creation is up always. Go and make your toons!
---
Alternatively, just move your ass over if you don’t want to deal with queues.

DO IT ! MAKE CLASSIC CLASSIC AGAIN !

Maybe because people already made their character on that server?
---
What is a hunters strategy when facing a druid in 1v1? Assuming the druid hibernate the pet.
---
yah just to keep nightfall up easily :)
---
I like it. You can force the clone and then set a timed period before the 3 additional name slots on the new server (assuming the person made 3 chars on Herod) are then deleted if the person is over the 3 char limit.
---
Take my upvote you aluminum horned madman!
---
Possible, I always thought it was removed with the revamp of naxx in wotlk. But you're probably right
---
r/inclusiveor
---
No, you're really not. If you want to play on a PvP server, and they're all full, you can't magically manifest a not-full PvP server to play on. 
---
5/7 are Full, the remaining 2 are "high" - and the majority of players have yet to even make a character.
---
&gt; Just using threat abilities to reduce damage, and even a Bodyguard system to protect some key ally?
---
I might be mixing things up, but Im fairly certain taunts also made players deal less damage to anyone but you, for a short time? That was a pretty genius way to make a "irrelevant" PVE ability, useful in PVP. It also thematically makes sense. Kinda odd they never did anything like that in WoW, tbh.

Once phase 1 is over, the queue time will jump way up on Herod. This is because 3 layers now become 1 layer, and will get far more crowded in every zone. The way to prevent each zone being like a Tokyo subway in rush hour is to have the login queue keep people out for longer.
---
So if you want to avoid this, listen to their warning and switch servers now when it's a lot easier to do.
---
what is it about them?
---
The blue post did say that a medium pop today was more populated than full realms in the past.
---
I still don't think they will open another one until more people migrate to stalagg first though.
---
Well we have cross realm battlegrounds (not a fan personally) but last I checked it was like 56% horde 44% Ally. That is just based on the survey in the Fairbanks subreddit. The actual ratio could be wildly different.
---
Why the hell isnt Blizzard opening alot more servers. I mean what is the catch? If servers then get Low populated the can just put them together. That way no one would need to separate from their guild/party and every one would end up on a healthy populated server.
---
The alternative would be incredibly bad - that servers get overpopulated. Then what can blizzard do to fix it??

Patch 9.0 be like:
---
Yes, please keep your cringe in those 10k+ queues so I can play on a smooth, stable server on launch.
---
&gt; The easiest option would be to offer extra name reservation slots for people who have 3 characters on super-full servers like Herod, Shazz, and Whitemane. But the new slots would have to be on lower population servers.
---
Why? There are other servers right now available. All they need to do is coordinate with their friends/guilds.
---
You fucking nerd. I love it. Can I have one?
---
My casual guild back in TBC-wotlk ran “suicide kings” loot.
---
Basically everyone is on a list, and the highest person on the list can take whatever upgrade (gotta be a legit upgrade) they want, and suicide themselves to the bottom of the list. You only moved up the list if you were in the raid when the person suicided. People would only hold off on huge upgrades once they actually got decent upgrades already, so in our case people only hoarded their spot later on in progression for bis weapons n such. 
---
It encouraged attendance but also made sure if you miss a raid or 2 you’re not completely fucked when you come back. Tbh it’s much better than dkp or lc for casual guilds. For reference we raided 3hr every fri/sat/sun.. i guess that’s casual? We got shit done tho and nobody had loot arguments.

Not many people have heard of it tho from my experience.

Tank isn't always the leader tho. I've had runs where I made calls on pulls ,marked targets, etc as dps, because our tank wasn't experienced or paying enough attention. It definitely goes smoother if the tank is the leader, but it's not a given.
---
Which is weird. Because WoW is *the* MMO that ~~steals~~ 'takes inspiration from' other games/MMOs. Out of all the things they couldve done something with, Huttball was probably the #1 thing they oddly never did. That, and how tanks worked in PVP.
---
Are you implying a quest helper add on is REQUIRED?
---
Vanilla raids are extremely simple (by comparison to retail). If I can put heroic azshara, then I'm sure I can pug about anything in classic.
---
Shazz aswell. I already said in other post that people is not wanting to move out, and that it's going to be problematic, and I ofc got downvoted...
---
Because plenty of people don't want to risk losing out on their current names because they have to delete them in order to try for a new name on a new server.  
---
Giving people the extra slot incentivises them to at least try.

Who is asking? I've not seen 1 post about what spec their computer needs.

In fact, I've seen more people posting what specs you need to play then people asking for such a thing.

Classic can be played on a potato, nobody needs to update.

I'm 99% sure you aren't in combat until your pet actually hits the opponent for the first time.  So as long as you cast shadowmeld prior to that first melee, you're good.  It shouldn't break your stealth if you enter combat while already shadowmelded.
---
If people are going to move, do it now. Not later. It's easier to do now, and no play time lost.
---
I'll take 2, please.

Use these keybinds to move - e (Forward), s (Back), d (Left), f (Right).
---
Use these keybinds for abilities - q w a r t g 1 2 3 4. Or, use mouse keybinds if you have them available. Using shift/ctrl modifiers of course. This will get you 30 keybinds, with room for more.
---
You wont miss out on classic exp playing on a different pvp server. They already said servers that are medium right now will have more players on them then full servers in vanilla did.

5. Wait to play.
---
I’m surprised Mankrik isn’t the most populated. It’s easily the best name
---
Well for starters how can you make 1 character on each realm when you can only make 3 characters per account? 
---
As for your question I think I answered it. They don't know which realm you choose so they'll have to estimate the probability that you would play on a server. So if 300 players each make 3 characters where 1 is on Herod, that means they estimate that a third of them will choose Harod so they all count as 100 players. 
---
The examples you listed are irrelevant because if you add enough numbers up, that kind of stuff evens out. It's statistics.
---
Very nice, I’m starting act 2 on hell, really not looking forward to the duriel fight again
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it got locked soon enough if nobody moves and even more people keep stacking there.
---
People nowadays will come up with ways to avoid logging out as well. I foresee a lot of auto hotkey use to prevent /afk'd logouts in order to avoid the queue, which will just make it even worse.
---
Blizzard is massively fucking up by not giving us way more servers to begin with.
---
You know that a medium pop server is higher than a full pop Server in vanilla?
---
What if the queue is 10 hours?
---
While hunters do scale poorly across vanilla, a lot of people still seem to have the wrong impression of the overall value of the class.
---
Hunters are **really good** in T1 (MC/Ony).
---
If you get the [BWL crossbow](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19361), hunters are also perfectly fine in BWL. It's kinda rare though, so if you have to make do with the [MC bow](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18713), hunter is okay but not that good.
---
The problems don't really begin until AQ40 where hunters get almost no upgrades. There's a new weapon if you didn't get the BWL crossbow, but the crossbow is better. T2.5 for hunters is unusable garbage. In Naxx there's another couple of weapons that are upgrades, but the one you really want is from KT so you won't get it until you've cleared Naxx.
---
So in the first half of vanilla, hunters are totally fine. They'll top the meters on some fights in T1 (particularly Shazzrah and Onyxia), and they'll still do alright throughout BWL. This is basically the high point of vanilla, the first 8-12 months where people are still motivated and the game is still reasonably balanced. On pservers, things die down a lot by the time guilds are clearing AQ40, and once Naxx comes around the server fizzles out completely.
---
In other words, for the parts of vanilla that are really worth caring about, hunters are **pretty good and definitely pull their weight.** The class doesn't start to seriously struggle until the end of vanilla when everything goes into decline.
---
Or you just have to wait in queue because you rolled on a full server?
---
Do not drink all those energy drinks, if you need careen drink coffee or tea, don’t drink anything but water after 3pm, you will hate yourself if you follow that plan.

At least you're eating healthy 😉

Recruiting only experienced raiders  that have done MC through  atleast C'thun and even better if you've  downed KT! I know many people  do not have this experience so this may  not be the guild for you.

We use flasks, full consumes, world buffs! Don't come to raid if we need to pick up your slack!

Level   a warlock to lvl 45+ for summons is a huge bonus! World bosses are  good  loot for AQ40 prep and some great BiS items early on!

Professions for most raiders will need to be engineering and herbalism.

Assuming layers don't fuck it, you will likely see familiar names as you level up. Many quests are difficult and it makes sense to send invites to people that you see showing up to do the same quest.

Do this enough times and presumably you meet some people you like, and add them or maybe join their guild

GRIZZLY going to stalagg...
---
I feel like it made all the armour meaningless. I liked when it was, "this is the armor you get and this is what it looks like."
---
I used to be able to tell if I could fight someone based on their gear. Now it's all meaningless.
---
Yeah I'm gonna trash talk alliance players while playing Horde. How is one an asshole on a pvp server?
---
The thing is there will be. If they don't open another server now Stalagg will end up in the same boat. It's almost HIGH now as it is.
---
We must destroy the world to save the world.
---
Oh the irony.  Dungeon finder was one of the worst things that happened to the game.
---
So you force all the streamers to 1 server. so instead of having 2 decently playable servers you have 0 because of the queues. Hilarious shit.
---
Imp JoCr will be 161, adding 115 damage to a smite. With Sanc Aura, Searing Light, &amp; Force of Will this looks to be 71.9 DPS without crits factored in(seems comparable to the shadow weaving 81 number up there).

With gear, Arcane Elixir, &amp; Flask of Supreme Power SP is at 435, Imp Jotc brings it upto 596. Spamming rank 5 smite(6705 mana over 90 seconds so easily affordable for this sim) I'm estimating a

((149+596\*.714)\*(1.25)/2 ) \* (.278 + .815)
---
392.49 DPS
---
I probably messed some part of those numbers up, but no world buffs were harmed in the making of this value. This is without misses factored in as well.  Can't forget about the PI cooldown to dish out too...
---
well in bfa you exclude those without experience unless they’re somehow over geared for pugs generally. Also, with the class homogenization that has happened over the years, there are no bosses in raids anymore that require X number of a specific class to do something competently. You’re gonna need all 3-4 of your hunters in the raid to do their job on Razorgore or the pug is breaking up after 2-3 wipes. In BFA you just have some other class do the thing/mechanic if someone is failing at it.
---
For real, the way they are handling this is the correct way. The goal is to not have any dead servers. I see none so far.
---
Based on what this blue post says, though.  Even medium population servers are bigger than the original Vanilla servers, so I'd think it should be fine.  That's the entire purpose of them being very cautious about opening new servers.
---
Listen, speaking as a tank the reason we don't like to tank is because he have to deal with so many bad DPS. It's quite frankly exhausting. All the DPS who complain about not being able to find tanks should reevaluate themselves. We wouldn't mind tanking if the fuckhead dps don't pull mobs because they are impatient. We wouldn't mind tanking if you knew how to re-apply crowd control before it wears off. We wouldn't mind tanking if you waited for us to get a few sunder armors up before you start DPSing.
---
Tanking shouldn't be this difficult but bads make it unbearable so most tanks stop tanking while they get gear.
---
\/end rant.
---
Np, I'll play Runescape while I wait
---
They upped server capacities during Warlords or Legion.
---
Maybe the real WoW was the noobs we ganked along the way?
---
Well yeah, the strategy they are employing definitely benefits the PvE servers where as it is detrimental to the PvP servers.
---
I think it might be too soon to add that one back.
---
I'd argue TBC. Woltk was already way easier than TBC and didn't have the same feel
---
Nah man don’t sweat it. They’re good, coordinated players who have been rolling on private servers for years. They will have competition horde side and I’m sure it won’t be some sort of steamrolling situation. This isn’t a private server, it’s gonna be more competitive with arguably more people
---
&gt;Also Brazillans already claimed another server (they are known to be pretty toxi... unfriendly, as a community to play with)
---
Just to clarify - because I know this is the case on retail - but the BR community going to Classic has stated they don't want to keep that reputation on Classic and will blacklist and BR folk trying to be toxic/unfriendly.
---
People paid for their name and they want to keep it, has nothing to do with the strawman about server pride.
---
I will be streaming to level 30 (40 if my xp/hr works how I plan) in one 24 hour sitting/standing. My computer is right next to my kitchen and my wife will be bringing me my meals at my computer. Then I will be playing 4-6 hours a day every day after.
---
gotta stay hydrated. amphetamines cause sweating and dry mouth. 
---
i've been on adhd medicine most of my life, those are the side effects that never went away for me.
---
Yeah, I played the shit out of it back when it launched.  It was an absolute blast to play with friends
---
I think people will change come launch when they are stuck in queues that don't move and get frustrated.
---
No, not really. I already stated in the post that I'm skeptical. I also didn't know how large they are or how large a guild can actually be in this game. I've barely played WoW while my friend is quite experienced, so I was thinking he might know better
---
Dark roast coffee and hella fruit and grain bars to keep the energy up.
---
As someone that never played past level 15 on a warlock in vanilla, what does raid prep look like?
---
It's not chair or something stupid.  I like my names and one of them was the only character I had back in vanilla.  Also not legolas or a variation.  More unique but still simple and im not going to thex them.
---
I've played on several private servers. In my experience, a server pop that fluctuates between 5 and 7 thousand online is the sweet spot.
---
Absolutely Stalagg will be full if they do not open another realm or 2 NOW!
---
There wasn't any sharding in Vanilla. Interaction doesn't mean grouping.
---
You could interact with everyone in one cohesive world, without needing to deliberately friend, party or guild invite anyone. Hence why it was organic interaction.
---
But let's be clear here - you're currently defending not only layering, but sharding too. Just let that sink in.
---
Part of the reason I'm not looking for a guild ahead of time is Vanilla creates friendships and groups that you will end up continuing to play with. Let it happen organically. I promise you will makes friends as you level.
---
If you're playing Alliance you probably won't notice much at all. Even if they go hard at the world PvP they will still only be a small piece of the scene. There's just way too many people who's jumping into Classic for the world PvP.
---
Congrats on quitting smoking. It is a very hard thing to do. I used to smoke back when I played Classic as well. Was a fosaken warlock though, so I could be afk for smokes. I used to smoke hardcore until I stopped almost 10 years ago. It was really difficult to stop. Keep it up, kudos amigos!

Healers are the mommy making sure everyone has snacks and juice packs.

DPS are the 3 children in the backseat picking their noses and wiping it on the seats.
---
There won’t be too much level-appropriate PvP until like STV, yes, but there will definitely be Alliance players who speed-level with the intention of going to the Barrens to gank low Horde, and vice versa. Maybe that’s what you were saying.
---
im probably gonna sit down for an hour or two after work with a glass of water and an apple
---
Yeah, the movie definitely wasn’t flawless, but ultimately it was enjoyable, and the Orcs were the first time I ever felt that “movie magic”, ala Jurassic Park, from CGI.
---
Only in Phase 1. Once Phase 2 comes, if there are 30k people on your server, you are fucked.
---
wasn't this on EU ? so that's like 5 months less
---
seems like a lovely fellow :D
---
Where do we join you? Is there a discord / subreddit?
---
The bigger concern here is that they are realizing they don't have capacity based on name reservations alone - but you can only make a name reservation if you're willing to start your subscription early.   No one has a clue how many new subs will pop up for launch day.
---
Suspicious behaviour. If a charater stays online for 12 hours without killing anything or going anywhere and just runs in circles or moves back and forth, then it's clearly a bot.
---
A real person could do this in theory but it's so unlikely, and it's blizards server so it's their rules.
---
Yeah, that sounds reasonable. Now I'll just have to convince my friend about it... Maybe I'll show him this thread

Ooof, I swear I remember doing that to some poor people who were looking for a "summon to Shattrath" (I guess ghettoing wasn't as well known back then?) in TBC. And having 2 friends of mine summoning people up ontop of the islands in Nagrand and just see them falling to their death. Fun, but at the same time kind of sad. They prolly felt so betrayed :(
---
If you are going full consumables, 200+ gold and a couple hours of farming for a single raid night. And hardcore guilds would raid 5+ nights a week easy. This is why naxxramas was very rare.
---
Lore-wise, Chromie is responsible for Classic via the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=550t8jeYRgg).

I play on a merged server, Dentarg and Whisperwind. There are many others.
---
Beat your head against the wall enough and you'll reach max.
---
Great information to have, thank you so much! I didn't remember reading about the cross realm battlegroups, that makes me pretty sad tbh =(...
---
I'll see what a little talk can't accomplish later. One of my friends is a *very* vocal horde player, and I'm not much for confrontation. We'll see where we land xD
---
They do grief the servers and lock down zones like Un'Goro so you have no chance to farm. 
---
But its fun cos they make wpvp happen all the time, and thats part of the fun in classic wow!
---
ps. Level as a Rogue and steal their devilsaurs. :)
---
Right there too
---
Eq and then wow was my escape from a shitty family but also my tinder, Craigslist (i found 2 band members for a project via wow), and later my eHarmony. The few friends i gave now and my SO all came from my time on Mmo's when they were more centralized.
---
I think we have to wait and see, there by the time phase 2 hits there could be a uproar for layers to still be on, if the bigger servers do turn in to mega servers and the fight for resources and mob tags gets too annoying for people player, I do hope it doesn't get to that...
---
Not that it's necessarily needed, but Feign Death + Shadowmeld is always an option.
---
If you have ever worked at a company with an internal marketing team, this wouldnt surprise you in the slightest.
---
It's a PvE realm and most hardcores aren't rolling there because of that.
---
Makes a lot of sense. 
---
They should also turn off layers on the less populous servers as soon as it makes sense to do so there rather than doing it on the same schedule for all servers.
---
Horde and Alliancr have their own
---
Best way to reward this kind of player is to just reimburse them with gold or mats from the gbank as payment for work done. You dont want ppl becoming entitled to loot just because they help out.
---
Unless you want to assign ep or dkp as payment for this kind of service, could be a good way to offer incentive for others to chip in, and at less cost to the guilds coffers.
---
Isn’t  a dragon wearing a gnomes skin a more accurate statement? Lol
---
&gt; it's going to kill the game if there are 50 servers like before
---
If those servers are well populated why would it be a bad thing?
---
Does anyoen reading this comment know if raids give shards in the build Blizzard are using for classic? Or are you forced to do the soul shard farming outside raids a few hours before the raid?
---
I read that to, and I hope they are successful.
---
I often keep the launcher minimized and would like the ability to right click launch Classic from the task bar. Right now even if I have the classic selected in the drop down, it launches retail WoW. If it had it's own icon they would both show up when you right click and I could just pick Classic.
---
Same mindset as blizzard.
---
Instead of allowing people with reservations to "slide" their names into a new server. They created this situation and it's hard to remedy
---
Just use skill. Addons are not needed.
---
I’d be fine with it. You do not speak for everyone.
---
Play in the office. Makes nice with IT if you arent the tech guy. They probably played. Buy them time cards for their cooperation
---
Software related, a lot is automated.
---
The only time I worked crazy hours was during the initial growth period.
---
I think multiple lists is the best way to deal with it. 1 for tier gear 1 for off set pieces + rings and necks 1 for trinkets and weapons
---
And IMO, the whole having to run to the instances out in the world wasn't as genius or cool as it might sound like. Sure, it's super immersion, but it always ended up the faction with more people there just killing the other faction. So the only hope was to try to get as close to the portal, ress and run in to queue. And I SWEAR at one point you couldn't join a battle if you were dead, so you also had to hope your 2min ress timer was gone when then battle popped.
---
Happen to have a link of a store that still makes these?
---
The only thing keeping me from hanging myself tonight is knowing that I have 3 months to level to 60 and a couple more months until Cyberpunk and Last of Us 2. After that.. Oh boy, back to the store for the rope.
---
Did you have a character on herod already?
---
Honestly i am not sure about overpopulated realms, how would they deal with it
---
It’s not worth it xp-wise, but it’s such an awesome lowbie dungeon.
---
You can solo RFD. I used to do it on a Rogue for (fiery) enchanting mats. Was a trival way to earn good income (note: enchanting mat price/value varies on a server by server basis)
---
They said they already increased the pop cap such that a medium is larger than any server from Vanilla.
---
Tbh I'm kind of a noob. If it's not simple my dumbass brain will not handle it
---
Oh no
---
Can't wait to read all the tryhard rpers profiles that read like a terrible GOT fanfiction.
---
Only chance to get those names (and there's no in-game content yet)
---
I came here to say this. You could probably run it fine in any distro, since integrated graphics can run it fairly easy as well.
---
This dude is using literal autoclicker.exe, look at his past posts.  LOL
---
It's amazing how they managed to make the humans look more artificial than the orcs
---
Water and coffee. Eating like shit was cute when I was 25, not so cute at 35.
---
The EST servers are actually in CST time zone. So west playing on east is closer than east using a west
---
I would say 2 months or so
---
Accented letters are a thing. In Vanilla, I had "Deanna" on Dalaran from day 1. 30mins into name reservations, I couldn't remake her on Grobulus, so I went with Deànna. On live, I have a Dànnikà and other accented names. Just learn the alt-codes.
---
If I had to guess probably a little over a month
---
Blizz has seen this and already implemented your genius
---
Because I'm sure people like M0rph_ are worried about their names being taken.
---
it ain’t bad, I’m sure ribs are a lot worse. I’m going back and doing the back of my calf next month.
---
TBH I feel like that's an unforeseen bug or an oversight -- clicking the WoW icon doesn't default you to WoW1 and it shouldn't affect the other dropdown either. 
---
Has anyone tweeted this to the devs or something?
---
I'd disagree there. The hollow feeling to me comes because retail focuses almost exclusively on very specific mechanics, removing everything and anything which doesn't fit into their primary purpose: Keeping people subscribed. There's no game behind them, no world, only an external reason for them being the way they are.
---
It only took this long for me personally at least to see the value in weapon skills, elemental resistances, being able to build for individual attributes instead of only the ones "you're allowed to use" and all the other things people used to see as a tedium, but removing them removes a lot of the *feel* of the game.
---
Vanilla WoW is like D&amp;D 3rd edition. Retail WoW is like D&amp;D 4th edition. It's fun, but it feels hollow, *because* it has been hollowed out to be "easier to pick up and play". As a response, Pathfinder came on to the scene, and later D&amp;D 5 backtracked on *a lot* of what 4 changed at the time.
---
Meanwhile, more people play AD&amp;D and 3/3.5 than play 4th, and even more play Pathfinder and 5th. I'm fairly sure something similar will happen to WoW, where Vanilla becomes a long term success and 9.0 backtracks on a lot of things that have been introduced since 4.0.
---
Vanilla simply hasn't been around long enough for people to get "properly" tired of it in the way you describe. Meanwhile, people quit BFA in the first month, even new players to the game altogether.
---
Legion was good, but not as great as people make it out to be. The good stuff of Legion mostly lies outside of its core mechanics, at least in my opinion.
---
Damn, that’s basically a second job. How many shards do you usually bring to a raid?
---
I plan on rolling warlock, pretty pumped to see the end game, never played long enough to really raid.
---
I intend to be semi hardcore for PVE and PVP. I cant decide between Troll or Orc hunter... I played Nelf in vanilla so I have no old loyalties. I understand glancing blows arent a thing so the weapon skill will only really be beneficial until I'm geared. The stun resist is very nice but a berserk aimed shot combo is also super exciting. Ignoring that Orcs are the best all around in TBC what's the all around best Hunter for Classic, Orc or Troll? I need your help friends.
---
where on earth did the footage of black dragons strafing in BRM come from?
---
I subbed today because I was scared of Faerlina getting locked before I subbed but with all my friends being there

Hey more power to you. I'm not waiting 10 minutes to play game I pay for lol.
---
Thanks :)
---
This was amazing. I am so hyped! Great work c2c!
---
Slowly turning into /r/gameofthrones
---
Names. This is basically the biggest reason why ppl aren't switching. If only we had the option to transfer from herod.
---
I assume that's a rare item? Sorry, I've barely played this game
---
And is it actually considered griefing if you're just killing the other faction? I thought that was part of the game
---
I'm a server at a restaurant at the airport...  I can't get my liquid cooling past TSA...
---
Everyone wants to be noticed for having a cool or rare name. Nevermind that the novelty of their cool name wears off within seconds of it being seen. "Oh, that guy's name is Hello. That's... a thing."
---
Meanwhile the really skilled, funny, or interesting people will garner a reputation regardless of their name.
---
Post it in the LFG like everyone else
---
Gotta show some Aussie love in here. You're amazing Josh!
---
Yeah, my first name reservation was for a bank alt. If you see me on Banksy on Mankrik say hi lol.
---
They are expecting attrition to play a role in this, I can see it becoming a problem if everyone decides not to quit. But even then, Nostalrius and some other realms worked fine with 10-15k pops. Only time will tell.
---
Did you read?  We are already Medium which is bigger than any Vanilla server ever was.  We don't need more people, especially people that don't care about RP.
---
I'd like to know for RP purposes. I had an extensive wardrobe before transmog and intend to do the same thing this time around.
---
These are some next-level mental gymnastics.
---
Your argument boils down to:
---
"People getting ahead of you due to your restricted playtime is the same thing as being physically unable to see 90% of the server's population, because you will spend time not seeing players". 
---
Even if the level 10 mage is now level 40 while you're 57, he's still in the same cohesive world as you - if you're both in IF, you can see and recognize each other - reminisce about that one time he saved you.
---
With layering, you might be on the exact same stage on the exact same quest in the exact same zone all the way to 60, and never ever see each other again.
---
Not to mention that they've literally just announced that layered servers will have 10k+ queues as well, so that point about queues being the worse alternative is completely moot.
---
It absolutely fits here. What are you on about? It's a tattoo with horde and Alliance symbols combined. There's nothing wrong about this. Get the stick out of your ass.
---
A case of bawls, a big bag of chocolate covered coffee beans, an 8 ball and a gallon of whiskey.

one of the mods argued with me about [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpznfm/lf1_dps/) and [mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/FairbanksClassic/comments/cqc2nk/herod_on_launch_day/), I asked why was my meme flagged for low effort when that one is pretty much the same context as mine.
---
Overcrowded servers will also create a player retention problem though.
---
Blizzard allows 50,000 people to a single server, because layering.
---
Fast forward to phase 2, 20,000 people still playing herod
---
Blizzard than goes "unfortunately the least disruptive course of action at this point will be keeping layers on indefinitely, because fracturing the server would be too problematic"
---

I second this idea, do one on west also for whitemane.  Give a 24 hr transfer window then open it up to the rest.
---
orly? thats sweet! do you have a link for more info?
---
Right? Some of their server names are just plain "wtf?"
---
I swear VT isn't a thing in vanilla, and was added as a talent back in TBC? The last one in shadow, if I recall correctly. Could def be remembering wrong.
---
&gt;Dominos is running a 50%
---
[I](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/dominos-pizza-half-off-deal-july-2019) dont see any info on this anywhere, can you give a link plz?
---
I see they did this july though
---
Alhordiance then? A l'ordiens, maybe?
---
Why stay on Herod?
---
They've made an estimation of how many people will drop off after Phase 1. So say they estimate a 75% loss, then right now they can implement servers with 4x as much population, and expect it to fall to a normal full server when they remove layering.
---
Wow Classic players: We HATE LAYERING THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA
---
Also wow Classic player: \*all sign up for the same overcrowded server\*
---
upoorn/gay.com
---
This is insane... mods deleted this yesterday as low-effort. They told me they couldn't know that I made the image myself. Now they do it again?  
---
What is going on?
---
Huh, most other people here are saying they'll just be a drop in the bucket of PvPers. Not sure who to believe now :/
---
I don't either, I just think it's ridiculous that people are actually advocating to move off Herod because "queue times". All the new launch players will be filling up the remaining servers, don't worry about that. If anything, I'd say Herod has the most potential long term players.
---
"Now its even more fun and you actually get to save her"

You sound like Blizzard devs when they released Cata...

Nobody human clicks in the same pattern and frequency as a clickbot. You play the game and notice how you click, how often you do it, where you click. Now try your bot.

Bnet detects these odd inputs from users and if it keeps on detecting it, you're banned.

That's a half-merger, it sidesteps the naming issue and introduces a few quirks (such as whispering, inviting, etc). I'm not sure the Classic crowd would be alright with such a method.

Nah, it’s really nice to have a lvl 35 alchemy/tailor or leatherworking alt so you can make cured rugged hides/ arcanite bars/ mooncloth cooldown.  The only benefit of having alchemy on your main is for crafting flasks and ZG potion.  Both require higher level.
---
Reverend of all things not processed or starchy

we already knew this
---
I'm going to do it just like I did in vanilla. I'm going to focus on leveling and gearing up and make connections while doing that to get into a guild with like-minded chill people that want to raid.
---
lol have you ever played a private server?  They are literally harder than the beta for classic.
---
&gt; be blizzard
---
&gt; provide one server for half the US to play on without getting harassed by streamers and jajaja
---
&gt; half the US rolls on that server
---
&gt; surprisedpikachu.jpg
---
Did you say the same about BFA?
---
No server is low pop.  The way they are saying, even a low pop server is the size of a healthy server back in Vanilla.  Stalagg became medium pop in one day.  Until they open a server that doesn't fill to medium in like a week, there's 0% chance of a dead server, which would be something like less than 2000 active players, a very low bar.

I don't who why people think streamers won't be there. We will get some streamers just maybe not any of the big names. What if some other stream from another game comes over? Played in the past wants to relive it who knows. They don't care about the "streamer servers".  Also people may change server we still have sub 10 days to go....
---
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
---
Technically it was 2.01 *I think*; I just liked the combo. VE alone was so good though.
---
You're straight up describing my exact same scenario. Are you me? I think I'm going to level up a hunter though because pally's are kinda repetitive while leveling.
---
Its not classic... but also, it IS classic. I don’t know how to feel about this. Everyone really should have to spend hours looking fo her until they find out about thotbot.
---
Not when the graphic artist has to do the job twice because they didn't do it correct the first time...Time is money friend!
---
That ret pally one made me laugh pretty hard. I understand that people really want their posts for discussion (I do too), but why can't there just be both?
---
Leaving a server over a guild being on it is very silly and definitely an overreaction. They’re skilled players but they aren’t Gods lmao. Horde will provide lots of competition against them
---
They lock down high level zones to farm HKs, so anybody that lands is dead.
---
You're probably right. We'll also be leveling pretty slowly, if that accounts for anything
---
PvP servers are super fun when it comes time to start doing MC. Everyone gets choked into on path to the dungeon and lots of fun can be had
---
Agreed! I'm glad players are opening up this discussion the mods are ignoring my mod mail request and personal messages, dictatorship doesn't solve anything.
---
Some of us have had the same character names since Nov 2004 in WoW. We are known by these names, those names we have used in other games and other social media experiences. We also took time out of our lives to be on at the designated time, put up with server queues upwards 30 mins to an hour to try and reserve the names we wanted. But now with poor planning on their part, Blizzard has made it unlikely we will get these names if we just up and move to another server.
---
Entire region afraid of \~50 players. It's not a good look.
---
You sound like you needed a positive role model growing up.
---
It's the onion.
---
Thats not true they’ll just go to a server that has no queues
---
OPs point is that you can _naturally_ bump into these old players _as well as_ purposely (by inviting).
---
You missed an option.
---
* Doesn't believe them.
---
I am glad they re-affirmed their intentions to disable it by phase 2 today though.
---
It wouldn't be as packed as herod is now tho. im just saying the main reason why ppl aren't switching is because of name reservation. It seems like alot of ppl on herod WANT to switch but wont unless an option like this becomes available.
---
When I was clearing old raids on retail I got the drop from Ragnaros on my first try. I was pretty surprised but it was cool to get such a famous weapon.
---
Sorry but this is against the ToS of WoW. If you want use it but don't cry If they ban you. Even if it just small adjustments ingame, with that program it still interacts with WoW. It got detected back in 2006 and it will be now as a botting program sooner or later.
---
Elect a chancellor who promises more lebensraum
---
This is very silly. The characters are nothing but names so "transfering" would just be them opening the server....
---
«I probably won’t be able to heal without an addon»
---
The skill level is much higher now than in retail vanilla.... 
---
Jesus. You're drinking 6 energy drinks on launch day? I regularly drink energy drinks, but only one or two a day. Anything after that is just diminishing returns and more negatives than positives.
---
3k in the long run yes. But we all know population is exponentialy decaying. How would you achieve your 3k pop through 6 phases without starting off with alot more than that?
---
It's not a discussion, it's not even labeled a discussion, it's a passive aggressive call out post designed to inflame.
---
It's like taking to a brick wall who just keeps repeating buzzwords. 
---
Sorry I'm not sorry you don't get to see your E-BFF walk into the auction house.  I really don't care.
---
God Hurricane is great. These next 10 days are going to feel so long, I can't wait to come home to Azeroth!
---
I never knew people cared so much about their in game names until this whole classic launch. Its kinda crazy.
---
You can setup party and raid frames at interface options, so you will see all or your dudes. Classic client is a backport of bfa so some of features stayed there.
---
The word you are looking for is min max.
---
shit but 200 ppl upvoted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cq1vnz/when_you_see_everyone_fighting_over_herod_and/)  86% Upvoted but ya i'll listen to you.
---
But what if some people like chibi drawings? Does it really hurt you that much to ignore them? What if people don't have a lot of friends to brag about their cool wow tat to? *But fuck them, right? /s*
---
I hear what you are saying. A quick visual of what gear they have is cool, you can always check their character pane too. Thier are certain pieces I really want to sport but they aren't always top tier pieces. It's not a deal breaker for me though. I'm still hella looking forward to playing. Got my top three names on Stall.
---
Well I suppose I worded the title without much though and I admit I messed up there but it was his words (the streamers) that it’s not available to the public and he got it because he’s a streamer. I suppose he just got an early version or something I don’t know.
---
Damn that's awesome. The lan party is such a good idea too. I'm jealous.
---
My top van wow moment, I was in an alliance raiding guild on Greymane, and I log in one day and see guild chat blowing up to get to Org. I get there and we had joined up with 5 other big raiding guilds massing to the left of the main gate. When we charged in, my frames dropped to -15, I was just swinging at anything and everything, and we crashed the server for 30 minutes. By God, that was just epic.
---
Its hard to take any content creator serious that think Vanilla and soon to be Classic World Buffs are an exploit.
---
Why remove it? Everyone else gets to share wow art and screenshots but I don't? Why are you in such a twist about this? What do you think this reddit is for?
---
It will be different every time.
---
Whelp its too late for that. We're getting a no changes classic. The only thing that could bring changes is if people were to quit playing after a while.
---
As much as I'd like to see a bit of TBC's class re-balancing, (I can't lvl an auto attacking paladin again) Its the myriad of other voices calling for changes like transmogging to gearscores that has everyone (me included) too scared to want any changes.
---
They'll be on Bloodsail Buccaneer's with all the other weenies who get bootyblasted when their mary sue gets kicked down a few notches. Went into a BB RP discord and it was all the same MG big names trotting around their 6+ year old characters and their $800+ art pieces with their harems and all. Went to the Grob one and it was just good friends and shitposting and good times and positivity. 
---
GROB GANG
---
Not in classic. This area was sealed only to become available in Cata, no idea why since it was fully textured iirc.
---
I was gonna no life classic but now I’m having second thoughts. 
---
I’m going to play casually. Can I get away with Rank 10 gear and like barbarous blade? i.e. I don’t wanna raid outside of maybe a pug here and there. 
---
Usually I play healer but I want to be self reliant and still have fun in PvP this time around.
---
You definitely have to be aware of dots and CC durations to get a channel off but the same applies for a bandage. 
---
For example against a hunter you would fear him and howl of terror the pet. Against shadowpriests and locks you would CC and then dispell the dot with felhunter and shadow ward. The only class where it's pretty useless against would be a warrior because those are fast fights and you can barely CC them.
---
But yes CB shines more in BGs and 1vsX situations.
---
Not having to sit down in WSG/AB was really useful vs rogues to deny the guarenteed crit or in AV when you kept being in combat and you couldn't drink. Or when you're out in the world farming and you see a guy coming towards you, you pop that CB and get as many ticks in as you can, you deathcoil into fear his initial attack and if he's not using a trinket you could then start lifetapping a bit and bandaging and you're full mana and hp again and we all know who wins in a fair fight ;).
---
There's plenty of situations where CB is very useful for a lock and we're not even talking about WotF which gets all the glory.
---
You guys are really giving him a hard time.  He probably has a disability or something.
---
I didn't think I could ever disagree this hard with an internet comment. I'd much rather this subreddit be 95% /r/ironscape and 5% /r/2007scape than vise versa.
---
It's almost as if they should have had more servers open to begin with, and that they underestimated the interest in classic
---
Still a dick. Killing Grey levels just makes you look weak
---
I guess when your buds see the light of day and shame-roll on Grob with you, you can help them out with a bag or two, maybe... LOL.
---
Yeah I'm not sure what that's about, why would Blizzard do all of this work to keep the integrity of the game and then essentially throw it all away with P2 layering. Makes no sense why people choose to believe that lol
---
/r/Grobbulus is the subreddit, they have a discord link is stickied there
---
I peeked into the future and found [a picture of herod players on launch while everyone else is having fun playing](https://i.imgur.com/otmwBpY.jpg)
---
You could zone in while a boss was engaged, so graveyards had to be well away from the dungeon so groups would actually wipe.
---
Oof, didn’t realize you had to pay. I think I’ll pass then.
---
If your handle has numbers or is more than 12 characters, it's not gonna work.  Not everybody can be Bread or Thex.
---
Nope.
---
Yep, and that's 5-7k *per single layer* that we see on pservers.
---
Lolol. I remember sweating when i had an evga hybrid in my bag after Christmas
---
Ty mate! Didn’t know it was lfr

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cregwi/who_agrees_classic_wow_is_cool_cause_its_free/). 
---
I think they're simply used to it like you said but that's it. They're used to it, but I don't think I'd say they prefer it. We've all had to get used to it because that's all that there is these days. I think there are still tons of people that prefer a good time sink into something. It's just that game studios realized they can profit way more with the current faster paced model of games.
---
I disagree. I expect all servers to be high pop. People aren't leaving Herod because they want their names and they didn't get a chance to get their names on Stalagg because it released on such short notice. Guilds are entrenched already. This solution will allow the guilds to move over as a big group.
---
....what? Yes, we can complain because Blizzard refused to launch with enough servers. Blizzard forced us into this situation. Especially when they dropped the ball by refusing to get involved with the streamer issue. Literally left us 1 PvP est server to pick.
---
Oh, okay. As I said earlier, I have almost no experience with this game so I had no idea. 
---
That does sound pretty nasty, but someone else said that it won't really be a problem because we're playing Alliance. I think the main concern my friend had was that people won't want to play Horde because of them and it'll be bad for the server
---
Is English your third language? Not only do you not comprehend the discussion, you had to be a smug little shit about it.
---
I'll have a fuckload of water, couple bags of baked bbq chips, some strawberries, pistachios, edamame, and pb&amp;j for sandwiches.
---
Isnt that what they just did?
---
The more blizzard tabs on battle net the less chance I have of seeing shitty activision titles
---
Troll is marginally better PVE, Orc is chosen every single time over troll for Pre-Made BGs. If you’re on a PVP sever it makes it an easy choice. Personally orc has a better overall gameplay to me compared to marginal dps increase for PVE. If I wanted to top DPS charts, I’d roll another class.
---
I remember seeing Stitches trucking across the graveyard. Scared the living crap out of me. Glad he doesn't turn hostile till he reaches the road. He was also still lethal to characters way above his level.
---
If you have any interest in pvp, go orc. Troll is nothing but a small PvE dps increase. It’s really not worth it. Weapon skill is not anywhere near as good for hunters as it is for melee, and you mostly use crossbows late game anyway.
---
But it doesn't interact with WoW. AT ALL.   It interacts with the keyboard, and the keyboard is the middle man that sends commands to WoW.
---
The firewall prevents WoW from touching my other software on my computer.
---
LOL, did you watch the Q&amp;A lol? "thats not how layering works, just stop" maybe watch the Q&amp;A and you'll hear what he said the plan was for servers.
---
Spose you could always pirate it lol
---
The name reservation idea was a good idea for them to gauge interest and intent, that has a lot of bad unintended side effects.
---
Why would you tell him :(
---
Burns When I PvP was taken I assume?
---
I don’t understand this:
---
Blizzard announced the day AND TIME servers would open so people could reserve names on them because they understand how important names are to players.
---
Then, when those servers got overpopulated, they added more servers WITHOUT ANNOUNCING IT - if a player got a name they want reserved on one server, what do you think the chances are they’ll move to another one without knowing if they can reserve the name there?
---
+60 ish
---
[Im sure Kargoz can help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi-7oKvOM4c)
---
I don't think layering being on or off would affect the queues. You are logging into the server not the specific layer.
---
Maybe he meant the guide he used in the addon
---
If by level cap you mean with layering then yes. The cap is much higher. But in the end a single layer will be around the same cap as a vanilla realm.
---
Thank you so much that’s it!
---
For the record this isn't a bad idea, I just think this sub over exaggerates literally everything. The world is always on fire here
---
call it what you want, but its not against the rules to stay at the character selection for 12 hours a day
---
The Nordic Gehennas discord channel is like 95% swedes.
---
Really neat actually! I'm so confused why crafts of wow are ok but people posting fanart wow isn't in this sub.
---
Either way, really neat stuff!
---
But either way that won't be the case. Once layering goes away the population cap is 2500-3k. Once you hit that from people who aren't leaving you have queues, and with the current numbers probably hours long queues.
---
you need at least 1 alt for when you are getting corpse camped
---
Well that's great if you want to play at 10am. But those "only 4 hours a day" are generally all going to be in the SAME 4 HOURS (peak time!) for most people. So it doesn't help those who want to, I don't know, raid from 7-10pm...
---
I think you are probably getting killed on the downvotes right now... but I work for a small business that has been around for 30 years... and my owner still works a ridiculous amount, and the little free time he has is spent with family.   My Father in law owns a small business and works 6 days a week 12+ hours a day... and again his time he has off there are other things he has to do.
---
Running a small business and playing 3-6 hours a day is nuts... but on top of that giving yhour employees a week off is just a bad business decision... 
---
Seems crazy.
---
you could just check the survery data and see for yourself that the answer is druid
---
WAY MORE
---
This has been confirmed already though.
---
And make sure the preempt all of this with a back and forth 17 hour discussion about the difference in definition between hardcore semi hardcore and casual
---
Lfg Button in Task bar 🤔
---
in phase 1, dal'rends or warmonger are your best options. otherwise you will mostly rely on other boe's like assassination blades or something.
---
So log in the game and then log out after a minute back to the character screen
---
jesus Christ yall care about saving yalls names more than a stable server?
---
They don't deal with it. They simply remove all the extra layers. Then they implement queues. If the queues are insanely long, they offer free server transfers to more evenly distribute the player base.
---
People panicking about population when the name reservation includes tourists aswell as actual people who plan to play.
---
[That idea has been floated around before](https://redd.it/cod9dz). And I'm sure /u/jefframclassic wasn't the first either.
---
Sounds amazing, unfortunately I cannot assist my knowledge is very limited. I wish you all the best I will definitely be trying this out
