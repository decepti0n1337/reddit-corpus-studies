and it's a pve guide. it's not worthless, but if you get dmg in raids, your survivability is often low no matter what. there are only few situations imo where this really is of use

---
I'm unsubscribing from this turd of a sub again
---
What opinions or feedback are you looking for?
---

---
You say 'this is coming from someone who wants authentic vanilla &amp; addons' and then say 'how could someone who wants authentic vanilla use addons'... I'm not sure what the purpose of this post is.
---
Addons were in vanilla and should be usable in classic. "No addons" is a change.
---
Kind of an aside - but we do know (with a high degree of certainty) that addons will be based on the new addon framework &amp; lua. So porting from 7.3.5 to 1.13 should be fairly easy. 
---
If you want fresh servers every 6 months stay on the shitty private servers. No fresh servers, no patches after Naxx, no nothing that wasn't in Vanilla WoW. 
---
TBC after Classic.
---
Not being able to enter AQ and Naxx has made me want to play it at level appropriate content 13 years later. They clearly did something right if I’ve seen the place but still want to experience it. I’m pumped that I’ve got a second chance to actually experience these raids.
---
As a point of not respec-ing for PVP I value those 4 points, that's just me though. I guess more play pve servers though
---
There are a few features added to retail over time that removes the needs for specific Addons. But people will still use those addons anyways.
---
Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind that post Nax. That's what Old School Runescape more or less did and their new content is excellent while still maintaining the old school feeling and balance. 
---
If you're a warlock wearing Felheart, you're bad.
---
check out r/workingaduiltsguild sounds like you'd be interested and according to current numbers we need mages anyway.
---
I'm big on SEASONS man. SEASONS!
---
First, there must be PRISTINE servers. Disconnected from the season system entirely. No xfers to/from these servers.
---
Then -- have like 4 SEASONS servers. Once the season ends, you can move these characters to STANDARD servers and keep playing them there. Then the SEASON server resets.
---
You wouldn't want a SEASON character moving to a PRISTINE server - because it would fuck with the economy (a character with bags full of black lotus or something). So you would need the "season" server, "holding server for old season characters" server and "server without and to/from transfers" all disconnected. 
---
But they've said they're not doing Classic on some 2 year timeline and then it's over. It's supposed to be a 10-15 year long endeavor. Potentially a product they can offer over and over again for many years. 
---

Dont care that he was fueled by racism.
---
Expecting to get over genocide committed by the Orcs is insane.
---
Stuff like that takes time, even if it wasnt the Orcs fault...despite drinking the killer kool aid twice.
---
An acceptable alternative.
---
I go back and watch Scrubs seasons 1-5 every year.
---
I go back and play Stardew Valley all the time. I go back and play OoT every few years.
---
As long as Classic is available, people will play it. Sure -- some folks will be longing for progression, either with BC or "patch 1.14" -- but some folks will also want Classic there, in the 1.13 state, forever. 
---
no but have focus on pve / raiding. even on pvp servers :) but yeah it really depends on what you like doing. and 50g respec costs are gonna prevent most priests from switching between pvp and pve spec
---
Not only too high ilvl but also too tightly itemized.  I get that it's hard and not many people will have it, but the jump is too big.
---
I pvp'ed with some members of one of the top horde guilds on my server back in the day, Nightmares Asylum. Some of the guys got me a few invites to their weekly alt nax runs. I got a frost resist helm that was removed and not added with the return of 80 nax in wotlk. My mage still has to this day. It's no Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian, but it's more than enough evidence that I downed a boss or two in the OG nax. I really hope some new people get to experience that level of accomplishment from a video game come classic. Maybe some of us veterans will get to experience it again, this time as leaders and SME's, instead of the noobs being dragged along. 
---
Yeah DK sets in Wrath were pretty awesome looking. I alternate between T8/10 transmogs because I really haven't found a set that looks as good since. The exception would be Alliance plate in T9 because wow that was fucking ugly, especially on my NE character. 
---
Just wondering why I see criticism of classic having improvements to the interface when those same people are going to get add ons to solve those problems in the end anyway. Or will they actually choose not to get addons because that’s how they want to play classic.
---
There were addons in clsssic. Just delete this moronic post.
---
I understand how it works, I am saying no one wastes mana doing that unless they are doing some speed run kill of the boss.
---
Delete this post please
---
Yo Tov here from the stream.  Good stuff!
---
I'd also like to hear peoples thoughts on mixing things up with "Seasons" like in modern ARPG's.  How would you feel if you started on a fresh server with a race to MC but the whole server has a restriction, or a weird thing.  Once the season ends, your toons go back to your main account.  thoughts?
---
calling bs on that story
---
:D I told him over the phone this comment and he cracked up !! 
---
If they could come up with something like fastest boss kill times, where you could improve scores every week.  Weekly rankings and each phase titles are given out.  Doesn't need to happen on the first batch or whatever. This can be a scheduled thing with server launching X date and guilds sign up, keep it spicy in two years
---
Spirit only works if you stop casting for 5seconds, wand up keep will/is time consuming with little benifit if any and a lack of the whole aspect of a warlock, I think you should go play a want priest you might enjoy it more.
---
I won edgemasters handguards and the epic dagger from princess in one run. I equipped both and sold them to the bender shortly after. I was a shaman. 
---
Could start as Tauren too since it's more peaceful and beautiful(in terms OP is asking for) than the other 2 starting zones. Stonetalon is a shared zone so it should be good with an Ally. Arathi highlands, Hinterlands, and Ferales are good spots for them too later. 
---
Fel was most common for resits if demo + purge and silence once keybound define a skilled warlock.
---
Don't get me wrong blue was go to for most melee fights simply for sac (or double if demo) 
---
&gt; You are saying druids are bad because when given the choice of what healers to put in the "extra" spots, people will always take a priest, paladin, or shaman over a druid.
---
"Always" is your gloss on it. "Always if they are optimising" would be mine, in just the same way that people always want a properly specced mage, warlock, rogue or warrior over an enhance shaman or ret paladin in a DPS spot if they are optimising, all else being remotely equal.
---
&gt; And even if it was, it wouldn't be indicative that druids are bad. It could just be that there aren't many people playing druids.
---
You can live in a fantasy world where this is still a live possibility. As opposed to the generally accepted reality that they are bad. I have no stakes in whether or not you believe any of the stupid things you post, especially since you have admitted you are not posting in good faith.
---
Translation of OP: Why is that that some #NoChanges people advocate for base UI improvements that exist in retail and will be possible with add ons? Wouldn't it be more genuine to leave people with the shitty default UI and force them to use add ons which can break from patch to patch for basic functionality that literally everyone uses?
---
This is a technical problem, incidentally, since the UI will use the retail client regardless. We'll get the best approximation Blizzard can make, but I doubt they'll use resources to actively make the UI worse just to make it genuine. Also all of the things in the Vanilla Ui that allowed semi-automation are gone, regardless. That will not be coming back. So the actual UI is going to get a huge change for purely technical reasons behind the scenes, regardless. If that is happening anyway, and it is, all the more reason to make the default UI more useable. Playing the game is not the same thing as fighting with the UI. 
---
Twas the begging of the end.... 
---
It is a bug? Just because it was in vanilla doesn't mean it wasn't a bug. Are you saying all 'bugs' that occurred during vanilla aren't bugs because they were in vanilla..? 
---
It doesn't make it faster, but reading a book while power leveling a profession was always my go-to. Tailoring from 1-300 is multiple hours, get a lot of reading done.
---
Just spend more time in the alliance zones decapitating humans and elves... Dont see what the issue is? If he prefers alliance zones, you will spend more time in ally zones as a horde if youre playing right.
---
That would have been hilarious.
---
That's considering there's actually any thought put in to this "nochanges" movement in the first place and isn't just a dumb slogan for the masses to chant.
---
I am curious how you know this. Is this an estimation or is it documented?
---
Mulgore is beautiful, just the Alliance zones. Tirisfal is similar to Darkshore. So you can start as either Undead or Tauren and have him locked in for a while. 
---
[removed]
---
We all play private. None of us can say we do. Some of the moderators actively create content within private and have even been known to stream... Its sort of like the ugly step child, we all do it, we all love it, but we cant let it out of the basement for fear of staining our credibility.
---
No. We will continue discussing modifications because changes are inevitable. It is important to have an open dialogue, especially in a place designed for discussions, so that we can influence the inevitable changes that will occur. Being silent will not prevent the inevitable changes, it will only reduce our impact on them.
---
 
---
&gt;Mage or Priest for someone who wants a bit of everything
---
Priests can heal. You get more of everything by being able to do 2 roles. If you want "everything" pick a pure hybrid like a paladin or druid that can perform all three roles.
---
Great for bc. We are getting classic wow. Mot everything was balanced. And they wont be. Dont like it? Play shiity retail. But stop bitching about classic.
---
Mods where in classic, I was there, I used them.
---
Mods don't = changes
---
Don't like em don't install em, if ppl game the system with new mods they will get disabled or broken.

Loot sharing is the ture enemy!!

---
Class sets aren't gone from retail WoW forever, let's try and be fair here. Ion stated they'll come back eventually.
---
Besides, the class sets they made for Legion absolutely shat on anything that was made in Vanilla. They looked incredible. Not that the vanilla sets look bad or anything but the art team for retail WoW right now is absolute godsend.
---
&gt; Inaccessibility makes you feel like one person in a much greater world

It's a reflection of reality as well!

Let me guess who; Tips out?
---
I can't tell if they're joking anymore or if they've become terminally stupid.
---
Dumb question, what’s a muezzin? 
---
My ping averaged 4k on broadband like two hours away from the physical server on launch day and I couldn't stay logged in for more than ~5min. They aren't going to recreate that experience. The server instability on original launch was horrendous. 
---
We really don't even know what a stable server, if that is possible, looks like with the kind of launch day population we can expect. It has never happened. I imagine Blizzard thought about it and that is why they think sharding is a good idea, because six starting zones for people who are not constantly d/cing is going to be a new experience that isn't fun. Not saying they are right, but talking about launch day without talking about the mitigating effect of constant disconnects is disingenuous. 
---
How did you get up there? I started in BC so in wrath we'd just fly up
---
my biggest concern with the longevity of classic servers is the influence of Activision...
---
Lol toxic. Go back to buzzfeed snowflake
---
Warrior isn’t unfun, once you get ms it gets quite easy. The unfun part is not having range tools to solo pull in some areas at the start and getting beat down. Tanking in retail is more interactive but in classic it’s a necessity to groups and dungeon grinding and you’ll get added to a lot of friends lists
---
classic isnt even in beta and we already have a #numbaone
---
Finally, you are of age, &lt;name&gt;... of age to battle in the name of the Horde. To conquer for the glory of the Warchief.

No doubt you wish to find a great dragon or demon and strangle it with your bare hands, but perhaps it would be wise to start on something less... dangerous.

Ugh. i miss it so much
---
I am 100% using any type of LFG finder in Classic. The cancer that is trying to find groups for RFK / Gnomer from late 20s to early 40s is c-a-n-c-e-r.
---
Nope. I'm done with that nostalgia trip on pservers for the rest of my life.
---
You can tell they are joking because of the alternating caps uncaps characters in nochanges. Still they're worth downvoting for being an ass though.
---
I only ever saw two BoE epics (outside of raid bosses).  First was a Warden Staff that dropped in Inner Mara.  Second was a Skullflame Shield that dropped when I was farming ZG crocs.  I kept that one for my shaman's tanking set.
---
Lol that’s not quite true. Unless retail level 40’s have 10,000g. 
---
I admit it reads kinda like that but all I can say is it really happened. Maybe someone else had a similar experience 
---
I don't understand this new kid sarcasm.  Thanks for clarifying.  A rule for comedy is that being intentionally annoying, is still annoying.
---
Blizzard wont let this happen on purpose. It would make a lot of new comers get pretty turned off from that experience. I dont see them thinking this would be an ok route to take. The share holders would be pissed!
---
The current pserver im on has progressive content patches so when I levelled there was no searing gorge or sillithus quest hubs plus many other quests missing that were eventually added as we got up to the patch they were originally released in. It would make sense for bliz to do this for sillithus at least as those quests relate to aq, it would be ridiculous for people to do field duty for example pre mc
---
I want to say it took me 9 months focusing on it as a 29 think in BC. Wsg &amp; AB take forever and AV takes almost no time (I levelled to 70 after the first two). It may have been quicker than that, but it does take forever 
---
&gt; I needed to fill a void that I wasn't finding elsewhere
---
You could have played on a private server instead of rewarding ActivisionBlizzard for their crap.
---
I want to say it took me 9 mo as a 29 twink in BC, focusing solely on bgs after work in unorganized queues. I may be mixing it up with the insane grind but both took forever and you’re looking at at least 6-12 mo
---
Addons are a core feature of Vanilla and World of Warcraft.
---
&gt; easily
---
Convenience doesnt make the game more fun.
---
In Classic being bad was a general thing and it was ok for the most part. i Never heard gearscore or achievements. If you failed and wiped the group or had some special task in a fight you  Always had someone helping out with a tip. The world itself was a mysterious place with many dangers. 
---
I remember getting escorted to OG from TB with my lvl 8 by a lvl 50 Druid to get the FP and stuff. Through The fact that it was my first character and I felt somehow lost this was a huge thing. No one was left behind really. I cant remember kicking someone cause he was to bad or failed to many times (since we all failed at some point and wiping was part of getting used to the dungeons anyway) 
---
NO comparison to this casual shitshow it is since cataclysm..
---
Im actually a little bit scared that it won’t be the same when classic drops, since I’m already worn out by private servers and the classic feels won’t come back probably + investing time for a mmo is not as easy as an adult at least when you don’t want to miss every other games that come out..
---
Absolutely. When you saw someone idling in Shattrath with their full T6, Bulwark of Azzinoth or single/double glaives with mongoose, riding their Onyx Netherwing Drake - while you were there with no epics and struggling to complete heroic Shattered Halls - you'd just stop everything you were doing to take a second to admire this person and their dedication; they were the rock-stars of the server.
---
I've been a critic of the game since Wrath, the expansion that planted the seeds of the tree that has bore BFA, and over the years many have looked at me like I'm a fool. However I'm glad that finally we're waking up to this nonsense. 
---
What's going on? Here's what's going on. The greatest MMO of all time was bastardized so that blizzard/activision could make a little bit more money in the short term.
---
What would happen if this modern WoW player whiner (that doesn't even play BFA that he helped ruined) got his way.  He still wouldn't get a raid spot because he could no longer be carried and the amount of raiding guilds would be tiny due to no healers. TBC has 25 man raids for a reason. 40 man don't work with what he wants in Vanilla Class design. 
---
&gt; If you want fresh servers every 6 months stay on the shitty private servers. No fresh servers, no patches after Naxx, no nothing that wasn't in Vanilla WoW.
---
Fresh servers were in vanilla WoW.
---
[Here you go.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+a+muezzin)

its a pve guide and matyrdom is 100% useless in raids. if you get critted you're straight dead mist of the time and even if you survive with a sliver of hp, cast interruption is the least of your worries.

---
We humans have to stick together!
---
Tfw 31 and having money due to not having kids
---
(before downvoting me, think of the kids in elwyn forest, satanic demons, point made) 
---
I started playing WoW a few weeks after it was released. Knowing absolutely nothing, I went with a prot warrior from the beginning. I had nothing to compare the leveling experience to, as this was my first mmo. I had a blast. It probably took me twice a long to get to 60, but that was mostly because I would spend time pvping, exploring, and just enjoying the game. I wasn't (and still am not) into speed leveling. I made it to 60 eventually and became the 3rd tank in my guild. I remember us working through BWL and our main tank and off tank both went down on a boss fight. I grabbed the boss and we managed to get him down for the first time for us. It was awesome. I was never a main tank in our guild raids, but I had a blast.
---
The point is, your experience is what you make out of it. It's leveling slower? Yes. It's getting 5 man groups easy? Yes. Is becoming main tank in a guild easy? Not really, unless your the guild leader. Is it fun? That depends on what you consider to be fun.
---
I would do it again in a heartbeat. But you do you. Don't let us discourage you from playing what you want to play. 
---
Go back to /r/wow
---
Are you serious? Do you have proof? 
---
I can play the movie back in my head. Music and all. **I AIN'T NO GOD DAMNED SON OF A BITCH**
---
Worst part about this sub now is how many /r/wow people are here white knighting retail.
---
The point of the graphic isn't to say the new sets look bad.  Point of the graphic is to demonstrate how little differentiation there is between the newer raid sets, even among different armor classes.
---
What does rearranging the expression "don't put the cart before the horse" have to do with anger?
---
Do yourself a favor, unsub and check out a classic private server or the one popular instant 60 server for free
---
Awful guide. Also Progress is far from "#1 Classic Guild in the World" whatever that is supposed to mean. 
---
Having a different opinion doesnt negate the fact that its stupid.
---
[I love SEASONS](https://youtu.be/PUeedyXfyv8)
---
Well, I don't see you making any better suggestions. If you are nochanges I can respect that even if I don't agree with it, however if you would like to see some changes I think expressing your ideas would be the better than insulting people who think differently than you.
---
I've stayed subbed and am playing a private server.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That way I don't feel like I'm stealing the game, if that makes sense.
---
Addons were part of Vanilla.  They were optional content.
---
Part of the problem is the game started getting designed around the new UI features and that made it easier.
---
Fair point. 
---
Communities can create their own 'leaderboards'. Like instance clears or whatever. 
---
Seasons would scratch the 'Fresh Server' itch that is super prevalent in the pserver world.
---
Blackout with 16 debuffs? Should mages take Shatter and Impact too. Big lul. Spirit Tap is not very good but Blackout is ass.
---
We arent allowed to guide people to play private, despite the fact that we ALL do it. Be careful... I would NEVER recommend playing private even though its insanely accurate and was more accurate then the Classic demo and is fucking AMAZING... OP, you should definitley NOT play a private realm!
---
I have no idea. Imgur wasn’t working for me in two different browsers so I just looked for an image host
---
Im specifically referring to it's PVP usefulness. Never said it was useful in PvP. Some people don't want to respec all the time. These two talents w/ 4 points does that same thing as shaman talent counterparts with double the points.  
---
  
---
That is all
---
\*whoosh\*
---
&gt; The greatest MMO of all time was bastardized so that blizzard/activision could make a little bit more money in the short term.
---
Lol @ these nuclear takes. 
---
So, for a grown up answer, OP, what really happened is that since Vanilla the playerbase begged for removing attunements, LFG, a way for casuals to experience raid content, instant mail, removal of RPG elements like reagents for spells, ammo, homogenization, etc, etc.
---
I’ve read threads and threads from TBC onwards where players wished for things like these, as if the game is incomplete, or broken without them. Now, with hindsight, we can tell them they were wrong, but they didn’t know it at the time. 
---
More things that players asked for:
---
* People wanted to craft while the raw materials were in their bank and not taking up space in their bags, but now that's considered *Casualcraft.*
---
* Hunters didn't want to be the only class forced to pay just to DPS—but nowadays removing ammo is considered *Casualcraft.*
---
* On the topic of Hunters, wouldn't it be cool if they weren't limited to only three pets? Uh oh, Zoo's-in-a-bag are *Casualcraft!*
---
* People felt that mounts having different speeds was silly or unfair, but now boars running just as fast as Talbuks is considered *Casualcraft.*
---
* Remember when everyone wanted a menu tab for Heirloom items so they wouldn't have to keep mailing them between characters? *Casualcraft!*
---
* People pointed out that eating and drinking between every fight was *not* immersive, it was just mind-numbingly anti-fun. Uh oh, that's *Casualcraft.*
---
* Whacking the regenerating Treants under Dalaran for *hours* just so you could do maximum DPS on a new weapon was a frustrating, unnecessary form of grinding, but the removal of weapon mastery is now considered *Casualcraft.*
---
* People complained that getting a new piece of loot meant they couldn't equip it until they went back to the city and reforged/re-gemmed all their other gear—or equip it and risk getting kicked from the group for exceeding their hit-cap. People cheered at Blizzcon when reforging was removed, but now that's considered *Casualcraft.*
---
PvPers have [complained](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8197592358) forever that [gear shouldn't matter](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6520712399) in PvP, [only player skill](http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5116972819), and that eSports demands that [the RPG aspects of WoW be removed entirely from PvP for it to be taken seriously.](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13203880628)
---
Not to mention the constant hypocrisy of players:
---
* “Talent trees don't feel special, each step is just a tiny percent increase!”
---
* “Talent trees are clunky and pointless, everyone just copies the most efficient build!”
---
* “Hybrid classes are too powerful, nerf them!”
---
* “Hybrid tax makes nobody bring Hybrids!”
---
* “Why do we have so many worthless spells cluttering our spell book?”
---
* “Why do we need to keep tracking hour-long buffs on my raid members, they just feel like a chore/homework.”
---
So this idea that WoW Vanilla was “the greatest MMO of all time” is silly. If you want to claim that WotLK was the greatest (because it had the most subs, even though [that's a terrible argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/a96pex/was_watching_my_bc_collectors_edition_dvd_which/eciaodb/)) then you have to admit that catch-up mechanics, LFG, welfare-epics, etc. are the ideal MMO game mechanisms.
---
Warrior is the hardest class to level. Tanking at 60 is great to grab groups, and you can easily tank ALL pre raid content with a DPS build. Getting a spot in a raid may be more challenging as a warrior than other classes. You will NOT be given a tanking position in any guild. If you DO get a DPS position as a warrior, you will be expected to maintain a proper tanking set and be willing to conform to the needs of the guilds for specific fights.
---
In regards to the FUN of a warrior, that is entirely subjective. Some people love it, others hate it and others still (like myself) play everything.
---
&gt; One of the things I don't like about tanking on live is that there is an  insane pressure on never making a mistake. This is primarily a problem  only in M+, but it's easy to just get shit all over in chat. 
---
Vanilla is a very unforgiving game. On the one hand your guild will have expectations of you, on the other hand guilds are more tight-knit, on the other hand focusing and controlling 40 players IS VERY STRESSFUL and raid leads are often FAR more emotional and explosive due to the immense stress. If you fuck up, you will get shit on regardless of your role.
---
Raiding days and times?
---
Did u not want to mention any down sides to playing a glass vannon? Not rly fair there. 
---
Yep! I also got a krol blade on my hunter.  Sold that bad boy and was able to get the epic mount 
---
I can agree with you in that a game shouldn't force you to adopt an unhealthy lifestyle in order to play optimally, keep up with current content and keep up with competition. What I will add to that though is that firstly a lot of the pressure to spend your life inside the game came from the community itself as well as the developers' design choices. And as further food for thought here I would suggest that many players were not forced into anything; they *wanted* to sink their lives into the game because the game was so damn good and gave so much meaning to them that they didn't want to not spend time on it. 
---
Yes the game is more accessible etc. now and everyone can do everything because "we pay our sub fee just like everyone else" yadda yadda but the game's meaning has been sacrificed on the altar of convenience. 
---
And don't just take my word for it: Look at the state of the game.  
---
It’s clearly for tbc 
---
Very true, and if you look at the [timeline that realms were created] (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_creation_of_US_realms) new servers were popping up every few months for a couple years after release. 
---
Grey quests always reward rep but very very little 
---
Now this app s correct. 
---
TBC ruined the game.  The missing areas on the map like Hyjal can be a hint of content that was not added.  I am totally for adding a raid that was originally planned.
---
Well back in vanilla you could only get to friendly with the brotherhood on just quests alone. 
---
For the Horde!
---
I had no clue they did that in vanilla
---
Now let's be fair... considering the mix+match to min-max that was done and the general theme of giant pink crystals.. TBC had *really* bad clown suits. 
---
Nah his nuclear take was accurate. This game is garbage now.
---
I always played UD and am planning to zep to tirisfal on classic with my orc because I know the quests much better (and work towards exalted mount that much quicker)
---
&gt; was bastardized so that blizzard/activision could make a little bit more money in the short term.
---
This is the nuclear take. I love how the short term is 15 years. Only on this sub can you get a thought-process like that, haha.
---
Your gear may have been bad, but YOU were good enough to enter!
---
nah the ground portal takes u directly into naxx. These 4 portals were added in wrath
---
I have leved up almost ever class on a pserver up to mid to late 30's, i now know what i want to play, race gender ect.

Did this for a few reasons, i was sick of all the "what class should i play" posts, just go out and try for yourself. I put in anywhere from 1 to 2 days in each class and by that stage you know were it ranks in your personal list.
---
It saves me from wasting time in classic, yeah i know it will be around for years but there is nothing worse than getting into the 50's and you know that the class is not right for you, but you have invested so much time and gold you feel obligated to get to 60. 
---
Refresh game mechanics and quest chains, this has been a big help. Having quit before WotLK its been a while, but to my surprise i remembers about 70% of the quests, were to go, how best to chain. Now i have my own plan/lev guide i know will work for me. I'm not big on min/max but i do love efficiency while questing, with the odd break for a dungeon here and there.
---
Now i'm stuck though, not sure if i should push through to 60 (all the ganking makes this unattractive) and potentially burn out early, or just watch guides and poke my head in this subreddit to get my fix until summer.
---
You need 8 geared tanks for Naxx
---
I wanted to be sarcastic in the beginning, but the story was genuinely interesting and gave me nostalgia. So 10/10 would read again.
---
The scourge invasion event was pretty sick as well
---
This guy grinds
---
Most people I've played with have been considerate enough not to take drops while they were flying/riding over to join the group. That was pretty cold-blooded of that rogue to do that to you. 
---
Nah, screw that guy. He definitely should have passed on that. I would personally define that as a ninja loot
---
Why'd you go with T1 over T2 or T3?
---
Tbh just find someone to level with. I’m sure priests pallys or even rogues would like a leveling buddy. On launch there will be lots of people to level with.
---
According to all the information i have seen that is incorrect.
---
Paladin, priest and shaman all have tools or gimmicks that makes them better than druid at raw healing.
---
Druids had rebirth and innervate.
---
I like transmog, but it can't work in Classic.
---
Which happens 2 years into wow
---
If you're trying to say that the vocal majority (but overall minority) of players ruined wow by begging for changes then I agree with you. The loudest people begged and begged and slowly the game became a shadow of its former self. Meanwhile the true majority were like: "Wtf is this shit?" and unsubbed. 
---
Of course players complain, there are always people that complains about something. Your entire argument is basically to bash the players for speaking out what they would like for changes and the fact that Blizzard are listening to them, right?
---
Then why aren't Blizzard listening to the players now (and the past few expansions all the way back the Wotlk)? Sure, there were players complaining about certain stuff like having to buy ammo as an example in TBC.. I don't deny that at all, but that was a tiny, tiny minority. Compare that to players wanting anti-casual changes nowadays.. or for years, several expansions.. without Blizzard providing it for them.
---
Do you remember when the complaining first started about things getting easier? From my experience it happened the first few weeks in Wotlk, people started complaining IN MASS that getting epics were way too easy and you could literally faceroll a few dungeons and end up getting full epic gear. Who asked for this? I don't know and I never heard of a single person that asked for this, so it was obviously a very small portion of the players a.k.a the casual family man that can only play an hour a week.
---
Either way, Blizzard took the voice of the very small minority of players to heart and changed the game for EVERYONE. Why? Was it because they actually thought that it was the majority that spoke? OR did they want to try and EXPAND the playerbase to the more casual crowd because the older players were leaving by ever passing month? The answer is obvious.
---
When WoW started losing players (post-Wotlk), things turned more and more to the casual side of things. Why? It's not like the majority of players asked for more casual changes to the game, I actively played the game and what the majority wanted was obvious even back then. But Blizzard kept marketing the game to more casual players. **WELL, in 2013-2014 Blizzard added microtransactions** and profits skyrocketed because they now had their population of casual players actually wanting to spend money for pets and mounts.
---
I believe last year 50% of Blizzard's revenue came from microtransactions, which is insane in itself. So I'm a strong believer that THEY (not the actual majority of players) picked the route of the game back then to attract a new audience that would gladly spend $25 on a mount. Just like the global economy, we need constant growth to have a healthy economy and that won't happen with a population that doesn't consume.. which is why they took an anti-"nolife" stance.
---
If you were an investor right now you would realize how huge microtransactions are for gaming companies and how many investors that thinks the gaming industry is overvalued like crazy because of it. Activision Blizzard is not an exception, Activision and their investors wants to see those profit targets get beaten every quarter.. they will use methods to have it that way and it doesn't take a brain surgeon to realize how profitable a casual audience is with microtransactions in the picture.
---
Hell.. I wouldn't even be shocked if they would completely drop the subscription fee for players soon and add more microtransaction options if the playerbase keeps declining hard. Will that also be the fault of players since probably one or two guys in the WoW forums asked for it and you can use them as examples in your wall of text about Activision being the nicest and bestest people running a multi-billion dollar company that obviously cares sooo much about the veteran players of WoW..? Come on dude
---
That’s dope

&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA - PVP| Semi-Hardcore
---
Undaunted will have a decent core of players that have played for many years in both live and private servers but even if you are new to classic we are accepting all. But we do want dedicated players that will stick around and help. We are wanting to do both PVP and PVE. Our goal is to progress at a strong pace but leave no one behind in the roster. We are recruiting all classes.
---
&lt;Rules&gt;
---
Be kind and don't push elitism onto others. Just be respectful and polite and get to know the other members of the guild. Raid members are expected to be prepared to show up to raids on time and be ready to pull but remember to enjoy the game as well and not take it so serious.
---
&lt;Raid Time&gt;
---
We do not have a set raid time as most likely a lot of members might have different schedules by the time classic releases but we will get together and establish a raid time that works for majority. The current plan though is to run at least 3 nights a week around 3-4 hours.
---
&lt;Discord&gt;
---
We have created a new discord channel that will have class/boss guides to help inexperienced classic wow players to look for good information for help. If you are an experienced player we encourage you to post tips into the correct class/boss tabs accordingly to help out. Feel free to join us and chat: https://discord.gg/y8rBXsJ
---
Or add me personally at Feral#0846
---
if i like to pvp as a priest i go hybrid or shadow. but thats not even the point. its a pve guide, if he wouldnt focus on pve it would be a bad guide. and matyrdom is just 2 wasted talent points for a raidspec.
---
i have been playing Retail for about 1.5 years now it was confusing at first but i really do still enjoy the game. I will probably switch focus more towards classic when it is out but BFA, though flawed, is still really fun. 
---
I got lucky and got some epic pants... I think they were the Cloudkeeper Legplates or something like that. Someone bought them off me for a fuckton of gold. I want to say it was right around 1k gold, because I remember buying a ton of mounts for people in my guild. It was pretty early in vanilla too. 
---
Hes off his meds again... Crazy deranged rants that are targeted towards specific individuals that he will not name... Taking personal arguments and making them public without giving any context!!!
---
Imagine being this nasty over a game 
---
They probably just got back from the Goldshire Inn and wondering why the sheets are so clean
---
&gt; but that was a tiny, tiny minority.
---
That's your opinion. I can reframe the same arguments back at you.
---
&gt;Who asked for this? I don't know and I never heard of a single person that asked for this, so it was obviously a very small portion of the players a.k.a the casual family man that can only play an hour a week.
---
I would never believe your personal memory over actual data.
---
&gt; OR did they want to try and EXPAND the playerbase to the more casual crowd because the older players were leaving by ever passing month? The answer is obvious.
---
This much is obvious. It's also why WoW has survived fifteen years while every other MMO, even Wildstar—made be ex-WoW devs who thought WoW got too casual—have long since failed.
---
&gt; I wouldn't even be shocked if they would completely drop the subscription fee for players soon and add more microtransaction options if the playerbase keeps declining hard.
---
This is... the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Going free-to-play with microtransactions is exactly how all MMOs have failed. Look at poor EvE Online even.
---
&gt; Will that also be the fault of players since probably one or two guys in the WoW forums asked for it and you can use them as examples in your wall of text
---
Once again, you're pretending like the community didn't ask for these things *en masse*. I invite you to peruse the Ars Technica forums for TBC and see it. I know it might seem unbelievable to you, but *most* vocal players on the forums saw the game differently from you and they didn't have the benefit to see the damage their desires would have on the game.
---
&gt; Come on dude
---
I get that you're triggered as fuck by my post and would rather lash out than admit reality, but the fact is that even though I agree with you, you're choosing to selectively misremember history. I invite you to read the old forums, search for relevant topics and you'll see that most players in WoW's past saw what you like about WoW as *problems to be fixed* and not positive design *frictions.*
---
Exactly... Its a distraction. A slogan that doesnt mean anything and detracts from conversations that are very important. The only thing that has more changes than Classic will, is the definition of #nochanges. "No changes, every patch as it was!" "NO changes outside of 1.12". "No changes outside of those that remain supportive of the core design philosophies".... For such a simple slogan, ive heard about a dozen different definitions of no changes.
---
Those of us who are passionate about Classic, and are rational adults, ALWAYS have acknowledged that changes were inevitable. Its important to have conversations so that we can influence some of those changes. Picking our battles is important. Are we going to screech and throw tantrums when they inevitably update the display at the auction house and mailbox and how they function? No... Were going to choose our battles and remain calm.
---
Vanilla had addons. I would prefer if Classic did not. I would have preferred if vanilla did not. I will use EVERY competitive advantage I can get and exploit every potential opportunity I have to get ahead in the game... Meaning that a group finder would destroy the game. If they make one available, I will download it and use it continuously. In doing so, it will ruin my experience and I would likely get bored of the game sooner.

Mods, can we please consider banning u/caseofwhoopazz? This sub isn't his personal livejournal page.
---
&gt; In other words, the majority that couldn't be bothered to go into forums and pushback against the bullshit
---
Exactly
---
Nothing new here the loot tables bugged out during the 2.0 PTR patch vanilla was growing throughout its entire life cycle so a large % of vanilla players will remember this happening but it wasn't for the majority of vanilla
---
As opposed to content creators lobbying for buffs to classes they suck at and that Blizzard already said they won't change? Every single post asking for class changes shouldn't be on this forum. The devs already said it's not happening. It should be stickied at the top of this forum.
---
Go annoy those content creators then. No one is reading your journal entries here.
---
can you explain the bug in your post?
---
Got one in Feralas and immediately equipped it on my Rogue. My friends all laughed at me but It was perfect!
---
This is when you go to Stv and farm some of those Poison/disease remedy's that drop off of the witch doctors near the alliance camp, very handy!
---
Maybe you would actually know how to play your class if you listened to "crazy people". NM, just sit there hopping from private server to private server and doing nerfed tier 1 and 2 over and over again pretending you are doing a real raid with healers using idiocy like this.
---
[https://github.com/satan666/LazySpell](https://github.com/satan666/LazySpell)
---
You clowns can't even downrank heals without automation and want to talk about heal hybrids. 
---
But they can ask for buffs and changes to the class 3 times a day? When the leads said it's not happening?
---
So this disease all sorts of fucked up my life.  I had it and got on a long gryphon. Like IF to EPL or longer.  I realized halfway through that I was going to die midflight.  It, of course, happened and I released only to find my ghost at my destination GY and my body at my starting location.  I spirit rezzed, because fuck that noise, and it ports me to the GY nearest my body.
---
All that money and time wasted to end up exactly where I started... smh.
---
Decent guide but gets a fair few things wrong or misses some things. Healing focus is almost mandatory for 5 man content, and it's good for raiding as well, I'd recomend it over Imp Renew almost always.
---
If you're expecting high incoming boss damage on a tank and can time a PWS that well, you should be timing a Gheal on the tank post hit instead. You should only PWS that big hit if the tank is in danger of dying, in which case you probably already goofed.
---
Missed that you'll have the Imp-fort bitch and Divine Spirit bitch, you probably won't have multiple priests with those unless for QOL purposes.
---
Priests have two methods of healing, downranked heal spam or abuse 5-second rule and use Gheal. You don't just gheal and treat it as your main heal, if you're going to do that you need to be constantly trying to avoid casting it for stretches so you can get that sweet sweet mana regen. 
---
In general, any healer guide not dealing with mana regen is doing a dis-service to the class, it's the fundamental problem for healers in classic.
---
Some other things you'll probably see that aren't mentioned: 
---
* Silence priest, sometimes even spammed for a certain boss, especially if you're a PVPer as well and can convince your RL that it's gonna really help for the boss.
---
* Inspiration, it's in all the builds it needed to be in but I didn't hear it mentioned, it's actually crucial for raid healing to have that buff up.
---
* Silent Resolve is a real help to your tank in dungeons
---
Also as many others have said, Desperate Prayer aint castable on others.
---
I was rank 13 in retail vanilla on a shadow priest... I played retail vanilla... Quite a lot. I leveled to 60 on 3 characters, and had access to numerous characters that I raided with on my account, my brothers account and a friends. I play an awful lot of vanilla retail... Private servers are VERY blizzlike. The experience people have there, is relevant. If that offends you or makes you sayuuuud, thats your issue. A lot of the people on private, are there because they are passionate about the game. Is it 100% accurate? No. Nor will Classic be 100% accurate. But its better than anything else available, so we play it.
---
Youre sick. Get help dude. There is a way to present your opinion, that isnt offputting. You arent doing your opinions any justice... We read your non sense and it is more of a nuisance than a talking piece. You are the kid yelling and squealing to get attention at an adult get-together. Just go play with your toys and let the adults talk.
---
Private servers are not close to blizz like in anything but pvp and even that is wrong with spellbatching. The experience they have isn't relevant because there is not a real raid in 1.12 until Naxx, the boss armor resistances are complete guesses and the top players use mutliple forms of automation with auto downranking and dps macros with longer strings they could do in real vanilla that macro things that simply didn't work. Raiding on private servers is a fu@#ing joke and anyone that thinks it's close to legit is simply delusional or has no idea what their guildsmates are doing. 
---
You don't know what a real raid looks like, you don't know how to play your class and you obviously never raided. Instead all you want to do is lobby for changes to classes based on a BS, fraudulent experience, while lying about experience and attacking anyone who does anything as simple as linking a interview with the developers that flat out tells you to go play BFA if you don't like class design in Vanilla.
---
At least this one only comes from stratholme and only groups with a druid healer might not be able to cleanse it. Poor druids.
---
yeh its there around 44 just like most people haha.  i realised feralas is the answer to go from 40-43, finish up stv, and THEN start tanaris much later.  then searing gorge iirc.   but wew before i knew that 40-50 was always brutal
---
90k damage. yikes.
---
get your ass to mars
---
Lies about experience, calls other people "sick". Claims raids where the private server creators like Nost say they are complete guesses that also have people using basically bots to play the game is "blizz like". Oh and you claimed all these people were lying to at their own class panel lol.

On a wiki you can go back in time through the edit history. This means that on the Reputation page on the WoW wikis you can go back to 2005 and read:
---
&gt;What is Reputation Reduction? 
---
&gt;This is the term given to the effect seen when a Reputation from a mob or quest is lower because of the level difference. Once the mob goes Grey, or a quest is six levels below you, you lose 20% of the total Reputation possible for the kill/completion for each level. This goes this way for four levels, until you reach the minimum Reputation gain of 20%.

**&lt;UNITY&gt;** \- OCEANIC (PVP) Semi-Hardcore
---
**Alliance faction**
---
We are based in Australia (Sydney/Melb). We will be taking time off work at launch after then returning to work playing on a 6pm-12pmish schedule while trying to keep a balance of life. Weekends times are all day if possible.  We are mostly 30+ but we have a few younger members joining us as well.
---
Priority is raiding and Dungeons. PVP is secondary but still promoted. We will be using DKP (Sucide kings) as our loot distribution system and we will not be letting anyone just over-ride gear calls except to the main tank or unless there is some serious reason to otherwise.
---
**Anyone can apply** \- more the merrier just PM me on reddit and I can send you the discord info. This includes those outside of Australia who play in the same timezone. Feel free to bring in friends we don't have a limit on numbers.
---
**Rules**:
---
Standard non-Harassment rules.
---
&gt;vanilla players will remember this happening but it wasn't for the majority of vanilla.
---
I wasn't aware of this. I wonder if it'll be an issue that is glossed over because so many private servers continuously failed to address the issue themselves so it just becomes the unfortunate norm that each faction will get totally unwanted and wasteful loot. I tried to fix it myself on a particular server, but never got around to finishing it. Totally within reach of my autistic ass to fix it in a few hours then it shouldn't be an issue for them I don't think.
---
I didn't tank in Vanilla.  But I have been a tank in a hardcore guild on a private server.  And frankly, I think that's going to be closer to the actual experience than Vanilla was; while there will be plenty of players who don't know what they're doing, there's a lot more information out there now and a reasonable base of PServer players who will be pretty efficient.
---
With that in mind:
---
Yes, tanks will have a huge advantage in finding groups.  In fact, some tanks make most of their money from hiring out their tanking skills for 5 mans.  20% of a 5-man's members are tanks.  20% of the greater WoW population is not going to be tanks.  Most 60 warriors will be fury and can tank in a pinch, but generally aren't looking to do so.  Bear druids are rare and you're about as likely to see a prot pally as you are to see R Kelly dating a girl of legal age.
---
Raiding is a different story.  5-10% of a raid is tanks.  As you can see from above, that's at best half of what you need to support 5 mans for a server.  And by necessity, tanks don't miss days and they rarely retire or take vacations, so you don't generally have a lot of spare tanks on the roster.  Raid spots are very competitive, and your best bet is to find a group that's trying to form up a raid core at launch and hope they hold together long enough to get into MC.  Once you're a raid-geared tank, moving laterally between guilds isn't tough.  Of course, you don't want to move too much or you'll get a bad rep.  But breaking in is the tough part.
---
Leveling a warrior isn't bad, unless you're comparing it to literally any other class.  All jokes aside, it's miserable, and anyone that tells you otherwise is either a masochist or a liar.  But no, there won't be a glut of prot warriors at 60.  Warriors as a whole might be a little over-represented, but more than half of those will be fury warriors.  Anyone thinking of going prot is going to know that there will be tough competition for raid spots and that it will involve no-lifing both the leveling experience and the raiding schedule.  Prot warriors in raids is basically a job.  You need to be dying or otherwise have an incredibly good excuse for missing raids.  It's not just "hey, wanted to go on a date that night".  It's "we had a biblical flood and the power is out for the whole state".
---
Is it fun?  Well, depends on what you're doing and what you enjoy.  Raid tanking is probably the easiest thing you can do.  You're generally taking 1 add at a time (especially given the way shield block works) and all you have to do is generate more aggro than the DPS.  Occasionally you need to dance a fear or taunt off another tank for breath purposes, but most of it is just having the proper consumables and positioning, which if you've played retail at all in the last decade, you should have positioning down pat.  In fact, for raids, 90% of your job is done before you ever set foot in the instance.  It's about gearing and consumables.  Expect to carry 2 to 3 sets of gear plus a few random pieces that you swap in here and there.  5 man tanking is an entirely different beast.  You have dick for AoE abilities, in fact, Battle Shout and Demo Shout are your best aoe threat abilities.  Prot Pallies (what few of them there are) are actually far better suited to tanking 5 mans.  And most 5 man pulls are big.  3 pulls are pretty standard.  It's far more micro-centered than raid tanking
---
The pressure is there in Vanilla as well.  You are the center of every run.  And if you're an attention whore, that's great.  But it also means that you need to perform perfectly and quickly.   
---
 You'll be expected to know what to pull, in what order, and when.  You'll be expected to know what trash can be skipped.  You'll be expected to know the abilities for all bosses.
---
Finally, one thing you didn't ask about, rage management.  In 5 man settings and while leveling, maintaining rage is going to be a serious issue.  In fact, as a T2 or better geared tank, you're likely going to swap in a lot of DPS pieces when you go back to 5 mans because otherwise you won't be generating enough rage to hold aggro.  If you're with a group that's similarly geared to you, it kind of becomes the sort of free-for-all that modern WoW is, where you just grab the things that hit exceptionally hard and the DPS just burns down the rest.  Either way, the rest of your group is probably not going to understand rage mechanics.  Priests will try and put PW:S on you (make sure if they do you ask them not to), people will CC things that don't need to be CC'd (that could be beating on you and generating rage).  Resource management takes a back seat to rotation in contemporary WoW, but it's an important aspect of the game in Vanilla.  Often times you'll be working against your group, not because they're malicious, just because they don't know that a lot of what they're doing is making your job harder.

Where was this creepy little scene located in game again?

It says warrior but I’m seriously considering a hunter kuz it’s tied for my fav class
---
No link for my stream set up yet but I have the link for my write up. I’ll most likely do it on YouTube 
---
Not sure what servers you have played on. Paladin/Shaman tier gear dropping on the opposite faction won't happen in classic because it wasn't an issue in 1.12, only in the TBC pre-patch and maybe very early on in vanilla when only MC was out not sure.
---
Low drop rate on jungle remedys.
---
Spot on. 
---
Private servers are incredibly accurate. If you consider the wide body of data that represents World of Warcraft and consider the complaints your have, its a minute blip of data that is inaccurate.
---
&gt; Raiding on private servers is a fu@#ing joke 
---
Lets see... =)   Lets see how we translate in Classic. I'll be MC is downed in the first 1-2 weeks Classic is released (if its available on launch). I'll also bet that a private server guild is the first guild to clear BWL. How about this. We bet posting on this thread. If im wrong, I will no longer post here, and you will do the same? Want to take the bet?
---
&gt; You don't know what a real raid looks like 
---
I raided in vanilla retail. I can have a different opinion than you AND have played vanilla you weirdo... lol The rest of what you wrote is sort of weird and incoherent... I think that you may have some sort of mental illness. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it just makes it hard to have a discussion with you.
---
People cleared Siege of Orgrimmar for 14 months in MOP so I dont think people will get bored to be honest. Classic isn't just about the content that is presented its a very community driven experience. I honestly think just the fact that Classic servers wont have sharding(hopefully) will encourage people to play because they feel they can be part of a community. Also there is the idea of Burning Crusade or fresh servers so who knows. I wouldn't worry about it though.
---
Not that low tbh, considering how fast you can farm them at 60

They just said Summer 2019. I think most of the community is hoping that means June/July and not August.

I liked how the old hunter armor sets in Vanilla and BC were designed around wearing trophies from the bosses you killed in those raid tiers.
---
what do you mean you were not aware of this? i told you 3 times in twitch chat! but you didnt say anything
---
That's literally all this sub is now. I'm only subscribed because it's the easiest way to get actual news when it does come, but in lieu of any actual content to discuss the entire sub is just a big circlejerk of DAE RETAIL BAD?? xD
---
How much are they paying you?  
---
what does it look like in retail if you fly in between SW and IF? is that big plot of land still there?
---
I guess it does sound that way doesn't it. Haha. Naw man, I'm just looking for more stuff to fill the void till classic. Wanted to share what I watch and show some love
---
Here's what I imagine you did. You wanted to level your priest to 70 to make it an even number, but you killed a single Hellboar and your level shot up to 87 and you couldn't control it.  
---
I believe by the human starting area in a little hut by the lake. 
---
So you are saying addons should be a baked in functionality.  
---
By that logic, we can expect to see the following built in functionality in Classic:  
---
Dungeon group finder  
---
Quest helper  
---
Raid boss helper  
---
Automatic dispel system  
---
PVP spell cast alerts  
---
Automatic healing spell rank adjustment  
---
Sound good?

There are very few Classic content creators who I don't see as completely selling out as hard as possible using Classic.

Hello. Can you tell me why you stop at season 5? I haven't watched the entire show or even in order for that matter, so I'm just curious.  
---
Thank you!

All I needed to know.
---
Never watched streamers really unless it was a clip on YouTube. Once Classic comes out I'll be to busy playing to watch anything.. till then though. I do hope I get a few hidden gems out of this post though and maybe a good discord to get in touch with the community.. maybe even find a guild
---
False.
---
Every 1.12.1 client I've played on and had the privilege to dissect has had this issue. Maybe it is just private servers that have suffered the unfortunate neglect from it's owners and isn't an issue in blizzard's official source code. However I find it puzzling if it isn't a 1.12.1 client issue rather than a pre-patch issue, then how could it have happened across all the private server projects anyone can easily open up and check. Loot table items are flagged by monster number server side and then possible loot is drawn from a item number list sequence after the monster in massive spaced rows and columns text file IIRC, and I could never locate any filtration system by which they should or shouldn't drop relating to the item number attribute characteristic file regarding faction ID (I think triggering it made it impossible for other factions to see 0,1, etc.

Don't tell anyone.
---
I have watched some of his stuff. Some of its great. Thanks
---
None of this was in warcraft 3 lol. The reason why he hates elves doesn't matter any more than the reason why Kael was away from QT during the invasion. If it was important to the story, they would have included it in original text - but they didn't, and the reason why is because you can make up any number of obvious possible reasons or backstories and they wouldn't change anything about the story. 
---
I hate this obsession with "lore" in gaming communities. Stories aren't history books and they aren't written like history books. Garithos didn't come to exist through natural causes, he was created to play a role in a story. There's much more interesting ways to read stories than to mill through interchangeable details made up after the fact.

2-5 are the good seasons. 6 and 7 are fine. 8 starts the decent... and 9 doesn't exist as far as i'm concerned.

There won't be any fresh start servers. Not in two years, not ever.

If Classic is doomed it'll be because Blizzard screws up. Not because fans get bored.
---
Do you get bored watching your favorite sports team play the same way and win every time?
---
My gut tells me July 23.
---
My brain tells me August 13. 
---
I think we'll get a beta (perhaps a closed beta) announcement by the end of February. Soupa, Tips, Esfand &amp; the gang will make youtube vids and stream content for sure when that happens. 
---
a lot of us hold ourselves to higher standards
---
Erm, loads of fresh servers opened in vanilla, wtf you talking about? 
---
I never realized how pathetic that sounded. Currently I live with some friends. I'm making my way though and the WoW community has been by my side since my teenage years and I suspect you will until I die.
---
Blizzard will cancel it due to time restraints and release classic time walking dungeons instead 
---
Hey buddy, I think you forgot to make the lis-
---
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW I SEE

GOTTEM!
---
They specifically requested no retaliation on the forum post. Alliance are and have always been less than human.
---
Fuck you. That was one of her favorite zones. The Alliance, braindead as always, couldn't show up and fight on equal terms either. They attacked while the Horde weren't wearing armor in respect for their guildy. Genuinely fuck the Alliance and fuck Serenity now. I wouldn't feed them if they were starving.
---
I never realized how much Dustwallow Marsh looks like a seahorse blowing a bubble. 
---
No it's like yelling in world chat "We're respectully remembering a friend in her favorite place in Azeroth.". Don't twist the words to make it sound like it's ok for you to be a cunt.

I'm not the one who ran away.

I missed the internet 😂

WHOAH LOL

Check out Im AliveTV, this guy hardcore raids and is super knowledgeable when it comes to raids, min maxing and playing on a serious level. None of the youtubers mentioned have ever raided competitively, so he definitely brings something new to the table
---
Then your other healers were bad. You get sniped hard and you just overheal.
---
So you get 100% Rep as long as it's not gray? Also please do post proof.
---
Alliance saw shaman gear drop. Horde saw paladin gear drop.
---
&gt; don't need to prove anything to anyon
---
then why did you even try?
---
Appreciate it. I'll check him out. I played competitive in other games, was a super noob back when I played WoW. I'd love to play harder this time around. Will have to make time with work and the lady haha

Allakhazham guide from 2007:
---
&gt;This is the term given to the effect seen when a Reputation from a mob or quest is lower because of the level difference. Once the mob goes Grey, or a quest is six levels below you, you lose 20% of the total Reputation possible for the kill/completion for each level. This goes this way for four levels, until you reach the minimum Reputation gain of 20%. Example:
---
&gt;Morrowgrain to Darnassus/Feathermoon Stronghold is a level 50 quest. At level 56 it becomes Grey. The level rewards look like this:
---
&gt;|Level|Points|Percentage|
---
:--|:--|:--|
---
|47 - 55|25 points|100%|
---
|56|20 points|80%|
---
|Level 57|15 points|60%|
---
|Level 58|10 points|40%|
---
|Level 59|5 points|20%|
---
|Level 60|5 points|20%|
---
Also, it's pretty well established. It Is Known. Full rep from green to red. 80/60/40/20 % once it hits gray, minimum cap of 20%.
---
Yes I see that in his post now, his original post had no mention of what he was talking about and I didnt want to watch the clip atm.
---
There’s no land there anymore, it’s just the sea
---
Have you been working on any other Clasic projects since the Master Guide, snox?
---
Other people were sharing their stories? It's one of my favorite moments from vanilla so I thought I'd share.  
---
https://youtu.be/LMSrqrJs1CY
---
Here's one of his best videos.  
---
Omg I forgot about this, these kids were little demons lol
---
Platinum wow is good as well if you enjoy a little more humor in your videos.
---
I'm actually going to gloat about each and every change that ends up getting through so these morons get mad enough to stay on their shitty and oh-so-authentic private servers.
---
Wouldn’t they be influenced by their late (bag) work and design philosophy ?  
---
But I’ll sure love new dungeons with a classic spirit (grim batol ?) in some years !
---
It’s right by Goldshire! There’s a house out on it’s on by the lake where you can pick up skinning and leatherworking! More specifically, it’s upstairs at around 4:00PST!
---
I had forgotten about it too! Especially since I primarily play Horde!
---
Krol Blade from farming Tyr's Hand here as well :)
---
Dude I just watched that whole thing... Didn't read the title till the end. Lol. Funny but not exactly the content I'm looking for. 8 levels though, only in classic haha
---
Oh yeah, we all have to deal with similar problems ^^
---
Thanks!!
---
There is also the July 16 theory from that tease in the demo. 
---
Isnt it 1.12.1 though?
---
The fix was clearly on the backend and no one who developed all the scripts for pservers ever found a solution. It isn't like pservers ever had access to all the scripting and code on a real server, they made it up. 
---
The bug came back in the TBC pre-patch, which is honestly fairly common (someone probably didn't merge properly, this is a VERY common issue for Blizzard across all their IPs because their version management software is always an in-house solution they build themselves for each game for some bizarre reason). But it was fixed pretty promptly in vanilla, I think the same patch they made it so T2 actually dropped in BWL instead of both T1 and T2 dropping in MC. 
---
You paid them to play that? I just download the PTR since its free to play and do some sight seeing. I was checking out old dungeons, and yeah everythings different.
---
I didnt have Hunters Mark, or Eyes of the Beast, I couldnt find serpent sting and a bunch of other stuff on the other chars I copied over. The game is unrecognizable really. One thing is for sure, theres no "saving" live. Its too far gone.
---
What it is, is all there will ever be. You can't fix that shit. Its beyond repair.
---
Dammit you just increased my hype level!

Hand of Edward the odd's proc makes a craft instant:

[https://classicdb.ch/?item=2243](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2243)
---
&gt; Do you remember when the complaining first started about things getting easier? From my experience it happened the first few weeks in Wotlk
---
This started already in TBC, you don't remember the complains about "Welfare pvp epics" when you could get gear from arena by loosing 10 matches a week, or the badge epics. 
---
&gt; WELL, in 2013-2014 Blizzard added microtransactions
---
Wrong again, depending on what you call micro transactions this either started during Vanilla 2006, when they started the paid character transfer service and other character services or during Wrath when they launched the Celestial Steed as the first shop mount. 
---
&gt;Remember when everyone wanted a menu tab for Heirloom items so they wouldn't have to keep mailing them between characters?
---
What? You can equip gear that's not in your bags through a menu? It's not even casualcraft anymore, it's World of Menucraft.
---
This won't happen.
---
As he is yet to be mentioned, SoupaSoka makes good content.
---
No, I actually remember something vaguely like this. I can't confirm the story itself but im fairly sure I remember a period in Vanilla where there was some code where a mob might show a weapon it would drop. I can't find anything about it but I wouldn't call bs just yet as I'm at least 60% convinced that I've heard about this holding-their-drop mechanic before.
---
It's not entirely how it works, but I remember the endless threads on the forums asking for a non-clunky way to handle heirlooms between characters. Putting them on an account-wide UI was an effective solution to player demands.
---
Yup, proof is super important! People can make false allegations. It happens all the time. How do you suggest sharing screenshots btw?
---
Yea i am totally #nochanges and vanilla means vanilla but can you buff ret paladins?!
---
/s
---
Yah as a rogue I cant even do half the healing of a pure hps class. Gap is to large there 2
---
This is a new one. Thank you
---
Yes, why is why it makes no sense the sets from tokens are made to match the raid where the token drop.
---
so brave
---
You can be rational and still advocate for no changes. Further, there is no denying the no changes movement has left it mark since it keeps getting brought up. No changes doesn’t mean that even with the slightest change that people will flee to private servers nor that he movement failed. The purpose of it is that every time Blizzard considers adding or changing something there is a pull from part of the player base to not do it. Rational people, adults, teens or otherwise, will realize this. 
---
As you said, changes are inevitable. If you think that voids the whole movement then I am afraid you really don’t understand why many people subscribe to it.
---
I know this is difficult for a lot of people in this age of renewed tribalism but if people would put aside their own judgement and arrogance and think calmly and rational about it, there probably wouldn’t be such meaningless “discussions” from both sides. Goes for both no changes and those who are against that group.
---
That would be a lore clusterfuck.
---
Because you are picking a particular skill that worked a particular way and stating that the skill was bugged because it got changed in the following EXPANSION. Do you not see how absurd that logic is?
---
Do you have any real information that SoR proccing effects was a bug? The patchnotes that the skill can no longer proc does not prove that it was a bug. It also proves the developers wanted to change the skill in TBC. It takes some special kind of idiot to read those patch notes and come to the conclusion that the skill was never meant to proc extra effects throughout all of Vanilla.
---
Release new Classic servers ever x month so people can start fresh again AND release a TBC progression server (perhaps with a character copy option). Those would be my solutions.
---
I would be this |-------------------------------------------| happy
---
"Your kind"
---
'Hurr durr I press button I get teleport to dungeon I roll slot machine to see what loot I got!!!!!!!' 
---
Modern wow is literally a Diablo pepega simulator with soap opera 'make sure you're subbed next month to see who the dead elf corpse bangs and then kill her!' Story. Lick my dick AND my balls 
---
Ouch.
---
SoR is meant to be proccing things in Vanilla. It was how the game worked from 1.9 to TBC. It's not a bug. If you believe it is, find a source from a developer or GM stating that it was a bug, otherwise you are just making things up.
---
The devs have been affectionately calling it 1.13.
---
e.g. https://www.wowhead.com/news=288144/
---
But yeah, in essence it's running 1.12.1 on a modern backend.
---
There was a building in plaguewood outside strat you walked in that ported you into the instance. You had to be attuned.
---
Well it's not a bug. I dont know why every post in this thread that say it's not a bug is getting downvoted. There's a lot of zerobrains on this subreddit.
---
I don't.
---
But most people do. Because addons were in 1.1-1.12, which means they are part of #nochanges.
---
It's really apples to oranges pertaining to rpg themes. How is it RPG to you to smack ghuun or whatever his name is and he pukes out spooky skeleton armor which magically is teleported into your bag?
---
At least in vanilla/tbc, you killed the boss and your raid leader goes through its corpse and you decide who gets it. Anti-circlejerking is still circlejerking and either you suffered from fevered encephalitis in years past which melted half of your white matter and you actually like modern wow (their target demographic, iq below 90 makes it easier to sell store mounts) or you're one of these pseuds that thinks arbitrary contarianism =me smart smart big brain critical thinker
---
&gt;That's a semantic argument. SoR adds Holy damage to your weapon swings, but that doesn't necessarily mean it must proc things in the same way a white weapon swing would—and once again, their patch notes imply that it wasn't intended to:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;“Seal of Righteousness: This seal will no longer cause additional chances for weapon procs to trigger.”
---
The patch notes dont imply anything. It only states that the skill was changed in TBC. I dont know why basic logic is so difficult to grasp. Just admit your only goal here is trying to get Paladins nerfed. You have ZERO evidence SoR proccing is a bug. ZERO.
---
Yes
---
Thanks OP, this shows that this subreddit has some ppl with brains left :)
---
Most of the comments tho...
---
Hunters are a meme class. People need to stop rolling so many of them. They are just loot thieves. Really all they need is some +hit gear and a nightfall.
---
If you want to see a good collection of all the best youtubers/videos for classic just watch asmongold, he generally just watches thier videos.
---
Jesus christ calm the fuck down and quit being so triggered.
---
The fact is, SotC makes you swing faster, but nerfs your swing damage. The design philosophy only makes sense if this is the seal you're supposed to use to generate more procs of Judgements and enchants.
---
SoR and SoC are mirror images of each other, each one to be used with a different weapon speed.
---
SoR wasn't guaranteed to hit on every swing, which is how it was balanced, and nobody used it. No one back in the day noticed that the Holy damage component was programmed (unlike other +Magic School damage swings) to behave like a second white-damage swing.
---
When they made it guaranteed in 1.9 it became obvious that this replaced SotC in every way.
---
If you use SotC after 1.9 you're an idiot because SoR does everything it was supposed to do, but better.
---
If you think this was intended, then you're dumb. Especially because they fixed the procing problem two patches later.
---
Can I shamelessly plug myself? I've been working on classic guides on YouTube and plan on doing all the dungeons ASAP, followed by some discussions with irl friends who played vanilla, and then move into more community wanted materials
---
&gt; We will continue discussing modifications because changes are inevitable
---
They may be inevitable only because people constantly moan about it.  There were no inevitable changes as it is.
---
No shit. Private server guilds like Progress are filled to the brim with autistic egomaniacal narcissists, so it's no surprise to see this claim already.
---
Yeah, Well back then Edgemasters wasnt worth anything at all. I remember seeing loads at AH for like 10g each
---
Nothing says passion like droning and mumbling in monotone. 
---
&gt; There will be differences and changes, even if they aren't intentional. 
---
Why are people always coming with this definitive "there WILL be more changes 100%"? Where do you come from? 
---
Blizz so much has only stated there will be loot trading and possibly sharding at start but that's it. They pretty much confirmed not making any more changes.
---
Classic pally gear makes me drool. I don’t know if it’s the gold or the nostalgia but god damn I know what I’m rolling. 
---
I would be happy if it was good, sad if it was crap. I feel that any expansion should try not to repeat the basic mistakes, which are:
---
- leaves the old world behind in favour of new zones
---
- portal cities
---
- flying mounts
---
- too many corridor/gauntlett style dungeons
---
- low level content no longer relevant
---
My only hope is that it won't coincide with my plans for holidays in June.
---
&gt; And its not like Vanilla itself didnt change from 1.1 to 1.12. So #nochanges also goes against what Vanilla itself tried to do, which was evolve and keep things fresh for its players.
---
-#nochanges means anything from 1.1-1.12
---
- yEa BuT hOw dO yUO NoCHanGes if vAniLLa cHaNgeD?!?!

You cannot draw theories like this when the product isn't finished yet.
---
Human warrior. Pretty unique I know.
---
That would require me to watch his stream. His hijacked stuff on YouTube can be pretty funny though
---
Plug away. Link your channel
---
Actually, this isnt Vanilla, its Classic.
---
Allan please rotate NPCs
---
Haptix gaming must watch for uber pvp insights. 200 iq If you can follow his guides. Alive, as mentioned, great attitude. Platinum wow is super entertaining on the other end of the spectrum (leveling + fun). There’s a few hardcore pvp movie creators like stormx. 
---
Sorry but I cant stand madseasonshow/wowcrendor, his pace is beyond slow and the content is so watered down. Tipsout is a sensationalist, and while I do enjoy many of his videos, he’s not a great analyst, and he doesn’t have a deep understanding of top end gameplay. Esfand is super fun with his ret pala, but ret is still a meme spec for raiding, unless you take it to absolute extremes (which he does, granted). 
---
can you elaborate? July 16 wouldn't be horrible
---
I had similar thoughts back then, people talking about raiding quarters and I was yet to understand the difference between PvE gear and PvP gear ^^
---
They shouldn't have gotten paladins. And Ally should have never gotten shamans
---
Never heard of Haptix. I'll check it out. As for crendor, he's the Bob Ross dude... Don't forget the pretty little trees. Haha, his content is actually pretty good, kinda like Frost, you gotta get passed the voice. Thanks!
---
If it takes them additional time to get a quality product shipped then so be it.
---
Stopped reading at Cat DPS taking up debuff slots - they don’t. You only use shred and finish off with ferocious bite. 
---
OP everytime you post. Its killing your karma. People obviously dont agree with you. Just stop 
---
Indeed. And having a darkmoon card: Blue dragon and innervate and you'll never have to spend gold on manapots (though you'll have quote a few angry priests for not using innervate on them)
---
Never heard of count down to classic. Will look it up. Thank you
---
actually Alive is a warlock player and a freaking good one, but mentioned that to him as well
---
It's only there at certain times of day? And why are you giving the time in PST time zone instead of server time?
---
Dwarf priest is the only priest
---
Classic will release on July 16th and here is why:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/
---
I think being not frustrated when I try to buff a lowbie because I have to bring up my spellbook to guess the right rank buff to use would make it more fun, because I think buffing people is fun.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019
---
BC was perfect, if you were not ready for the commitment to a full time 25man raiding guild you had Kara and ZA + 5 man content that was hard but very rewarding through the badge system. it felt like no matter what you were doing you were working towards something of substance. community was huge if you were a good dps, tank or healer you would log on and people would ask if you wanted to do the daily heroic or come to a kara run. if you were a toxic player you were pretty quickly found out and often times would find it hard to get a group. 
---
I think the strict no changes is said to be as intolerant as possible to any changes made. A point to prove that the sloap is slippery and can changes made here and there compound to more and more. Does that make sense?
---
&gt;Actually, this isnt Vanilla, its Classic.
---
Actually; "first and foremost is authenticity as our goal."
---

---
As per the count down channel you mentioned. What episodes would you suggest that you enjoyed most? There's 89... I'd like to start somewhere. I'll look through the titles, but if you have a favorite, let me know. Thanks again!
---
Alt naxx runs   :O
---
Who casts this? And how do I avoid it?
---
That's the thing with modern WoW. As much as I want to see all classes have different sets, this just makes more sense. And if you don't like your current gear, there is the transmog option (which I personally do enjoy).
---
Alliance looking like bananas. Meanwhile the _real_ faction looking good.
---
I’m stuck between a Human Warrior or Gnome Mage myself. That should be enough time for me to decide...
---
dude  
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=1315/lei-of-lilies
---
So use an addon or macro then. Addons are a core feature of Vanilla. QoL changes is not.
---
There’s a big gap between balancing classes on Classic and getting full Retail. We all have our opinions, and IMO that would be a better game.
---
I think his favorite color was blue. Or was it yellow?
---
tbh so many people will be playing dwarf priests this time around, I doubt she'll really have to go dwarf. It's not like you need 10 priests with fear ward.
---
Jokes on you, I play a troll.
---
This is true
---
Cat debuffs/bleeds weren't worth it until WotLK for PvE dps. Vanilla/tbc cat is just shred spam + FB while powershifting.
---
Loot sharing and sharding at launch aren't huge pillars of gameplay like old world, lack of flying mounts, Vanilla itemization, class identity etc etc.
---
The reality is that most of the community doesn't give a crap about sharding and loot sharing because it isn't going to impact the reason they are playing Classic to begin with. Nor are updated graphics or animations or any of the other small nitpicks that people obscessing over this product come up with on a daily basis.
---
If your reason for wanting things to be 100% same to the pixel is "authenticity" or "nostalgia", i don't think it's a good enough reason, and the long term sustainability, playability, and attractiveness of the product in line for a 2019 release should be more of a factor in design decisions. There are many annoying and ugly things about the old client that I'm happy to never revisit ever again.
---
The problem is that Garithos' backstory isn't mentioned anywhere in Warcraft 3, and before him there's no indication that anyone would be mad about elves. He appears in TFT, is a major dickbag, then is killed off. All the background info we have of him is scrounged together from Dev Q&amp;As that were held 10 years later. No wonder I don't remember reading any of that back when I was interested in it.
---
I can also vouch for “Countdown to Classic” sooo good.
---
Also check out the podcast “Deftalk” another great listen and it features Kargoz frequently and have had other Youtubers on such as Scorecraft, Platinum WoW, Esfand to name a few.
---
I think they just gave up on trying to make cool armor because everyone just tmogs anyway.
---
Ye ye I wish I were a girl I’d enjoy that voice even more, peace.
---
Yeah he’s pumping then out:-D lemme think for a sec
---
I had always assumed that it was intentional the second time around (TBC pre-patch) since each faction now had all 9 classes technically so the legacy content was adjusted accordingly. 
---
It's not poor druids. It's poor my friends who I will "accidently" forget to heal once we're finished in the instance. I will be fine, I can just heal myself.
---
#85 - pala pvp with drakova. Highly recommended! Drakova knows his shit
---
Ep.64 nost meeting was interesting
---
God, I want to go back
---
Ep.62 pvp with ohgee/haptix
---
Yeah you're definitely right, it's a very strong ability to have and is perfect for Warlock, and contributes to why I'm pretty sure I'll go Warlock. That said, I was more referring to the "current" (or how it was in Legion... haven't purchased BfA) healing of Warlock, where you can just... face tank literally anything that doesn't instakill you.
---
It’s the adoption of the concept that sarcasm works via text, which leads to toneless sarcasm in person as a symptom. Sad, really.
---
Ep.49 deconstructing meme specs with keftenk. HR!
---
Already been listening to one of them. I'll listen to these others you've mentioned. Thanks man. Appreciate it
---
Ep.53 everythibg mages.
---
Think you got something to play with now:-D
---
Drakova one was top prio. Yw thanks for asking and enjoy..
---
It was supposed to be live for TBC but not for the pre patch. Some people after all were still raiding.
---
Sharding in the first week, to handles the peeks im totally fine with.  
---
even if they dont do it and it will be a farm fest, im also fine with.
---
The whole loot sharing is a 100% no go.  
---
This is a mechanic that wasnt in Vanilla.  
---
^(This whole sub is going down the drain with all these repetitive post every day.)  
---
^(i would suggest the auto mod, deletes post with sharding and loot sharing....)
---
they said summer 2019.  
---
You can't make out of that if its going to be, begin, mid , or end.
---
We'll just have to wait and see.
---
Or they'll announce more info, but until then, we know its going to be summer 2019
---
In vanilla, you will have to do nearly all the quests in every zone anyway, so the question really doesn't have to bother you. 
---
That I do. Thanks for your input. Any suggestions on discords? You already in a guild for classic? I'm still doing my research. Don't want to go in full noob like I did back in my early 20s. 
---
&gt;the desert
---
Also, it's plains not desert, you know like where people go on safari IRL.  Tanaris is a desert. 
---
I feel like the souls of innocents would summon a doomLORD
---
Gotta agree with this. To be completely honest, I'd even take a game created in the spirit of vanilla/TBC. Take all the good elements of both and create the perfect MMO.
---
Dont get me wrong vanilla was and always will be my favorite. But I have done it all before. Still going to play the shit out of it regardless
---
Yes I remember tanking a few bosses in TBC too, there were I think at least two mage bosses that a mage had to tank with spell/elemental resist and shields but I'm not really counting this in my decision for class choice in classic. Not saying I don't believe you that you didn't tank a few mobs in dungeons at lvl40, but I'm not going to use mage-tanking as a factor in my class decision for classic. 
---
sniping is not good healing ffs
---
I would be very happy, as long as they kept the spirit of Vanilla/TBC.
---
Take all the good elements of both and throw it into one game. Better spot for offspecs in PVE/PVP, 25 man raids to make getting loot and organising easier, a way to get pvp gear without grinding for months daily etc etc.
---
I'm in the same boat. I was torn between Mage and Priest. Currently I have settled for the Druid then. Makes sense, right? Ultimately I'm quite certain that this decision will change anything between Pi and Googol times from now until release and then there's always this chance that my brain won't give a darn eff and inside the character creation screen something completely random may happen. 
---
But if it's really just between mage and priest I'd personally lean towards the priest. In a raid, everything is boring, doesn't matter if it's healing or DPS. Shit just becomes challenging in Naxx. But as a healer you'll have much higher chances to join random dungeon groups even when your level is a bit lower. Therefore alone I'd suggest Priest, too.
---
It certainly is :D Always look forward to these vids :D
---
&gt; Now its kids to bed by 8pm, and uninterrupted gaming from 8-12.
---
Look at Mr. Fancy over here with his kids who actually stay in bed.
---
Kazak appears.
---
Buncha dead kids
---
nopes out.
---
You get this garbage from the trash mobs in Stratholme. I think it's most common on the living side.
---
Alliance had the best quests.  Horde had a sort of the theme of a demonic conspiracy but it never really went anywhere.
---
I could easily argue that  we are not power rangers and by so we don't need to be of multiple colours at any cost. 
---
In my dressing room when I play for transmo, older sets are not even counted 
---
Let's call it &lt;Neglect&gt;
---
&gt;the community doesn't give a crap about sharding and loot sharing
---
Loot Trading will basically remove Raid PuG for Classic. You can never run a pug and be sure that groups of friends join, unequip the items they want to roll on for a friend, and roll for a friend, so you can never know that the 8 people who rolled on loot you also want are a bunch of friends that will trade the loot after the raid... This will affect the majority of the community because the majority doesn't do organized raids in a guild.
---
Not on my server.  As soon as the news about getting Nax level gear as regular quests rewards at 70 hit raiding died.  I actually ended up on a Nax pug because there were so few people left willing to raid that the guilds trying to do nax would take anyone with BWL tier gear in their attempts.
---
Time to avoid Stratholme
---
*laughs in dwarf*
---
Any healer but a Druid can help you get rid of this though!
---
I remember being able to log off instantly mid flight and it would let you land early at a closer path. 
---
You’ll find all sorts of good stuff through the podcasts depending on your interests..
---
As for guilds, I don’t have time to build relations before classuc, but I will count on playing with some good people come classic at 60 and join some good guild at that point!
---
So you have to make up your mind about what you want. Do you want Vanilla or do you want something different?
---
All these talk about "balance this, balance that". Doesn't matter.
---
Classic is Vanilla. Should be Vanilla. You know a game which already was? It's not a new game. It's not an "idea", it's not an "experience". It's an old game, being brought back so people can play it. In whatever shape it was then. It should never be changed because then it's not the game it was, it's not Vanilla. Shall we then petition Blizzard to "bring back Vanilla" *again*. It's idiotic.
---
Ill be honest, the only reason i like most of the tier sets is cause most sets are "basic" in comparison. Its mostly cause they are well cimplemented, not cause the sets look amazing by themselves
---
My 2 cents tho
---
I missclicked accept on the phone, and hit upvote
---
You clever devil
---
I absolutely meant it when I said I hated both then and now what they did.  It's awful.  But I see now I should have taken the fact that people back then would have been much more naive, and I was too back then, more into account.
---
I see now "stupid" isn't the right word in the context of that time period, so I take that back.  I probably should have said "naive."  Nowadays I've learned that you always have to protect yourself against the worst pieces of shit when there's any possible threat because the nature of the internet means everyone is connected, including the "always someone's" of the world.  In this case, there's always someone more morally bankrupt than you think there is.
---
why did you link wowhead instead of thottbot?
---
I grinded a few levels there and probabaly tossed 200 away
---
&gt; like the ugly step child, we all have it, we all love it, but we cant let it out of the basement for fear of staining our credibility
---
yeah, should have not taken that holidays in Africa...
---
They’re up there with a few other guilds.
---
as a hunter main, it annoys me more than it should that he has some addon to make his auto shot hits yellow font
---
I cant wait till the final boss of WoW ever ends up being summoned by this shits so they actually have some impact on the game instead of just being super creepy
---
Lol well I'm entitled to my opinion. Thank you for yours, though.
---
Is there another guide you would recommend ?
---
It would depend very much whether it was any good or not. That said, I think there's hardly any chance that this will happen.
---
You
---
Will
---
DIe
---
Sure you save 100g. Saying to a complete noob that "you get a free mount". The poor guy is going to hit 60 and see the quest chain adn think something like "Hey they said this was free!!"
---
Tips out, eafand, stay safe 
---
Eh I’m oceanic based so not great RP following hah, but I generally go straight pvp server

&gt;I'm entitled

Who told you they are innocent?  
---
They are a fucking cabal!
---

---
These days fury warriors will be all over that MBB.
---
Raserisk, without a doubt the best raid boss guide creator
---
That's good because you won't be doing high end content with some random spastic spec. 
---
There is media about anything now days. Positive or negative it’s all just a specific groups opinion and won’t really represent success.
---
Generally I believe companies trying to buy into the common media is their downfall. Ingenuity is really absent from game making lately, they need proper feedback to make the right changes but can be hard to get, because usually the loudest people are the idiots of society. World of Warcraft gave you a sense of early success that they took away because of bitches that thought it was too hard. 
---
Just my opinion, lots of people like the simplicity now but I’m just salty because they simplified it before I could really understand it :/
---
To be fair, this started already in Vanilla, not to the biggest extent but for example the AQ sets were very much dungeon themed and not Class themed.
---
I’m a SCATMAN!!
---
Congratulations, you can take what someone says out of context to insult them. Do you work in journalism by any chance? They'd love your work.
---
Exactly. People who desperately want to customise the game to their own personal requirements want changes to be inevitable so they can achieve that.
---
These will be the same people who will complain and quit the game when they realise that changes they didn't want also get implemented.
---
Those who are desperate for changes or 'fixes' are too naive to realise that they are a small fish in an ocean of other fish who have different desires and opinions about the game. 
---
The one thing we can agree on is that we like classic. So let's just have classic as it was, and then everyone gets what we originally asked for. 
---
1. Make Warlock
---
2. Get to 60 
---
3. Go to Valley of Trials
---
4. Cast Curse of Recklessness on lvl 2 Boars whent they’re engaged by level 1 players
---
5. Enjoy your epic warlock roleplay
---
Yeah, lets make an event on a PvP area of a PvP server and go to the forums to say "PLEASE DON'T ATTACK US!"
---
That'll work!
---
AV is good for main factions rep grind, the repeatable quests give rep to various cities.
---
I didn't realize how much words could hurt.... 
---
&gt;Sharding at launch can be arguably not a change because it's being implemented to preserve (not destroy) the original population cap dynamic—while avoiding log-in queues.
---
Trying to implement any feature is objectively a change, even if it is attempting to overcome an issue.
---
Maybe you would prefer sharding for less crowded zones and instant logins, and you believe that to be more important than preserving the single world dynamic that is lost with sharding, which existed in vanilla.
---
But that is entirely your opinion, and there are going to be a bunch of other people pissed off that the game was changed just to appease you and others who support that feature.
---
My point is why does it make sense to introduce changes to appease certain groups, instead of just leaving it the way it was so that we can have the original version of the game.
---
After all, changes to the game is the reason why we are all here anyway; we don't like what blizzard have done, so why are we trying to do that all over again? It seems so short sighted and makes no sense. 
---
&gt;Congratulations, you can take what someone says out of context to insult them.
---
That's was kinda the idea....
---
troll berserking
---
If you want to fill the void, play a vanilla private
---
You paid Activision Blizzard for that garbage? Foolish. You could have played Vanilla for free.
---
And I congratulated you for it.
---
Im planning to roll a shaman (at the moment) so he can dispel it? 
---
Nobody said Warlocks get 2 free mounts. Just the one. At level 40.
---
&gt;Loot sharing and sharding at launch aren't huge pillars of gameplay
---
The way loot works fairly, with it being impossible for people to be cheated out of loot in random parties (without it being apparent), is absolutely a fundamental pillar to Vanilla WoW.
---
In fact, the scarcity of loot and how it is split among players is one of the most fundamental aspects which define Vanilla WoW.
---
That's probably a good way to put it.  I honestly like tidbits like this being added after the fact to flesh out throwaway characters like him, but only for a "what if" thought experiment because, indeed, you can't know what the story of Warcraft III would have been like this if all this backstory existed back then.  It's very interesting and not hard to imagine how it would be, but you can't change what was the story of Warcraft III.  It was what it was.
---
The most important talent for drain tanking is the one in affliction which reduces your chance to be interrupted on hit by 70%. It takes 5/5 skillpoints tho.
---
 Overall, drain tanking is not viable for leveling. It’s more viable for PvP in endgame. It is viable though to use in your rotation in preperation of life tap AND only if you can get at least 4 ticks off Life Drain off, otherwise you will net lose mana. 
---
Just keep sending your VW pet and consume shadows if he’s low. 
---
&gt; Loot sharing and sharding at launch aren't huge pillars of gameplay like old world, lack of flying mounts, Vanilla itemization, class identity etc etc.
---
Loot sharing, sure. It's not really a big deal, and it doesn't run contrary to what people really like about vanilla. The reaction against it is primarily knee-jerk. 
---
But sharding? No, that's a fairly big issue. People want to walk into cities and see the familiar faces, see the same guilds. People like that consistency, and while limited use of sharding in the early-game won't really affect that prolonged use would - servers would be designed to be larger, splitting players up, until you're effectively on a megaserver like Guild Wars 2 uses. 
---
I agree with all of your points otherwise, but sharding is a concern. Not for a week or two, or at points of high load, but when the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj are being opened, that should be a server-wide effort, with everyone on the same shard of the same server working together. When two guilds both go to raid at the same time, they shouldn't pass by each other because they're on different shards. Players shouldn't phase in and out. These things don't matter because of nostalgia, they are genuinely part of the vanilla experience. 
---
Lol I didn’t notice that 
---
Yeah but most of those have a built in expiry date from one thing or another because of the legal situation they are in, the cost of running servers and competition, I don't know of any that have had 10 years of naxx that have been successful. If your on the wow server subreddit for awhile you will see what I am talking about, everybody who comes back wants a "fresh" server, and whenever one comes out people flock to it, most of the servers never make it to AQ patch then die out and people move to other servers. Sometimes they are mired in corruption and the players leave long before that. 
---
Not saying its impossible that people will enjoy naxx 3 years later, but I don't see how. I struggle to think about what I would do to entertain myself that long in, The pvp balance is so thrown out of whack with naxx weapons that rerolling a new character for pvp won't be worth it, I have been playing on a few private servers
---
I think he was Charmed by Sylvanas, but it was a loose hypnosis rather than a direct puppet-like control.  At the very least, I remember for sure that he agreed to work with her after she promised him the lands of Lordaeron after they took them back from the Dreadlords, but of course she betrays him at the end and has Varimathras kill him.
---
Yes, theres the building + ramp leading up to the last two FW towers, RH and Drek’s keep. Take 5 mages to suicide aoe bomb / ice block any amount of alliance players and they will die. 
---
Thanks! I think I did pretty well.
---
It's really interesting how you choose the wording " I'm entitled to my opinion" instead of the less whiny and more manly wording "I have a right to my opinion".
---
Yes, that is what I mean. It creates an incentive for participation and competition that otherwise begins to fade.
---
He clearly meant ‘Precise Spawn Time’ isn’t it obvious?
---
The intire definition of being out of touch, clueless etc. as a dev, is that the changes you bring to the game fail.
---
Devs have been making the wrong decisions because they don’t play the game properly themselves, and were thus incluned to listening to ”feedback” or you know ”we are listening to players”. 
---
The fact stands that ”listening” is NOT the same as understanding. It isn’t so in the classroom (no more homework please), not in the doctors office (give me xyz medication now) and not when it comes to wow developmemt (remove mastery, arrows and mind vision plx). 
---
The game was good for a reason: great design. Not listening to superficial bs. Let me give you an example of real listening:
---
”No more arrows or deadzone plx” should become ”I am tired of playing a hunter” or ”I want to be the strongest and most convenient class because I am a very competitive person”.
---
”Nobody wants to play hybrids” should become ”the raiding scene is too focused on personal dps” or ”the community thibks druids can’t tank”. 
---
Only that it hardly ever happens anymore. There’s an honor penalty to if you kill the same player(s) repeatedly. So if you kill the players in the same BG for 1-2h, you will receive only a fraction of the honor, you used to receive previously. 
---
Also, the fastest way to get to exalted is to wintrade/kill the front commander for rep if you’re losing. 
---
It is not at all desireable to keep AVs going for much longer than the initial baserace. And cursed be the person who caps snowfall GY
---
Well I'm MORE than happy to have an OG vanilla. I will absolutely love the shit out of it and spend months of ingame playtime on it easily.
---
But if it were up to me, I would like a brand new game recreated with the core spirit of vanilla/TBC. But I know 100% blizzard of new would mess this up so in reality it really is just a fantasy.
---
With this build you rely more on the passive regen from sacrificing your voidwalker. It's seriously underrated. 4% max hp every 4 seconds is stronger than a rejuv/renew that's permanently on you.
---
Of course this should not happen.
---
But surely there's some weirdo idiots out there, scrambling for their pitchforks, calling me a lunatic and an anti-christ for even suggesting that something should be changed. Bugs like this should just be fixed, period. There's gameplay element bugs like the rogue vanish - i agree this should be recreated. Then there's escort quest bugs - fix them. And opposite faction loot bug, sure fix it.
---
That's not "part of the classic experience". Whoever argues in that way should simply consult a shrink...
---
Not everyone knows this but you can reach mulgore with lvl1 orcs/trolls. mulgore is nice and often less populated than durothar.
---
Maybe it's different in other countries, but I thought summer was May, June, July, and Autumn was August, September, October?
---
Because everyone should love what you love in this game, right?
---
I strongly feel like I've heard this exact story, like verbatim.  Hmm...I can't remember for sure.
---
For me it was Stockade Pauldrons from farming mobs in Silithus.  And I got 300g for them (or maybe it was 400?).  That was a shitton of gold for me at the time.  I don't think I got scammed too badly, if at all, but I honestly don't know.  Looking back, that was pretty lucky.
---
Well you are entitled to your opinion of who I am and what actions a man should take. 
---
In my opinion, a man can do or say what he wants as long as it doesn't bring harm to someone else, which is the same right that should be afforded to everyone. 
---
It is also my opinion that talks of what a man "should" do has no place in a discussion about a video game.
---
Wow the far right and far left of those modern sets look amazing to be honest. I like it when they make them more class specific rather than the look of the place you obtained them though. Only tier 2 is was really good in classic let's be honest 
---
human priests are very strong as well. just choose the faction you like, priests in general are always in demand! the night elf starting zone is really cool.
---
Yeah but some of the tier 7 sets were really nice. I loved dk tier 7
---
Does it happen on retail too? 
---
&gt; I would like a brand new game recreated with the core spirit of vanilla/TBC 
---
That sounds cool an all. I bet you have many awesome ideas. And every other person have many good ideas. And when you add all that together over 12 years, do you know what you get? BfA, urgh...
---
Hmm I was sure my first epic drop was the shitty hammer of the northern wild and I was sure I got it from a leach in epl but I just looked the item up to check I was thinking of the right one and apparently it doesn't drop from leaches in epl :( my memory's are a lie.
---
I was a hunter so it was useless for me anyway. 
---
i think they changed it a little bit
---
&gt;Well you are entitled to your opinion
---
# Do you even know what entitled means?
---
&gt;entitled  
---
&gt;feeling that you have the right to do or have what you want without having to work for it or deserve it, just because of who you are:
---
So NO, I', not entitled to anything.
---
iirc they're constantly moving from the house to a different place 666 *unit of measurement that i don't remember* away
---
How often does this happen in retail? I've played up until Legion and I've never had this happen. The only reason it will happen (which it won't) is because of all of you people crying about it constantly. One of the biggest reasons to do it is to tick you, specifically, off.
---
Loot trading is implemented so that GMs will have other things to do. It hasn't been an issue in the past and won't be an issue now. You're being ridiculous. 
---
You always can to do something with that, alternative universe for example. 
---
I deliberately got the attunment done despite our guild being in BWL still. For the record soloing trash not so easy
---
Yeah, they get a single target version and a totem that will dispel diseases.
---
This guy tries so hard to karma whore by bashing modern WoW it's pathetic. Just stop, your post history is pure cringe.
---
Oh dear, I'm rolling a druid!
---
Neither did the AQ sets
---
Which was first introduced in Classic...
---
AQ and PvP armour
---
You're sexy though and looks matter
---
This post is bitching about a concept introduced in Vanilla Wow. It's moronic
---
Oof. Actually now when i think of it I would fucking love growing up with a deadbeat dad that sits in front of a monitor all day not giving me any attention. WOW I would feel so appreciated when my dad doesn't give a shit about me. 
---
His kids will end up with all kinds of psychological issues. I feel sorry for them. Well each to their own i guess.
---
Hey Yarrick!  I think I played with you on stormscale a long time ago. Do you remember Beevo the Tauren shaman?
---
Especially since the old macro/addon that did the downranking can't work in combat with the 7.3.5 API.
---
1) You may have a priest/sham/pal in your group to dispel it
---
2) Very easy to heal even if you dont dispel it, it's only painful if you're solo without a healer
---
None of it was done "On purpose", the interviews with john, and the other devs told us exactly what went on. They didn't have enough time or manpower to do everything, so they only picked the "Most popular" specs to create tier sets for, which was a self reinforcing stereotype. 
---
Also along these lines many buffs and changes had to be pushed back to TBC because of these time constraints.
---
As long as starting fresh is not forced I am cool with new servers. Since I'll only have 1-2 hours to play during the week (with the exception of weekends) you can be damn sure that I will stay on my very first server. 
---
It's not my fault that people rush the content and demand to start fresh and they expect every other person to do so as well regardless of their progress. This mentality should just die.
---
Not fussed about my karma. I enjoy a reasonable debate.
---
Some responses in this thread are reasonable.
---
Yeah, the circlejerking is really bad and frankly alienates those who are fans of modern WoW, but willing to give Classic a try to see what all the fuss is about. While I admittingly don't enjoy the current gameplay of BFA, I accept that the two are entirely different games, and don't see the point in low-tier meme karma farming that goes on here. I'd rather talk about the game.
---
I wish they'd just reveal it so I can book my long vacation. I can't hold off on deciding those for very long.
---
Official days (at least for US) Summer begins June 21st and ends September 23rd.
---
It shouldn't be a major factor at all, but it should speak for itself. A mage of frost or fire can tank in any level of dungeons. The methods may not be taunting and shields but I guarantee any basic mage player could do this. Warlocks and hunters rely on those pets mostly but it's nice knowing u can be capable without on in a pinch situation. 
---
It has certainly been an issue in the past - many people have reported on this.
---
In retail, loot is completely different. You can’t compare the two, since loot is much more scarce in classic. You have to do 50 ubrs runs if you want briarwood reed, for example. That’s 100 hours of /player. U think that’s worth some gold??
---
In retail, gold is completely different. It’s not that important. In classic, gold is everything because of consumables, item, mounts etc. Gold farming is required for raiders and pvpers alike.
---
Plus, I did not say ”it will”, but ”it may”. Contrary to op who states that ninja looters will simply go away, due to this fantastic change. Wtf. Get a clue dumbass.
---
It feels like you're trolling me. No one said anything about level 40 either and what in the fucking world makes you think some random guy would know the difference?????
---
Now you can ask yourself WHY you just use these 2 spells. You do not because it takes the debuff slots.
---
As a tank in vanilla, you basically have instant access to any 5man content you wish to do at any given time.
---
Awesome Thank you very much, Lets hope I don't change my mind in the next 6 months.
---
So you do not have certain healers per group and your other healers always push the players to 100% hp? That only shows me missing skill and a bad group setup.
---
CTC is my personal favorite, but I am pretty biased all around on this discussion to be fair.
---
&gt;It's really apples to oranges pertaining to rpg themes. How is it RPG to you to smack ghuun or whatever his name is and he pukes out spooky skeleton armor which magically is teleported into your bag?  
---
This is just extreme nitpicking.   
---
No, anti circlejerking is not circlejerking.  
---
&gt;'Hurr durr I press button I get teleport to dungeon I roll slot machine to see what loot I got 
---
You do know you still need to walk to the dungeon for the highest difficulties, right?  
---
Oh that's right. You're trash at the game, so you never get past LFR/RDF level.  
---
And WoW was always a slot machine roll when it comes to item drops.  
---
It does make sense.  
---
One example: You and your group clear the raid. Kirin Tor follows after you and gathers materials or magical energies which they use to forge new armor and give it to the strongest of heroes.  
---
Retail had tokens since vanilla. Both AQ and Naxx had tokens drop for the T2.5 / T3 sets
---
...but did the second binding it drop?!
---
not only do you woosh for someone else, you also fail at it because there was nothing to woosh at  
---
geez now that's embarrassing  
---
go back to your /r/cave  
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the clarification.

There are some diseases where its better to just die. Like the lowlevel -Str/Agi and -50% Healthreg Disease you can get from Bears. If you get that as a Warrior you better just die because it lasts at least 15min.
---
Blizzard has no idea when its going to Release. They said Summer 2019 because they are not sure. They will release a Alpha/Beta sometime Soon™ and then see how its going. If there are lots of problems they need to fix, it will take longer. If the Community says everything is fine, they could release it sooner.

It wasn't epic but I had both Feet of the Lynx and Sentry Cloak drop in early 2006 whilst leveling my rogue, of course i equipped them both without knowing I almost made a small fortune and carried on leveling.
---
To be fair this post sounds a lot like pserver experience and not like Vanilla experience, especially the Devilsaur Mafia part, which to all my knowlegde wasn't a thing in Vanilla, but only formed on the overpopulated pservers. With original players caps and region restrictions running a 24/7 devilsaur mafia will be a lot harder and a lot less rewarding.
---
Still think Silithid Pox is worse, since you get it levelling and you're usually solo, therefore nobody around to dispel it for you
---
Did someone say?...
---
It depends on the equinox, spring is 20th March - 21st June, summer is 21st June - 23rd Sept, autumn 23rd Sept - 22nd Dec and winter is 21st Dec - 20th March.
---
You can when Blizzard teases it themselves.
---
While i agree that Vanilla should not be sharded (although i could live with a exception for the launch days), sharding has nothing to do with "seeing ppl from multiple servers", that is CRZ. 
---
Loot trading is cancerous retail shit that will leave a massive stain on the game. If Activizzard is gonna cheap the fuck out and shard for the first week, whatever, it’s gonna happen anyway.

Are you legitimately this retarded, or are you just trying to meme?

More importantly, on the southern hemisphere it is "summer of 2019" already!

It was fun to talk with GMs during retail Vanilla.
---
Unfortunately with the new Activision Blizzard cost cutting, these sorts of interactions will be rare if not non-existent.
---
At least they still occur on private servers to this day.
---
&gt;If they want to turn Classic into Classic+ qol edition.
---
Classic can't be Classic+, because, by definition, it is Classic. Again, Vanilla WoW and Classic WoW are two different things. Vanilla WoW is gone, and cannot return.
---
QoL isn't inherently bad. It can go too far, but things like: having a Guild Calendar in-game without addons, or UI timers, alarms, autoloot without holding shift, .etc are all normal QoL improvements that make sense.
---
&gt;Why are people always coming with this definitive "there WILL be more changes 100%"? Where do you come from? 
---
This isn't the original client, this isn't the original server, I'm like 99% sure Ion said it will use the network stack from retail. Things like Starcraft: Remastered and Warcraft 3 Reforged are new graphics kinda "pasted" over the top of the old game. Classic Wow is old graphics and old content "pasted" over the top of the new game. Emulating every single little quirk and oddity from the old game is not feasible, and may not even be possible.
---
&gt;Blizz so much has only stated there will be loot trading and possibly sharding at start but that's it. They pretty much confirmed not making any more changes.
---
Ion at Blizzcon stated that the UI was fair game. Blizz also hasn't fully committed to trying to emulate all previous behavior, things like spell batching, .etc are still up in the air AFAIK. They also haven't said anything about emulating old bugs. Not only that but they can't just release the exact same game, we already know some modern things like native color blind support will be in Classic. They also will be implementing Battle.net to some extent, and the details of that haven't been revealed to us either.
---
Hopefully they'll also continue to use sharding after launch in order to handle big events and city raids, not by splitting people off into separate shards, but doing it EVE style where they can put all the players on a "heavy duty" shard on separate hardware designed to handle many more players than could normally fit into a region.
---
Wow great response. 
---
By the light! 
---
shit's gonna be even funnier when idiots like these will claim world first on 14 years old game that's also nerfed down. 
---
remember Ascent, Drama, Nihilum? yeah, fuck'em
---
&gt; Vanilla WoW and Classic WoW are two different things
---
Which aim to be as close as possible. And adding qol doesn't help this.
---
&gt; Emulating every single little quirk and oddity from the old game is not feasible, and may not even be possible.
---
It does not mean we shoudl be "open to change". Yes, there are technical issues, which are unavoidable. But you turn it into "changes happen anyway so let's discuss what else we can change".
---
You just prove that "slippery slope" is not a fallacy. One thing changed because it was technically inevitable and people start using it as a basis for asking for more changes.
---
Ahh i remember the days of trying to get four random strangers to participate in the ritual with me so I could unleash an unbound doomguard on the city. Then they changed it to a standard spell summon.
---
KTM, and some sort of damage meter. They're my go-to's. Outside of that I like the default ui.
---
There's no denying that raids will expect you to not pull threat and be decent at damage now though, and I think that's fair enough.
---
On both sides people do. It’s the few who give the many a bad name. Some men just want to watch Azeroth burn.
---
Hopefully not mandatory tbc, that ruined wow for me and I'd drop classic in a heartbeat if it came to that.
---
I feel like Discord is a widespread playform these days. People still have websites. There are plenty of places to upload pictures you can link to forums and here on Reddit. I hope they bring back realm specific forums.
---
There are lots of games where I am pro season, but wow really isn't one of them, at the end of the day I want to pvp against similarly geared (within 25% or so) equally skilled players. Everything else up to that point is fun but not really the reason I play personally. So from this viewpoint I think seasons and fresh start servers could be detrimental if overdone.
---
It's like music really. All the best rock songs have already been written. How many more {class} themed sets can anyone think of?
---
That would be the dream, only hard part is finding some1 with a compatible schedule.
---
The classic sets all instantly evoke thoughts of the class they are designed for, whether you like the aesthetic or not.
---
Those modern sets...definitely something to do with bones...but impossible to tell what the character class is underneath
---
Me and several other warlocks raining infernals around GS is one of my best wow memories

There is a macro that does this

---
I got my 1 and only BoE epic, the Krol blade in Felwood off a wolf. When I got it it wasnt worth shit sold it for like 100g or something. 
---
&gt;This is Vanilla
---
Actually it's Classic, not Vanilla, not 1.1, not 1.1.1, not 1.1.2 ect.
---
You're never going to get Vanilla unless you invent a time machine and return to 2004.  While you're there murder Ion Hazzikostas. 
---
As long as it's before Halloween, don't want to miss another Hallow's End

We don’t even know how it’s going to be implemented yet. What if they confine it to raiding/ML only? We need more details before we freak out. Blizzard doesn’t read this.

---
Class change =/= Balance 
---
I feel like classic hasn’t come out yet. I don’t even want to think about expansions until I’ve played this game first. 
---
&gt;Which aim to be as close as possible. And adding qol doesn't help this.
---
It aims to be an authentic vanilla experience, not as close as possible. No longer making players hold shift to autoloot doesn't make it no longer an authentic vanilla experience. It does make the game significantly less of a PITA to play without watering anything down or removing any social aspects.
---
&gt;It does not mean we should be "open to change". Yes, there are technical issues, which are unavoidable. But you turn it into "changes happen anyway so let's discuss what else we can change".
---
Yes, it does, because it is, at least partially, about the community's expectation of what the purpose of Classic even is.
---
&gt;You just prove that "slippery slope" is not a fallacy.
---
Slippery slope is a logical fallacy. Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean that it isn't.
---
&gt;One thing changed because it was technically inevitable and people start using it as a basis for asking for more changes.
---
The point is that it isn't going to be 100% accurate anyway, so it isn't as if you're choosing between "no changes" and "changes". You're choosing between "only currently announced changes" and "other changes" at best. If you know you're not getting "no changes" then the community needs to figure out what changes they can and can't get behind.
---
The presence of changes also establishes a difference in the purpose of Classic. If Classic were to be more of a historical project, with the goal to recreate Vanilla *precisely* as it was, that is a very different goal than Classic actually has, which is to just deliver a Vanilla experience (as Ion has repeatedly said).
---
The Vanilla experience can persist through minor changes, but a recreation of Vanilla can't by definition. Exactly what is and isn't a Vanilla experience is then something the community has to figure out. Essentially, the community has to pick and choose which changes it wants, not if it wants changes.
---
I find it telling that you also haven't pointed out how any of the suggestions I have made for changes (many of which will probably end up in Classic) would hurt the game or detract from the Vanilla experience in any way.
---
June is the very beginning of summer. Summer goes into September.
---
Blizzard is a us company after all. I’d imagine they go off the us calendar.
---
&gt; It was fun to talk with GMs during retail Vanilla.
---
&gt; Unfortunately with **the new** Activision Blizzard cost cutting
---
My face when r/classicwow thinks new = fourteen years ago.
---
Never fail to amaze me, r/classicwow haha.
---
The extra mana as a fresh 60 is more beneficial, but as you build up better pre-raid BIS you will gain more benefit from the +healing as you'll have a decent mana pool.
---
(this is what I've read on a few guides anyhow)
---
hmm... guess visiting.
---
I was expecting beards to be above it, honestly.
---
&gt; It aims to be an authentic vanilla experience, not as close as possible.
---
It is one and the same.
---
&gt; No longer making players hold shift to autoloot doesn't make it no longer an authentic vanilla experience.
---
it does. Just slightly, but it does. And if there are dozens of such minor things changed, the impact would be noticeable.
---
&gt; community's expectation of what the purpose of Classic even is.
---
Community expectations were quite clear both before the announcement and after. Authentic vanilla without any unneeded enhancements.
---
&gt; Slippery slope is a logical fallacy. Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean that it isn't.
---
Yet people like you continue to prove it. Fallacy or not, it IS happening. I saw dozens of people proposing changes based on "the game is not vanilla anyway, why not add some minor changes?".
---
This IS the slippery slope. You change one thing, people ask for another.
---
I'm almost sure that in the later patches vanish removed hunter's mark. So it wasn't as bad. If that helps.
---
I would go for the Mana. More healing is fine but how much of that will be overheal? More Mana will be more efficient i guess.
---
When you say 60 you mean 30, Classic isn’t retail kid
---
no xD
---
As a druid healer this (and res) is why i always tried to bring a shadow priest or enh/ele shaman on runs
---
increasing your mana pool doesn't benefit your regeneration at all tho, 10% more healing practically makes your mana regen 10% more effective
---
&gt;It is one and the same.
---
No, it isn't. Trying to make an exact copy of a game, and making something that has the same underlying experience as a game are two very different things.
---
&gt;it does. Just slightly, but it does. And if there are dozens of such minor things changed, the impact would be noticeable.
---
No, it doesn't make it no longer authentic vanilla. If someone back in the day had created an addon to automatically press "shift+RMB" every time they clicked on a corpse would they have suddenly been playing a totally different experience? No, of course they wouldn't have. Would the impact be noticeable? Yeah, the game's UI would be less annoying and let you do what you intend with less clicky work.
---
Playing chess by dragging pieces on a touch screen and playing chess by tapping a piece, then tapping where it goes, are noticeably different, but the underlying chess experience is unchanged.
---
&gt;Community expectations were quite clear both before the announcement and after. Authentic vanilla without any unneeded enhancements.
---
Except they aren't quite clear, as this subject keeps coming up again and again and gets debated again and again. You even mentioned it keeps coming up again and again.
---
&gt;Yet people like you continue to prove it. Fallacy or not, it IS happening. I saw dozens of people proposing changes based on "the game is not vanilla anyway, why not add some minor changes?".
---
The slippery slope fallacy is:
---
&gt;When a relatively insignificant first event is suggested to lead to a more significant event, which in turn leads to a more significant event, and so on, until some ultimate, significant event is reached, where the connection of each event is not only unwarranted but with each step it becomes more and more improbable.  Many events are usually present in this fallacy, but only two are actually required -- usually connected by “the next thing you know...”
---
The slippery slope fallacy is the suggestion that if A, then B then ultimately Z. For example:
---
&gt;We cannot unlock our child from the closet because if we do, she will want to roam the house.  If we let her roam the house, she will want to roam the neighborhood.  If she roams the neighborhood, she will get picked up by a stranger in a van, who will sell her in a sex slavery ring in some other country.  Therefore, we should keep her locked up in the closet.
---
It would be a slippery slope fallacy to say:
---
If we remove holding shift to autoloot then it'll lead to Classic+ qol edition
---
It wouldn't be a slippery slope fallacy to say:
---
We aren't getting Vanilla anyway, so it isn't like some changes will make the difference between us getting Vanilla or not.
---
Let's look the definition of word "necessary" - needed to be done, achieved, or present; essential.
---
Wait this is wrong, let's check some dictionary....
---
Yea, that's more like it: "necessary - something which is totally not needed but NakSFC can't play without"
---
I will never understand this fear ward obsession. Sure, fear ward is nice but it's on a 2 minute cooldown. If your tank sucks at stance dancing, he will just be feared the next time while your ward is on cooldown.
---
Do top guilds really need fear ward? I have no idea. But average guilds definitely don't need it... because, back then, we all had no dwarf priest in the raid. And neither did horde, obviously.
---
Don't get me wrong. If you're a dwarf healing priest you will always get into a raid. On the other side, if you're an elf or human healing priest you will... also always get into a raid...
---
I'm sure it won't be mandatory, but a lot of people that you've gotten to know will quit your vanilla server to go play TBC if/when it happens. 
---
&gt; Loot trading existed in Classic. Because of the way GMs work today, copying the old method of loot trading would require doing what Nost did: Remove Loot trading altogether. This would be a change. So in order to preserve Loot trading a compromise is made: Automated Loot trading.
---
Don't try to call it a compromise. A change is a change.
---
&gt; Sharding at launch can be arguably not a change because it's being implemented to preserve (not destroy) the original population cap dynamic—while avoiding log-in queues.
---
Why would they avoid login queues? Queues existed since start, sharding did not.
---
A change is a change. It does not even preserve anything, its just a cheaper option for them.
---
&gt; No, it doesn't make it no longer authentic vanilla. If someone back in the day had created an addon to automatically press "shift+RMB" every time they clicked on a corpse would they have suddenly been playing a totally different experience?
---
Why should I evaulate my experience by how someone else played? You installed an addon back then? That's ok, you can install it again. I did not use it, so if it becomes default option now it changes MY experience. 
---
Saying that "it does not change your experience is like "you think you but you dont". Dude, i know MY experience better.
---
Great guild leader. I used to run with him back in the day. He puts forward a lot of passion in the management of the guild, and ensuring all the members are happy. I might actually start playing vanilla again if he's running the show.
---
&gt; That's your opinion and doesn't match up to the countless threads from old forum posts on MMO-Champ, Ars Technica and the old official forums 
---
How is this even relevant? I can gather countless posts about people being okay with massive changes for classic WoW, but that doesn't mean that the majority wants it. The tiny minority being the loudest doesn't make them the majority..
---
&gt; I would never believe your personal memory over actual evidence. 
---
Okay, as an example. During a recent q&amp;a when Ion was asked about Raid Finder and if it's actually needed (because a majority feels like it's useless and counter productive overall to the WoW experience) he literally used a guild created by a family that only plays a couple hours a week together and will never even reach normal mode as an example of why the game needs Raid Finder. Do you think players like that are even remotely close to being the majority of current players? Hell no. They are a tiny, tiny, TINY minority.
---
&gt; Lol at giving up guaranteed income.
---
Which is why I said that if the number of players keeps dropping there would be panic at Activision-Blizzard and the only way for them to keep relevant and try to attract new players is to make it free. Do you think a 13 year old kid nowadays would start playing WoW for a monthly fee or stay with a one payment game/free game?
---
&gt; I get that you're triggered as fuck by my post
---
Why would I be triggered? I have officially quit retail WoW and what happens to the game now on doesn't bother me at all, even though I still voice my opinion on the subject from time to time. It's more about you not being able to see what people are talking about and you actually believing that the Activision marketing team are some kind of great people that really cares about the veteran WoW players.
---
Like I said in my post, the actual majority have been asking Blizzard to change things up for several expansions but they have refused to do so and that's enough evidence for me to realize that they are not basing their decisions on what the majority wants. They can't even come back with a god damn PvP vendor even though people have been crying about wanting vendors back since the removal of them..
---
But hey.. you can have your opinion on this, but I disagree strongly AND I disagree with you that classic will be very "niche" six months post-launch aswell FYI ;)

Just a few areas that were in the Classic world but weren't made available in vanilla. There are a few other areas I can't remember offhand, but they have a lot to work with.
---
You and me both brother
---
Because this statement is at least partially due to the "tourists" from retail which are going to give up mid-way or even earlier.
---
They judge people by themselves and think that if they love action, everyone loves action. "Vanilla has less action, which means it's boring and will die out quick". Simple-minded people.
---
Some also think that people play on private servers for years only beacuse it's free. Idk, maybe they judge by themselves too, i can't see 15$ per month being a deal-breaker for playing a favourite game.

WoW is not an esport. It is an RPG. The whole idea is to have one character and be able to continually progress with that character over time to make him a stronger hero, through some combination of levels and gear.  Seasons and races to clear raid zones is not very RPG like.
---
You either need to have content that allows you the progression or some alternate way to be continually progressing - like EQs Alternate Advancement (points you earn via exp that you then use in a talent tree like system to improve your toon). I think modern wow realized such a progression would add value to the game, but they chose to link that to a specific piece of gear vs your actual character.
---
I think that is the hardest part of a MMORPG is to have to content or the system in place to achieve the spirit of the game of continual character improvement over time. Which is why it is right to worry that eventually classic will grow stale. Enough people will not have a way to improve their character and will have seen all of the content. 
---
For me, the next logical step is a TBC server.
---
People on the WoW forums are biased towards retail, because they're the ones still playing it. It's like going to a tennis court and asking people what their favourite sport is.
---
My worst memory of this is from BC, needing to respec to pick up the points that made Mend Pet remove debuffs in order to solo Strat.
---
I mean, I remember feeling like that (them being a ninja) at the time but I also remember feeling that, if I went to the forums w/ this that the community wouldn't have been w/ me...but, glad to see that may not have been the case. 
---
I mean, if most of what I hear on this sub is to be believed, most people here stopped playing around the end of BC/beginning of Wrath... Which is a decade ago now.
---
Considering that Blizz put in a feature not too long after to prevent stuff like this I'm sure other felt the same way, but I remember at the time thinking that I was sort of in the wrong in feeling salty about the situation. 
---
It’s not a lot of people. It’s a select few who think they know everything. You know the ones who fly into a rage every time the smallest thing doesn’t go their way?
---
This has been answered a million times and there's a lot of opinions but here's how I feel. 
---
If it did I think it would be from mostly the slow pace / lack of quality of life features clashing with the younger generation (and even 25-32 y.o's) that have been socialized in a world of instant gratification &amp; quick rewards for the last 15 years.  Nearly everything in our lives today are instant (economic [1-2 day shipping, all electronic transactions], social [swipe left/right, snapchat, texts], entertainment [netflix, youtube], education [online learning, etc] the list goes on...)  Our collective consumer consciousness is very quickly changing and classic WoW is a slow burner where you have to work for your rewards.  I'm in love with the game and I've been playing since I was 13 but I know I will struggle with going back.  
---
Combine the above with an older demographic who now have jobs, families &amp; real responsibilities most people will have very little time to play.  Little time + not being able to "accomplish" much in that little time may get stale and frustrating.  Yes, I will try enjoy the journey, nostalgia, community etc. but If I have 1 hour to play and can't even finish a dungeon will I really feel great getting like 2 bars a night and finishing 2-3 quests? Will my brain be happy or will it be fiending for a chemical release that other sources of instant gratification can provide me? 
---
There are many other possible reasons this is just what I worry for the most and what my inner circle of classic wow friends agree with me on.  I'm super super hyped and couldn't be more excited.  I know for sure I will play for at least a year but I wonder if it will hold me beyond that with real life coming at me strong.    
---
Would definitely be something
---
It's a close call because all talents that increase healing done by a % only increase the base healing of the spell. Additional healing from your +healing stat is not increased by talents.
---
But +10% healing is generally going to be slightly better. In dungeons you won't have much +healing yet and will be using high rank spells. And in a single hard fight you regen little enough mana to make them almost identical in performance, but over the course of a long dungeon +10% healing is the clear winner for reducing the time you need to drink.
---
I’ve changed my mind 6 times in the last month.
---
I enjoy too many aspects of this game.
---
I did this end of last year. With just 4 levels to go I was bored, bored, bored. Joined a private server and been happy as a pig in shit ever since.
---
CTC is my go to. Great podcast.
---
I'm planning on rolling a priest as well and just went through and came up with a similar build.
---
If the build is just for raiding/dungeons isn't it better to drop the wand spec and go into the mana AND the +healing?
---
The +healing will make down ranked heals more efficient and draw less aggro.  In my experience healing, the big dick heal is rarely needed, unless you're fighting, say, the wyrmkin in Sunken Temple.  Those things hit like Mack trucks.
---
Perfect man. Never trust an elf!
---
&gt;Why should I evaulate my experience by how someone else played? You installed an addon back then? That's ok, you can install it again. I did not use it, so if it becomes default option now it changes MY experience. 
---
Last I checked in retail you can turn off autoloot. Your experience of what, clicking loot manually each and every time? Wow, that is totally a fundamental aspect of Vanilla WoW! Should we bring back people getting stuck on Griffons too, that was a big part of a lot of people's experience for the first several months, how could you change THEIR experience with vanilla? Maybe Blizz could even leak passwords to some accounts, to bring back the hackers from vanilla, that was part of some people's experience after all!
---
Just because something was in Vanilla, doesn't really mean it is part of what people are getting at when they say Vanilla experience.
---
In Vanilla there was *literally no way* for autoloot to work. The point was that if you compared your experience, to the experience of someone playing with a *purely hypothetical because it couldn't have existed* addon, then you two wouldn't have been having two radical divergent Vanilla experiences. You'd be playing the same game, and you wouldn't have even noticed they weren't shift clicking if you'd been playing with them.
---
&gt;Saying that "it does not change your experience is like "you think you but you dont". Dude, i know MY experience better.
---
Dude, you clearly don't remember your experience and are blinded by nostalgia. You didn't orgasm when you had to hold shift to auto loot, it didn't create a deeply entertaining and engaging meta of precisely how to time your shift+click, it was just something that once you learned it was a thing you committed it to muscle memory. It took no skill to do, added no depth, had no impact on socialization, .etc. It is a literal waste of human effort.
---
&gt;I wouldn't call playing chess on board and touch screen an "unchanged experience" lol. You have some strange understanding of what experience is. Game mechanics are unchanged in that case, but experience is different. Same would be with classic.
---
Did you read my comment? It was about the difference between dragging a piece on a touch screen, and using two taps to move (one tap on the piece, and one tap on the destination). Playing with physical chess pieces would be very different, but for a MMO that is something that would be entirely self-determined. Even then, you wouldn't say you are no longer playing chess if you're playing with physical chess pieces or if you're playing on a touch screen, it is the same game and offers the same underlying experience. No one would argue that it isn't "real chess" because the board is on a touch screen. Even when people play chess via mail or email, using only notation for the moves, that is still chess. It is just the same as how you wouldn't no longer be playing Vanilla WoW if you were allowed to autoloot without holding shift in Blizzard's reference client.
---
&gt;Out of, let's say, a 100 players, 80 agree with nochanges while the rest 20 ask each for their own "improvement". In that case i say that community expects no changes, because the overwhelming majority is waiting for it. It will never be more clear since there will always be people unhappy with something in vanilla.
---
Except that we already know we aren't getting no changes, therefore all 80 are going to be disappointed, if they even really care about no changes in the first place (which I suspect very little of the Classic WoW community will, they will mostly be fine as long as it isn't radically different, just as how people are happy with private servers today).
---
My suggestion is, that Blizzard should then mostly ignore the 80 who are asking for the impossible, look at the 20 people with ideas, and make their own determination, and the community needs to be open to the idea that maybe at least one of those 20 people have a point. Maybe holding shift to autoloot isn't an orgasmic experience and removing it isn't going to cause Classic WoW to crash and burn. Maybe the 16 debuff slot limit should be a loading screen tip. Maybe the 16 debuff slot limit should be a tutorial tip, maybe debuffs should have an animation when they fall off, to make it more obvious what is happening.
---
Game design isn't a democratic process, nor should it be. Players generally don't know what they want, and that includes a fair portion of the no changes people who don't understand the difference between LFR and holding down an extra key to loot. Blizzard shouldn't blindly listen to the no changes people for the same reason why they shouldn't listen to people who ask for flying mounts and LFR/LFG. If every single player wanted flying mounts then Blizzard should tell them all "no".
---
You'd need to put 5 points into either Wand Specialization or Unbreakable Will in order to get further down the Discipline Tree.
---
6? Rookie numbers! I was going Druid until I read they can't dispel that disease.
---
i dont want to be the buzzkill however adding additional servers with different rules is a solution to EVERY single problem the community faces.
---
The problem with that is: on the player side splitting the community too much and on the blizzard side evaluating for server availability, cost and in the end deciding what rules to give what server.
---
Think of it this way: how many servers will blizzard open? for every localisation there has to be one SET of servers. for every server TYPE has to be one set of servers. if you add different SERVERRULES and different PROGRESSIONTYPES on top of that its just too much..
---
IMO thats why those servers with different rules are not going to happen.
---
Blizzard will either go one way or the other.
---
I just hope they will choose the cost effective route of time frozen servers or progressive servers.
---
Only epic I've ever seen outside of a raid was the Headmaster's Charge that dropped off Gandling in Scholomance back in 2006.  I won the roll against a priest on my mage.  A shame it didn't have +spell damage, but I had become a mage that had two int buffs, so that's pretty nifty I'd say.
---
Quick question here when we're already on topic: How it Lightwell in vanilla? Is it a good spell if people learn to use it?
---
Keep in mind soooooo many healers just don't dispel diseases even if you ask them to. I've ran with so many pugs who didn't even have their cleanse trained. 
---
Aleister Crowley literally lives in the crypts under the Cathedral of LIGHT (Huge occult reference), DIRECTLY next to the Orphanage. He has a quest that tells you to seek out Brother Anton (Anton Lavey, founded the church of Satan). They love throwing you little breadcrumbs right in front of your ignorant faces that you will never understand.
---
Yea, it took a while for the community to figure out how absurdly good + weapon skill (and subsequently expertise in TBC) was.
---
Personally I would go the 10% healing, as it is far more beneficial. As for your talents I want you to know imp renew, imp shield and imp fort all only equal about 150 hit points... I find those talents to be garbage unless you are absolutely pure PVE in every sense. If you even dabble in PvP I highly suggest healing focus, matyrdom and unbreakable will. That's just my personal build preference, I will love you have priests like you in raid who get imp fort.
---
I mean it won't die but there is absolutely gonna be a big fallout of people. One when people hit barrens/silverpine level areas and the sheer grind to even get to 40 sets in.
---
The more persistent will make it to 60 but even then many people will start looking at attunments, bis lists, drop chances etc. 
---
Old school semi casual players make it through BWL before the fatigue probably gets to them.
---
More hardcore players get to twin emps, maybe a few naxx bosses. Which is where I will probably end up burning out as well.
---
The amount of work that goes into each tier of raiding just gets exponentially higher. Until people dont have the time or energy to bother staying at the top of their game when you might go months without getting that one item you want. During this time you have 100s of other games competing ghee your time and money.
---
I'm not trying to say that it's all doom and gloom, it's just a natural part of gaming. Most people don't have the willpower to play the same game for years and years, especially if there aren't any updates.
---
I have been as hyped as anyone for classic.
---
But I have also been playing on a pserver recently... and I have to say, I'm kinda already bored.
---
The content is just too easy, because everything is known.  The meta is so strong in classic that gratification is *basically* instant.  
---
Leveling feels good.  Getting that first mount at 40 feels good.  Getting level 60 feels good.
---
But then... you have fresh 60's easily clearing MC and ZG right away.  After a couple of weeks of ZG runs you're geared enough to easily clear BWL.  Gear doesn't feel that powerful.  I remember in vanilla we had this attitude like, "oh well as soon as our MT gets more T2 we will do fine in BWL..."  That's just not the case anymore.
---
I think people will hit the wall at AQ where the challenge starts to ramp up, but few will last that long.
---
I'll put it this way.  Classic is better than retail, hands down - but it doesn't grab my attention nearly to the degree I think a lot of us are hoping that it will.
---
Weird that the 10% is only for the base spell, so at lvl 60 its only like +75 healing on a greater heal…... is it the same for the 10% mana? or is that effected by intel?
---
Hype killer 
---
Not the way *some people* play. If you’re playing WoW at a wedding, something tells me that person is *some people*...
---
Also, wut? You could level 5 toons through a retail xpac before you hit 30 once, it’s not even close.
---
Amen.
---
No blood needs to be spilled.  Alter the course of time to ensure Jeff Kaplan stays the game director after 2009.
---
I can see a drop in players in 3-6 months, but die, that just don't make no common sense.
---
I think it depends on what "die out" means. To some people, it's based off X percentage of people quitting from the peak. We'll likely see millions of people on launch, and yeah, a lot of those people will quit within 6 months for sure. It's hard to say what the actual continuous core playerbase will be. We've got 50k subs on this subreddit, and there are maybe over a million people playing on private servers; but we don't know how many will end up switching over or pay $15 a month. If we drop from 10+ million trying the game out, to 500k, that'll be "dead" to some people. I think we'll likely do better than that, and as long as there are 1.5k+ concurrent players on my server, and I can find a raid guild, I'll be happy.
---
Another fear is that the release schedule will be too fast, and raids/dungeons won't be progressive enough. Based on what they've already released, it looks like Rag will be there on release, as well as DM. That invalidates a lot of the earlier content farm, and people will be able to get geared for BWL and AQ40 faster than they have been on most private servers. While we have seen people playing private servers for a decade, it's usually not the same server. Fresh content and progression are pretty important to people, so we'll have to see what happens if/when the official servers get stagnant. I think that will be longer than 6 months, even with a very aggressive release schedule, but again who's to say right now.
---
Nothing sayes vanilla pvp like back pedaling haha
---
History has a long list of MMOs that have come in gone in the life time of wow. The vast majority of which were just complete wow clones. So they ended up just dieing in 3-6 months when players went back to play what was a better version (and the original) wow. Now WoW is competing with WoW and its a game that came out over a decade ago. Its the progenitor to all of this but its the one that took away all the QOL that the new player-base wants and lives by.
---
So they believe history will repeat itself and Classic will just die like every other mmo that competed with wow. Players will get to the end game see there's nothing to do and leave. I would bet though that a majority of those people have never played classic and the ones that did just have no interest in it and what to stop you from enjoying things.
---
That didn't stop them from making WoD
---
&gt; Everyone will be focused on trying to get through the starting zones it should be free.
---
And if someone shows up he might be in a different shard. :-)
---
I'd be happier if classic would ban all addons. Addons are a slippery-slope that really make the game easier. Addons affect me even if I don't use them.
---
If I quest around, find a player who is doing the same quest, I'll join pt. He is using quest finder addon and is brainlessly following the arrows. Now I have to keep up with him or leave pt. Bad experience either way. If nobody has access to quest addon, people can ask questions about how to do certain quests. Sure, classicDB exists, which means banning quest addons won't solve the problem, won't eliminate it, but it would decrease its severity a bit.
---
If I join a raid where everyone is using an addon which tells you what the boss does and what you should do, I am forced to use said addon as well.
---
It is more fun to tank and dps without a threat or dps meter. Takes more skill to be good dps without a threatmeter. More information makes the game less difficult.
---
Yeah, it makes me sad.  I want to love classic *so badly*, but seeing how insanely easy it is to just pug ZG and MC with people still wearing green items and playing memespecs and clearing without any wipes in  90 minutes... it's just depressing.  I don't know how else to say it.
---
I think that Classic had its own set of challenges vs the other expansions. For example there is only 1.12 as they have told us as they just overwrote the databases. Opening instances isnt that hard as you just flip a trigger to say you're open now and check for attainment if needed! But for the most part TBC and Wrath exist still though there have been changes in some vendors and other things places there for QOL. The only question from the players end would be Talent systems and item databases. Assuming they didnt just overwrite everything AGAIN there should be back ups from TBC launch through modern day that would make this process much faster then trying to rebuild the entire server structure systems.
---
&gt;You could level 5 toons through a retail xpac before you hit 30 once, it’s not even close.
---
Was someone talking about retail?  Nope.
---
&gt;Not the way *some people* play
---
Not of a good enough reason to assume he would even *want to* get to 60 in 10 days  Not everyone wants to rush it to 60 or even to get to 60.
---
Im banking on there being a rppvp server where a lota people love world pvp and make world pvp guilds.
---
Lol they're so delusional
---
I don't think its bad, Im more worried about the DM/MC clashing release. But at the same time, the slower the better IMO  Hopefully all goes well.
---
&gt;Theres so many things about vanilla wow that are better then retail 
---
lists 2 things  
---
Depends what is meant by "die off". It won't be as big as some people here like to believe (past initial month or two), but it will have stable and decently sized population.  
---
I still loved Wrath because it didn't remove the old world, and dungeon finder wasn't introduced until the last patch. That last patch, and ultimately Cataclysm -with destroying the old world and removing all of the RPG elements of the game - are what made me quit WoW for good. 
---
It's been 8 long years and I can't wait to come back home.
---
You wont be able to 1shot Kazzak if that's what you're asking.
---
&gt; you clearly don't remember your experience and are blinded by nostalgia
---
Good that we finally come to quality arguments like "it's nostalgia". I even mentioned "you think you do but you don't" and here we go. Guess I can end the dialogue now.
---
Don't forget to comment about rose-tinted glasses next time someone tells you they love some of inconveniences in the game or something else which you perosnally don't like or don't consider to be part of experience. 
---
You can't just one shot people out of nowhere out in open world pvp, but it'll still be decent in pvp. Wear your shield, stay alive while eating a few crits, then swap out to your 2hander to burst down a target. 
---
&gt;classic isn’t retail kid
---
That's my ideal situation, that they would use Classic as a springboard for a parallel progression, even evolving the Classic 1-60 experience. That being said, I'd be shocked if it happened. Obviously this is only on the table if Classic is a success, and if Classic is a success, why not then leave Classic as is and come out with TBC:Classic which is a guaranteed success instead of taking a massive risk. So we'll likely be getting TBC:Classic, which will also be awesome.
---
Because they have no experience.
---
Flip flops with socks is even more sexy than those goggles 
---
these damn tourists will ruin the beaches with their plastic
---
✔
---
Just like Grykogh linked you, just because you don't care about Classic WoW doesnt mean **you** should ruin it for others.
---
I actually almost forgot that DM shouldn't be available before initial MC progression either.. That is concerning, indeed. Lots of farming potential, as well as gear to bypass certain BoE's and crafting use.. Please Acti-Blizz.. don't fuck this up, deliberately..
---
&gt;But the real deal are unsubsribed people and players from pservers. Some also think that people play on private servers for years only beacuse it's free.
---
They should REALLY LOVE free stuff if they have desire to play the same game from shitty 2006 over and over and over.
---
Or maybe... the game is just good.
---
If they do make fresh servers they shouldn't make them until the initial release has run the course of whatever they deem "classic" to be.   
---
???
---
I am Just saying its going to be "classic" not "vanilla"
---
Maybe you should know what you are talking about before you start talking like its fact.
---
Sharding not a core pillar of gameplay??? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? haha
---
I'd personally go two points into the prevent interruptions + mana.
---
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
Then maybe instead of trying to fuck up Classic, you make sure to play Classic so that **retail** can change to that.
---
Thats is probably the case. So developement cost for progression on tbc and onward might be lower.
---
But they will still have to guess about how many servers to run for what type etc. Its just a huge clusterfuck and noone with atleast a little understanding of business is going to do it. Even when it would make us happy.
---
Yeah, but the way you say it basically implies that what I just said was stupid and that it should be in the game.
---
same lol
---
The green goggles are the most iconic
---
In reality I'm not sure it is that big of a deal. Ragnaros wasn't ever killed before DM release anyway so I don't see it has deeply impacting the entirety of the game. DM was released March 7th 2005. Rag world first was March 25th 2005.
---
I have been focusing on Dungeon Quest guides, but will be branching out to other types of guides, lore, tips, and commentary shortly. I should be back home around the time Classic is released and I plan on streaming at that time. 
---
My content is more focused on newer players, or folks who may not have been on the private server scene rather than the experienced players. Classic will be a shock to a lot of players, so my goal is to help reduce that shock and keep folks playing.
---
I'm pretty sure your reckoning stacks are supposed to get reset when you swap your weapons.
---
it would suck because blizzard doesn't know what there doing anymore
---
As has already been pointed out, EU WoW released with DM, and even NA WoW players were largely not level 60 by the time DM was out.
---
It’s not optimal to have everything so crammed together, but DM at launch, however disruptive, is likely one of the decisions in the release schedule that is the most readily supportable.
---
To be honest, it really does have that potential.
---
I'm going to be a long hauler. But at the same time, you cannot be honest with yourself and say Nostalgia isn't one of the major driving forces of this project. Nostalgia fades pretty quickly when sated, and games tend to have a 3-6 month drop off anyway. The game will shrink at about that time, the big question is How Much? 
---
I'm a little pessimistic. I expepct the final number to be sub 1 million, but flirt with it very closely. Over time the bleed will be real, as there's nothing to draw players back in unless they start doing Seasonal servers, BC servers, or Classic Plus content.
---
why are we seeing the same posts over and over again?
---
What class did you play? Hour many hours did you put into the private server? 
---
I don't know if ZG will be available at release but if I remember correctly, ZG provides some OP easy to obtain BiS gear.
---
&gt;From level 60 dungeons feels like getting slot machine titanforged loot in BFA except worse, because there's no slot machine - I know exactly what boss drops the loot I want and I can just run it as many times as I want and boom, I have BiS chest until AQ which is 6-7 months away.
---
I find this hard to believe, you would rather your BiS comes from weekly chests of completely randomized loot?
---
&gt; I see it as a win-win for Blizzard
---
Except that they in the second case they would spend resources like on retail game but for 10% out of 10% out of whole wow fanbase.
---
It's still a really good PvP spec even if you can't abuse to hit players for 60% of their HP in your healing set at the start of a fight. 
---
While working as intended it's pretty powerful, when it's absolutetly broken like on every private server it's incredibly over powered.
---
Maybe, but these flying tiger goggles were the goal of every lowbie engineer.
---
Why is tanking easier/possible for the alliance than for horde? 
---
Not even private servers are broken enough to let you keep stacks through weapon swaps.
---
jungle remedy is your friend 
---
they dont know PepeLaugh
---
The mental strength +10% mana talent increases total mana by 10% so anything that increases mana increases its benefit. It would be a terrible talent if it only increased base mana because even a naked priest gets more mana from their base intellect stat than they have base mana.
---
I agree wholeheartedly with your list, but unfortunately see no solution to the last issue.
---
If the endgame is kept up to date then endgame guilds will have no incentive to progress.
---
I try to not be too cynical, but I know deep down this is what I've been feeling too.  This is exactly why I don't see myself truly sticking with Classic and mostly just playing around to see how the reality of Feral Druid in Classic in 2019 plays out vs. the perception people had of it back in 2006.  For example, back then you'd think it was 50-60% of a damage dealer's DPS with how people felt about it, but I have a feeling it was closer to 70%, or 75-78% if you abuse Furor, Wolfshead Helm, and a certain weapon.  It's just a feeling of mine, no hard math.
---
Stockholm Syndrome. They are identifying with their captors.
---
Same argument can be made about this subreddit I guess
---
These people are the residue - the white crusty stuff that is left after you boil everything else away. They will defend every negative change made to the game and cry for more - right up until the day they quit. I recognized their shit for what it was back in Wrath and it’s all been downhill since. 
---
I think you’re massively underestimating both the number of players Classic will have, and the number that would choose a “Classic+” server. 
---
The fact that the most upvoted post on this subreddit is about new content shows there is a big appetite for new content, but in a game that doesn’t suck (like retail).
---
Just like ZG is makes no difference, like for real. Molten core is going to be piss easy regardless of if we have DM or not. Same goes for BWL, most guilds will clear it the week of or within a week(for those guild's that had MC on farm prior) and ZG dosen't really make much difference. 
---
What it does make a difference is how much raider's are going to have to play with ZG and BWL out at the same time, that's my real concern.
---
No, I hate the slot machine mechanic but if you get lucky with the slot machine on week 1 - or from just an m0 run - you get tier BIS without having to raid.  So the result is the same.  With classic, I don't have to wait for the slot roll each week, or even wait for my mythic dungeon to reset.  I can spam 30 minute Baron runs until I get the piece I want and I'm set for that slot until C'Thun.
---
I'm playing a resto druid and I've done maybe 12 level 60 dungeon runs, ZG a few times, and MC a couple of times.
---
Feign death at its best.  This why I scrapped my Pally main from vanilla and went Hunter main in Cata
---
Back when they first introduced those knock-back snowballs in AV you could throw it at someone on a gryphon and it would instantly teleport them to the end of their destination.
---
I still say they should go with backwards progression, release the raids earlier and time gate the dungeons with the better gear for later. This can be achieved without the huge clusterfuck that is item rebalancing altogether (which they won't bother with anyway).
---
"DoA"
---
&gt;15 years later zoning into MC
---
ZG provides stuff of significantly worse quality than BWL (excluding set for locks), so it will be probably catch-up mechanic for casuals, while steamrollers are going to clear BWL.
---
Progress in BWL and ZG are separated quite a lot, enchants are of no outstanding value to be farmed 24/7, and BWL eventually was released more or less at the same point with BGs (1 month later) and right at the same point with the final honor system improvements.
---
There is nothing to worry about, tryhards are gonna nolife anyway, 3-4 hours per week to clear ZG are not somewhat even noteworthy for them.
---
As for the honor system, just keep in mind that it is impossible to jump over the ranks after rank 8 or so, so their run to rank 14 is going to take at least 2-3 months, so the real rewards from PvP will be obtained like at least 8 weeks after BWL is on farm, so the content is going to gate itself.
---
A feral pulled #4 on the meters w/o even using the Pummeler in a 40 man MC pug I did a couple of weeks ago.  We killed Rag no problem. 
---
I think memespecs are totally playable up to probably Twin Emperors.  If you want to have fun with the spec in the first 4 raids, it will be totally doable.
---
Just like every expansion in retail
---
Yeah man that’s a wonky build!
---
&gt; I think you’re massively underestimating both the number of players Classic will have, and the number that would choose a “Classic+” server.
---
I sincerely hope you are right. But judging by popularity of Classic forums/reddit compared to retail, it looks to me like Classic will have hardly more than 15-20% of retail players.
---
And i seriously doubt that people who cry for more content in retail would invest time in classic. Of course some % of them will, but those are mostly players who enjoy quick and active types of gameplay.
---
Yup, this indeed, this is also why paladins are god tier healers with gear... Illumination makes crit scale your mana efficiency exponentially.
---
Because a lot of the retail players are used to a different game at this point. I’m sure there will be a surge at launch but it will rapidly drop off when retail players realize how much of a boring grind Vanilla was. While I’m sure there’s a decent number of private server players out there, I have my doubts on how many will be willing to pay a sub to play. Add to that most people who intend to play classic long-term likely already play on private servers. I don’t think the class servers will be “dead”, but I also don’t expect more than 100k players after 6 months.
---
This is just the people hyped for Classic. I think a large majority will try Classic, simply because it’ll be free and people on retail will be talking about it. It will be an option on the launcher for everyone to pick.
---
How many people stick around is another matter. I’m cautiously optimistic it will be a lot.
---
Was a wasted talent back when I tried it in 2006. Probably still is, because it just isn’t how most encounters need to be healed. Would still be interesting to see a efficiency analysis of it though, if it was used correctly.
---
I also didn’t like spirit of redemption(? The one that you can heal after dying), its bad in PvE because if your healer is dying you’ve got bigger problems than 8 more seconds of healing . And in PvP, it’s frustrating how often your team runs out of range and it’s useless.
---
Terrible idea.
---
Kronos as an example. 
---
Kronos  1 and 2 are frozen at 1.12.1 with Naxx. Everything was conquered. They then opened Kronos 3 to start at patch 1.12 but pre AQ gates and NAXX patch.
---
Guess what everyone did after they had been on Kronos 1 for a few years and they're all geared out?
---
Everyone flooded to Kronos 3 and the populations on Kronos 1 and 2 fell apart and now they are competely empty ghosttowns. 
---
The same would happen with any frozen in time content. 
---
Start with patch 1.12, use 1.10 loot and non buffed pieces of loot.
---
From there listen to the community of when to move onto BC, everyone together. 
---
From then they transfer everyone to BC like it happened back then and to satisfy the vanilla folks, make another round of 1.12 realms and start the process over again for another group of tens of thousands.
---
It won't die out. But I do think there a some, including myself, who may put in a lot of time at the release, but will gradually turn into a more casual player due to RL priorities. Plus new retail players will try it and some of those will quit. So there will be a decline at some point. 
---
I personally probably won't start playing until a couple weeks after launch.
---
No it's not, all priests should spec into pi as soon as possible
---
My first character is going to be my rollplaying bank alt. Leaning towards human pali, because roleplaying as a gnome warlock just doesn't seem to fit. 
---
not just set for locks. there are many things at least for healers that are better in ZG than BWL. For example, the  healing neck from Jindo is amazing up til CThun. Also, the shoulder &amp; belt of the 3-set ZG priest pieces are better than their T2 counterparts from BWL when combined together because of the set bonus. Further the enchantments you get from ZG are ridiculously good, the best enchants in the game for head/legs. these will help steamroll BWL if released at same time.
---
Huh, that figures.  You know, that's the most beautiful thing about this: to be vindicated after all these years!  I always thought I was right back then, but I could never be sure.  Awesome!
---
And yet...that very thing does speak to what you're saying about Classic's tuning.  I don't know what the right answer is here.  The lead dev said they want to make something like a museum, which means a 100% accurate recreation, and that's what we're getting.
---
But it's sad because while the game itself won't change, **people** change, and so the experience will change just like you're saying.  So this is why recreating an old version of an MMORPG is a bit of a folly: It can never be the same by the very nature of things.  But hey, it'll still be fun as its own thing perhaps.  I just hope the Russians don't ruin too much as they're unfortunately known to do to online things.
---
The paid character transfers during vanilla was something of a special case. It wasn't a free-for-all, it was only enabled for people who wanted to get off of high population or low population servers and move to healthier servers, and you generally only had a single destination that was allowed. Not the best solution, personally I think mergers would have been better for the low pop servers, but at the time "server mergers" was the kiss of death for a relatively new MMO.
---
&gt;PvP'ers will be locked into BG's farming for High Warlord/Grand Marshal gear while also having to take breaks to progress through BWL AND obtain integral ZG enhancements/gear. 
---
I mean, welcome to Classic :P
---
Seriously, though, that'd give the game a more authentic retail vanilla experience. When I played back then, when I wasn't raiding, I was PvPing, when I wasn't raiding or PvPing I was running dungeons, when I wasn't doing that, I was farming. 
---
I managed to get to Rank 11 while in an AQ40(/ZG/AQ20) guild, and I'm not saying that to brag, what I'm trying to say is it's possible to achieve decent rank whilst raiding, but if anyone who's eyeing rank 14 is literally going to have to account share and PvP 24/7, so they're not raiding for a while anyway. 
---
Because you can't spend years farming mounts, so they're confused what to do.
---
Cool thanks! Appreciate the love. Can't wait to get to BRD, lol
---
Well part of it is that there is only so much content that can possibly be released for Classic. Even if they stagger the content releases out for 1-2 years, eventually there just won't be anything to do any more. And there won't be anything to look forward to.
---
I'm STOKED to play through it all again. And if its around for a long time I'll likely do it once every few years, assuming fresh servers are released. But ultimately its a re-release of one slice of an otherwise living, breathing game world - eventually, there just won't be anything to do.
---
It's a stupid argument considering Battle for Azeroth has died out in less than two months, despite getting *'new content'*.
---
I'm excited for vanilla wow, but if I'm 100% honest with myself, it's probably more that I'm excited for the PROSPECT of vanilla.  I love the nostalgia angle.  I love the community angle.  I love the gameplay/RPG angle instead of having little to no choices.
---
However, I now have much less time to play, so seeing the rest of Naxx, as much as I want it to happen, is probably not going to work out because I'm not going to be there to grind out gear/consumables/etc.  The graphics are old.  I don't care what people say about it "still being good", they're not.  They were arguably not great on release, and here we are 15+ years later.  It's the same reason I can't stand playing the 8-32 bit games, no matter how much I loved them before.  Also, everything is already "solved", which kind of sucks.
---
You are assuming there was an actual design philosophy behind the design of the classes in Vanilla, which ofcourse is not the case when you see how almost every class had a massive overhaul throughout the lifespan of the game where abilities got removed and reworked left and right.
---
The Paladin revamp happened in 1.9. At this point, Seal of the Crusader's main function was to apply the debuff that increases holy damage taken, similar to how Seal of Light and Wisdom were almost exclusively used for their debuff and not for their primary effect.
---
You can keep stating that SoR proccing effects is a bug all you like but it's just a nonsensical thing to do. There is no problem with SoR proccing things. In fact, it is the only thing that makes specs like Protection even semi viable as it allows you to keep up your mana through double proccing Judgement of Wisdom. The reason I write what you call "rageposts" is because you are seemingly incapable of grasping simple concepts such as something being changed in the next EXPANSION does not prove that it was intended for it to never work in Vanilla. All it proves is that the developers wanted to streamline weapon procs in TBC. Possibly to have more control over the relative DPS of each weapon proc to avoid a balancing nightmare.
---
But since this seem to difficult, and because you seem to love interpreting patch notes. Here's a piece of the 1.9 patch notes (Paladin revamp)
---
* Seal of Righteousness - Now does holy damage on every swing. **It can now proc correctly as well.** The Judgement effect has been renamed "Judgement of Righteousness" to differentiate it from the Seal damage in the combat log.
---
Notice how the patch notes specifically mentions that the seal can now proc correctly? Since the same patch notes also says the seal now does damage on every swing, and the class has no mechanic that allow the seal to proc, the only way to interpret this is that SoR is meant to proc weapon effects. And while I am well aware that the patch notes are being a bit vague on the specifics, I still feel this interpretation is much less liberal than your own interpretation of the TBC patch notes in which you conclude that the seal proccing effects is a bug in VANILLA based solely on the fact that it's ability to proc got removed in TBC.
---
It's because the content is finite. There is an end to Classic. Once you've cleared all the content and gotten all the best gear you've beaten the game.
---
I don't think it's going to take as low as 6 months and definitely not 3 months but eventually most people will be done or have given up on the way.
---
Why play something I already beat 
---
Played that in vanilla.
---
Am I the only one who thinks the honor system patch should come out first and then the battlegrounds patch a month later (could include all 3 BG's, doesn't matter that AB comes later)? The first few weeks of crazy world pvp are the best ! 
---
ZG and BWL can be released together after that who cares if it makes BWL slightly easier... IMO
---
The only player base you can bank/gurantee will hate classic wow is current retail players. Think about it, the people that are going to enjoy this...
---
1. Are part of the 10 million+ players that have quit over the past decades.
---
2. New players who have never played classic wow before and want to give it a shot.
---
If you are playing and enjoying retail right now, then you are going to hate classic, it's a completly different game. Blizz decided to fundamentally change the game starting in Wrath to be Diablo the MMO to entice different players to join, and doubled down each expansion after. Now those are the only players left with a few minor exceptions, and those who started because they wanted an MMO RPG instead of a RNG lobby game are left in the cold.
---
As long as Blizzard offer as close as possible to authentic Vanilla servers they can do whatever the hell they want.
---
&gt; One when people hit barrens/silverpine level areas and the sheer grind to even get to 40 sets in.
---
I always thought WoW leveling was cake, but then again, I played a crap ton of EverQuest back in the day. 
---
To be fair. Even Blizzars thought that untill 2 years ago...
---
Remember that P Servers are pretty poorly tuned and not accurate representations. 
---
Plus, classic is going to attract a ton of people that don't touch P Servers and don't know the meta that well.
---
less content. It is arguably more fun to work on pre DM gear, and then after DM release work on gear again than straight up get geared there.
---
fuck em dude
---
Most of the haters never played vanilla and don’t understand it.
---
I'm hoping for the off chance that "stages" don't mean everything is launched on the first day. Or at the least the stages are longer than 2 or 3 months. 
---
This is what OSRS did if I remember correctly. They would present changes and let the user base vote yes or no. If 75% of the userbase voted yes, the change would be patched in. 
---
I prefer not to respec for PVP, I'm not a cookie cutter fan either. Their is so much possibility with priest talents, than to just stay the same build for me
---
Yeah, I agree.
---
How can you oppose sharding and then propose server consolidation that is essentially sharding on crack. 
---
When i tested /sit in 1.9 pvp it didnt work and managed to do just fine.
---
not sure i follow the concern of "how much raiders are going to have to play" when this is something that will happen regardless of ZG coming out with or slightly after BWL. i have issues with releasing them at the same time otherwise, but releasing a 20man raid earlier actually helps to spread out playtime 
---
Even when there are better things from BWL you need some serious luck to get the good stuff on even half your players. Even if you clear BWL every week from the day of it's release players will still use ZG gear by the time that AQ is out because they haven't got a Lok'amir to replace their Jin'do's or whatever.
---
I support releasing the game early in Australia. There is no guarantee any of you will survive for another 6 months given the heat and various deadly flora and fauna.
---
\&gt; Only Reason
---
Lol Goblin Rocket Helm, Rocket Boots, nades, and net-o-matic would like to have a word. (Also Green lens is more doper)
---
You could just not burn yourself out so badly though...? All those problems sound entirely self made from spending far too much time doing something you don't want to do.
---
I've been playing this game since the original beta, I don't need to burn 10 hours a day in dungeons and get to 60 in just a few days.
---
People that truly enjoy the gameplay will be very happy with it, but there's another group of folks trying to use classic as a time machine to relive the good old days who I suspect will be deeply disappointed in how this plays out.
---
Because people dont want others to have fun playing a game
---
Work on pre DM gear? You mean halfway afk through a bunch of Mara runs and grind even more scholo?
---
answer is:
---
in early game you want mana, in late game (full t2+) you want bonus healing
---
6 hours? I did it with a mage at start of work and it took days
---
&gt; Nostalgia isn't one of the major driving forces of this project
---
Quit WoW in 2006 shortly after AQ.  Installed WoW retail demo in November due to nostalgia - it was very very very different and levelled to 17 without coming close to dying once.
---
Set up on a pvt server also in November, hit 60 over Christmas in 11 days /played and am now 6/8 T2 and 25 days played.  
---
It's more than nostalgia, wow retail is a very well crafted game and the experience of starting on an already launched server with a clear patch timeline is very different to having started at US launch with the long patch cycles and barebones end game content
---
If you want to play on a server full of raidloggers and get carried after slowly grinding up to 60 months after everybody has cleared bwl, you can. 
---
Fresh seasonal servers would let people who enjoy rerolling and the race/gearing competition at 60 to do so. 
---
bloodvine set :thinking:
---
I have no idea. Probably it would be boring but I have only played on servers later on with DM released, so for me it would be a different experience
---
Classic was great due to the community.
---
The gameplay was good in 2004, but relative to today it is boring.
---
I look back on classic and remember the people I played with more than any specific in game accomplishment.  These are the same people I still play games with today.
---
As we have become adults our game focus has changed to casual and as such, classic appeals to us.
---
Can I get a /r/woosh up in here?
---
&gt; I've been playing this game since the original beta, I don't need to burn 10 hours a day in dungeons and get to 60 in just a few days.
---
I didn't do either of those things... I play at most 2 hours per day.  Maybe a touch more if I'm doing a raid.  Took me several months to hit 60.
---
&gt; far too much time doing something you don't want to do.
---
I'm not sure what you're referring to.  Playing the normal endgame?  Gearing in dungeons, then facerolling raids and seeing epics drop that are downgrades?  I mean... 
---
Normal/HC you can queue. Mythic and Mythic+ you have to walk, that makes it 2/4 not 3/4? 
---
If druids were bad you would actually be able to give a distinct reason why. 
---
Oh my yes, filling up that head slot 10-15 levels before anyone else with an item that actually had *stats* on it was the best feeling in the world.
---
Thanks, I guess.
---
The green ones were why I wanted it...
---
Lol this is the best thing I’ve read today.
---
Yeah "They play Classic because it's free" is such a bad argument. There are literally hundrets of modern free to plsy fames out there.
---
raid dungeons  
---
The fucking shoulders lol
---
REALLY!!!?  
---
I need to make an alliance priest then...  
---
So apologies because I wasn't able to play during Vanilla, and am super pumped for Classic, but can you do AQ gates things at low level, or do you need to be 60? Because server launch is going to have retail players going "sure, I'll try it out", and you're not going to get as large a spike for something that you can't just pop on to be part of.
---
devotion aura, bag of marbles, blessing of protection.
---
Removed rule 1
---
I liked a lot of the tier 8 and 10 sets, especially the warlock and paladin sets. WotLK had some good design still.
---
I never understood people saying getting to lvl 60 was an insane grind. I always felt WoW leveling in vanilla was a joke. That's also probably because before I played vanilla i played Silkroad Online and Lineage 2 for years. Now those  games are what you correctly call a grind. Try getting to lvl 30 in those games you'll want to kill yourself.
---
Nobody has to do anything. 
---
The game doesn't need to be catered to people who already have no lives to be able to fit the available content in all at once. 
---
If rankers want to take a break from BG's to raid then they have to deal with other rankers who are more dedicated who choose not to take raiding breaks. 
---
Kept rolling from critssnd you had high crit then
---
I think when you've invested so much time into something, that the thought of everyone running off to something else with the chance of it ruining your fun, makes you try to convince others it won't be as good.
---
Well first of, fuck blizzard and their fake classic wow.
---
No Changes!
---
Remember doing 25 runs to get your dalrends? Well get rdy to do 100 runs or learn how to make friends. 
---
Whoever makes the most scummy friends wins. Your friends getting loot makes you stronger as a team. If you dont roll on thier shit for them. They may consider you not a friend. They gonna run with a real friend next time.
---
It's like when you are doing a baron run with no reserve. Then right at baron it gets switched to ML, the leader distributes loot then kicks you from the party while still leaning over corpse. 
---
Then you decide that you gonna get some friends 2.
---
I disagree on that point. There was a lot of outcry when Blizzard announced you would need a sub with people demanding it be free. And when I was on private servers a lot of people were doing it because it was free. Sure there are loads that love the older expansions, but there’s also a bunch that are only there because it’s free.
---
I expect there will be a huge die off of vanilla players.
---
Here is the thing... We are not kids anymore...  It is going to be up to new teens/college kids to fill out raids and carry is casual 30-40 year olds... And for them, there won't be the nostalgia boost... 
---
I think there are a lot of reasons classic will hook some players, both old and new.  But how long can you expect players to raid the same content?  How long will enough players put in the time to progress, knowing there is only X amount to go through?  And since community is a big factor for classic, will the casuals be able to find a place when the hardcore retract to progress?
---
I have 2-4 hours weeknights when I get home.  I have to make dinner, make a lunch box, eat, clean up, check afterwork emails an personal emails/pay bills/schedule RL stuff, spend time with my wife. Then maybe tv and games...
---
Once that is done, and some nights it only takes an hour to do all that, or maybe we get take out and there is no emails, I have maybe 3 hours tops...
---
Say I want to relax, watch some TV?  So no classic that night.
---
Say it's a busy night and things take more than 2 hours to get done..  so less than 2 hours for wow that night... Might not even log in then...
---
After 2 -3 weeknights in one week not logging in... I am probably be a bit disconnected with my wow community, or at least not a core member.  I can honestly understand that more dedicated members might be a bit put out with me, or that I am not pulling weight.
---
As maybe just a weekend Raider... Well I fear it will be harder to be part of things.  Plus you know, life happens on weekends, trips out of town, visit the folks etc... 
---
The only big thing I see is Improved shield &gt; Threat Reduxtion. Imp shield is very good, you cast it a TON and the extra damage reduction is also interrupt protection. Whereas you really should need to worrying about threat at all if you’re healing at the right time.
---
&gt; If you want to play on a server full of raidloggers and get carried after slowly grinding up to 60 months after everybody has cleared bwl, you can.
---
Months after release I expect most of people to be slowly grinding up to 60 just like me. Leave that "everyone has cleared bwl" pls, it has nothing to do with reality.
---
&gt; Fresh seasonal servers would let people who enjoy rerolling and the race/gearing competition at 60 to do so.
---
What's the problem with rerolling on the same server?
---
There is no reason to start another server (effectively killing previous one) just because someone can't start second character on the same server, lol.
---
Vanilla is not for racers, deal with it.
---
True, I have worried about threat in many years haha, it's hard for me to consider the 150 hp for 3 talent points personally. I guess I see the threat reduction as an insurance thing
---
The gear set with the most success is Exodia's, who holds the record for the most dps on a paladin.
---
I expect Classic to have around 500k more or less active players a few months after release.
---
Heart of the wild isn't excellent at anything it's just the ultimate hybrid spec for the only true hybrid class. 
---
You don't bring leader of the pack which is a huge draw of bringing a feral druid in general. You also don't have natural shape shifter, natural weapons and omen of clarity. 
---
So it makes for an lackluster cat in all pursuits, a decent 5 man dungeon tank and a passable raid healer. 
---
Fresh 60 you will have mostly items with int which increase mana so +% mana benefits you more. When you start to get stuff with +healing, the +% mana talent gets weaker.
---
yes, or you know, these people like something different from what you like.
---
it's people like you who give the rest of us the bad name, stop.
---
I hate that bloodvine is better than t2 and near everything else till Naxx. Thats not fun at all, its craftable ffs.
---
Who are those people though? I realize this is subjective, but in nearly five years of playing Private servers I have yet to meet a single player who have said they would not pay to play Classic.
---
What the hell is wrong about friends helping each other?!
---
In legion i used to raid with a friend with the same character his main was warlock so when i raid with him i play warlock so he can give me the loot on normal or heroic.
---
classic youtubers own.  love me some dudes who were level 30 when tbc came out preaching the good word of vanilla
---
I will either be organizing my own pugs or running with guild only.  Maybe if we put up enough of a stink bliss will not put this in game.
---
I'm hoping they tune it up a little, this is definitely not the vanilla experience
---
Tell that to the toxic private server pvp community 
---
While I respect your comment and opinion and agree with some of it, I have a couple comments.
---
You have gotten really lucky with gear or played a tank.  Vanilla is famous for running a dungeon (or ZG) 50 times to get your BIS loot.  You make it sound like you flip a switch and you're BIS.
---
You are speaking from a PVE raid perspective (point 1) from a person in an very good guild (point 2).  
---
Point 1 - You are leaving out alts, pvp and the other things to do in Classic.  You mention leveling in passing but remember that Classic is better than Retail because of the JOURNEY.  I hear a bit of the "the game starts at 60" mindset in your post, which most of us on this reddit agree is on one of the problems with retail. 
---
Point 2 - My private server guilds didn't steamroll much of anything.  We had occasional trouble with Rag, occasional trouble in BWL, trouble with the trash to Twin Emps, never killed C'Thun until we merged because we couldn't sustain 40 people.  As far as I could tell we had good competent players, but apparently that wasn't the case.  If you are truly worried about steamrolling content, join a mid-tier guild of people you actually like to spend time with.  Many times the elite guilds that clear things on day 1 are full of arrogant jerks anyway (not all members of course).
---
I guess my main answer to your concern is to manage your expectations.  How happy or sad a person is with a particular thing in their life is significantly affected by their expectations.
---
&gt;The meta is so strong in classic that gratification is basically instant.
---
Except that is not really true. Sure, while the actul raids can be cleared in blue gear with the right composition, buffs and debuffs it will still be drastically easier as you gear up. Because the entire process of gearing up relies on you repeatedly showing up to Molten Core, BWL and ZG for months and months to slowly build up the gear you want on your character, saying gratification is instant is probably as far from what the actual game is like as can be.
---
Now let's say you play warrior, and you want a twohander for PvP. You eyeball Ashkandi, and now you need to raid BWL. You need to be in good standing with your guild, and you need to compete with the 6 other warriors and 3 retpaladins and a hunter for the weapon once it drops. It can take you a year or more to finally get it, but when you do, the feeling of accomplishment is massive compared to anything that you experience in retail.
---
Dad, is that you?
---
I just want balance patches and some Mana Regen (talents or abilities) or something for hybrid dps
---
Vegeta!
---
Not sure how you kept arguing with that guy who is clearly delusional for so long. It was fun to read though. I agree with you. 
---
What do players mean when they use the word easy to describe content though? Vanilla raiding isnt mechanically hard, but it can also be unforgiving. The difference between the HP of a tank and the HP of a DPS is very small, and the margin of error on some pulls/bosses is also quite small which means that if a mistake occurs while you are trying to speedrun the dungeon, the raid can still easily wipe in seconds.
---
&gt;It isn't like pservers ever had access to all the scripting and code on a real server, they made it up.
---
I see what you mean, in this circumstance it is foreseeable why this issue has persisted until even this day then. Someone must've cranked out the SQL for loot tables back in the day whenever classic emulation first came about and the server scripting was just too cancerous for anyone to touch or when even when generating it from scratch didn't think twice about it. Thanks. It would be interesting to see what the loot table scripting looks like for demo client, but we'll never know until the time comes bosses are on farm or it is officially said it'll be fixed.
---
You are playing the game wrong if you expect 40man raids to be challenging without trying to speedrun. It was always about the experience you had with the people you played with.
---
Did you not notice the litany of posts from people demanding there be no sub? 
---
Are you telling me you cleared Naxxramas on every class and got full best in slot gear and rank14, and your guild was dominating the world PvP scene while getting all the world bosses?
---
Nah, you didnt beat the game.
---
Back then it wasnt bad, but mmo/rpg design has changed so much that for lots of people it's going to be a slog, wearing white items into your lvl 20s with nothing other than base stats on your greens. Drinking/eating after every few pulls isn't going to be for alot of people
---
Lol wow ain’t alt friendly wouldn’t mattter and got no time for that
---
Its gonna enforce the idea of joining a guild.  
---
Sounds very vanilla.  
---
People on the WoW Forums don't understand what they are saying.
---
But that’s the point? WF and Raid sets in BFA follow the idea of what’s going on then random ass sets like in Vanilla. Troll raid heavily featuring Baron Samedi a death god? Bone Set. Forsaken Vs Night Elves for season 2? Plague Doctor Cloth set (Which I want so bad).
---
&gt; anyone who's eyeing rank 14 is literally going to have to account share and PvP 24/7, so they're not raiding for a while anyway
---
Even that is only for the last few weeks of the grind, from maybe 12-14 when its your turn. Though if you want a turn you will probably be "helping" other grinders who are in that window before that
---
I liked vanilla and I like modern WoW but I had people arguing with me when I pointed out that every time this sub hits my feed it’s bashing retail. 
---
Have you seen lionheart? Bis forever craftable basically day 1
---
But there is variety too. Compare Season 1 Sets to season 2 and the generic horde set bs the Forsaken. I have a remake of classic PvP cloth, plague doctor, Dwemmer cloth, and a baron Samedish cloth set. 
---
I argued the same thing on a random Facebook group recently. I used to multibox in casual PvE, LFR/normal pugs, and I always had all my characters need for each other, and running with friends it's no different. People said it doesn't happen on retail, but that's because we've got personal loot there. When Dragon Soul LFR came out everyone could need on all gear for their class and trade it to whoever they wanted after. Thing was a complete shitshow. 
---
I would prefer no loot trading, and a zero loot trading policy from the GMs too. Make people communicate what drops they need with the group instead of mindlessly pressing need/greed. Mistakes would happen and there would be ninjas, but it's still what I would prefer.
---
They aren't saying anything ground breaking, this is what happens to every MMO.
---
They have an initial rush and then the game populates with the people who want that style of game play over time.
---
3-6 months may not be the exact correct time frame, but it's pretty normal for the initial rush.  After that large groups quit who were just in it for something new, and that will begin to form the actual community.
---
Where they are wrong is that WoW classic doesn't already have a following who will adopt this game, it does already, but there are tons of wrong things that get said about retail players here, so there is no reason to believe they couldn't also make similarly lazy opinions.
---
Yeah, no such thing as poor countries where $15/mo isn't chump change. Or just poor people. Or people who don't want to support Blizz. Or people who don't want to pay for entertainment they already get for free.
---
There may be hundreds of free games, but only one Classic WoW. The people who choose private servers probably don't like said free games.
---
You mean like how people would roll on BoE Patterns and use an Argent Dawn consumable to fake learning it so they could sell it or trade it..? This shit has been happening to the entirety of the games existence.
---
Also, what would stop them from doing this same thing, then ticketing a GM and saying the item was mislooted to you and your buddy rolled second highest, which is something I don’t think a GM could verify but who knows. Run with a guild, your own group of friends, or just deal with it. It’s happened forever and it’ll continue to happen.
---
Rank 14 weapons are about on par with the best BWL weapons. The upside is there's no rng in getting them, just a huge time suck
---
And in vanilla holy pallas wore robes. Like what?
---
Disease Cleansing Totem will cure instantly upon drop, and every 5 seconds in the totem's radius every 5 seconds.
---
So that usually means drop it once to aoe cleanse your whole party, and then just not worry about having to cure them until you move on.
---
Same applies for tremor totem and poison, all 3 instantly dispell when dropped and then every 5 seconds after.  Really nice in group pvp if multiple team mates are hit with viper sting, crippling poison, or feared.
---
I think we're making quite a jump here.  Some PUG on some private server cleared a raid with relatively undergeared people. That sounds too anecdotal to me.  I played on some private servers and this wasn't my experience at all.  My guild was challenged at times.
---
Clear ZG and MC with people wearing greens and memespecs in 90 minutes - I'm sorry but this is NOT going to be what most of Classic raids are going to be like.   I think that private server is under-tuned or that PuG had a core of UBER geared players that carried some greens.  I could be wrong.....but I don't think so.
---
Ah yes the classic I don’t know what the modern endgame is so I’ll use trigger words to try and sound like I know what I’m talking about.
---
You can only teleport to end game content via Warlock or Summon stone, in which case people need to be there. Mythic Plus requires you to make your own team and go to the entrance, same with Normal + in raids.
---
This is why loot trading is, and always has been, a bad decision.
---
- It allows small groups of friends to take advantage of solo players.
---
- It allows guilds to totally own pugs and distribute loot amongst themselves.
---
- It allows ninjas to steal and then attempt to resell items to players. 
---
- Half of people won’t even know they got swindled because they might not realize they’re playing with friends and players can just in-equip BoPs they already have.
---
Are any of us really surprised? 
---
This is the same Blizzard who chastised their own players “don’t you guys own phones!?” royally botched their own BlizzCon, and shut down HotS like it was nothin.
---
Those long debuffs reminds me of a story my friend told me. 
---
So, back in the day he was levelling a rogue, finished the quest line where you learn the "poisons" skill, and got that disease that won't allow you to go stealth for a week. 
---
He played on relatively small-pop server, tried to yell "dispell that thingy off me" on the main city, yet nobody reacted.
---
Then he was like "Ok, guess I won't be playing for next 7 days then!" 
---
AND HE REALLY DID =D
---
We've had a good laugh, considering that there was a follow-up quest, where you can make yourself a cure.
---
They just fill up bags and dont sell on ah. Felt like a waste of space. It's to much to hold on to
---
I was going rogue, but then decided I want my warrior buddies to enjoy the gift of windfury and crit chain lighting artillery support in wold pvp.
---
So now I'm rolling a rogue when solo for money and city ganking, and a shaman for group play as my "real" main.
---
I just need to figure out my twink... I'm thinking druid (that was my main in vanilla) in the 29 or 39 bracket as a feral flag runner.
---
Personally I love the new Clothy Elite set for Season 2. Plague Doctor for my Forsaken warlock? YESSSSSSS!
---
See I play retail enjoy it and play on pservers and will be very dedicated to classic. To claim you have to enjoy one or the other is ignorance. They are two very different games, you can like coke and Pepsi.
---
&gt;You mean like how people would roll on BoE Patterns and use an Argent Dawn consumable to fake learning it so they could sell it or trade it..? This shit has been happening to the entirety of the games existence.
---
So your argument is that because scummy behaviour happened we should make it a lot easier to do? Brain damage?
---
Even as someone who plays primarily with friends, I hope they wake up and fix this before it’s too late. I already emailed blizz devs and I’m hoping they reconsider this. This loot trading really screws over your average solo player
---
You're thinking waaaay too much about how private servers played out rather than how vanila actually was.
---
EU came out after DM was available, and Rag world first came after DM release anyway.
---
Get over it.
---
&gt; I think that private server is under-tuned
---
You might be right.
---
&gt; PuG had a core of UBER geared players
---
Nah.  Blues, a couple of purples tops.
---
&gt; I'm sorry but this is NOT going to be what most of Classic raids are going to be like. 
---
I wouldn't be so sure.  The mechanics on the encounters are *so* easy compared to modern WoW that anyone who has played since even as early as Wrath will find them so trivial that the only knob Blizzard has to turn is to increase damage and health.  If they do that, we might have some good progressive content. 
---
&gt;What the hell is wrong about friends helping each other?!
---
Nothing. A player joining UBRS to help clear it for his friend is perfectly fine. But when that player then need on items he have no intention of ever wearing so he can trade them to his friend it becomes unfair play which should obviously not be condoned.
---
If you're only playing 2 hours a day then the problems you're referring to aren't really big issues. The content release dates would line up fairly well with when you're getting shit unless you're just straight up getting lucky. Outside of that though, gearing isnt the only thing to do in the game. Might even be one of the less fun things to do in the game.
---
&gt;Heart of the wild isn't excellent at anything
---
Try telling that to the 10man UBRS group where the warrior offtank sits there being useless for 50% of the trash and all of the bosses.
---
Well said. 
---
Blizz is fixing something that wasn't broken. 
---
Classic system works great. The entire point of Bind on Pickup is that it *stays bound once you picked it up*.
---
I never met anyone who needed to contact support because some one accidentally clicked Need, and then ALSO accidentally clicked Yes to "are you sure". There are two effing clicks! 
---
Yet, Blizz thinks this tiny, tiny issue is so grand that it invented an entire system that unintentionally makes things worse for the average player. 
---
Spending precious resources where they don't need to be wasted. Classic Blizz.
---
my thoughts exactly.
---
Classic WoW is the steak, and Retail is mostle sizzle. People today are just addicted to the sizzle because that is what they have been given for too long.
---
Do you even lift, bro?
---
Many protections.
---
Good bot.
---
Hope they change it, including class balance patches. Personally only see certain things ruining classic like lfg system, sharding, personal loot, flying, Respec costs, or any major hits to economy.  
---
I think people should be more welcome to balance patch and changes like this. Vanilla was in constant flux. Wish they would add lock stones and mage bartables
---
&gt; you can like coke and Pepsi
---
YOU JUST TORPEDOED YOUR OWN ARGUMENT!
---
*throws down overly-dramatic gauntlet*
---
AFAIK, white hits when sitting won't trigger skill procs like fury warrior's or paladins skills; namely reckoning.
---
But if you are sitting and stand, yellow attacks will proc reckoning.  It will be much harder to abuse in classic than on MangOs based servers, for sure.  Assuming you know, you can deal with losing a massive chunk of your health bar just a couple reck procs.
---
I think we are going to be surprised at the number of people who stay. It’s easy to shit on classic until you actually experience it.
---
Theyre hypocritical idiots trying to relive their life 14 years ago. Youre going to be met with their bad reactions from cognitive dissonance when you bring up your logic.
---
It would be hilarious if the /u/ mentioned is not the creator of the bot and is actually some guy the creator hates.
---
WoW sub isn’t just retail people post about classic there all the time. It’s just Reddit is outraged at blizz right now so it’s only live stuff atm.
---
I hope they do that after Naxx.
---
&gt; Whoever argues in that way should simply consult a shrink...
---
I think it should be kept. No need for insults.
---
Knowing Blizzard, it will be released the second week of September when its still "*technically*" summer.
---
If they actually keep loot trading we’re going to see so many more complaints and issues of ninja’ing than we would’ve seen without it.
---
Whoever makes these decisions at Blizz has their head up their arse
---
I don't really care how it will work, because if loot trading is in the game, I won't be.
---
And then you ruin it with socks and sandals.
---
I think lightwell could be situational though.  There are some fights where you could put one next to the warlocks to heal their own lifetap or put one in the path of a kiter to click as he runs by.  Mostly garbage but probably has a few situational uses.
---
I never really speak up about this stuff in games but I hate this change so much I emailed ion directly about it lol. 
---
I’m not sure if that’s the best person to email, I just hope blizzard finds out somehow that this is a huge mistake
---
&gt;*Do you remember the 21st night of September?*
---
&gt;*Love was changing the minds of pretenders*
---
&gt;*While chasing the clouds away*
---
&gt;*Our hearts were ringing*
---
&gt;*In the key that our souls were singing*
---
&gt;*As we danced in the night*
---
&gt;*Remember how the stars stole the night away*
---
Sheep moon*
---
For the same reason everyone goes "we need to add more content after Naxx."
---
My experience with Blizzard tells me September 22nd, last day of summer.
---
It would have to meet a series of requirements.  
---
1. no change in character level.
---
2. no continent changes. (meaning added content has to be connected to already existing world)
---
3. no item affix additions, only pre existing item affix's allowed to roll on gear.
---
4.  Must use pre bc class balance patch to minimize "drastic changes".  At most this would do is allow pally tanks and a few other minute builds to bloom.
---
He's saying you can't like classic (coke) if you like retail (pepsi). My argument is you can. That is literally my argument?
---
Are you illiterate or incompetent?
---
&gt;e the main reas
---
The sock with flip flops... DAD IS THAT YOU???
---
&gt; Blizz is fixing something that wasn't broken.
---
This is what boggles my mind. The Classic loot system is perfectly fine. Why are they wasting time, energy, development teams, on a redesign? 
---
Not to mention the *new* system is flawed in ways that the old one isn’t!
---
It’s a bonus every time you cast it, which is a ton in PvP and grinding. Think about it as making PW:S as 15% more efficient
---
There are good trolls and bad trolls.  The good trolls are the Darkspear.
---
The bad troll are online, foolishly saying that Classic will die out in 3-6 months.  
---
This kind of bad-troll thinking almost ended in Hakkar returning.  
---
Listen to the good trolls, and stay away from the voodoo.  
---
The result will be the same like in Vanilla, since GMs handled loot mistakes. 
---
I've run into this same thing in Real Life.  Some people don't think deserts are beautiful.  That is crazy, all natural scenes have their own natural beauty.  Remember that scene in Forest Gump where he's running and it pans through 4 or 5 really beautiful scenes....all very different ecosystems.  Embrace the Barrens!
---
Also, you go there for the chat, not the scenery.
---
The Forsaken/Lorderoneans are the main people they ally with though. They really are only in the horde because of Sylvanas and Night Elves attacking them.
---
Because it's hard to believe a company like blizzard could pour so many millions of dollars and hours into a game only to have it end up worse than before. It really is hard to believe, but it happened.
---
you don't want classic wow
---
They praise the sun. 
---
Commence the triggering
---
Are those the Engineering ones or are those the square ones that Flight Masters use? The latter is from the Gahz'rilla quest and was removed at some point in Vanilla or TBC because nobody picked that reward over the Carrot on a Stick.
---
&gt; Loot Trading will basically remove PuG Raids for Classic
---
No it won't lol. 
---
Your thought up scenario being so common that PuGs are killed is nothing but the result of extreme paranoia and the assumption that almost everyone playing is an anti-social asshole. 
---
I mean, it's not at all impossible that is what will happen. The gaming world has changed a lot since WoW first came out, and this subreddit is in no way representative of the average gamer, or even the average WoW gamer. Classic will definitely feel dated and boring to a lot of people, and while launch might be strong due to the nostalgia, it's entirely possible that the game will only be left with a very small, dedicated community after 6 months. If the size of that community is small enough, then "die out" is a pretty accurate description.
---
Years of reinforcement of each other.  From the Wall of No to You Think You Do, etc.  They have stood there with a sense of security behind them of always being right and now it got torn down and they can't handle it.
---
They are petrified Classic will overtake Retail and they are using insults and put downs as a defense mechanism.  The age of Classic is upon us and Retail will be the one that dies.
---
Who would be against this idea? It's pretty much giving everyone what they want.
---
Server costs are minimal for large companies. I remember reading a report (can't find it now) that the annual upkeep cost of a server for most companies is 3 - 4 thousand dollars. However this was for traditional servers, not cloud based, shared server systems that seem to be in use today (although I would like to see traditional, dedicated servers so that we don't have to deal with sharding and slowdown). Regardless, every company greatly exaggerates their server costs because it's an easy excuse for what would otherwise be a complex topic.
---
It's the manpower dedicated to maintaining a specific set of servers that would probably be an issue. Since it's an online game with thousands of people, bugs and issues would be constantly being found... especially since they're building on the retail back-end. 
---
There will be no end to updates for the foreseeable future, which means splitting up the team and handling multiple versions compounds the issue. Slow updates and fewer fixes to player requests.
---
Since we all know that Activision is calling the shots now, the only way they start dedicating more manpower (and therefore money) is if becomes not only successful... but profitable. 
---
Fuck that bruh I want to Need everything and then trade it among my bois 😂
---
I come from post-communist country and I did not have enough money to pay for subscription (not that it even occured to me, the idea of paying for games was pretty foreign in my country 10 years ago). Do you really think that I was looking for a random video game to play? No, I wanted to play WoW. And since I wasn´t able to pay for subscription, I went the pirate way, just as thousands upon thousands in my country did.
---
If you missed Tanaris and Un'goro you are in for a treat.  Very nice zones with cool quests.  Also some really good nodes there.  Un'goro has Rich Thorium and a ton of dreamfoil.  Good place to far Elemental Fire also.  
---
Silithus is more challenging than your regular leveling zone.  A good place to grind or do a few quests if you are close to max level.  A good place to grind is those elementals in the NW corner - might as well work on your MC faction on the way up.
---
Yeah Loot Trading is not all bad. I will admit to that. Its a nice feature BUT the negatives are waaay worse than the positives.
---
Socks with sandals is the exact opposite of peak performance.
---
Totally this, but add 2 kids to the mix too. Wait till their in bed before I start tv/movie/game. So 1-2 hours some nights a week.
---
I never hit level-cap in vanilla (altaholic, plus it was a much longer slog than it is now) whereas I have 2 max and a 3rd on its way in retail after coming back to the game a few months ago after a 5-6 year break.
---
I'll try Classic, sure I'll enjoy it at first, but there are SOOO many QoL improvements in retail (especially if you have lots of alts) that I imagine I'll come back to it and get more alts to max. 
---
Hoping to be pleasantly proved wrong tho :)
---
This argument makes no sense, and is brought up constantly. EU got the game 5-6 months after NA, so of course they have stuff from later patches. This has no bearing on if it is a good experience for the game. The first onyxia kill was in january 2005, 2 months after release. People were in Molten core for months, at least 3, and at most 4-5 progressing through Molten core before Dire maul was released. The world first Ragnaros was a couple weeks after Dire Maul was released, which could be an indication of the strength of the gear and how it made it easier.
---
Then I’ll abandon all hope. Jk my plan for that is to play as much as possible but not stress it. Still gonna enjoy my nest for the week and watch old wow vids on my downtime/screw around on stream/chat with my buddies 
---
You will go Mental Strength until your gear improves.
---
That makes more sense
---
Clearly, you're doing it wrong.
---
It is because they never played it. Simple as that. Lack of RELIABLE information makes people say stupid things. Their assumption is based on gossip, basically, gossip from retail players, that never ever played Vanilla, retail players that consider, exclusively,  that a TIME consuming game, without QoLs, is doomed to fail.
---
This is pretty much the extent of the retail players knowledge : if a game can be "beaten" in 10 minutes, by pressing a "join raid" button, its a "good" game.
---
A game that require months only to reach max level, and YEARS to complete the content...is a "bad" game, for them.
---
They (the retail players) simply don't know better.
---
Me: can I get a coke please
---
Server: pepsi ok?
---
Me: er, I'll have water
---
They’ve said in their blog post it applies to Bind on Pickup, and common sense dictates it would obviously mirror the same system currently in place in retail.
---
We DO know how it works, it pushes power toward groups/guilds and screws over the average player. 
---
And will continue to lol
---
Mans is clearly joking with you. Lighten up?
---
I predict that there will be no more announcements of "Reserved" loot, but that is exactly what will be going on 99% of the time, leading to lots of wasted time farming your pre-BiS.
---
The moral of the story is, don't run in pug groups unless you have absolutely no other choice. The chances of getting the loot you are after will be very low.
---
If your class can be Orc, always pick Orc; no exceptions. 
---
Not much reason to go Succubus when you can Soul Link + Void walker and eat any rogue 1v1 at any time. 
---
That's what Jordan Peterson talks about a lot. Equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome. The same outcome no matter the effort put into it, is hurting everybody in the end.
---
It COULD be changed.
---
I forget meta humor isn't well received here. My favorite counter troll is to get more literal and serious because then the person trolling me gets frustrated thinking their troll is completely missed. Then I laugh
---
It took me well over 25 runs to get the healing robes from UD Strat, something like 35-40. Under the new system, I can see this stretching on for more than a year in some cases, for someone who really wants that pre-BiS item.
---
What class is he?
---
No, my argument is that this shit happens no matter what. Should we take it to your logical extreme of everyone gets personal loot, like live, and it’s 100% untradeable? That’s the most fair. No one can ninja anything and it solves all of our problems! 
---
Oh wait, the slippery slope... gosh darn it. It’s almost like there isn’t an actual solution and people just want to screech about a change being implemented that would remove a large amount of time consuming nonsense for GM’s to deal with. This has the potential to do far more good than harm. Lower ticket queue times and situations of actual mislooting being solved instantly.
---
If a group of 3 assholes do this sort of shit, blacklist them, like we did to Ninjas back in the day. It’s that easy. But wait, it’s YOUR item being taken, so that small chance so is all consuming to you that you ignore the benefits. 
---
Also, insinuations of Brain Damage? Are you really that petty dude? “Ooo, I disagree with his reasoning, so I’m going to start hurling insults!” That’s the kind of shit 6 year olds do on the playground, grow the fuck up.
---
Because they don't want ppl to use GM's to accomplish this same thing. In the old system loot was also traded, however you needed to ticket a GM to do it. A better solotion would be to not put in loot trading in Classic and just make a rule GM's won't trade loot. But i can see where Blizzard is coming from. 
---
U look like fucking sonic with that chest piece
---
The people that say it will die fast IMO are describing themselves. Its like asking people about their pets personalities, they just describe their own personalities.
---
Most of those people can only see themselves playing classic for 3 to 6 months before leaving, so they extrapolate that across everyone. Its stupid, but thats how people think. Most of these people were **Wall of NO** people as well, and they are just angry they were wrong. So they are in the "bargaining" stage of grief where they are like "Okay, you can have it, but it will die in 6 months anyway".
---
Sure, free would be nice, but I think that's an unrealistic expectation. I think it will be a very small % of people that will be lost because of a subscription price.
---
Yeah.. I had my doubts about classic. I played on a private server 2 months ago, I adapted pretty fast and didnt really miss features I expected to miss. Maybe it’s cause I played in actual classic but it was amazing.
---
I had to force myself to quit at level 40, don’t want to be burned out when it drops and I don’t want to put a lot of effort in on a pserver. 
---
So far I enjoyed it far more than Legion and BFA combined!
---
Your first post acts like it’s unknown whether they intend to include it. You’re wrong, right now they intend to include it and they’ve specifically described how and why.
---
Of course anything COULD be changed, that goes without saying  
---
MC and ZG are what? 1% of the entire game? This is how you judge the longevity of a game?
---
Raiding is "just too easy" ? FOR WHOM ? For you ? For me ? Yes, it will BE EASY.
---
But 80% of the Classic player base won't make it past BWL. They just can't. Too damn casual to be able to go past BWL. Not enough discipline, commitment, TIME for farming gold for consumables.
---
Not even ONE YEAR after BWL is live, most guilds WILL NOT CLEAR IT. 
---
As for AQ40 and Naxx...those 80% of the players will ONLY admire it from outside.
---
Go to R3tr0 w0w (instant 60), pick a war tank get gear and try some dungeons (theres lots of people)  
---
I found tanking pre wrath to be absolutely miserable experience. Never enough rage, aggro being pulled away, mobs running around etc.  
---
Try it before you commit 200 hours to a class you might not enjoy.  
---
Fairly sure you are mixing up the Fireball dot with Ignite there
---
BfA still has more subs than vanilla ever did AFAIK
---
I know they intend to. Did it say they didn’t? My post is about how we don’t know how it will be implemented. Stop trying to assume what a stranger you have never met means. You just wanted to tell me I’m wrong. I never once questioned if they will put it in. It’s a certainty.
---
Pi is crappy, only reason it’s viable at all is because of priest talent trees are kind of weak. It’s gimmicky in PvP, marginal af in PvE.
---
If you're talking organized (group queue) PVP in battlegrounds, the ability of any class to 1v1 a rogue is a non-factor. You shouldn't worry about it because you'll just never face a rogue 1v1 in that setting.
---
Incorrect. Summer lasts until the autumnal equinox on Sept 23rd
---
I think the best argument for light well is that it could be kind of fun.
---
It's the same people who would say Diablo 3 is fine game.
---
It’s best practice for Druid’s to innervate priests. Even though priests have tremendous mana regen, the nature of their healing role basically always means they are strapped for mana. I used to spec into crit regrowth and would sometimes innervate myself if someone went down and I needed to go absolutely nuts trying to keep people alive, but otherwise, priests generally get more use out of the mana.
---
Some fights even call for innervating Shaman, and on rare occasions some circumstances even call for innervating Mages. I don’t think I ever innervated a hunter though. Even I wouldn’t stoop that low,
---
Video games are just emerging from a period of infancy if you think about it. There are only two or three generations of people that have developed alongside this new mode of vicarious experience and come out the other side with an adult perspective on them. 
---
As a mode of storytelling, it's clear that video games stimulate more senses simultaneously than any mode before it, whether those are theater, books or movies. 
---
As a mode of learning, it's clear that video games are incredibly powerful for teaching in a way that is memorable and compelling. The only times I ever purposely sought to learn or do math is when I realized that it gave me a competitive advantage in whatever game I was playing at the time. The cognitive benefits of video games are well documented now, which is something I think most of us gamers felt and knew long before any measurements were available. People who play a variety of games have brains optimized for problem solving. They're also buffered against mental health problems. They can more quickly and easily reorganize neural connections and adapt to new sets of rules, track objects better in space, and the list goes on and on.
---
The cognitive harm of video games is well documented now too. For people who play the same game for a long period of time, the returns of these benefits diminish and eventually reverse. Those neural connections become resistant to change, to new sets of rules, and to new environments whether digital or real. People develop an emotional attachment to their competencies and the environments in which their competencies are relevant. 
---
I can feel when this has happened, because that's when the game begins to feel repetitive. What was once a space of exploration becomes familiar and predictable, and before you know it, the class, quest, zone, and eventually the whole game feels like a chore that I have to complete in order to arrive at one of the last few remaining unexplored classes, quests, zones of exploration that exist for me. 
---
I think that's mostly the appeal of Classic WoW. People including myself feel like they have some unfinished business, some unexplored territory that calls to a ten-years-younger self. The exploration of which might provide closure to a lingering sense of purpose that, let's be honest, was never meant to conclude to begin with.
---
That brings me to what I think is a major part of our generation's hard earned wisdom about video games. A game can hijack your sense of purpose and meaning and then keep you spinning your wheels on a treadmill of drip-fed exploration. That is what great RPGs like WoW in particular do best and what they are specifically optimized to do. Those games quickly become dangerous in a non-trivial way. 
---
The newly popular opinions and trends we see in gamers over the past 7-10 years have developed to reflect that new wisdom I think. We can spot the more insidious treadmills more easily than before, reject them more readily, or at least make a more informed decision about what we're getting into. We realize that we can't play the game in order to win the game. If we think that way, we will be filled with a sense of meaninglessness as soon as a new update introduces newer and better things to win. 
---
So instead, we have to play the game for the fun of playing it, or at least for the fun of continuing to re-win it every cycle. This change in attitude and realization among the population I think is why RPGs have declined in popularity, while games not centered around storytelling/storyliving and thus carry no implicit promise of closure have increased in popularity. My identity isn't tied up in League of Legend's Alistar the same way it is tied up in WoW's Horde and the Tauren Druid that I spent several years playing/being.

I have a business conference that week so add my bad luck to that guys

That is the best Holy build I think. You can move that one point in Holy Reach to Spell Warding or wherever. Improved Renew didn't scale with gear, it only effected base Renew, which made it a not so great talent. There are fights with area damage, so obviously reduced pushback on heals is useful. 
---
&gt; MC and ZG are what? 1% of the entire game? This is how you judge the longevity of a game?
---
I don't have the time to respond to this.  Endgame raiding is easy at every level except probably deep into AQ and Naxx.  Since the content will be gated, MC and ZG will be a huge portion of what max level players actually do in-game.
---
&gt; But 80% of the Classic player base won't make it past BWL. They just can't. Too damn casual to be able to go past BWL. Not enough discipline, commitment, TIME for farming gold for consumables.
---
Consumables are not needed and raids can be pugged.  I don't get what part of that you people seem to be missing.  These raids are so easy that pugs who don't even use Discord (or even all speak English) can clear them in a couple of hours.  I'm not speculating here; this has been my actual experience on private servers.
---
&gt; Not even ONE YEAR after BWL is live, most guilds WILL NOT CLEAR IT.
---
80% of guilds who enter BWL with the intention of clearing it will clear it.  The other 20% will not because their players and leadership will get bored before they do and disband.
---
&gt; As for AQ40 and Naxx...those 80% of the players will ONLY admire it from outside.
---
Only organized guilds will fully clear AQ and Naxx at first, but eventually those will be pugged too.
---
Socks and sandals -5 CHA
---
Nelf is best for everything. Front Flips Ftw. If you need more convincing then you sir just don't understand vanilla.
---
It will suck for people who hit 60 and gear up fast but it is what it is. Can't be having people in HWL/GM gear before BWL is even out. 
---
Personally I think DM should be held back 1-2 months after release. 
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/) is a more in-depth survey that also covered professions. 
---
Cant argue with that
---
I agree 1000%. That was the pinnacle of world PvP. Hillsbrad war all the way
---
That rug really does tie the room together.
---
Your entire argument is essentially an Appeal to Authority. You keep coming back to "Everyone takes priests over druids when they can" or "Its just the generally accepted reality that druids are bad". Never once have you talked about a druid's abilities or what makes them bad. 
---
By good you mean storing up procs and then unloading them on a player in pvp? Yeah, it will still work. 
---
Honestly that's not a bad idea if they clarify it from the beginning. 
---
🙂 thank you 
---
I hate to use the word bad, but completely shallow of a guide.
---
What's with the rank/level question where the lowest response is 40/70 and monks/demon hunters being included in the classes. Did you forget what subreddit you're on?
---
Why is undead mage so high? Mages are great in pvp, but is wotf really that good for them given how few alliance warlocks there typically are?
---
Same here. Had to take it real slow because the progress is getting wiped when classic hits.
---
&gt; This post is bitching about a concept introduced in Vanilla Wow. It's moronic
---
The most you could say is that the AQ sets were too similar, and I'd agree.  That said, there was still clear differentiation between armor types.  Tier 1, 2, and 3 were highly varied.  The latter had a slight scourge theme in some sets, but an order of magnitude less than retail.  Honest to God, I can hardly tell them apart now.  I could easily see that cloth set being a plate set (both DKs and Paladins have worn robed plate sets before), and they're all the same f'n color.
---
Transmog violates WSIWYG and is one of the worst things you can introduce into an RPG.
---
It's not the apocalypse. Please don't call into question the humanity of people who don't like the same videogames as you.
---
I put Undead Mage and number 2 because I think Mage has to be top 2 no matter what, and I think Undead is the best race you can go for when it comes to Mage PvP. Out of Berserking, WotF, Perception and escape artist, I think the choice is quite obvious. Alliance also have less Warlocks, which is a really hard class to beat for Mage.
---
I’ll be happy if they finish game as it was intended before TBC was scheduled for launch. Karazhan and other zones, specs revamp (hybrids do not need to be top damagers for this + there are enough healers these days, but a bit more fun won’t hurt), MC/BWL/ZG hardening, minor itemization fixes (nerf DM items, fix set bonuses), etc.
---
Tbh TBC was nice, but I’d better play finished Classic.
---
Let’s just hope they won’t bring more of those QOL “improvements”.
---
This subreddit is for Classic WoW - A remake of the original Vanilla version of the game, which is currently unreleased.
---
I think you might want /r/WoW.
---
Look at all of you.  You lot are absolutely infesting this sub now.
---
Except for how lanky and awkward they look, penis ears bouncing with every step
---
I've always wondered how getting rank 14 on every class means you beat the game? Does someone have to spend atleast ~70 x 7(8?) days straight pvping in premade? Seems like such a weird claim, do you need to beat super mario bros in sub-5min to have beaten the game?
---
&gt; Because they don't want ppl to use GM's to accomplish this same thing.
---
I understand their reasoning. It doesn't change the fact that the new system is terrible replacement because it grants all this power to groups and screws over individual players.
---
Besides, not a single person I ever met actually ever contacted a GM about loot. It just didn't happen. It maybe affected 0.5% of players.
---
Do you think it makes sense to change an entire system around 0.5% of players?
---
Completely agree about the rule that GMs dont trade loot.
---
Bind on Pickup binding should stay. If you get ninja'd, *it sucks but it happens*. Why Blizzard feels the need to parent players is beyond me
---
Not too easy lvling up for me and my friend playing. We've went in blind and have died so many times to just random mobs, let alone stepping foot into a dungeon.
---
"Ohh but, it saves so much GM time because so much of their day was spent fixing loot issues!"
---
I don't understand how people can support Blizzard on this issue. 
---
Simply make a new rule: BoP rules stay, and are never reverted. GMs can no longer help. If you get ninja'd, it sucks but that's life. 
---
I always found it weird that people make these types of comparisons. People say Felheart Shoulders look like dildos, Lawbringer bananas, and now this. I think it is something wrong with the people who think like that, not the actual game design :-)
---
&gt; When Dragon Soul LFR came out everyone could need on all gear for their class and trade it to whoever they wanted after. Thing was a complete shitshow.
---
Completely agree. It was nuts. Everyone literally clicked Need on anything that popped up on their screen. Then afterwords tried to trade or sell it to each other, or give to friends.
---
&gt; I would prefer no loot trading, and a zero loot trading policy from the GMs too. 
---
This is the best solution I think. You don't waste GMs time, you don't introduce a shitty new system, you keep things simple and everyone knows that when something is BoP, it truly binds on Pickup and it aint changing hands. 
---
Simplest solution would be to have a no-trade policy for GMs.
---
In other words, respect the Bind on Pickup rule. 
---
99.9% of players were fine with this in original Classic anyway. Why Blizzard feels the need to create a new flawed system just shows how out-of-touch they are.
---
&gt; how much raider's are going to have to play with ZG and BWL out at the same time
---
2 hours to clear BWL, 6 more if you do ZG 3x/week.  So, about 75 minutes per day.
---
People hate to be on the losing side. People hate to realise when they're wrong. People hate loss on investment. Instead of admitting to the fact that retail is trash and vanilla, people would rather go on the attack and shit all over vanilla.
---
Let them foam at the mouth in their blind uneducated rage. Rest assure that in their heart, they *know* that vanilla is better.
---
&gt; ultra-diehard private server "elites"

Have you played on a pserver?  Most of the people on them are super casual and not very good at the game.

---
Imo they have to release content slightly faster because meta is known. I also think it could indicate intention to release new classic content. If not, i would assume they would actually stagger content releases to keep classic only players subbed longer.

Hello sir. Have you ever played World of Warcraft? If people can increase their chance on pre-raid bis loot without anyone being able to know what they are doing, do you REALLY think I'm paranoid for expecting people to do that? REALLY? I mean, I have played since TBC, I played during Wotlk when this feature was first introduced... I kinda know what I'm talking about.
---
You better bet your ass Blizzard will be looking at the gameplay metrics and figuring out which game people are spending all their time in. If Classic is high, we'll see more content.
---
Warlock/Shaman/SPriest is pretty difficult for Mage to beat, two of them use fear as CC!
---
Meh, they will know the play time for their subs, modern vs classic.
---
[What's wrong with bananas?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/861/482/9d4.jpg) 
---
Blizzard will know. The players won't.
---
ZG WILL trivialize blackwing lair. The enchants, reputation rewards, Zanza flasks and world buff that persists through death especially are a lot to have available. Same with Dire maul gear/enchants/world buffs/mage water toward MC. People that say dire maul and ZG are no big deal have’t done MC and BWL before and after their respective Catch Up dungeons
---
&gt; You are assuming there was an actual design philosophy behind the design of the classes in Vanilla.
---
From Kevin Jordan, the class designer in Vanilla:
---
&gt; So, Prot Paladin is supposed to be damage from being hit, right? Retribution Aura, Holy Shield, You know? I would generate threat this way, I would punish evil for daring to attack me. And then on top of that we wanted his taunt to be more of a rescue operation than a direct insult, right? Like a Warrior is just like: Hey you, you’re a jerk, come attack me. Very direct. I’m intimidating. Whereas for a Paladin the idea was Oh one of my frieds is in trouble, I’ll cast a spell on my friend and it will transfer the threat to me and get that monster to come over and, right? So that’s more in mind with the thematic of he’s a protector and a saver rather than, you know, like a direct yelling and screaming.
---
&gt; So that’s was the thematic approach. The mechanics were difficult because it was much harder to switch targets and use an ability on a friend without the smart targeting stuff that eventually went in. It wasn’t just, you know, hit taunt on the thing that you were already targeting so we had some mechanical difficulties. He was fine generating threat as long as the thing was on him, but once it was off him it was really difficult to get it back on him so that he could go back to generating threat, where as the Warrior was more direct and, you know, consistent.
---
&gt; It’s one of those things where we didn’t have the idea worked out yet and we didn’t want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt you can’t take it away, right? Like anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? why would you do this to us, just give us the thing back. It’s very difficult to take mechanics away. We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt so we were still experimenting and learning as we went but our goal and our philosophy was always do it different; make the bear tank a certain way, make the paladin tank a certain way make the warrior tank a certain way and to a lesser extent make the void walker tank a certain way, just have him feel differently, have the function differently so that they give a different experience and it changes the dynamic of the group and how people have to play and there’s different things going on.
---
&gt; I still feel this interpretation is much less liberal than your own interpretation of the TBC patch notes in which you conclude that the seal proccing effects is a bug in VANILLA based solely on the fact that it's ability to proc got removed in TBC.
---
Well, at least you're willing to admit that it's vague and up to interpretation. :)
---
You mean you don't want Cataclysm-era loot trading system to be introduced to Classic.....??!? 
---
DOWNVOTE HIM BOYS
---
The number one sign you were about to be fucked up in low level Warsong Gulch.
---
&gt; instead of just leaving it the way it was so that we can have the original version of the game.
---
Because this is the problem. It's 2019, not 2004. The *world* has changed.
---
To release Vanilla as it was in 2004 is going to create a very non-2004 experience in 2019.
---
Fun fact: around the Cata launch Mike Morhaime reported that before Cata, only 30% of players kept playing after hitting level 10. Hence why they redesigned the old zones to make them smoother and added heirlooms, increased XP etc.
---
I'm not sure why everyone is convinced this is going to run rampant. How often did you encounter ninja looters in vanilla?
---
Name and shame them and move on.
---
This post was removed because your survey seems to be for modern WoW, based on the level ranges, and not Classic WoW (Rule #1). Please either design a new survey focused on Classic WoW or use one of the numerous surveys already posted on this subreddit.
---
Hahah this!
---
To remove loot trading is to change the game. Period. You want no changes? You keep loot trading and compromise to reflect the fact that GMs don't handle loot trade tickets anymore.
---
Seem basic to understand.
---
There are those of us who are capable of liking aspects both games.   I played through classic &amp; bc and quit in WotLK, and prefer the state of the game back then for the community and RPG aspects, but enjoy mythic + dungeons and raiding in retail for the faster-paced gameplay and more challenging mechanics.   I plan on playing both for different reasons.  There are many people like me.   This sub has a really weird "us versus them" attitude with regard to retail and classic and often forgets that the two playerbases will overlap significantly.   
---
That's true. :(
---
Honestly, I'll be playing BFA and Classic. It'd suck-ass to have to pay $30/mo for that. I'd rather get BFA as a bonus to my Classic subscription than have to pay for both separately. 
---
Who cares if the players know? The players will know if retail continues to suck because content creators will tell everyone it sucks. I've never looked at sub count or what blizz says about their game to decide whether or not I'm going to play or like it, I look at what youtubers/reviewers/friends are saying. Blizzard is the only group that will care about those stats, since it lets them know what players prefer, and they'll certainly be monitoring metrics. If you think they'll have 8 million people playing classic exclusively and 2 million playing BFA and their reaction will be "Everyone loves BFA! We did it!" then idk what you are smoking.
---
The real problem is going to be what wow tokens do to the classic economy thanks to the shared subscription.
---
He wasn't trolling. He was joking and made it obvious he was doing so.
---
The wow forums have been filled with that sort of posting since BC.  Whatever the new hype expansion (or in this case Classic) there are always people saying that it will die within a few months.
---
Denial mostly. They have to try to stop classic wow from being successful or else 10+ years of their life on their current account just went to nothing. I’ve never played anything but classic so I don’t know the state of the current game. Looks like shit on twitch, couldn’t figure out wtf was happening on the screen. Looked like it was super smash bros or something. 
---
Then your statement is useless. We DO know how they plan to implement it because of the blog post and because the system was already in Cata. It’s safe for players to assume that’s how it works because it’s exactly as described to be like the cata  version of having a few hours to be able to trade any BoPs to any group members.
---
Why do you bother posting if you’re so misinformed on the topic?
---
Im aware there are exceptions. But from a pure math standpoint, if you had to statistically pick a group of people most likely not like classic, it would be those enjoying retail. Thus answering OP's question.
---
For shadow anything but Undead is less than optimal. Devouring Plague is a trump card. Dwarf is indeed best for pure healers though.
---
Human may be better for rogue, because perception is incredibly op. Undead vs Orc is a close call Horde side.
---
Now this is a good post. I want to make something like this for hunter ranged weapons now...
---
Lol well you can stay angry. You won’t change my mind. 
---
You guys really need to stop to freak about that staged thing.
---
For those who complain about DM and MC being released at the same time :
---
EU (and probably other regions) release was very close to 1.3. This mean basically no EU player was level 60 on patch 1.3. In general even for US servers, it's easy to guess that WoW population was very low at that point, therefore very, very, veeeery few people were in the situation of having access to MC (which is far from being geared for it), let alone clearing several bosses. **Basically only the tops 1% guilds would have felt the difference of not having DM at the same time of MC. Should we care? Absolutely not.** All people who are complaining about that and saying it will ruin Classic are the worst really. They don't even know what they are talking about.
---
Also, you seem to forget 1 thing all the time. Getting gear in Vanilla was insanely long. **It's not because you will have access to ZG at the same time as BWL that suddenly, you will get full ZG gear in 1 week and BWL will be "trivialized".** It's catchup gear, but not instant cheat mode we you are godlike geared in a few days and suddenly everything is way easier. You are complaining for nothing.
---
&gt;At the very least, I'd expect them to push ZG release at least a month after BWL.. 
---
Again this will change nothing because most people in a raid get very, very few pieces of gear in 1 month. It won't **significantly** change anything.
---
&gt; PvP'ers can deal with the headache for weapons that are an entire tier above the current, I suppose.. 
---
Same reasoning here, you're just worrying for &lt;1% of players that will access to r14 gear. Like really? You want to complain about that? Also none of them will get r14 before stage 3 or late stage 2 arguably.
---
And last point, do you understand that the game is set to last for years this time? Everything you are complaining about will have 0 impact not long after a stage release. Do you get that all you are worrying about doesn't matter at all for 1) Casuals 2) Non-raid PvE players 3) Quest/rep/gold farmers 4) PvP heavy players 5) Alts? 
---
**Only you PvE endgame rushers will be slightly concerned**. Of course in an absolutely perfect world, everyone should have his best wishes fulfilled, but you have to understand that it's possible that Blizzard won't share your priorities, and rather focus on what will affect most of the players.
---
**Just stop saying it will ruin the game because it's utterly wrong.** Loot trading is what you should be complaining the most about nowadays. If that features makes it through, dungeons PuGs are dead.
---
Would be great to add in some color coding for exceptional wands- highlighting high DPS for level required
---
That might be when they introduced connected flight paths, and it drops you off where you normally would have went before
---
Perhaps with no honor system they will give that special tabard to the guy with most HKs when stage 2 hits
---
Offtopic question: Any1 know about how many % will play say horde? Was it close to 50-50 in vanilla and how do you think it will be now?
---
Soupa is awesome and has an interesting career outside of YouTube. I love watching his videos because he talks about his day job as a scientist. Highly recommend watching a lot of his videos.
---
I watched them in order and got to hear all about his continuing education and experiments.
---
NELF EVERYTHING
---
If you want to stick your head in the sand and assume for some crazy reason that we don’t know anything be my guest
---
But anyone with common sense can see they’ve already given us all the info.
---
Unless they announce otherwise, the loot change appears to be identical to what was introduced in cata
---
Ahhh those noob days &lt;3
---
I wonder if Blizz will fix the ear clipping through helms (since it's based on a new client). I'd roll a NELF instantly then. The ears are really the only thing that put me off from rolling one.
---
Right? I always hate that shit. You know what i was mad about when i was 9? Getting a fucking 12th place bronze trophy in a 14 team event. It was like a everlasting idol spitting in my face, stating how unskilled I was due to getting a coach who only cared about his two kids learning the sport. Getting nothing, or some dinky medal, would have been much less of an insult. 
---
People with a job can be equally more "dedicated" than jobless people to something. Having a job or not has nothing to see with being dedicated to do PvP in Wow. But somehow, mostly jobless people will actually reach the last ranks (because they can play 14h+ per day) because of this system. Is that a system that rewards the best / most dedicated players? I don't think so.
---
They're taking the likely outcome of Classic losing a large portion of it's initial player base after 6 months and magnifying it to talk shit. Just like some people here will see the troubles retail is currently experiencing and insist that the game has zero redeeming qualities.
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
Yes I am
---
&gt; The world first Ragnaros was a couple weeks after Dire Maul was released 
---
Lol yeah because of few stats difference here and there is what makes you kill Ragnaros suddenly way easier XD
---
Reddit argumentation. Always the best.
---
If Blizzard boasts that WoW subs have tripled a few months after Classic launches, we're all going to know what that means.
---
Hahaha I'm getting down voted 
---
Bookmarked. Might not even play a caster, but this will be great to share with others.
---
Awesome list.  
---
Having a job or not has a lot to do with how dedicated to WoW you are, because assuming you can't play while working that's 40 hours a week you can't play WoW. 
---
Having a job is your business and your business alone. It's the same as people who can't dedicate all their time to WoW because they are in school or have to raise their kids or any other responsibility. 
---
No one is forcing you to keep your job. 
---
Divided subscriptions mean the player base will be divided between BFA and Classic. Blizzard does not want that. It's possible Wow Classic players will also play BFA which will keep the world flowing. 
---
A lot of people just don't understand how strong the community aspect of vanilla is. It's easy for them to look at vanilla on paper and think it's worse.
---
Hi, /u/lakeboredom
---
Alright then I guess you are a lost cause if you think that way. Laughable.
---
The point is there is a better honor system than the Vanilla one, that will reward better and more dedicated players.
---
39 1v1 you will most likely lose. as an orc you may even pull wins.
---
starting from 42 its becoming alot easier to deal with rogues. again, beeing orc increases your chanced to win a lot. 
---
Did not know this one but nice one, having played a tauren hunter as main, with a wolf as fav pet, it definitely resonate with me... except I was a pure pve boy, on a pvp server ah ah ah
---
gnome mage  
---
dwarf priest  
---
dwarf paladin  
---
dwarf hunter  
---
gnome warlock  
---
undead rogue  
---
orc warrior  
---
orc shaman  
---
nightelf druid
---
they should just get it over with and make retail a console game. I'd play it then.
---
No they don't report sub numbers anymore. It's not an important metric to them,revenue is 
---
It's entitled players like you that ruined this game originally. 
---
"QQ I don't have time to do such and such but I should be rewarded just the same as people who do"
---
Nothing about the system says it's supposed to reward "better" players, just those who get the most honor. Go play League of legends if you want an ELO system in place. 
---
Wait so if I averaged 3 hours per day it would take me 3 months to get to 60? lmao damn
---
I gotta say, if you just started playing on a certain popular vanilla server, you are kind of late to the party.   
---
If you were there at the start of the server and joined a guild that was progressing through MC or ZG instead of just stomping it, it may feel more difficult and rewarding. Jumping into a guild that is already facerolling the content is an easy way to get disengaged. They are just carrying you through the game at this point.   
---
Remember that the timeline of that server got majorly accelerated. ZG should be just releasing now I think, not have been out for months.  Once ZG comes out, you are right you can basically skip your prebis by grabbing gear there.  This will not be the case for classic. We will have a long time with just MC and prebis before seeing BWL and ZG. The accelerated pace of the server really burns players out.   
---
But you are still right, the game is known and it can get boring. I just think you should take your p server experience with a grain of salt.
---
I can enjoy both though, right? 
---
I've enjoyed retail off and on since WoD and a bit of wrath when I was 13. But I really am excited for classic! Especially because it'd be a whole new experience. I've often haven't enjoyed leveling in retail as it feels less like a journey. 
---
I think what it sounds like, from my readings, that OG WoW, while not always easy and accessible, was truly an adventure to sixty, not a grind to 120. I miss the old zones I experienced as a kid pre-cata. I'm leveling a Druid in retail right now and I'm in Darkshore.  And while I think it's actually a pretty fun zone post cata, it was one of my favorites when I was a stupid kid who just wandered around the woods as a night elf Hunter trying to tame owlkin lol. Also I hate the new talent system. Feels less RPGish due to these  meh toon development choices. 
---
That being said, I do enjoy retail WoW, at least rn coming back from break. I don't think it's perfect or the best expac but I'm still having fun. I think I'll enjoy classic alot too! Maybe more so as I prefer a game that is more punishing, a little less cut and dry and does less hand holding. I want to be lost and find my way out, either by trial and error or with friends. Current WoW isn't that, bit I still thinks it's fun and relaxing. Helps me unwind after work :) 
---
Never had an epic drop in retail vanilla. I got the eye of shadow once on private servers then on K3 during the first month I think I got server first stockade Pauldrons (horde) and sold for 300g. Too bad that server died and epic Mount was short lived. 
---
Commenting to save for later. I was a lock for Vanilla and TBC, but a priest for ICC Wrath. I’ll be a dwarf priest from the start this time. 
---
PVE would be preferred realm, 11:45 is pushing it for me but I should manage. 
---
Now... I dunno if this is a good metric on wands to get, but I just did a quick (=DPS/level) in excel and looked at the values to see some "OP" wands, assuming the higher the number, the better. We all know that the Lesser/Greater Magic Wands are nuts for their req. levels, so using that DPS/level as a "guide," we have... 
---
note, dps with dps/level listed
---
Level 5 - Lesser Magic Wand (11.3 dps, 2.26 dps/level) 
---
Level 13 - Greater Magic Wand (17.5, 1.35)
---
Level 17 - Cookies Stirring Wand (22.3, 1.31) DM/VC
---
Level 18 - Gravestone Scepter (29, 1.61) &lt;-- this wand is better than some level 30 options, BFD Quest
---
Level 31 - Goblin Igniter (32.8, 1.06) STV Quest
---
Level 44 - Flaming Incinerator (47.2, 1.07) ZF Drop
---
Level 46 - Noxious Shooter (50, 1.09) Maraudon Drop
---
Level 51 - Wand of Biting Cold (64, 1.25) AV Quest
---
Again, I'm not sure if this is the "best" wand progression out there. It just seems like these ones are relatively "easier" to get, assuming you won't get or buy any random BoE world drops. Also, some classes like mages have class wands that are pretty good, such as Ragefire Wand (37.1 dps, 1.24 dps/level).
---
Remember the rogue poison that lasted 7 days?
---
I'm in the position where I have absolutely no interest in modern WoW, and will only ever play classic (and wherever it ends up, hopefully TBC+).
---
I'm hoping that Blizz aren't just treating it as a project that's slapped on the side of modern WoW. Would love if we could pay a lesser subscription for classic-only, but I doubt that'll happen.
---
Just bear in mind that you are only able to PUG MC and ZG so easily because you are late into the server lifecycle at this point. There is alot of progression to get to that point that you straight up skipped. Also, alot of boss mechanics just aren't working on private servers and further trivialize the fights in MC and ZG. 
---
There are definitely boss mechanics that aren't working right on private server such as healers on sulfuron, chain lightning on ZG snake boss, etc.
---
So it won't just be a difference in damage and health but also non broken bosses, hopefully.
---
well, that was part of a quest, it would clear if u completed it. but ya if u didn't haha --ur fucked
---
&gt; Cookies Stirring Wand
---
Cookie's Stirring Rod looks good on paper but it's actually awful because it's arcane damage. Orc NPCs resist arcane damage -- like the orc NPCs you immediately need to go fight in Redridge and Wetlands. So do slimes the slimes in wetlands. Arcane is the most resisted damage type in vanilla, even more than fire. Avoid arcane damage wands or have a backup to use against arcane-reistant NPCs.
---
You are my new favorite meme
---
The first time I was afflicted, I cured it with my last antivenom. I was pretty annoyed when simply talking to the quest turn in poisoned me again.
---
Yup. Unless that rogue massively outgears you, a SL lock will eat them alive.
---
Rogue jumps you &gt; Sac &gt; DoT &gt; Coil &gt; Immo &gt; Summon &gt; Sac &gt; /laugh
---
What percentage of players on the private server have cleared BWL? I bet its less than 20%
---
Pepsi and coke are very similar though. Unless I don’t get the joke.
---
I mean if you think those two words are mutually exclusive you are as incompetent as he is. 
---
Yeah,
---
I included the damage type because players need to be weary of resistances.
---
It's a good rule of thumb to have a wand of different damage type than you do. Ex. A shadow priest probably shouldn't have a shadow wand and a frost mage shouldn't have a frost wand. (or have backup as you said)
---
No arenas.
---
&gt; on patch 1.3. In general even for US servers, it's easy to guess that WoW population was very low at that point,
---
To be fair, it was probably higher back then than it is now.
---
That's my point. Retail and classic are very similar when you compare them to anything else. Like Pepsi vs coke vs tea aka counter strike.
---
The best solution is to only allow trading for greeded items.
---
Another solution it to make all items Unique, like Blackstone Ring, so if you have one you cannot loot another.
---
The first solution is by far the simplest. Loot trading of needed items is 100% unnecessary. Anyone arguing for it is either a dumbass, or planning on abusing it.
---
If you fuck up by needing an item you don't actually need, next time don't be a moron.
---
People need to pug UBRS all the time even if they are in a raiding guild. Usually you are expected to have pre-raid bis before joining an active raiding guild.
---
I think people are taking my comment the wrong way, I'm just talking statistical odds, I'm not the fun police of course people exist that like both. 
---
Yep. Have a pretty old school dad. Would have to tab out quickly when I heard his footsteps, otherwise it would be no bueno for me. I wasn’t a huge gamer though, but even one hour during a school night was frowned upon. 
---
Yup. Just make it clear in the Request help section.
---
*Roundabout plays* To be continued...
---
Ok just making sure, Mr. Officer sir lol 
---
The list is arranged by level required. You can just run your eye down the dps column and the outliers jump out immediately.
---
If they add post naxx content, naxx should still be the bis gear. I’d love for them to add more raids that get people naxx ready. If you got people with pre naxx bis now, they would be able to clear naxx. So it would be nice if they added some 49 mans for some naxx quality gear so we can get those 8 geared tanks for 4HM without sniping them from other guilds.
---
Interesting. Does this also aplly to damaging spells? 
---
Perception is utter garbage compared to hardiness, not to mention that you dont have to play vs Orc if you are one yourself, after an Orc resist two kidney shot in a row, that perception of yours will feel pretty useless.
---
&gt;Ahh okay, I didn't realize that. Thanks for that tip!
---
Ego. They can't accept the game they play used to be better...to some people.
---
Yeah I don’t see that last issue being easy or anything. However it is still significally better in vanilla that it bevame in tbc. Some examples include stones from mining iron, grave moss, various engineering trinkets, major factoon rep turn-ins, world pvp as a consequence of ganking (Shattrath was just too far away from e.g. Redridge). Also gates of AQ farming process.
---
And some more probably, the point is that it is more than possible to make happen. Sometimes I wonder if the marketing dept. took over, and considered tbc is a separate product, which should then exist in its own universe. 
---
heavily depends on the server
---
back then most server were alliance heavy, partly because certain kind of gamers didnt find any horde race "beautiful", which was addressed in tbc with bloodelves
---
 but big private server in the last years  were within 45:55 ratio
---
It's pretty easy to understand bro, it's just more "fuck religion" edgy bullshit
---
you are high!
---
d3 is fine and classic will find its consistent playerbase
---
sry for breaking your worldview
---
&gt; telling themselves people enjoy their game again
---
*There are* people who enjoy retail as it is, I don't want to take it away from them, do you?  
---
I'm just happy enough they're giving us Classic after more than 10 years of asking.
---
&gt; do not want to be linked to modern wow
---
You won't be.
---
Blizzard is perfectly capable of reading their metrics so they'll know *exactly* who plays what.
---
Tellling *us* is a totally different matter, but I honestly don't care, we all know Classic will most probably be more successful than retail.
---
&gt; I don't own BFA
---
You will.
---
They changed it some years ago so every time a new expac comes out they give for free the previous one to all registered accounts, even if inactive, so *you will* own BfA as soon as the next expac comes out.
---
current bfa subs are guesstimanted at 2-3m, end of vanilla had 8m
---
Ya, I don't agree. There's a reason Alliance absolutely dominated TBC arenas, despite the prevalence of mace specs. Granted, Vanilla is not TBC and Hardiness was nerfed to 15%, but early TBC arena is the closest thing we have to an actual rating system for racials.
---
Throwing perception in a WSG flag room or at an AB node is extremely powerful. It's the only real counter to stealth, the most powerful ability in the game, in wPvP.
---
Hardiness is extremely solid, no doubt (and there's a reason it was nerfed to 15% (+5% gem) in TBC).
---
No sexy Engineering item will live for the WotLK googles that not only make you, but also everyone around hot!
---
I keep telling people to watch out for Tauren Gnomes and Goblin Accountants, truly the most fearsome combos to roam the lands of Azeroth.
---
Someone had that stupid and irritating spyware that takes screenshot every second. It was the worst virus a gamer can catch...
---
Actually it's the fashion now so jokes on you. I'm not even kidding.
---
But Platinum! What’s the best hunter pet?!
---
Yeah, his Vanilla Flavors series is great. 
---
\*Jungle Remedy prices rise\*
---
Anyone got a link to what these goggles actually are?
---
&gt; You keep loot trading and compromise to reflect the fact that GMs don't handle loot trade tickets anymore.
---
Except that they still can do it. They just decided not to do it for classic.
---
Removing loot trading is also a change, yes. But this one would have significantly lower effect on gameplay than allowing free loot trading.
---
The best suggestion I heard was, everyone in group when the item dropped needs to agree that the trade can happen, otherwise it can't. No screwing over allowed, done and done.
---
wait, isn´t it still like this?
---
&gt; But this one would have had significantly lower effect on gameplay than allowing free loot trading.
---
Free loot trading? Loot trading was already free in Vanilla. There's literally no difference other than whether a physical body is on the other end clicking the reassign button.
---
unless classic goes with progressive itemization it will be much much easier than pserver for fresh 60 till aq40
---
I refuse to sub to such a shit game so I wouldn't know  :(  I'd rather them have one less sub than mess around until classic. Speaking with my wallet.
---
You want to tell me that handing loot to every party member within 2 hours is the same thing as doing it through GM? Are you serious?
---
It also depends what is "dieing" exactly, according to the WoW forums WoW is dieing since Vanilla anyway :D
---
&gt; There is alot of progression to get to that point that you straight up skipped.
---
Several guilds advertise as "all content cleared from day 1."  They didn't progress, they just steamrolled.
---
F.
---
&gt; Huh, that figures. You know, that's the most beautiful thing about this: to be vindicated after all these years! I always thought I was right back then, but I could never be sure. Awesome
---
I am sorry to tell you this but you are still wrong, if you tryhard enought you might get to the top in MC PUG (where most dont give a fu and are here to gear alts) but past this scaling will get so bad people will catchup very fast.
---
It is the same for all those "bad specs". If feral had any hidden super secret thingy people would have already figured it out, there has been a lot of theorycrafting during those 16 years. 
---
The people who were there already did it and the people who weren't are likely in for some frustration and slower mechanics compared to their nostalgia-by-proxy.  Also, it's not exactly the experience because it's starting at 1.12, and vanilla was a journey not a destination.
---
It'll do fine as a niche offering, but when people are saying 3-6 mo, that's all the casuals fleeing to easier titles with newer pop culture references.  EQ legacy servers brought back the old guard, they didn't grow the game past its original pull yet that's what people seem to think will happen here.  Remember the population peak wasn't in vanilla.
---
CARBONITE Enemy \[Homzi\] detected near you
---
No. Damage talents all increase the total damage dealt, so they scale with +damage which is great. For some reason all healing talents don't though.
---
I do expect things to be a little tougher than on the pserver scene.  But I feel bad for all the people who think classic is going to even come close to their memories of vanilla progression.  They are going to clear old raids they remember as being "soooo hard" in a couple of tries and think, "that's ... that's it?!"
---
Why do you care about what players know? Blizz will know you are only supporting classic.
---
&gt; You want to tell me that handing loot to every party member within 2 hours is the same thing as doing it through GM? Are you serious?
---
Yup! Guess you didn't play Vanilla, did you?
---
To give you a modern example: The dev from Nost did an AMA on this very sub two weeks ago and admitted that they had to ban all loot trading because a full 1/4th of their GM tickets were loot trading related.
---
row 1 column 1, my retail character. Just add that islamic staff from Darkshore warfront.
---
So you say you don't want to have shared sub because you think they will start to show us sub numbers, which would be high, and some people may decide to buy BfA because of that, which you don't want to?
---
This is the most weird reason for separate sub i have seen. I mean i also wanted separate sub but for other reasons. Yours looks weird.
---
He did not specify if that was dungeon or raid.
---
And i can bet 99% of them were raid loot.
---
Hey, thanks for making this!
---
Yeah yeah only those 2 extremes exist. Either make it accessible for the &lt;1%, or make it free for everyone. Sure, the world has always been like that.
---
You should be president.
---
its gonna push for big community guilds, not just raiding guilds  
---
cry me a river  
---
I think transmog is good for retail. Without it you have several expansion packs worth of content with no purposes at all. Obviously for Classic it would be a travesty but for retail it brings a huge amount of content. Probably one of the reasons not to make as many tier sets.
---
This is a good list. The wands between 1 and 1.1 dps/level are relatively unexceptional for their level and can be replaced by any rare wand of similar level. But the ones with much better ratios Lesser Magic Wand, Greater Magic Wand, Gravestone Scepter, and Wand of Biting Cold are worth going out of your way to get.
---
Check out my [priest leveling guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/) for a list of the best quest reward wands.
---
Arena wasnt in Vanilla, so no point bringing that into it. Dwarf Rogue is not the way to go, you will have to fight vs Orc as Alliance, and that is horrible for a Rogue, Stoneform doesnt outweigh that you literally cant get your stuns in properly half of the time
---
Tbc != classic.
---
 Rogues AND druids were insanely strong and the most versatile classes in 2v2 and 3v3 arena. That is why perceptIon became strong.
---
Since classic has no arena it is either duel/ wPvP or BGs. And in bgs rogues amd druids ( flag carry aside) are not that strong. 
---
Garbage? Maybe not, but Orc is the clear winner in my book
---
if this is true, I need to watch the video just to see what even is in there
---
1. Add Karazhan as a post-naxx raid, along with the crypt (kara25 and kara40?)
---
2. Add Grim Batol dungeon
---
3. Add that Uldsomething raid (the one in Tanaris, that even has an unfinished questline
---
4. Something behind that Mage Tower Portal, and an equivalent for the Horde. Player housing? But please, not garrison, and not another continent. 
---
5. Emerald Dream raid
---
6. Hyjal as a level 60 raid
---
7. Long-promised epic "War of the Ancients" raid, which ended up as several 5-man dungeons.
---
8. Quel'thalas as a some sort of questing hub
---
Hi, /u/Kraidrunner
---
I wonder if it's just people who've never played the game speculating about how compelling the game will be?
---
I know that before I started I didn't think I'd ever commit to playing long enough to reach 60, or paying monthly for a game for that matter, I just figured I'd try the free trial. Years later it's still my favorite game and I'd gladly hand over money every month to play it.
---
It might end up being a giant fuck up on Blizz's part to listen to those people. Could be that 90% of the people that try it for the first time will be hooked right away and not quit, turning phasing (And I'm assuming a "temporary" raising of the population cap.) into a far reaching, travesty if they guess wrong.
---
Well it could actually play out a lot differently. This private server is approaching "dead" very rapidly. Alot of the hardcore guilds are losing members left and right and recruiting new players to stay afloat (Also pugging raids). Hopefully in Classic, you don't get a massive amount of hardcore players quitting because their char is literally getting deleted in July. This could lead to you not getting into a progressed guild or PUG right out of the gate. 
---
There were about 10 guilds that cleared BWL in the first week. That's roughly 400 people on a 10 000 pop server. It is also the most hardcore players that know everything and in Classic will be spread out across many servers.  
---
Clearing MC on day 1 is not possible, because you are level 1. 
---
My experience was awesome on the private server. I hit 60 around September, and my leveling guild slowly converted to a raiding guild. We farmed MC/silithus for Hydraxian rep for a week before being able to summon Luci and killed him the next week.  It took us about a month to fully complete MC (took over 5 hours). Getting the FR gear on MT and building up a raid group of 40 consistent players with the right comp was the major blocker there.  Slowly, we geared up and got better, being stronger let us do more efficient strategies and we are just now getting to the point where we faceroll MC in 1 hour 20 minutes. We don't flask for trivial content like hardcore guilds do. Alot of us were new to Vanilla and didn't know the content, had to learn how to get through ony and such. 
---
It only started to feel tiring when ZG came out a few weeks after BWL and all of a sudden we had to raid 5+ instances a week. Once ZG is on farm, its a bit tiring to run MC, ZG twice, BWL , Ony every week. 
---
Guess I'll just go and Wooosh myself
---
Nobody saying Gnome Warrior???
---
Escape artist is one of the best racial actives in the game. It also makes up for a week spot in the warriors kit. Jumping out of a frost nova makes frost mages a much more fair fight. 
---
rogue at first place? Hmmm... lets have a short look at 1-4.
---
Rogue: great duels, good wPvP, mediocre in bgs
---
Hunter: mediocre duels, great wPvP, good in bgs
---
Warlock: Top of the foodchain duels, good wPvP,  mediocre in bgs
---
Mage : good duels, good wPvP, good bgs
---
Seems to me like mage should be at the top spot.
---
I thought they changed domains to fandom or something silly
---
Enjoy playing D3 my friend. Hope you fun.
---
Thanks!
---
Oh wow... I didn't expect that... 
---
I'm all for no changes but I'm not going to criticize or bash on people that do want changes. I think it should be just how it was back then. Believe it or not, I've been playing since the end of vanilla all the way through WoD, and I've never used any add-ons and have always been a keyboard turner. #nochanges
---
&gt;Its like asking people about their pets personalities, they just describe their own personalities.
---
Off topic, but has anyone else experienced this? I can't relate in the slightest, but find it very interesting
---
That's a good idea!
---
They don't appreciate your harsh words, but you ain't wrong
---
Is this one of those "Evidence for number 1 is I said so" instances?
---
How is Orc Rogue #1 and Orc Warrior #9?
---
The absolute best pvp setup race/class combo is Orc Warrior.
---
Stun resist is absolutely fucking broken in classic. Axe spec gives them a bonus + axe spec is the best spec for 2h warrior so it's extra extra good. And solo without a healer they have bonus attack power racial.
---
People still go to that ad-ridden horrible site? The correct site is https://wow.gamepedia.com/Wowpedia
---
Oh nice! I leveled a priest back in TBC, but thought maybe I'd give it a go in Classic. Been loving it so far on a pserver. I'm only level 15, so I'm sure your guide will help a lot. Thanks mate
---
Agreed. And it's not even on a long CD, at 1m its ready for the next mage after you global the first one.
---
More '*meta humor*' ?
---
I assume mage is up high because of the class, not race. 
---
So when I take mage as a granted I now have to take a look at all the races:
---
 Troll, undead, human, gnome.
---
human: mages have rank 1 blizzard and blink/block. And rogues have a tendency to engage without you expecting it, anyway. So perception is not as strong. 
---
Gnome: more int and escape artist. Definitly a strong combo. But in most cases you have more/ stronger snares than your opponents.
---
Troll is ok, but not a gane changer
---
undead : wotf might turn the tides in your favor.   Oh and horde mages have the questionable bonus of not having to fight shamans and therefore be allowed to play their class freely.
---
Sure you can. Go try to get Baron's horse, and BOTH ZG mounts. I'll check back in a few years. 
---
It looks like you're headed to Environmental Science 221
---
I remember getting a Banshee Finger in UD strat. Amazing times.
---
Pets definitely reflect their owners, especially dogs.
---
Fish, not so much.
---
I mean, that's not all of us though.
---
There will still probably be a point where if you are getting to 60 super late, there will be MC and ZG PuGs that let you skip alot of the dungeon gear. But that point will come much later in the server's lifetime. 
---
Honestly, classic is all about that FRESH. When it releases, get in there and start playing. Don't hit 60 on your first toon over a year after the content comes out. 
---
All Blizzard games.
---
I keep buying them and I'm not sure why...
---
same here. 2 wow token's stocked up on [battle.net](https://battle.net) balance
---
They think classic is just as disposable as they expac that they know. They dont understand classic and never played it. Aka, haters.
---
I like both.
---
Hi, /u/snoxthefox
---
Reported for enjoying things.
---
I dont quite understand the obsession with player housing in MMOs. I used to think it would be really cool but it seems impossible to implement in an immersive way. 
---
Anytime. Have fun =]. I've always enjoyed managing the five second rule so priest is one of my favorite classes to level.
---
Why would loot trading be a thing in vanilla? There was no loot trading, for BoPs.
---
Also raids, except UBRS, usually have loot master. Doubt anyone will be doing 40-man pug MC.
---
We haven't even seen the guild breaker that is AQ yet, never mind Naxx. These are not easy raids. They take tons of preparation and will not be steamrolled by players in green gear. 
---
I think the only exception to this has been the challenge mode/mage tower gear they've added in MoP/WoD/Legion. I came back to retail at the end of WoD just to see the story content mostly, but seeing the challenge mode weapons made me want to get good enough to earn them, to the point that I did it on a few classes. 
---
The mage tower really doubled down on this, because once people got a mage tower skin they were always rocking it in town/pugs. It motivated me to play classes and specs I otherwise would not have and learn how to play them well enough to finish a solo challenge. I was fucking horrible at feral druid, but you bet your ass I learned how to play it for the glow cat.
---
Going SL at that level is a bad idea. You can't have Ruin, Shadowburn, or Nightfall with SL at 49. You effectively turn yourself into a tank with no damage. Sure, you survive the initial stunlock, then he just kills you before you can kill him. It would take at least two rounds of fully ticking dots to kill the rogue, plus a little extra.
---
A better spec for being at the top of the bracket would be full destro or a hybrid spec picking up all the 11 point talents. I've never twinked a warlock so I can't say how the scaling is at that level bracket. My experience in world pvp around that level is that without deathcoil you're in trouble. If you stick with your Suc and can seduce right after he opens you should have a good chance. 
---
Because they're scared Classic might overtake retail in the number of subs and it definitely will during the last first months, especially with the state of BfA these days.
---
Those people hating on Classic are the same people who won't admit the fact retail is probably at all time low in the number of subs now, trust me I'm still subbed and it feels like Legion during content drought. They won't admit how bad BfA is, they won't admit Blizzard fucked up with this expansion.
---
But those people know deep inside Classic will be a huge thing and also the fact Classic vs Retail might end up like OSRS vs RS3. We all know what happened, or what's happening. OSRS is hitting actually insane numbers these days, meanwhile no one plays RS3.
---
But that's not really the same as people conflating their personality with that of their pets, as I think the commenter above me was referring to. 
---
Also, interesting thing to note is that Classic is actually planning to release ZG and BWL together, which many people including myself think is god awful. It makes BWL too easy on release. This is why you see people pushing back against Blizzard on their proposed phased release cycle. Because of what we are talking about here.
---
Are you excited for non-castrated dungeons?
---
The guilds that did steamroll the content early also were HARDCORE AF pvpers. They all grind for 16-20 hours per day to get rank 14 gear and then proceeded to wreck the raids. They farmed ungoro in the mafia for months til they all had 50k gold in their bags. That is just not attainable at all for the average player and shouldn't be seen as an example of how classic will be.
---
Sir yes sir!
---
Absolutely agree, but there will be some amount of people that come back, get their nostalgia, then realize the time investment and quit. Not all players. Not you or me. But some.
---
True. Also, if it had a bank, class trainer or auctioneer... it would have a huge impact on the game.
---
That explains why I used to feel like I was missing stuff when I leveled up a few times in here post-cataclysm. Can't wait to have dungeons we have to explore again! I loved that feeling of going down the "wrong" path in Deadmines to check for that rare mob who dropped a pretty good shield. 
---
Simply not true, even on private servers with the most hardcore players around, only about 10 guilds cleared BWL on release. That is 400 people on a 10k pop server.   
---
ZG makes a big difference imo. Maybe not for BWL initial clear times, but for gearing up players in general. ZG just hands gear that is better than prebis to any 60 that joins a PuG.  It makes the early end game too easy and basically lets you avoid a ton of dungeon runs.
---
Talking about LFD and LFR. When you castrate all but the highest tier of content, you're making the game shit. 
---
Vanilla/tbc and even wotlk to some extent had a solid early, mid and lategame because the game wasn't 100% about GET TO ENDGAME SO YOU CAN DO RAIDS NOW!!!!! It's the journey fam, seeing your character progress (1 talent point every 15 levels now lol) was integral. 
---
Now leveling is a tedious joke designed to shuttle you into the casino as fast as possible. You can get your mom's credit card and buy a boost. A big incentive to raid back in the day was to see the content, now any pepega can queue LFR. If you played before wrath you'd know what I mean
---
Embrace perfection.
---
3-6 months? Man I’m dying to play classic as much as the next guy, but 6 months is a long time. I’ll see where I’m at after 3-4 months, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable to stop after that. And I’m definitely not playing classic for the nostalgia—but because it’s a good game. But once again, 6 months is a long time—don’t trash on people who stop playing after a few months. 
---
Tbh I think honor should be out from day 1 with BGs.
---
Just because some stuff wasnt out at vanilla release doesnt mean it shouldnt be out from classic release.
---
I don't agree. So I guess it can't happen.
---
I guarantee you their business model for Classic is getting some Classic players to try retail. I'm happy to pay for both with one sub, because it potentially forestalls other, less desirable methods of monetizing Classic WoW.
---
I did play before wrath moron, I was there for Vanilla. And to act like LFR means anything when it’s not even endgame content and mechanics and cutscenes are cut out shows you know nothing. A lot of the time you have to do Mythic for the final cinematic of the raid. And no leveling isn’t supposed to shuttle you they want it to take time on live.
---
Again
---
LFR AND HEROIC DUNGEONS ARE NOT ENDGAME
---
MYTHIC PLUS AND HEROIC AND MYTHIC RAIDS ARE. 
---
It's a good example of what Blizz have done to the game with retail. Over simplified and made dull.
---
Does anyone know where to find a list of Rares in classic that drop unique BOE blues? Or at least have a chance to drop a Unique BOE green? 
---
*twink
---
Having gnomish death ray trinket before carrot on a stick = god
---
Lol
---
Darn, this is disappointing.
---
My whole fantasy was to roll Orc Warlock, have some fun with the initial wave on a PvP server not particularly rushing to 60, then at about 45 I figured I would be a 1vX machine, wasn't worried about the hit to leveling efficiency.
---
If you really don't think the damage would be good enough to world PvP I won't sweat it, can always try another low level spec.
---
One third cut out? crazy.
---
&gt; For shadow anything but **Troll** is less than optimal.
---
FTFY.
---
Played on recent private server.  They delayed the release of DM until after guilds had downed Rag.  Was nice, since it gave players time to try it before the bloated gear was released.  They also released BWL well prior to ZG, again was very nice to allow players to get BWL cleared before ZG gear was released.  
---
This is the timeline I played during actual Vanilla, and would really love to play it that way again.  The whole point of WoW classic is to bring an accurate reproduction of the game as it was (according to the devs anyways), so why not release the content the way it was initially?
---
**&lt;Working Adults&gt;  US (PST) - PvP \[Horde\]**
---
We are all working adults now with a much greater time commitment to real-life and less free time to play than we did 10-15 years ago. But, we still want to progress and do the best we're able with the time we have. 
---
We plan on being a semi-serious raiding guild with a very  structured weekly raiding schedule to allow us older players a chance to  progress without  burning out. Raids will be capped to twice a week and  3 to 4 hours per raid night, starting between 6pm-7pm PST.
---
We are mostly PvE focused; PvP will be supported but not required. Discord link below.

I’ve been jumping onto an empty ps doing a quest here and there on my shaman, just barely enough to tide me over and wrap my head around my battle plan for release. 
---
Mostly it’s this sub tho
---
you left out how nice having arcane resistance is versus mages as well for resisting polymorph
---
I didn't question anyone's humanity - I pointed out that the people left playing retail are the ones who tend to approve of all the negative changes made to the game over the years, usually because they were part of the vocal minority who were being catered to. 
---
&gt; It's like going to a tennis court and asking people ~~what their favourite sport is~~ where the paddle ball courts.
---
They hate this. 
---
Blizzard said they will add Loot Trading i  Classic so you can trade soulbound loot for 2h.
---
Pugging MC/Ony/ZG is easy and you can trade loot for 2h even with Master Looter.
---
Can't upvote that enough.
---
&gt; I didn't question anyone's humanity
---
You called them scum, not directly... but that white crusty stuff is called scum. They're people who like a videogame, not an organized party specifically to shut down dissenting opinions. Given the way you talk, what's more likely than you being "systematically oppressed" for your videogame opinions is that you're projecting.
---
There's a lot more than 10k on that server. More like 50k active players total, with 7-11k online at any given time. 
---
Even better IMO, just make it a toggle option in the loot settings. Party leader can switch to tradeable loot or not, and it's visible to all party members. If you don't have loot trading on, you get zero GM support for mismanaged items. If you have loot trading on, no complaining about roll manipulation. Let the players decide whether they want trading or not, and blizz can stop complaining about all the GM support they spend on item drops.
---
As someone who used it in Vanilla (but not in private servers), don't worry it works very well. The most important is where else you put your talent points. And I don't think reckoning into full ret for the rest of points is a good choice by memory.
---
I take comfort in being a man here. Our fertility is so forgiving in general. An acquaintance of mine hit menopause at 29, and I'm sure it can happen even earlier for some. Not to talk about things like endometriosis, PCOS etc affecting fertility for many. It's rough.

So you're a masochist? The unimproved ones I've had the ill-fortune of riding in we're damn near is painful in the kidneys is riding a horse for a long distance.

The only way to implement it reasonably was Garrison's. We all saw how that turned out. The alternative, non-instanced housing, would be giant and stupid to navigate.

This game is for dragon killing homeless people.

---
This thread is such...whinery
---
Since we’re psychoanalyzing each other I am going to guess that you were triggered by my post because you’re a retail player who fits the demographic described in my comment.
---
The reason for Orc Warrior at #9 is because Warrior is the worst class when playing without teammates. Its weakest in duels, its weak in WPvP on their own, they are only really good in BGs that have good healers or premades, which makes Warrior end up at the bottom since so many conditions have to be right. Axe spez also does nothing in PvP(I think it adds like 0.02% crit or something lol)
---
Maybe, Rogue and Mage really close, but I think Rogue has a higher skill cap and they can also escape from any situation so thats why I put them over Mage.
---
To be fair, the part they removed is straight up confusing 
---
Yes, I am ! For the Horde ⚔️
---
Orc is better, Gnome is just best for Alliance.
---
[http://www.youtube.com/c/Icosiol](http://www.youtube.com/c/Icosiol)
---
for priests, it depends on the spec and usage.
---
- pve healer - dwarf or troll, fear ward is great, berserking is the best *oh shit* button.
---
- pvp healer - undead &gt; troll. berserking is nice and all, but not getting fucked by fears is a huge advantage, and you won't have points in shadow.
---
- pve shadow - doesn't really matter
---
- pvp shadow/tri-spec - troll by a huge fucking margin. berserking matters very little, but hex of weakness can absolutely mess healers and fast hitting classes up, while shadowguard beats the living shit out of both devouring plague and WotF. why? because that fucker procs blackout *on everything*.  I can't count how many times that ability has saved my ass, and there are few funnier things that stunlocking rogues going *splat* or a mage getting stunned on their own frostbolts.
---
trolls are the most underestimated race when it comes to priests and their racial spells own just about anybody if you're specced shadow. compare and contrast to undead, who get a gutted hex of weakness and a DoT with ridiculous mana cost, dispellable by about half of the alliance. WotF and cannibalize are nice, but it still can't compensate for that much added fuckery.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
I would go mana when fresh 60. Once you gear up abit in mc and you notice you dont go oom every big fight I would respec into +healing. I would also took 2 points from +crit and put in healing focus, really strong and cheap talent. Holy nova is good only in pvp to break steath, so that depends where you play. I also found out that -threat is useless. You never pull in raid, and its to small to matter in dugeons where you will pull lose mobs regardless. Improved renew is debatble. Its ok, but nothing major. Min/maxing guilds will have 1 priest with it, rest will use those points sonewhere else.
---
Yeah man. Everyone who disagrees with you is one of *those kinds of people*.
---
You must have never worn socks and sandals bruh. Comfy AF
---
Died flying from winterspring to silithus xD
---
I'm all for the open discussion of this. Realistically, I think just like Classic gained a following of 1 implementation and very straightforward, so to would any push for new content: one thing. Hyjal seems the most apt, as it is an entire zone ready and waiting. 
---
When the hardcore players has farmed naxx dry theyll just start over on a newly released server like they have done for the last 8 years on private servers
---
One time I was at lunch with my 3yo nephew, and he didn't want water, just chocolate milk. We got him chocolate milk but water was still on the table in front of him. He threw a giant fit because the water was still there, even though he had his chocolate milk.
---
I hope you see where I'm getting at here.
---
orc makes you stronger against classes you're already strong against, gnome compensates for weaknesses. however... don't forget taurens and their hidden racial - increased melee range, both for giving and receiving. when it comes to warriors, that extra 2-3 yards matter a hell lot more than some stun resistance.
---
Yeah, wowwiki is terrible. Wikia (or "Fandom" as it's called now) is a godawful business.
---
I maintanked MC, AQ20 and ZG and Off-tanked BWL with a 31/0/20 spec. I think it looked something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LAGe0hbo0uZVfz0gM). You **need** defiance. Shield Slam is surprisingly optional. That said, if I wanted to be more towards the leading edge of raiding (as opposed to starting it a year in or so), then I'd probably take this spec up through UBRS and then swap to full prot when I got to raiding. If I was main tanking at least. This was an okay main-tank spec and a spectacular offtank spec as I could still do decent damage on fights that required only 1 tank.
---
no it's not. holy/reckoning was always the best strategy for pvp as holy paladins. you just heal and support ur team, after u got crit 5 times you switch to a 2h weapon (preferably one with on procc damage) and deal big damage. it should be around 5 x 200 from autoattacks, 5 x 200 from seal of righteous + procc items (weapon, trinkets)  and then finish off with judgement and hammer of wrath.
---
holy paladin burst was insane in pvp
---
Ye Troll is really good, but I still think Dwarf is better with the Triforce of Stoneform, Fear Ward, Desperate Prayer.
---
FF14 did a damned good job of it, I think.
---
*PVE SERVERS WITH THIS*
---
Can buy housing but only a limited amount, people can sell their current houses, u can set up shops and earn/lose money (simple stuff like repair etc, bad weapons for the normal super high price, grays ofc, food etc)
---
Now this isn't even something i would want, just a little fun thing i thought about :p
---
The lesson of WoW - all 15 years of it - is that the loudest and most assertive minority voice gets catered to. 
---
I am not making the same mistake twice of attempting to be reasonable, or placating them, or sitting on the sidelines mumbling about how it’s all subjective and everyone has a right to their opinion.
---
These people played a part in turning the game into the embarrassing mess it is now. When others began requested a vanilla option - GD foamed at the mouth and heaped endless abuse on those asking. When the first big drop off occurs in Classic, when the tourists have had enough, these same people will be gleefully posting and writing clickbait articles about how the experiment has failed and it’s time to shut down Classic. They cannot come to turn with the fact that retail is in managed decline and that the BFA model is a failure.

Problem is more that the community gets split (people that want it and dont want it) they do have a few soultuions for this, but no matter it will split community (They could allow 1 server transfer, for it make new servers for it, or dublicate your chars for it)
---
I think there's 2 parts of your question, I apologize if I'm not understanding:
---
1) What's the difference in PvP vs. PvE in a general sense
---
2) What options are there for having characters on both factions, how does that work, and how is it affected by PvE/PvP servers
---
For #1, PvP is the "less popular" option as a whole, but on this subreddit and on private servers seems to be the preferred type of server. World PvP is a huge part of the game, that a lot of people think you are missing out on if you go PvE. It's a lot of fun to have that tension each time you see someone from the other faction; sometimes they might see you struggling with a mob and help, throw you a /greet, or sometimes they might stab you in the back. Corpse walking and campers suck, but they're usually pretty uncommon and aren't game-ruining.
---
For #2, you cannot have a character on both factions on the same PvP server, but you can on a PvE server. This is to help keep people from spying with /who or trying to manipulate people into PvP and other griefing/exploitative mechanics. Also, you cannot trade, talk, send items to, etc. someone on the other faction, on either server, so you and your S.O. will need to play on the same faction if you want to group together.
---
I wonder if there'd be a way to implement limited housing, where a single player could literally own a property in-game. Perhaps they'd be charged gold every day for owning the house, and the gold would get progressively more expensive every day he owns the home. Ex. Day 1 rent costs 100 gold. Day 2 costs 300 gold. Day 3 costs 1000 gold. The property expires ownership when the user can't pay it.
---
I just can't figure out how you'd stop people from abusing it / holding every property. Multiple accounts, collusion between guilds, etc. Or maybe you tie it to PvP Ranks? Only Grand Marshals can own a house, and once they lose Grand Marshal status (meaning someone else gets it) then that person may own that house.
---
I really hate instanced housing because it feels like it doesn't matter and it really breaks your immersion. Wish it could work some other way.
---
Because they don't think it be like it is, but it do! 
---
Absolutely. Sunken Temple, especially!
---
First of all, you can't transfer resources from alliance to horde, only via neutral AH which other people can steal (unlikely if u are fast)
---
However i personally find PVP more fun, way more "fun small battles" that makes the game feel more alive. Also you need to be more careful when u walk around etc.
---
However if you are not much into PVP it can be a bit sad to die to a 60 that just kills u for fun and u have to run all the way back, for that reason PVP servers are better in the start since most PVP is only with people even to your level (since they once that rush 60 will be busy with other stuff since they are more hardcore, while the once that go around killing low lvl are usally less hardcore)
---
Overall PVP is fun if you like PVP interactions, which most people like, world pvp really adds another element into the game, however if you have "low patitence/gets mad eaisly when other people fuck you up etc" then go for PVE server.
---
Its gonna be hard to get the gravestone scepter at level 18 unless you know someone higher level to run you or your group through.
---
Yes you can get it at 18 and I'd advise to do so, but know you'll need help getting it. No one will take a level 18 into a regular bfd run
---
Off topic from the thread, but do we think that raids are going to be more highly tuned since they are much more simplistic? Like higher dps requirements, more damage taken by raid, etc.? 
---
Lack of self control?
---
Orc is better dude, not even close. Stun resistance is broken. Remember it works vs engineering items and tidal charm trinket aswell. If you are gnome you also have to play vs other orcs and undeads, which makes your warrior fear much less viable and your charge/intercept/grenades will often fail because of hardiness.
---
If your class can be Orc, then that is the best race for that class. Its something everyone just have to realise.
---
DP is really vulnerable to be dispelled. So in groups it'll be gone and solo... if it's a PvPer he is likely to have a jungle remedy or equivalent to answer. Your trump card and maybe one of ur cds (inner focus) are gone.
---
On the other side... troll's shadowguard procs blackout on *any* damage move, making it a more RELIABLE asset. Only way to avoid it is by another priest reacting to it (offensive dispell) since shamans are horde-only. 
---
And the same can be said about touch and hex of weakness. Touch (UD one) is proc'd exclusively on melee (and applies some damage, which may proc blackout). Troll's hex is a straight debuff and works against anyone, especially useful if they have a healer or means to get healed (-20% heal debuff). Troll is ahead again. 
---
I am not surprised - I’ve been on this subreddit since around the time Classic was announced and I’ve been noticing a big uptick in newcomers lately. I think there are some retail players here who are gauging their interest in Classic and looking for an escape pod from BFA. There was a time when I still felt very defensive about the retail game as well.
---
Although as a whole I absolutley dont want loot trading in the game. BUT, if loot selling does increase you will have a chance to buy items off people for gold. Every item is worth gold now whether it is bop or boe.
---
One of the problems I had with Wrath was how easy they made the dungeons and early raids, it's as if they were afraid to challenge us. For all it's faults early Cata tried to rectify that and the dungeons in particular went back to being difficult enough to ask some questions about whether you knew how to play your class/role properly. I remember clearly having to manage my mana studiously as a resto shaman in 4.0/4.1. 
---
But everyone was so used to the 'face roll' of Wrath that instead of meeting the challenge many just complained about it until Blizzard nerfed things. Then 4.3 dropped... that patch single handedly made me quit the game and ever since then WoW has never held my interest for longer than a month. 
---
I'm ready to come home too, just 5-8 months left now.
---
In classic there will be days you loose and not win or reach you traget. its a game for pro gamers. 
---
people talking over naxx and aq40. the most people will never see this because lack of raid and skill
---
but this is no problem because there are so much other things you can do.
---
the retail wow pvp is crap. classic shows you how hard is it to survive. when you get camped you loose.
---
the bgs was a dream, endless alterac bg. where people grinding and fishing while others try to cap the flags. crazy
---
same if you make some inis and some other loot your item. this means one run more.
---
back 2005/2006 i was tier 2 hunter bwl farm status, in the top 10 dd and never bored.
---
people will come other go. but the most will say its a game with targets hard but so much fun to play. and 60 is 60 it will never been obsolete like now with every extension. 
---
Since the end of Wrath, if you look at the numbers.
---
Yes.
---
IMO have legacy wow, which is just 1.12 forever, and then after a few years open up "classic wow" as 1.13+ with new raids, dungeons, zones; hell possibly even races. Try to expand on the game via patches instead of xpacs, gradually moving more content in without changing the core gameplay. No flying mounts, no new continents, no teleport cities, no LFG/LFR, no PvP stats like resilience and versatility, keep 60 as a cap, no catch-up mechanics/welfare epics, etc.
---
I highly doubt it'll ever happen, but a man can dream, right...
---
Leaving out a lot of stuff.
---
Warriors fear mages on blink off intercept to prevent them from getting range, also on frost nova if the mage is close enough.
---
You left out charm entirely.
---
Mindcontrol - if you're pvping around BRM a lot, you're definitely going to get mind controlled.
---
While we're on that topic, gnomish MC cap.
---
Also succubus charm.
---
1) the market for traditional mmorpgs is pretty rapidly drying out. Modern mmos take on different forms &amp; innovate because they have to - people aren't buying this stuff anymore like they do forrnite, dota, etc. Consumer interest has changed. 
---
2) all the content bring released with this game has been done to death for over 10 years.
---
3) this has been the behaviour for every expansion &amp; the base game released to date. Big peak at release, followed by drastic drop off.
---
100% agree, i made another comment like you at some time. The other 2 options would just devide community to much, making a "vanilla servers that will later turn into vanilla +" sometime after nax is the way to go. If they decide they wanna do it. But it's also possible they will just make BC servers, we never know
---
It sounds great on paper, but in reality you'll have multiple ganksquads camping every major FP and roaming any zone where they can farm honor.
---
Leveling or doing anything solo out in the world will be absolute nightmare. And people will quit in droves because of that. 
---
That's what happened on of the pservers that released honor before BGs.
---
Wpvp was actually great before the honor patch, because only people that actually enjoyed it would engage in it, rather than a bunch of tryhards forming gank squads just so they could farm honor as efficiently as possible.
---
one solution would be to shift the meta by making new content rewarding different itemization. for example if they implement karazahn into classic and make it so there will be sets for the off speccs of the classes (elemental, enhancement, feral, moonkin, shadow, fury, arms, retri, etc) with actual good set bonusses but it stays the same item level as naxx gear so naxx doesnt get outclassed. 
---
for meta classes there would be new offset items in those raids as they already have their bis sets from naxx. for example tank offsets for better tps, some items with cool onuse/procc effects and maybe even a legendary designed for off speccs.
---
also id really think instead of adding completely new content they should implement stuff from retail that worked well in the past. challenge modes, m+, hardmodes on bosses. 
---
I have no problem with the old models, but I love the newer models. I play with them on a tbc private server and it doesnt ruin my experience aside from a sheath bug.
---
Don't be surprised if it's an option to turn them on if Classic is running on the Legion client. 
---
Im gonna get downvoted for this, but the gameplay matters more to me than graphics. Just saying, Im not going to sperg out and quit if a toggle is available.
---
This depends greatly on the environment. For instance, a hunter in an open area and being able to keep properly the distance can 1v1 anyone untouched. A geared warrior in a tight spot (let's say... inside a small building) is brutal for the poor fool who dares to enter. But on the other hand take a hunter in an enclosed area and he'll suck hard. The same for a warrior out in the open unless he has backup.  
---
I will take my 1h/shield hybrid troll shaman any day in pvp  
---
1v1 artist cannot wait to reroll this in classic
---
God. Dammit.
---
Just one error imo.  90% of the high pop servers in vanilla were PvP type.  If I remember correctly there were only a couple high populated PvE servers.  Then again there was more emphasis on World PVP like BRM/EPL and the Horde vs Alliance theme that might've changed that trend over time
---
Really good PvP spec is pushing it a bit. It can be fun for dueling rogues. It's a poor spec for any organised group pvp.
---
I don't know. I've played games with player housing and I quite like it.
---
I miss the rest of sunken temple :( that was one of my fav classic dungeons. 
---
Why is that? Im using a wikia site for a mobile game im playing and its pretty much the most informative site about the game.
---
It would split the community and be frustrating for any new players to have to navigate between N near-identical realms. The population is likely to be relatively small, so adding barriers to the user experience before even setting foot in the game is probably not the greatest idea to boost subs.
---
Secret spoiler a lot of people gonna be sad over, and don't tell the normies I told you this. Rogues actually kinda suck in pvp after the first few patches and, people start to get gear.
---
The only pvp they dominate is world pvp. For obvious reasons. Other then that. Unless you have every freaking cool down up and, nothing goes even a little wrong. A geared character of almost any other class will eat you.
---
Honestly other then Cheesing. Who actually has a bad match up on to rogues? Shaman, Warrior, Druid, Mage, Warlocks, and Shadow Priests all have easy match ups to a rogue. I am less sure on these but, I'm pretty sure even Pally and, Hunter should easily kill you if they are good. 
---
Most of the fear of rogues comes from pvp videos and, leveling. People used to suck in 2005. So if someone popped on you 99% of the player base would turn into a deer in the headlights. It is also easy to play a rogue to skill cap as compared to other classes. That added to it as well. Point being after the first few months. You are gonna have a lot of sad kids rolling off rogues to the far better pvp classes.
---
Yes, high-pop servers, but there were far more PvE servers in general, and far more PvE players in total. PvE players are also more likely to prefer lower-pop servers, because it makes farming and getting world bosses easier, vs. PvP players want high pop because it means more PvP and more battlegrounds (before they added cross-server BGs).
---
Dwarf is way better than gnome vs rogues/spriests/warriors. Gnomes better vs hunter/mage. In organised group PvP I think it's fair to say dwarf is stronger. No question Orc is by far the strongest race overall for warrior pvp.
---
If you wanna give up the most broken racial in WoW PvP history, that is allowed.
---
lol @ OP saying that SoR/JoR only triggered procs in TBC during patch 2.0 to 2.1...
---
Seal of Righteousness - Now does holy damage on every swing. ***It can now proc correctly as well.*** The Judgement effect has been renamed "Judgement of Righteousness" to differentiate it from the Seal damage in the combat log.
---
Judgement of Righteousness - The damage of this judgement was increased significantly. ***This judgement can now trigger procs.*** The bonus from spell damage items has been increased slightly.
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.9.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0)
---
Confusion to some extent is good because it stimulates thinking and creates immersion 
---
yeah, that or side progression (gear equal to naxx) to ensure the game doesn't have too much power creep
---
Rogue vs rogue being able to immune bleeds and blind is 100% better than 25% increased stun resist. You really shouldn't ever lose a rogue duel as dwarf.
---
Even more bad news. If the rogue is leveling and, specced for cold blood. Your class/spec is irrelevant. You will die 100% of the time. Unless the rogue is an incompetent buffoon.  No class can survive a random guaranteed hit for 1.5k-2k at that level.
---
Your best bet leveling a lock is to be AFF. At least then you can try to be a porcupine. By this I mean refresh your dots as you die. Bring the SOB down with you lol.
---
&gt; Uldsomething 
---
Uldum. 
---
Also the sw portal between old town and trade district (although it is said it was presumed for the housing area and/or stockades) can be considered since it's still a scrapped idea.
---
&gt; lol @ OP saying that SoR/JoR only triggered procs in TBC during patch 2.0 to 2.1...
---
I never said that.
---
Before 1.9 SoR proced randomly on weapon damage. It proced an added Holy damage component, but it was random. After 1.9 they made the holy damage proc on every single swing.
---
The problem is that, unlike other +Spell school dmg on swing abilities, it behaved mechanically as **a second white damage weapon swing.**
---
This wasn't caught and patched until 2.1. SoC also has the same issue, but because it's random it was never an issue.
---
Does that make sense now?
---
You’re probably right, but if the option to choose between new and old models is there, I’m gonna choose old. I think most people want classic to be an exact replica of vanilla, which means no changes, nostalgia is strong.
---
"They want it to take time on live" 
---
Offering paid boosts to max, heirlooms, LFD with bonus experience, streamlined zones with the cata revamp = they want it to take time? When BFA came our I leveled a character out of curiosity and then unsubbed immediately because 1. It was piss easy 2. I was sick of seeing people who weren't even in my server at ironforge 3. World was dead 4. Felt like diablo
---
I'm not talking about cutscenes, I'm talking about being in the raid and seeing the encounters and bosses for yourself. A lot of the incentive to raid back in the day was fueled by your desire to actually zone into Black Temple and say "damn, look how far I've gotten"
---
Walking around a city as a new 60 and seeing a big dick raider (who was from your server and in a prolific guild) with T2.5 was meaningful and made you want to get a big dick yourself. Now that the game is a dress up simulator that relies on old content for completionists to stay alive, that's gone. The elements of the game which echoed the simulation of a real human social arena have been deprecated 
---
As for TRUE ENDGAME MYTHIC blah blah, the content is made to be mechanically difficult and challenge your attention and reaction time vs. intensive preparation, methodical gameplay and coordination we had in vanilla. That doesn't make it worse, it just makes it less of an RPG and more of an action game with numbers like Diablo. It's like Counter Strike vs. tabletop DND, which is why Method has expressed no interest in vanilla. 
---
That is probably true, but everyone isnt a rogue. Do you want to have an edge in Rogue vs Rogue or a huge edge vs every other class in the game?
---
Then that's settled then. Stop being so easily affected by simple words. In the end you are onky hurting yourself. 
---
Before = dope
---
After = wack
---
If your WC runs are shorter than your MC runs, you’re doing it wrong.
---
What do you like to do? Playing the game or fighting against other people?
---
If the later, go PVP. Although because you'll be new, it'll take a *lot* of time to get good enough and gear up to have a semblance of a fighting chance. (Even with your husband helping you, there are a lot of people who have been playing this game for years and have the "killing you and corpse camping you so you can't do anything" down to a science.)
---
If the former, go PVE. It's actually called "Normal". :)
---
People can "flag" for PVP on Normal servers too, actually. You just can't turn it off on PVP servers.
---
the retail pvp is dead. real pvp back in classic was hard to survive. but so much fun. you can do everything but your enemy too haha.
---
if you want have some great experience and fun choose pvp server. trust me. old school player here ;)
---
From 4.1 Patch Notes:
---
“Wailing Caverns
---
The maze section has been removed to make the overall dungeon more accessible and quicker to complete. Nearby creatures and bosses have been adjusted to compensate.”
---
I want to slap whoever allowed that to happen.
---
sorry, can you post this again in English?
---
I've done WC like 10 times on private servers. I still have no clue where to go when you reach that turn on the right. 
---
SL warlocks are great in world PvP even at low levels. Soul link makes a warlock takes 42% more damage to kill which is incredible. There is no way a rogue is going to kill a competent leveling SL warlock 1v1. The warlock takes 10% less physical damage with his voidwalker out which pairs well with soul link for massive damage reduction. If the rogue manages to get the warlock low he can just sacrifice his voidwalker for a massive damage absorbing shield and then immediately fel domination summon a new voidwalker allowing him to sacrifice again if necessary. There is no way on earth the rogue is chewing through all that effective health before they get eaten alive by DoTs and run out of ways to prevent being feared.
---
healing raid and flag carrier in bg. in pvp other classes stronger
---
MC has many additional nerfs in Classic on top of 1.12 (itemization, 16 debuffs, DM gear). You won't see anything approaching a real Vanilla raid on Classic until AQ and it's still nerfed due to no spellbatching and 1.12 talents (mainly warrior threat).They just aren't HUGE changes like the nerfs to tier 1 and 2.
---
You would know all this if you weren't a complete fraud. GOOD guilds will be doing Classic tier 1 and 2 with 20 people if Blizzard goes through with all these nerfs and then they will reform in AQ.
---
The fact you think anyone will care about any raid until AQ when people will be pugging something easier than LFR  with certain items on reserve is hilarious. 
---
Blizzard probably wants the raids nerfed to not take away from their "world first" crap with their influencer Method streamers in the first place though, so good luck ever getting a real raid in Classic. Naxx will prob remain close because it's the last raid. Guess what Naxx is? Potions/consumables/gear from money. Watch them introduce a gold token right around there.
---
read my edit for clarification - TLDR the blizz devs didn't give 2 $hits about SoR - they nerfed Seal of BLOOD in 2.1.0
---
QOL at it's finest
---
None of that counters my claim that SoR in Classic wasn't intended to completely replace SotC in all circumstances.
---
you make some valid points with stoneform, however, for shadow priests, troll still has better racial spells, especially since desperate prayer pulls you out of shadowform. for pvp healing, however, dwarfs are a valid choice, though fear ward still needs to be timed correctly to account for dispel/purge spam. edited my comment to reflect these.
---
Correct. All content will basically become GDKP.
---
Hyjal good. 
---
More things bad.
---
Yeah you're right that the world has changed, but the game doesn't have to change.
---
It will never play the same way as it did in 2004, because its not new anymore, and gaming culture as a whole has changed.
---
Trying to adapt the game with modern features to solve 'problems' is exactly what retail does. The whole premise of wanting classic is to recreate the original game. Yeah, it's not 2004, but no amount of changes is going to fix that. 
---
yes it does since blizzard specifically nerfed the $hit out of SoTC much earlier in the game:
---
Seal of the Crusader: Fixed a bug where damage per swing was increasing instead of decreasing when Seal of the Crusader was active.This resulted in a dramatic increase in damage per second (DPS) that was unintended. The tooltip for the spell displays the intent of the spell:
---
"Fills the Paladin with the spirit of a crusader, granting additional attack power. The Paladin also attacks faster, but deals less damage with each attack."
---
The overall increase in DPS from Seal of the Crusader should only result from the increase in attack power and not from the increase in attack speed. We understand this is a significant decrease in the power of this spell, but was a necessary bug fix to ensure both overall game balance and the viability of different Paladin Seals.
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.2.2](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.2.2)
---
SotC was never meant as an actual DPS seal - it was only there to provide the +Holy dmg debuff from its Judgement
---
If there's no alternative, then you make do with what you have, but I always try to use other wiki sites if it all possible.
---
The main problem with wikia is the ads. On desktop, it's whatever, because what are you doing browsing the internet on desktop without an adblocker in 2019, but on mobile, where adblocking is not as easy to do, it's a different story. They have ads that break their mobile layout and make text unreadable. But even worse are the ads that redirect you to shady sites which seem to appear 1000x more often on wikia sites than on any other site I go to with my phone.
---
My second problem with wikia is how they treat the individual wikis. They give them little to no freedom on layouts, forcing them to migrate from a more professional, wikipedia-looking layout to one designed to maximize the number of ads they can display and promote other wikis in their network. When a community decides they want to move to another platform due to these kind of changes, wikia doesn't let them delete the old wiki. That's why wowwiki still exists. All the big editors left to form wowpedia in like 2011 or something so as a result [wowpedia is way more active](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&amp;limit=500) [than wowwiki](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?limit=500), but wikia uses its weight to keep wowwiki at the top of google, which is doing a disservice to the community by making less relevant and more dated results appear before the superior and more active wowpedia. This has happened to dozens of other communities as well.
---
Basically, I just hate that company's business practices.
---
You might be right, priest is not my most knowledgable subject. Priest is probably the class that has 3 races that are super strong in PvP. I still think Dwarf is better but if more people insist on Troll then I will acklowdge that I might be wrong.
---
&gt; SotC was never meant as an actual DPS seal
---
You've got it! You understand what I've been saying all along! SotC is a **utility** seal. It's not meant to give you more DPS, but to allow you to proc more JoL/W's and more weapon enchant effects and trinket abilities on swing.
---
SoR is supposed to be the “fast weapon” DPS Seal. It wasn't supposed to also replace SotC's utility!
---
I'm glad you're starting to agree with me.
---
the real heroes are main tanks from raid groups, everyone will known your name. if you one of it after a half year of preparation 1-60 plus gear, gold farming  and pre quests   you get honored.
---
&gt; The whole premise of wanting classic is to recreate the original game.
---
So you're against progressive itemization, too?
---
&gt;Me: Hey, please don't use words that make you sound like an asshole
---
&gt;You: &lt;incoherent screeching about how triggered everyone else is&gt;

I picked PvE in vanilla simply because it was labeled "Normal" and I knew nothing about MMOs. Probably my biggest regret about vanilla (I didn't have the time to reroll after my first 60).
---
On nostalrius (the private server that made waves), I leveled with a friend on a pvp server, honestly it was a game changing experience. We had so much fun fighting the horde and it really felt like a much more exciting game. On top of that we formed enemies that lasted the something like 2 years we played on the server, which lead to crazy battles you would find when you message your friends that [insert hordes name here] was around.
---
I believe that PvE servers are literally half the gameplay experience. The only reason you should avoid them is if you are one of those people that gets too worked up by pvp.
---
This changes my entire shit thank you.
---
Very good point. so we are looking at 400/50k - less than 1% of players.
---

---
Pvp servers is like playing some crappy hard mode where you randomly die to things outside of your control. There are some fun times with more even battles but its up to you if thats worth it.
---
&gt;SotC
---
/facepalm
---
Pvp servers are extremely fun. That being said if you are a "consent" based player. I would not recommend them. By this I mean if you feel you shouldn't attack someone or bully someone unless they want to play as well. I would push heavily for PVE. 
---
The fun part about a pvp server in classic. Is that it will put hatred in your heart. I am not even kidding. When you can't play for 4 hours because 2 allies think it's funny to gang up on you. When they waste your entire day for no reason. You learn to hate. As odd as it sounds. It immerses you in the world. You are at war and, it feels like it. 
---
I am not a "ganker" as in I won't go find you in your little low level home and, kill you. That being said. I hate the Alliance. If it's red I will kill it dead. Regardless of fairness or regardless of odds. When I played the horde were out numbered 5-1 on most servers. We knew hatred then. It made us strong. It made us brothers. It made us Horde!
---
Classic is Vanilla and Vanilla is Classic.
---
PVE servers in Classic will be 100 percent worthless due to all the nerfs to raids. Leveling  5 mans and world pvp is what will make Classic good. There isn't anything resembling a real Vanilla raid until AQ. Naxx will be the first legit one. 
---
PVE servers will also be completely unbalanced and like 80 percent Alliance due to Alliance being easy mode in raiding with Blessing of Salvation. It's why big streamers who play things like human warrior and who refuse to play on a pvp server are already lobbying for cross realm BG's. They will have NOTHING to do outside raids nerfed 5x over with 1.12 talents, itemization, DM gear at launch, 16 debuffs instead of 8 on early tiers and no spellbatching which allows instant heals that will prevent quite a few wipes. Not to mention that ALL raids were nerfed consistently during patches and you will be fighting nothing in their prenerfed state. 
---
Tier 1 and 2 will be easier than LFR. AQ might resemble normal. Naxx is simply hard due to time commitment. You don't play Classic to raid if you want a challenge. Blizzard has already killed that. Probably afraid it would compete with their "world firsts" and wannabe esports (mythic invitational)  that no one cares about. Their influencers/part time employees (Method) get morons to buy micotransactions due to racials, faction changes (see Limit who just spent 9 grand on them), boosts and rerolls from people copying whatever they stack. 
---
Fake hype, fake viewers won't work in Classic to get MT's from the weak minded who doesn't realize current WoW is less popular than freakin runescape on google trends.
---
Dude i literally just told you im completely fine and more than happy to play classic wow as is. I will probably level 3-4 characters to 60.
---
Im not suggesting any changes be made or advocating for anything of the like. BUT, in my own fantasy land ( WHICH IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN) I would love to see blizzard put out a game made in the spirit of VAN/TBC.   
---
&gt; The overall increase in DPS from Seal of the Crusader should only result from the increase in attack power and not from the increase in attack speed.
---
The increase in attack power is an *okay* concession, but it's clearly not the hallmark design aspect. That would be the faster swing speed. And what sorts of things does a **damage-nerfed** faster swing speed allow you to do? 
---
Proc more things. Certainly not proc more things, but not as much as this clearly better DPS-only Seal, SoR.
---
Technically you get also get away from almost any situation as a frost mage. Nova/sheep -&gt; ooc -&gt; mount up. 
---
The only way it could work is a toggle like master loot. It's 100 percent going to fail and rip the community apart in the first week because people will exploit it for pre raid bis items that a pain to farm. Example? Dal'rends. Good luck playing a rogue with this crap.
---
Im not saying this is a good thing by any means. BUT, if you know how to farm a fuckton of gold while you level to 60, this can actually work in your advantage in some cases. Regardless, i dont want this in the game but it is what it is.
---
Is there a guide to doing all the quests and getting full rep? 
---
after 12 loots you get the trinket. only the best will get it because its arena even you friends will shoot at you haha worth it? oh yes. i will try it. 8 times a day you can try to loot. its ok and pure action and adrenalin.
---
It turns out, he did mean farming.
---
In a 1v1 situation you are more vulnerable against decent hunters/mages than rogues or warriors that you should already beat technically, so I'd say gnome is the best option there. Escap artist loses value in a group setup where your healer will dispell most root or you'll get a BoF from a pal.
---
I see no reason for them not to add option for newer models  
---
after all its only client side, you cant tell who is using what  
---
I thought that old school wizards school MMO with the decks had the absolute best housing system I’ve ever seen. Shit was crazy
---
I'm actually for progressive patching, just as the way it was from 2004-2006.
---
Unfortunately, Blizz have chosen to stick with 1.12 client from the start, so there's not much I can do to change that.
---
They are also going to release content progressively, so matching itemization to the relevant raid era seems the logical thing to me, and the closest to originality that there possibly is.
---
I know that you are going to try and catch me out and say 'that's a change'. And yes you're right, it is. However, Blizzard are committing to 1.12 with progressive content release, which is obviously not accurate to vanilla, so we just have to make it as accurate as we can with what we've got.
---
Adding things like sharding isn't even comparable to this. Old itemization vs newer itemization existed in vanilla, sharding did not, in any shape or form, forgetting about its negative impacts on server community. 
---
Sharding and log-in queues are two sides of the same coin.
---
Housing in Dark Age of Camelot was pretty good - one giant area.  Initially I didn't care but it was kinda neat, especially since each house could be upgraded to support a merchant for AH type buy/sell.
---
Could put dragon heads on the wall (from raids you completed), throw old weapons on the wall, had a vault in the basement.  Was really nice, especially for guilds as a kind of showcase.
---
You're right... for the start anyways.
---
After a while if it becomes more popular, then they can start looking at creating the other realms with additional stuff, assuming they get the funding and manpower.
---
I don't think anyone would mind starting out in plain Vanilla and going through the content there, then transferring to another realm for BC or whatever other options become available.

I was a warlock on vanilla and hit level 60 almost exactly as tbc came out, and every single time I encountered a rogue I felt like it crushed me. Even when I'd get the jump on one, they would make a comeback and either escape or kill me. Fuck rogues. 
---
How so?
---
I guess this is where I get downvoted for the obligatory post pointing out that:
---
1. The most recently implemented version of loot trading **only** allowed trading of Greed-rolled items, **not** Need-rolled. For exactly the reason that other versions were abusable.
---
2. Blizzard has never said that you would be able to trade Need-rolled-items.
---
3. Some people just enjoy panicking and spreading panic, whether or not it is justified.
---
I miss the rape dwarf face seen in this meme and actual black humans. The best you get in the new models is slightly taned from holiday to spain. 
---
Please do. I always alt a hunter and never remember where the good guns/bows are other than stv.
---
I think that each "stage" will be a span of 3 or 4 months. Which is still too quickly imo. I hope they stick to content release scheduel of Vanilla.
---
Full rep for what?
---
Login queues has always been a problem, even in Vanilla.
---
Sharding splitting up servers is a totally new problem that is exclusive to a very very different version of WoW.
---
Why would we choose the non-Vanilla problem over the Vanilla problem?
---
Maybe you prefer instant server access over Authentic community gameplay, but the one that we originally asked for when this all began seems to be the fairer choice here to me.

There was no blizzard made map for old ST
---
some people need a year to get 60 even with help. i think this is not goal to level in one week. the goal is to have fun.
---
if someone killed and camp you half a day this means half a day you make no progress. same when other people stealing your quest mobs this means you must wait.
---
welcome to classic haha.
---
&gt;  **Why do a lot of people on the wowforums think classic wow will die out within 3-6 months and its just nostalgia?** 
---
Because they've only played the shitty later expansions and don't understand that vanilla WoW was a much better game that will actually retain its players rather than just boring them to tears with shit pointless grindy gameplay
---
I mean, your balls hadn't dropped when you played back in 2004. Does that mean you'll let someone come over and kick them so far up inside your body to correctly replicate the ridiculous requirements you seem to have for how to experience an MMO in 2019?
---
I'd say week one but that's semantics.
---
No it really isnt. I dont know if you have noticed, but Blizz is talking about sharding at launch, to reduce server stress from the hordes of people that will start playing again. In vanilla, launch was a shit show, you couldnt attack a boar without 50 other people beating you to it. 
---
In Vanilla it started with patch 1.1, Classic starts with 1.12.
---
Timetable to release stuff in Vanilla was different than it will be in Classic.
---
Vanilla ≠ Classic
---
They will try to imitate it as best they can, but its not the same.
---
It definitely still holds up in group pvp as you're always bound to pick up crits pretty much all of the time from random shit flying your way that will let you do a solid chunk of damage on a fc before going into full support or taking half the health of some mage. There will be plenty of times where you will be facing rogues and warriors solo as well, especially in AB.
---
Losing 4% crit kind of sucks but it's not a massive difference in pvp where fights rarely last long enough for the crit sustainability to really kick in. I wouldn't say it's poor because you don't lose that much from taking it while it gives you a huge power boost. If you're not planing on raiding(It will still work fine you won't just top the charts and might have to bring some extra pots) it's a perfectly viable PvP spec.
---
&gt; Level 18 - Gravestone Scepter (29, 1.61) &lt;-- this wand is better than some level 30 options, BFD Quest
---
The level 30 mind flay (rank 2?) does similar DPS after accounting for the priest's +wand damage talent. A level 18 wand (with 5/5 talents) does the same as a lvl 30 spell, just to put it into perspective how amazing it is.
---
Realistically you probably won't get the wand until 21-24 unless you're being carried at lvl 18, or really persistent at your attempts in BFD.
---
Mages have such an easy time top to bottom my god. While locks and shadow priests have to farm scholo for the wand, once again, mages wake up already rich with the frost av wand. 
---
\-threat is useless for priests imo. You wont ever pull threat in raid, but you will pull the lose mobs in dungeons regardless of it. Also blessed recovery is very underwhelming (it doesnt stack, heals for very little and its sooo slow). You are better of with spell warding imo. 
---
&gt;ridiculous requirements you seem to have for how to experience an MMO in 2019?
---
Wanting the game remade as it was in 2004 is a ridiculous requirement? 
---
You seem to be under the illusion that this is supposed to be new game. This all came about because we asked them to open Vanilla servers, not a modern remaster. 
---
Wanting to chop and change features in Vanilla to suit your PERSONAL needs, desires and opinions seems more like a ridiculous requirement to me. No matter what year it is. 
---
On my laptop I have a GM saying some broken english telling me to have fun in AV. They were really nice.
---
Sorry I haven't seen one I particularly liked. My comments are from being a priest back in Vanilla doing server firsts and I think top ~50 guilds. I would say that this guide is fine, it gets the right results, it just doesn't really explain it particularly well. Dwarf is the completely right choice for Alliance priest, despite the OP thinking desperate prayer can be cast on the tank, as an example. The only real issue is Healing focus vs Imp renew, which is like 2-3 talent points, it's no big deal.
---
Don't look at this guide for HOW to play priest though. It doesn't cover how to heal very well, even though I'm a big fan of Gheal, not like how they've presented it here.
---
Priests also were in my experience the class that changed talents to suit fights more than any other healer, although that might have just been because we had a lot of really invested and good priests. 
---
Overall, a big thing about vanilla is you're not going to hit max level for at least a month, you'll have a lot of time to look into this stuff when you're getting there and a lot more content will be out then.
---
Enjoy paying for low quality garbage and funding our epic adventure?
---
Human Paladin instead of dwarf for perception.  Paladins can cleanse.
---
Undead Priest for PvP for more face melting power.  Devouring Plague is affected by all those shadow talents.
---
One-on-one, I'd put druid a lot higher.  Group I'd put warrior a lot higher.  I'm not sure which scale you're using, but both shouldn't be on the bottom.
---
&gt; So here is my question- are PVP servers more fun than PVE and why?
---
It depends.
---
How much fun is it, for you, to be able to opportunistically kill players on the other faction?
---
How much fun is it, for you, to be opportunistically killed by players on the other faction?
---
If the first is more fun than the second you should definitely be on a PvP server. If it is the other way around, you should be on a PvE server.
---
I played on a PvP server for a time and killing other people brought me no joy. So I will not do that again.
---
Personally, my problem with it is that good, fair fights are very much the minority of battles. Classes are so unbalanced in a rock/paper/scissors fashion and level makes such a huge difference that it's almost a miracle if two people in world PvP have a meaningfully fair fight. That's ignoring the very special community who say "I am ganking people forty levels lower than me, but only because this will make higher level people come out to fight me for totally good fair fights! Honest! I am practically an altruist! I might start a really big PvP battle and that tenuous possibility justifies any amount of bullying levellers!".
---
More modern games like Dark Souls 3 have systems in place to force non-consensual PvPers to limit themselves to roughly the same level and gear as their targets, to reward PvP and to place limits on how often one person can get ganked, and I think this makes non-consensual PvP much closer to a mechanically sound game as opposed to a gankfest, but Classic won't have such systems.
---
Oh I should say, look for guides on levelling priests, as they're actually a fairly complex class in terms of levelling efficiency. Played badly they're almost as bad as warriors for levelling, but played well they can be incredibly efficient levellers. Pro-tip, get the best wand you can whenever you can.
---
This one was very good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CLytIpJniY
---
There's also some online resources for showing where you can get the best wands from quests etc.
---
I don't know about dogs but often people who are religious think of god in the same way described. Their version of god is basically how they would act if they were god.
---
Thank you for your input on the threat reduction. Blessed recovery is particularly to have another buff slot To be debuffed if someone is dispelling me in PvP. 
---
That's why the answer is and allways have to be :  Soon ™ 
---
Oh, I've played WoW. And lots of other online games. 
---
And because of this I know from experience that people like those you are describing are in the minority. It turns out that most people are decent human beings. I know that because I remember the times I met people that actually qualified as egoistic assholes and guess what? They are an absolute minority. It was like this back then and also when I started playing again during Legion. Most people playing WoW are in fact decent human beings. 
---
I agree. They should have just put a rail system in there that you can jump on and it just takes you through the instance from beginning to end. And instead of swords and staves, we have a camera. And we take picture of rare monsters we see on our journey and save them to our collection.  
---
Oh wait, that's Pokemon Snap. Give me "confusing" Classic.  
---
Classic =/= Vanilla
---
Looks like the poop boss from Conker's
---
We stopped raiding with pre-patch. Everyone just PvPed with the new talents and to buy high rank PvP gear with honor points.
---
I've been on private servers and will be on Classic way longer than you, but ok.
---
It is the Verigan's Fist of wands.
---
World record is 4 days and 20 hours played.
---
So no, i’d say two weeks if you’re alightly above avarage and dont do much else.
---
But I still say take a week off the first week and enjoy the hype with everyone else. Even if its only to level 50
---
I started WoW back in 2004 on a PvE server. I eventually moved on to a PvP server. I have never gone back to PvE. To fully experience the game, I believe you must play on a PvP server.
---
Lol holiday to spain..
---
I ran that place so many times it wasn’t at all difficult.  But I was farming deviate scales for the massive 19 twink community to make deviate scale belts.  Those things were the easiest exploit on the AH on Blood Furnace 
---
However acording to all stats etc pvp server will be way more popular now. Not just on this subreddit. It also makes sense though since retail is kinda "PVE" (no world pvp) while then in vanilla you will have a lot of "PVP" (world pvp)
---
But one thing that's going to make this even out with PVP servers / PVE servers is that all streamers will roll PVE, because they don't have any other choice, which will make a lot of PVE servers always in queue/full.
---
Cool.  
---
    
---
Still gonna go with no.
---
&gt;Offering Paid Boosts
---
Yes to deal with people selling boosts. Which existed in vanilla
---
&gt;heirlooms
---
Nerfed
---
&gt;LFD with bonus experience
---
&gt;streamlined zones with the cata revamp
---
&gt;they want it to take time?
---
Yes they purposefull made it take longer to level so you would have to slug through TBC and Wrath or boost.
---
&gt;1. It was piss easy
---
Bullshit, Immediatly before and after BFA mobs were one shotting players from the scaling being broken, and people refused to do dungeons because the time to XP wasnt worth it.
---
&gt;2. I was sick of seeing people who weren't even in my server at ironforge
---
Thats phasing and sharding, has nothing to do with leveling speed and difficulty.
---
&gt;3. World was dead
---
Not for me, WM makes it alive and makes me hide from other factions.
---
&gt;4. Felt like diablo
---
That means nothing, are you saying it felt like an RPG? A loot gathering game? It was Dark?
---
&gt;I'm not talking about cutscenes, I'm talking about being in the raid and seeing the encounters and bosses for yourself. A lot of the incentive to raid back in the day was fueled by your desire to actually zone into Black Temple and say "damn, look how far I've gotten"
---
Mythic is there waiting for you.
---
&gt;Walking around a city as a new 60 and seeing a big dick raider (who was from your server and in a prolific guild) with T2.5 was meaningful and made you want to get a big dick yourself. Now that the game is a dress up simulator that relies on old content for completionists to stay alive, that's gone. The elements of the game which echoed the simulation of a real human social arena have been deprecated 
---
MYTHIC, 2400+ PVP AND MYTHIC PLUS IS WAITING FOR YOU
---
&gt;As for TRUE ENDGAME MYTHIC blah blah, the content is made to be mechanically difficult and challenge your attention and reaction time vs. intensive preparation, methodical gameplay and coordination we had in vanilla.
---
You mean like me having to bring Matts, Pots, Foods, Flasks, know what the bosses do ahead of time, know whos going to orb run, how to orb run, how to solo orb run, what classes solo orb run? Raids have WAAAY more gameplay mechanics than vanilla. This isn't an opinion its fact. Raids have gotten harder because the playerbase got better. Its partly why Naxx was oneshotted in WOTLK. 
---
&gt;That doesn't make it worse, it just makes it less of an RPG and more of an action game with numbers like Diablo.
---
Diablo and WoW are STILL RPGs. Infact with multiple choices, actual conversations between player and character, wow is more of a ROLE PLAYING GAME than ever. Your just using trigger words that don't make sense when looked at.
---
&gt;It's like Counter Strike vs. tabletop DND, which is why Method has expressed no interest in vanilla. 
---
No its not. This makes no sense. Its litteraly Edition wars from DnD.
---
Red Box vs Adnd vs 3.x vs Pathfinder vs 4.0 vs 5e
---
Except Raids progressively got more complex with more mechanics.
---
The Jadefire masters mechanics where your kicked into the air and have to play simon says with your face would never happen in vanilla. SoO would not happen in vanilla, Ghuun would not happen.
---
Comfort isn't worth the eyesore to me. I'd rather not look odd in public and save the ridiculous comfort for home. I guess I'm old school.
---
If they don't cap respeccing, like they do in private servers, I'm probably not going to be able to raid dps as fury - and tank dungeons. 
---
90% of open world PvP is going to be one of the following:
---
1. Ganker is high level, victim has no chance
---
2. Ganker is same level, waits until victim is low on HP/mana from fighting a mob, victim has no chance.
---
3. Ganker has a friend or three, and victim is outnumbered and has no chance.
---
Another 9% of world PvP are high level raids on faction capitals or Tarren mill/xroads style.
---
And the last 1% of open world pvp battles will be equal level players on full/hp mana in a relatively fair fight.
---
We're MC raiders, and we ain't got no life.
---
Also, Oxhorn's short shorts.
---
Nah. Whirlwind Axe and Gravestone Scepter aren't faction tied. Verigan's Fist is only for ALLIANCE SCUM.
---
None of that is accurate.
---
Same. If I couldn't play on a PvP server, I wouldn't play WoW.
---
And this is coming from someone who doesn't gank or world PvP.
---
PvP server just makes the world feel more alive. It makes some zones feel dangerous.
---
Game got fundamentally changed in TBC more than it did in Wrath
---
people will pug aq40 
---
If any thought is put into this loot trading system at all it becomes obvious what a terrible and damaging system it is.
---
And yet the lead designer is pushing for it.
---
There is no way Activision Blizzard is going to have the integrity to admit this mistake and back down on it.
---
If you don't engage in world PVP, how is a PVP server any different to flagging yourself on a PVE server?
---
Would you have an issue if I used a client side mod to make your character a naked night elf with my favorite hair and skin color?
---
This is an MMO*RPG.* I want my character to look the way I made it.
---
Especially for some races and faces, the retail models are significantly different.
---
When I wear certain armor and tabards, pick certain faces and hair, I want it to look the way I chose.
---
This. If it takes them a bit longer to get it right on release vs releasing a shit version and patching for months, I’m okay with that.
---
i have always played horde but i also want to becable to find groups and guilds so thinking of going ally only because of that
---
I'd probably do it for "muh frames"
---
The problem with this system is that it's different than what they already have in Legion/retail, and thus it will require development time and funding to implement,
---
and thus Activision Blizzard will never implement it because it will cost something to do.
---
If you have so much hope you should buy some lottery tickets mate! That's taking optimism to another level.
---
This is really true. There are elites but still so many casuals, which is great.
---
If PVP servers are the reflection of many private servers, then PVP servers are cancer.
---
Even before it was announced there were posts along the lines of “If they charge the same price as a retail sub, I’m not playing.”
---
There’s definitely a small subset of the PServer crowd that wants to play for free. 
---
Not the same team. Everyone's jumping ship.
---
With low powered gear I'd choose mana over +healing. When you get better gear and are raiding you can then switch over. But when you start out Mana is everything.
---
ZG will not be available at launch. 
---
Garrisons had a lot of issues beyond them being instanced, though I do agree that we're better off as homeless dragonslayers. 
---
In 1.0, not 1.1 release, Paladin's had Crusader strike. They also got it back in 2.0.
---
I would love to see them have it. I got to play the OG beta, I was confused why Paladin's were so much less fun.
---
They also had holy strike in 1.0 so two action attacks, not just auto attacking....
---
Who would want vanilla forever? Clear naxx for the next 10 years? Or do the people who want "classic forever" just want the game to live its normal lifespan and then die?
---
I'd like to see most of the list, but I like deadwind pass as it was. A intimidating, barren landscape, where low-levels see ?? level mobs &amp; capped characters occasionally grinding. What it lacked in content it made up for in atmosphere
---
